	abstract = {Lightweight primitives have already received a lot of attention with the growth of resource-constrained devices, and many lightweight block ciphers such as Midori, MANTIS and QARMA have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we present a SAT-aided search of the optimal (related-tweak) differential characteristics for such block ciphers combined with the Matsui’s bounding conditions and the technique of dichotomy. Using this method, we find the optimal differential characteristics for Midori-128 up to 10 rounds, and the optimal related-tweak differential characteristics for QARMA-64 and MANTIS up to 11 rounds and 10 rounds respectively. To obtain better attacks, we add some constraints into the search model to restrict the number of active S-boxes for input and output differences. As a result, we give a differential attack on 12-round Midori-128 based on the found 10-round differential characteristic with probability \\(2^{-115}\\). Moreover, we present a related-tweak differential attack on 11-round QARMA-64 based on the optimal 9-round differential characteristic with probability \\(2^{-52}\\), which improves the previous attacks as far as we know.}

	abstract = {AES is currently the most important block cipher. There are three variants, i.e., AES-k with \\(k\\in \\{128, 192, 256\\}\\) denoting the key size in bits. At ASIACRYPT 2009, Biryukov et al. carried out the rectangle attack against the full AES-192 and achieved the best results under the related-key setting so far. During our research, we found that the time complexity of each phase in the attack proposed by Biryukov et al. is unbalanced. More specifically, the time complexity of the quartet processing phase far exceeds that of the other phases. Therefore, the key of our work is to balance the time complexity of each phase so that the overall time complexity of the attack against the full AES-192 is reduced. In this paper, we adopt a strategy of pre-guessing some subkey bits. Indeed, pre-guessing subkeys increase the time complexity of some phases, but we can get more filter bits to reduce the time complexity of processing quartets. Using the above concepts, the time complexity of the rectangle key recovery attack on full AES-192 under the related-key setting can be reduced from \\(2^{176}\\) to \\(2^{158}\\).}

	abstract = {Cryptographic algorithms classification, which can detect the underlying encryption algorithm on sufficient large ciphertexts, is essential to encrypted traffic analysis and protocol compliance detection. Previous studies have typically employed various feature quantities and models for feature learning in analyzing encryption algorithms. Unlike these, this work performs a broader feature selection and extracts features from the P-values of the randomness test and their data distributions for different block cipher algorithms. This work utilizes the LightGBM framework to focus on block cipher algorithms classification in ECB mode. It takes six algorithms to test the classification scheme, including AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, DES, 3DES and SM4, with an average accuracy of 82%. To compare the accuracy, this work analyzes the influence weights of random features and experiments with the classification accuracy of different schemes on the same ciphertext blocks. The experiment results show that our scheme is effective in classifying block ciphers.}

	abstract = {The CLEFIA block cipher has a generalised Feistel structure, which has been an ISO international standard since 2012. In 2014 Su et al. proposed a white-box CLEFIA implementation with a white-box table for an S-box, and in 2020 Yao et al. presented an algebraic attack on Su et al.’s implementation with a time complexity of \\(2^{30}\\) and proposed another white-box CLEFIA implementation with a basic white-box table for two S-boxes. In this paper, we apply Lepoint et al.’s collision-based attack method to Su et al.’s implementation and recover all the white-box operations and the round and whitening keys with a time complexity of about \\(2^{22}\\) S-box computations, and analyse the security of Yao et al.’s implementation against Lepoint et al.’s collision-based attack method. For Yao et al.’s implementation, on one hand, our experiment under a small fraction of (affine encodings, round key) combinations suggests that it can resist Lepoint et al.’s collision-based attack method, for the rank of the concerned linear system is much less than the number of the involved unknowns, but on the other hand, it is not clear whether there exist affine encodings such that the rank of the corresponding linear system is slightly less than the number of the involved unknowns, for which case Lepoint et al.’s method can be applied to remove most white-box operations until mainly some Boolean masks remain. We also experimentally test that the rank of the concerned linear system is invariant when the Boolean encodings are changed to affine encodings in our attack on Su et al.’s implementation. Our cryptanalysis suggests to some extent that for white-box CLEFIA implementation, building a white-box table with two S-boxes is preferable to building a white-box table with a single S-box in the sense of their security against Lepoint et al.’s collision-based attack method, but nevertheless we leave it as an open problem to investigate the distribution of the ranks under all encodings.}

	abstract = {Four observations can be made regarding recent trends that have emerged in the evolution of authenticated encryption schemes: (1) regarding simplicity, the adoption of public permutations as primitives has allowed for sparing a key schedule and the need for storing round keys; (2) using the sums of permutation outputs, inputs, or outputs and inputs has been a well-studied means to achieve higher security beyond the birthday bound; (3) concerning robustness, schemes can provide graceful security degradation if a limited amount of nonces repeats during the lifetime of a key; and (4) Andreeva et al.’s ForkCipher approach can increase the efficiency of a scheme since they can use fewer rounds per output branch compared to full-round primitives. In this work, we improve the state of the art by combining those aspects for efficient authenticated encryption. We propose PAE, an efficient nonce-based AE scheme that employs a public permutation and one call to an XOR-universal hash function. PAE provides O(2n/3)-bit security and high throughput by combining forked public-permutation-based variants of \\(\\textsf {nEHtM}\\) and Encrypted Davies-Meyer. Thus, it can use a single, in part round-reduced, public permutation for most operations, spare a key schedule, and guarantee security beyond the birthday bound even under limited nonce reuse.}

	abstract = {Supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol (SIDH) is the most concerned isogeny-based protocol resisting quantum attacks, and in 2019 Flynn and Ti implemented a dimension two version (G2SIDH). However, at EUROCRYPT’23, Castryck and Decru, Maino et al., and Robert proposed efficient attacks against SIDH. Moreover, Robert extended his attacks to high-dimensional SIDH in theory. In this paper, we, for the first time, find that the uniqueness of isogeny decomposition and computing intermediate isogeny through kernel only hold for one class of high-dimensional isogenies. Besides, we prove a counting formula about isogenies between general abelian varieties. Based on these theoretic results, we present complete steps of parameter tweaks in attacks against high-dimensional SIDH, and analyze the efficiency of each tweak. In particular, for Flynn and Ti’s G2SIDH, we construct two attack algorithms that can recover the secret key in polynomial time. Our paper demonstrates the differences between isogenies in dimension one and higher dimensions, and illustrates that all high-dimensional SIDH protocols are insecure.}

	abstract = {Secure machine learning has attracted much attention recently. The celebrated CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme has played a key role in such an application. Inverse square root is widely used in machine learning, such as vector normalization, clustering, etc., but it is not a function that can be easily processed by CKKS. In 2022, Panda proposed a Newton iterative algorithm for homomorphic evaluation of inverse square root using CKKS scheme. The initial value of the iteration is selected as two straight lines intersecting at one point, which involves a very expensive homomorphic comparison operation. In this paper, we propose two novel methods for selecting the initial value of the inverse square root Newton iterative algorithm. Specifically, Taylor expansion and rational function are used as an initial value to avoid the homomorphic comparison operation and achieve a significant improvement of efficiency. The Taylor expansion method greatly reduces the initial value calculation consumption, but appropriately increases the number of Newton iterations. Compared with the Taylor expansion method, the rational function method is more costly in the initial value calculation stage but reduces the number of Newton iterations. Experiments are conducted on the SEAL open source library and we find that, while reaching the same accuracy, the total number of homomorphic levels consumed by the Taylor expansion method is about \\(83.3\\%\\) of the best known results, and the rational function method is about \\(56.9\\%\\).}

	abstract = {The relationship between oblivious transfer (OT) and public-key encryption (PKE) has been studied by Gertner et al. (FOCS 2000). They showed that OT can be constructed from special types of PKE, i.e., PKE with oblivious sampleability of public keys or ciphertexts. In this work, we give new black-box constructions of OT from PKE without any oblivious sampleability. Instead, we require that the PKE scheme is rerandomizable, meaning that one can use the public key to rerandomize a ciphertext into a fresh ciphertext. We give two different OT protocols with different efficiency features based on rerandomizable PKE. For 1-out-of-n OT, in our first OT protocol, the sender has sublinear (in n) cost, and in our second OT protocol, the cost of the receiver is independent of n. As a comparison, in the PKE-based OT protocols of Gertner et al., both the sender and receiver have linear cost.}

	abstract = {A ring signature scheme allows a group member to generate a signature on behalf of the whole group, while the verifier can not tell who computed this signature. However, most predecessors do not guarantee security from the secret key leakage of signers. In 2002, Anderson proposed forward security mechanism to reduce the effect of such leakage. In this paper, we construct the first lattice-based ring signature scheme with forward security. Our scheme combines the binary tree and lattice basis delegation technique to realize a key evolution mechanism, where secret keys are ephemeral and updated with generating nodes in the binary tree. Thus, adversaries cannot forge the past signature even if the users’ present secret keys are revealed. Moreover, our scheme can offer unforgeability under the standard model. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is expected to realize post-quantum security due to the underlying Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem in lattice-based cryptography.}

	abstract = {Fairness is a security notion of secure computation and cannot always be achieved if an adversary corrupts a majority of parties in standard settings. Lindell (CT-RSA 2008) showed that imposing a monetary penalty on an adversary can circumvent the impossibility. He formalized such a security notion as “legally enforceable fairness" for the two-party setting based on the ideal trusted bank functionality and showed a protocol achieving the requirements. Based on the same framework, we introduce secure multi-party computation with legally enforceable fairness that is applicable for an arbitrary number of parties. Further, we propose two protocols that realize our introduced functionality. The first one achieves O(n) rounds, \\(O(n^2)\\) communications, and \\(O(n \\alpha )\\) fees, where n is the number of parties, and \\(\\alpha \\) is a parameter for the penalty amount. The fee refers to the balance amount in the bank required at the beginning of the protocol, which evaluates the difficulty of participating in the protocol in a financial sense. The second one achieves O(1) rounds, O(n) communications, and \\(O(n^2 \\alpha )\\) fees.}

	abstract = {“Cryptography-as-a-Service” provides convenience for users to request cryptographic computing resources according to their needs. However, it also brings challenges for resource management, such as the constantly changing load, large numbers of users, and complex resource topologies. To address those issues, this paper proposes a load-predicted-based resource allocation algorithm for cryptographic computing resources. Firstly, we propose a load-based cryptographic computing resource allocation model that can clearly describe the dynamic status of resources. Then, we design a load predictor using time series analysis and a random forest model, which can quickly predict the load of cryptography service requests during service time. Finally, we develop a load-predicted-based greedy algorithm for cryptographic computing resource allocation. Experimental results show that energy consumption is reduced by about 20% at most compared to the baseline allocation algorithm.}

	abstract = {Grubbs et al. [11] initiated the formal study of message franking protocols. This new type of service launched by Facebook, allows the receiver in a secure messaging application to verifiably report to a third party an abusive message some sender has sent. A novel cryptographic primitive: committing AEAD has been initiated, whose functionality apart from confidentiality and authenticity asks for a compact commitment over the message, which is delivered to the receiver as part of the ciphertext. A new construction \\(\\textsf{CEP}\\) (Committing Encrypt and \\(\\textsf{PRF}\\)) has then been proposed, which is multi-opening secure and reduces the computational costs for the sender and the receiver. In this paper we provide a formal treatment of message franking protocols with minimum leakage whereby only the abusive blocks are opened, while the rest non-abusive blocks of the message remain private.}

	abstract = {As a fundamental operation in fixed-point arithmetic, truncation can bring the product of two fixed-point integers back to the fixed-point representation. In large-scale applications like privacy-preserving machine learning, it is essential to have faithful truncation that accurately eliminates both big and small errors. In this work, we improve and extend the results of the oblivious transfer based faithful truncation protocols initialized by Cryptflow2 (Rathee et al., CCS 2020). Specifically, we propose a new notion of two-bit extraction that is tailored for faithful truncation and demonstrate how it can be used to construct an efficient faithful truncation protocol. Benefiting from our efficient construction for two-bit extraction, our faithful truncation protocol reduces the communication complexity of Cryptflow2 from growing linearly with the fixed-point precision to logarithmic complexity. This efficiency improvement is due to the fact that we reuse the intermediate results of eliminating the big error to further eliminate the small error. Our reuse strategy is effective, as it shows that while eliminating the big error, it is possible to further eliminate the small error at a minimal cost, e.g., as low as communicating only an additional 160 bits in one round.}

	abstract = {Distributed oblivious polynomial evaluation (DOPE) is a variant of two-party computation where a sender party \\(P_1\\) has a polynomial f(x) of degree k and the receiver party \\(P_2\\) holds an input \\(\\alpha \\). They conduct a secure computation with a number of t distributed cloud servers such that \\(P_2\\) obtains the correct output \\(f(\\alpha )\\) while the privacy of the inputs is preserved. This system is the building block of many cryptographic models and machine learning algorithms. We propose a lightweight DOPE scheme with two separate phases: setup and computation, which means that the setup phase can be executed at any time before the actual computation phase. The number of the servers (t) does not depend on the polynomial degree (k), and the main expensive computation is securely outsourced to the cloud servers using the idea of threshold cryptography. As a result, any normal user with low computational power devices (e.g., mobile, laptop, etc.) would be able to evaluate and verify the output over a large field while the security conditions are preserved. Our protocol maintains the security against a static active adversary corrupting a coalition of up to \\(t-1\\) servers and the opposed party. The main two parties commit to their inputs using non-interactive zero-knowledge proof techniques. The communication complexity is linear and bounded to O(t) field elements which means that, unlike the previous studies in this field, it does not depend on the polynomial degree k.}

	abstract = {Passwords, a first line of defense against unauthorized access, must be secure and memorable. However, people often struggle to create secure passwords they can recall. To address this problem, we design Password inspiration by e Xploring information (PiXi), a novel approach to nudge users towards creating secure passwords. PiXi is the first of its kind that employs a password creation nudge to support users in the task of generating a unique secure password themselves. PiXi prompts users to explore unusual information right before creating a password, to shake them out of their typical habits and thought processes, and to inspire them to create unique (and therefore stronger) passwords. PiXi’s design aims to create an engaging, interactive, and effective nudge to improve secure password creation. We conducted a user study (\\(N=238\\)) to compare the efficacy of PiXi to typical password creation. Our findings indicate that PiXi’s nudges do influence users’ password choices such that passwords are significantly longer and more secure (less predictable and guessable).}

	abstract = {In cancelable biometric (CB) schemes, secure biometric templates are generated by applying, mainly non-linear, transformations to the origin data. The cancelable templates should satisfy the requirements of irreversibility, unlinkability, and revocability with high accuracy. However, existing cancelable biometric schemes have been demonstrated that their security is overestimated. Many well-known cancelable biometric schemes have been proven vulnerable to some attack models. In this paper, we analyze a recent alignment-robust cancelable biometric scheme called Random Augmented Histogram of Gradients (R\\(\\cdot \\)HoG) that is not as unlinkable as proposed. Moreover, we propose two schemes to attack the unlinkability of R\\(\\cdot \\)HoG. One is that two cancelable templates from different applications are directly connected according to the leaked tokens, and the other is based on the reverse of Z-score transformation, which can achieve higher linkability. Experimental results on CASIA-IrisV3-Interval show that the cancelable biometric template generated by R\\(\\cdot \\)HoG has high linkability with a maximum link success rate of 95.62%.}

	abstract = {The satellite Internet of Things (satellite IoT) has the characteristics of large space-time span and highly open communication links. While effectively expanding the spatial capability of the traditional Internet of Things, it will face security threats such as impersonation, replay, tampering and eavesdropping of the traditional Internet of Things and satellite communication. In this paper, an SM2-based certificateless integrated signature and encryption scheme (SM2-CL-ISE) is proposed for satellite IoT with key optimization and conditional anonymity. Then incorporating Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite, a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite authentication protocol and a static terminal device authentication protocol are designed. In addition, we prove the security of SM2-CL-ISE under the formal security model, and further discuss how the proposed authentication schemes can satisfy those essential security requirements. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed protocols, we conducted several experiments and compared their performance with that of existing protocols. The experimental results show that our scheme achieves more efficient performance with a slightly increased communication overhead on authentication.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) rely on data shared by users to provide convenient services. Data is outsourced to the cloud server and the distributed roadside unit in VSNs. However, roadside unit has limited resources, so that data sharing process is inefficient and is vulnerable to security threats, such as illegal access, tampering attack and collusion attack. In this article, to overcome the shortcomings of security, we define a chain tolerance semi-trusted model to describe the credibility of distributed group based on the anti tampering feature of blockchain. We further propose a Blockchain-based Lightweight Access Control scheme in VSNs that resist tampering and collusion attacks, called BLAC. To overcome the shortcomings of efficiency, we design a ciphertext piece storage algorithm and a recovery one to achieve lightweight storage cost. In the decryption operation, we separate a pre-decryption algorithm based on outsourcing to achieve lightweight decryption computation cost on the user side. Finally, we present the formal security analyses and the simulation experiments for BLAC, and compare the results of experiments with existing relevant schemes. The security analyses show that our scheme is secure, and the results of experiments show that our scheme is lightweight and practical.}

	abstract = {The darknet has been a notorious hub for illegal and criminal activities. One of the major challenges in identifying criminals involved in darknet market transactions is the presence of multi-identity vendors, who operate under different accounts to evade detection. Existing methods have limitations such as incomplete feature characterization, imprecise data annotation, and an inability to analyze across markets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to address these issues. Rich information of traded goods is collected from 21 currently existing English darknet markets as experimental data. Our method entails extracting text and image features and computing the writing style of suppliers. Subsequently, the feature dimension is reduced and pseudo labeling is applied to improve label accuracy. Further, four types of data about vendors are mapped onto a heterogeneous information network to characterize potential relationships among darknet vendors. By leveraging the graph neural network algorithm and Siamese neural networks, the link relationship between different accounts is predicted to determine whether they belong to the same supplier. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in identifying different accounts belonging to the same supplier with a maximum accuracy of 99.75% and a recall rate of 99.09%.}

	abstract = {Face recognition is a widely-used technique for identification or verification, where a verifier checks whether a face image matches anyone stored in a database. However, in scenarios where the database is held by a third party, such as a cloud server, both parties are concerned about data privacy. To address this concern, we propose CryptoMask, a privacy-preserving face recognition system that employs homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (MPC). We design a new encoding strategy that leverages HE properties to reduce communication costs and enable efficient similarity checks between face images, without expensive homomorphic rotation. Additionally, CryptoMask\xa0leaks less information than existing state-of-the-art approaches. CryptoMask\xa0only reveals whether there is an image matching the query or not, whereas existing approaches additionally leak sensitive intermediate distance information. We conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate CryptoMask’s superior performance in terms of computation and communication. For a database with 100 million 512-dimensional face vectors, CryptoMask\xa0offers \\({\\thicksim }\\)5\\(\\times \\) and \\({\\thicksim }\\)144\\(\\times \\) speed-ups in terms of computation and communication, respectively.}

	abstract = {Private-ID (PID) protocol enables two parties, each holding a private set of items, to privately compute a set of random universal identifiers (UID) corresponding to the records in the union of their sets, where each party additionally learns which UIDs correspond to which items in its set but not if they belong to the intersection or not. PID is very useful in the privacy computation of databases query, e.g. inner join and join for compute. Known PID protocols all assume the input of both parties is a set. In the case of join, a more common scenario is that one party’s primary key (unique) needs to join the other party’s foreign key (duplicate). How to construct an efficient Private Multiset ID (PMID) protocol to support the above key-foreign key join remains open. We resolve this problem by constructing efficient PMID protocols from Oblivious PRF, Private Set Union, and a newly introduced primitive called Deterministic-Value Oblivious Programmable PRF (dv-OPPRF). We also propose some PMID applications, including Private Inner Join, Private Full Join, and Private Join for Compute. We implement our PMID protocols and state-of-the-art PID protocols as performance baselines. The experiments show that the performances of our PMID are almost the same as the state-of-the-art PIDs when we set the multiplicity \\(U_x = U_y = 1\\). Our PMID protocols scale well when either \\(U_x > 1\\) or \\(U_y > 1\\). The performances also correctly reflect excessive data expansion when both \\(U_x, U_y > 1\\) for the more general cross join case.}

	abstract = {The deanonymization of Tor hidden services (HS) is the top priority for dark web governance. Thanks to the leap of artificial intelligence technology, it is a promising and feasible direction to launch a website fingerprint attack (WFA) by deep learning to identify the access traffic of HS. However, unlike public services (PS) on the surface network, the web pages of HS have simple structures, limited content, and similar development templates. Thus, it is different to extract effective features from the access traffic for HS identification. In addition, many WFA methods cannot capture global features from access traffic because their convolutional neural networks (CNN) lack the ability of long-distance modeling. Aiming at the shortcomings, we propose Zoomer, a novel WFA method with a scalable perspective when extracting features. The contribution of our work lies in three points. Firstly, a burst-based HS fingerprint generation method is proposed to describe the sequence of resource access. Secondly, a new WFA model is designed by introducing global burst attention (GBA) into the classic structure of CNN for global feature extraction. Finally, comparison experiments are conducted in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. The results show that our Zoomer outperforms three state-of-the-art WFA methods.}

	abstract = {The intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can help alleviate road security issues. However, increasing requirements for data privacy make it difficult for centralized machine learning paradigms to collect sufficient training data, which hinders the development of intelligent IoV. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising method to overcome this gap. However, traditional FL may leak privacy when encountering attacks such as the Membership Inference Attack. Existing approaches to address this issue either bring significant additional overhead or reduce the accuracy of FL, which are not suitable for the IoV. Therefore, we present a novel hierarchical FL framework called EPHFL. It leverages the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and pseudorandom technology to enhance the privacy of FL while bringing little additional overhead and not reducing the accuracy. Its hierarchical architecture can effectively schedule devices in the IoV to accomplish FL and reduce the communication overhead of each device, dramatically improving our system’s scalability. Moreover, we design a method based on Blockchain and Distributed Hash Table to detect malicious tampering and offset its impact, further guaranteeing FL’s data integrity. Finally, we perform experiments to demonstrate the performance of EPHFL. The results show that our method does not reduce accuracy, and our computation overhead on the user side is much lower than the classic baseline.}

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Display’s (HMD) are equipped with a range of sensors, which have been recently exploited to infer users’ sensitive and private information through a deep learning-based eavesdropping attack that leverage facial dynamics. Mindful that the eavesdropping attack employs facial dynamics, which vary across race and gender, we evaluate the robustness of such attack under various users characteristics. We base our evaluation on the existing anthropological research that shows statistically significant differences for face width, length, and lip length among ethnic/racial groups, suggesting that a “challenger” with similar features (ethnicity/race and gender) to a victim might be able to more easily deceive the eavesdropper than when they have different features. By replicating the classification model in\xa0[17] and examining its accuracy with six different scenarios that vary the victim and attacker based on their ethnicity/race and gender, we show that our adversary is able to impersonate a user with the same ethnicity/race and gender more accurately, with an average accuracy difference between the original and adversarial setting being the lowest among all scenarios. Similarly, an adversary with different ethnicity/race and gender than the victim had the highest average accuracy difference, emphasizing an inherent bias in the fundamentals of the approach through impersonation.}

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are suffering from adversarial attacks, where some imperceptible perturbations are added into examples and cause incorrect predictions. Generally, there are two types of adversarial attack methods, i.e., image-dependent and image agnostic. As for the first one, Image-dependent attacks involve crafting unique adversarial perturbations for each clean example. As for the latter case, image-agnostic attacks create a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) that can fool the target model for all clean examples. However, existing UAP methods only utilize the output of the target DNNs within a limited magnitude, resulting in an ineffective application of UAP to the entire feature extraction process of the DNNs. In this paper, we consider the difference between the mid-level features of the clean example and their corresponding adversarial example in the different intermediate layers of target DNN. Specifically, we maximize the impact of the adversarial examples in the forward propagation process by pulling apart the feature representations of the clean and adversarial examples. Moreover, to achieve targeted and non-targeted attacks, we design a loss function that highlights the UAP feature representation to guide the direction of perturbations in the feature layers. Furthermore, to reduce the training time and training parameters, we adopt a direct optimization approach to craft UAPs and experimentally demonstrate that we can achieve a higher fooling rate with fewer examples. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both non-targeted and targeted universal attacks.}

	abstract = {This study investigates the security of split federated learning (SFL), a collaborative deep learning scheme that provides similar peak performance to federated learning while significantly reducing its computation time for multiple clients. We find that the basic security assumptions of SFL are flawed, in which the honest-but-curious server can easily conspire with a motivated client to break the security of SFL. More prominently, we show that the server can train an inversion model (DecodeNet) and perform an inference attack on clients’ private data. To support DecodeNet training, we implement a data-free training scheme to provide train data in the absence of the original training dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our attack can reconstruct pixel-wise private images from clients on four different datasets and overcome the differential privacy protection mechanism in SFL.}

	abstract = {Since the popularity of deep neural networks, NLP models have played an increasingly important role in our lives and work. However, along with the widespread use of NLP models, backdoor attacks against NLP models have shown to be increasingly damaging, which can have extremely serious consequences. Backdoor attacks are generally used to implant backdoors into models by compromising the training phase, and then triggered by triggers in the inference phase to make the backdoored models exhibit abnormal behaviour. In this paper, we propose two backdoor attack methods that controlled by composite triggers, Enhanced Backdoor Attack (EBA) and Trigger Frequency Controlled Backdoor Attack (TFCBA), which extend the threatening nature of backdoor attacks by using composite natural utterance fragments as triggers, and they eliminate the shortcomings of currently proposed backdoor attacks such as triggers being easily used accidentally, the single function of the attack, and the over-association of trigger patches with the target class. We have experimentally evaluated our proposed attacks in multiple NLP task scenarios, and the experimental results demonstrate excellent feasibility and effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Discrimination in decision-making systems is of growing concern as machine learning techniques (especially deep learning) are increasingly applied in systems with societal impact. Multiple recent works have proposed to identify/generate discriminative samples through fairness testing. State-of-the-art fairness testing methods can efficiently generate many discriminative samples, which can be subsequently used to improve the fairness of the model. Unfortunately, the applicability of these approaches is limited in practice as they require the availability of both the model and the training data, i.e., a white-box setting. In a black-box setting (e.g., testing online services), existing approaches are impractical for multiple reasons, e.g., they require huge testing budgets. In this work, we propose a black-box fairness testing approach for neural networks, namely BREAM, which addresses two challenges, i.e., how to generate many discriminative samples without querying many times and how to guide the searching without the original model. Our overall idea is to obtain approximate gradients by training shadow models to effectively guide the discriminative sample generation for black-box DNNs. We also observe the density diversity of the distribution of discrimination, which enables incremental maintenance of shadow models and rational allocation of search resources by dividing multiple subspaces. We evaluated BREAM on three widely adopted datasets for fairness research. The results show that BREAM achieves a 9X higher performance than existing black-box methods, comparable to the state-of-the-art white-box fairness method.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of graph-structured data and the promulgation of various data privacy protection laws, machine unlearning in Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has attracted more and more attention. However, machine unlearning in GCN scenarios faces multiple challenges. For example, many unlearning algorithms require large computational resources and storage space or cannot be applied to graph-structured data, and so on. In this paper, we design a novel, lightweight unlearning method using knowledge distillation to solve the class unlearning problem in GCN scenarios. Unlike other methods using knowledge distillation to unlearn Euclidean spatial data, we use a single retrained deep Graph Convolutional Network via Initial residual and Identity mapping (GCNII) model as the teacher network and the shallow GCN model as a student network. During the training stage, the teacher’s network transfers the knowledge of the retained set to the student network, enabling the student network to forget some or more categories of information. Compared with the baseline methods, Graph Unlearning using Knowledge Distillation (GUKD) shows state-of-the-art model performance and unlearning quality on five real datasets. Specifically, our method outperforms all baseline methods by 33.77% on average in the multi-class experiments on the Citeseer dataset.}

	abstract = {Extensive studies have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Despite the significant progress in the attack success rate that has been made recently, the adversarial noise generated by most of the existing attack methods is still too conspicuous to the human eyes and proved to be easily detected by defense mechanisms. Resulting that these malicious examples cannot contribute to exploring the vulnerabilities of existing DNNs sufficiently. Thus, to better reveal the defects of DNNs and further help enhance their robustness under noise-limited situations, a new inconspicuous adversarial examples generation method is exactly needed to be proposed. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Normalize Flow-based end-to-end attack framework, called AFLOW, to synthesize imperceptible adversarial examples under strict constraints. Specifically, rather than the noise-adding manner, AFLOW directly perturbs the hidden representation of the corresponding image to craft the desired adversarial examples. Compared with existing methods, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the adversarial examples built by AFLOW exhibit superiority in imperceptibility, image quality and attack capability. Even on robust models, AFLOW can still achieve higher attack results than previous methods.}

	abstract = {Since facial forgery techniques have made remarkable progress, the area of forgery detection attracts a significant amount of attention due to security concerns. Existing methods attempt to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to mine discriminative clues for forgery detection. However, most of these coarse-grained and vanilla methods struggle to extract subtle and multiscale clues in forgery detection. To address such problems, we propose a well-designed deep learning framework, named SCA-Net, to exploit subtle, multiscale and multiview clues. Specifically, our framework consists of a skipped channel attention module (SCM), a constrained difference module (CDM) and an adaptive attention module (AAM). First, the skipped channel attention module is used as the backbone to extract sufficient different information, including low-level and high-level features. Then, the constrained difference module captures manipulation clues from the input image based on constrained characteristics. Finally, the adaptive attention module captures multiscale features represented by facial forgery. Moreover, we introduce a combined loss to address the learning difficulty of our framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has great detection performance compared with other face forgery detection methods in most cases.}

	abstract = {Although considerable improvements have been made in online signature verification (OSV) over the last decade, none of them take both temporal and spatial information into consideration, and thus there is still a room for boosting the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble based deep learning framework, which consists of a convolutional neural network model and our recently designed convolutional gated recurrent network (CGRN) for extracting spatial feature and temporal feature, respectively. However, it is not easy to combine these two types of features since temporal feature is two-dimensional with various length while the other is a fixed-length vector. In order to incorporate both types of representation, we firstly introduce cosine similarity for spatial feature to calculate the shape similarity and use dynamic time warping (DTW) for temporal feature alignment. Thereafter, the distance between reference signature and given signature is obtained by multiplying DTW distance and similarity score. In addition, we design a novel approach for DTW distance normalization, which significantly enhances the verification accuracy. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art result on DeepSignDB, and outperforms other existing OSV methods with at least 16.2% relative improvement in finger scenario.}

	abstract = {The consortium chain is widely used in multi-organization collaboration and data sharing in various industries due to its decentralization, non-tampering, and traceability. With its popularity, supervising these distributed systems has become a challenge for governments. The centralized supervision model destroys the distributed nature of blockchains and cannot provide open and transparent supervision services. Therefore, researchers propose to build a blockchain to supervise multiple consortium chains in one industry. Under this idea, the cross-chain supervision scheme becomes the focus of research. However, most existing cross-chain schemes are designed for digital currency transfer. If applied to a supervision scenario, they suffer from two shortcomings. First, the over-coupled interchain relationship cannot meet flexible supervisory requirements. Second, they cannot guarantee data authenticity during off-chain transmission. Aiming at the shortcomings, we design SCOPE, a cross-chain supervision scheme for consortium chains. The contribution of our work lies in three aspects. Firstly, we deploy a relay chain to implement automatic supervision based on the publish-subscribe model, reducing cross-chain overhead. Secondly, we propose a verification method for the authenticity of cross-chain data by calculating the reputation value of oracle nodes and performing threshold signatures based on reputation weights. Finally, we implement a prototype system and test it. The results show that SCOPE provides good scalability and achieves low latency. Compared with the verification method based on BLS threshold signatures, SCOPE obtains a higher success rate in verifying the authenticity of cross-chain data.}

	abstract = {Cross-chain technology aims to enable interoperability between isolated blockchains. However, existing cross-chain solutions cannot achieve both decentralization and incentive compatibility. In the paper, we introduce Subsidy Bridge, a general and decentralized relay scheme with special incentive design similar to Bitcoin mining. In Subsidy Bridge, target chain carries out cross-chain validation relying on relayers submitting new block headers of source chain, while honest relayers obtain basic subsidy from target chain and transaction fee from cross-chain users. The utility of honest relayers is always positive even when users are temporarily inactive. Analysis results demonstrate that our solution can provide decentralization, incentive compatibility, and strong security.}

	abstract = {In recent years, a growing number of breaches targeting cryptocurrency exchanges have damaged the credibility of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. To prevent further harm, it’s crucial to detect the anomalous behaviors hidden within cryptocurrency transactions and offer predictive suggestions. However, details of transaction records must be carefully analyzed for effective detection, and this information could be exploited by adversaries to launch attacks such as de-anonymization and model interference. As a result, it is essential to prioritize privacy preservation when designing an anomaly detection system for cryptocurrency transactions. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving anomaly detection (PPad) scheme for cryptocurrency transactions based on a decision tree model, which achieves privacy preservation by using additively homomorphic encryption and matrix perturbation techniques. We also design and implement PPad’s underlying protocol in a cloud outsourcing environment. The correctness and privacy properties of PPad have been proven through detailed analysis. Experimental results show that our scheme can offer privacy assurance with desirable detection effectiveness and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.}

	abstract = {Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) allows parties to calculate a joint function using their respective secret inputs in a distributed environment without centralized server and has numerous applications across various fields. However, the presence of cheaters in the MPC protocol can lead to an unfair process. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based secure multi-party computation scheme in which the entire computing process is publicly auditable, and cheating parties can be detected. In our scheme, cheaters will be financially punished, while honest parties will be financially compensated, thereby deterring the cheating behaviors. The analysis demonstrates that our scheme ensures public auditability, preserves parties’ privacy, and maintains fairness throughout the MPC process.}

	abstract = {In the research society, many solutions to solving blockchain scaling have been tried historically, usually by compromising on decentralisation. Ethereum has chosen to scale by switching to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus and adding data sharding to allow Layer 2 execution to be cheaper. However, in the light of cross-domain Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), even this strategy may have centralising forces built-in. In this work, we focus on cross domain MEV and try to identify cross domain arbitrage. We achieve this by extracting Uniswap data from four different domains and analysing the dataset with two different methods. Based on the analysis, we are successful in identifying one smart contract’s address, which is deployed to multiple domains, engaging in cross domain arbitrage. We also illustrate the difficulties when quantifying cross-domain MEV in practice.}

	abstract = {Trading data through blockchain platforms is hard to achieve fair exchange. Reasons come from two folds: Firstly, guaranteeing fairness between sellers and consumers is a challenging task as the deception of any participating parties is risk-free. This leads to the second issue where judging the behavior of data executors (such as cloud service providers) among distrustful parties is impractical in the context of traditional trading protocols. To fill the gaps, in this paper, we present a blockchain-based data trading system, named BDTS. BDTS implements a fair-exchange protocol in which benign behaviors can get rewarded while dishonest behaviors will be punished. Our scheme requires the seller to provide consumers with the correct encryption keys for proper execution and encourage a rational data executor to behave faithfully for maximum benefits from rewards. We analyze the strategies of consumers, sellers, and dealers in the trading game and point out that everyone should be honest about their interests so that the game will reach Nash equilibrium. Evaluations prove efficiency and practicability.}

	abstract = {Numerous applications based on Ethereum have been utilized in a variety of scenarios, such as financial services. However, due to the lack of effective regulation in the blockchain, a significant number of illegal users cash in on the anonymity of blockchain accounts, which has an extremely negative impact. Existing illegal account detection methods employ machine learning techniques to train fundamental account characteristics and fail to extract efficient high-order features by graph structures, leading to inaccuracies in account detection. To address this issue, we propose a novel illegal account identification method based on a heterogeneous transformer network. Specifically, we design an account-centric heterogeneous information network model to express real transaction data on Ethereum for the first time. This model can describe the network structure information more comprehensively. Additionally, we propose to apply the graph transformer network to automatically learn the multi-hop metapath and obtain high-order node information and links. These features, in turn, improve the quality and performance of our model. Finally, we employ the graph convolutional network to classify nodes and complete the account identification task and ensure the security of the Ethereum system. Furthermore, we compare our method with other existing detection models. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 95.57%, which surpasses that of traditional machine learning models and existing detection schemes.}

	abstract = {For many years, trusted computing research has focused on the trustworthiness of single computer platforms. For example, how can I decide whether I can trust my personal computer (A) or another computer (B), who communicates with A? In reality, both A and B are part of a computing network, in which there are many other computers, and these computers’ behaviour affects the trustworthiness of any communication between A and B. Obviously, the target of trusted computing is not only to build trusted devices but also trusted networks. Attestation is a mechanism initially designed to ascertain the trustworthiness of a single device. To check on the trustworthiness of a network, we need a network attestation mechanism. The basis of attestation is a root of trust, and research on building roots of trust for individual devices has been successful. One of the next challenges, the most important one, is to create a root of trust for network attestation. In this paper, we introduce our research on designing such a root of trust. This uses devices’ individual roots of trust and a decentralised ledger together with the techniques of “zero trust but verify”, which means that to start with, any entity in the system is not trusted until its functionality can be verified. Based on the verification results, the entities can establish trust. We aim to use such a root of trust to aggregate the attestation evidence and verification results from multiple devices in a network and to achieve trust in the network.}

	abstract = {The detection of missing security operations is a complex task in software engineering, mainly due to the semantic and contextual understanding required. Prior research efforts have employed similar path differential analysis to detect missing security operations, but these approaches have been limited in their ability to simultaneously compare the similarity of intra- and inter-procedural paths. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel approach called SSD that can detect multiple missing security operation bugs both intra- and inter-procedurally. Our approach collects slices with similar semantics and contexts based on four program slicing criteria, providing more versatile construction of similar slices and more comprehensive detection than previous works. In our experiments, we have identified 65 real bugs in the Linux kernel, of which we have verified 27 as fixed bugs and submitted the remaining 38 for patching. The Linux maintainers have accepted 19 of these patches, confirming the effectiveness and availability of SSD.}

	abstract = {Cloud platforms are widely adopted by many systems, such as time series processing systems, to store and process massive amounts of sensitive time series data. Unfortunately, several incidents have shown that cloud platforms are vulnerable to internal and external attacks that lead to critical data breaches. Adopting cryptographic protocols such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation adds high computational and network overhead to query operations. We present TimeClave, a fully oblivious in-enclave time series processing system: TimeClave leverages Intel SGX to support aggregate statistics on time series with minimal memory consumption inside the enclave. To hide the access pattern inside the enclave, we introduce a non-blocking read-optimised ORAM named RoORAM. TimeClave integrates RoORAM to obliviously and securely handle client queries with high performance. With an aggregation time interval of 10 s, \\(2^{14}\\) summarised data blocks and 8 aggregate functions, TimeClave run point query in 0.03 ms and a range query of 50 intervals in 0.46 ms. Compared to the ORAM baseline, TimeClave achieves lower query latency by up to \\(2.5\\times \\) and up to \\(2\\times \\) throughput, with up to 22K queries per second.}

	abstract = {Most Internet of Things (IoT) devices have limited computing power and resources. Therefore, lightweight encryption protocols are essential to secure communications between IoT devices. As a promising technique, physical layer key generation has been widely used in IoT applications to secure communication between devices. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Appropriate Key Generation Scheme (EAKGS) for various IoT scenarios. According to the characteristics of the channel data, we design the pre-judgment stage to classify the values. Considering the key generation requirements and measured values characteristics in different scenarios, we propose efficient key generation schemes for static and dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct real-world experimental analysis and validation of our scheme. We analyze the feasibility of EAKGS from key generation rate, key error rate and randomness. Our experimental results demonstrate that EAKGS meets the requirements for adaptability and key performance.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the spread of fake news in social networks has become a serious threat to network security. To address this problem, various fake news detection methods have been proposed. However, most of the existing methods cannot jointly capture the intra-modal and inter-modal correlation relationships between image regions and text fragments, resulting in the model not making full use of multimodal information, thus limiting their ability to detect fake news accurately. To solve this limitation, we propose a novel fake news detection method based on a multimodal cooperative attention network (MCAND). Firstly, we use BERT and VGG19 to learn text and image representations, respectively. Secondly, the multimodal cooperative attention network is used to generate the high-order fusion features that fuse the image and text representations by calculating the similarity between the information segments in the modalities and the inter-modal similarity. Finally, the multimodal fusion features are input into the fake news detector to identify fake news. The experimental results show that the proposed MCAND has outperformed the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in terms of performance, demonstrating its effectiveness.}
