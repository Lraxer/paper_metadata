	abstract = {Traditionally, capsule wardrobes are manually designed by expert fashionistas through their creativity and technical prowess. The goal is to curate minimal fashion items that can be assembled into several compatible and versatile outfits. It is usually a cost and time intensive process, and hence lacks scalability. Although there are a few approaches that attempt to automate the process, they tend to ignore the price of items or shopping budget. In this article, we formulate this task as a multi-objective budget constrained capsule wardrobe recommendation ( MOBCCWR ) problem. It is modeled as a bipartite graph having two disjoint vertex sets corresponding to top-wear and bottom-wear items, respectively. An edge represents compatibility between the corresponding item pairs. The objective is to find a 1-neighbor subset of fashion items as a capsule wardrobe that jointly maximize compatibility and versatility scores by considering corresponding user-specified preference weight coefficients and an overall shopping budget as a means of achieving personalization. We study the complexity class of  MOBCCWR , show that it is NP-Complete, and propose a greedy algorithm for finding a near-optimal solution in real time. We also analyze the time complexity and approximation bound for our algorithm. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both real and synthetic datasets.}

	abstract = {Answer selection, which is involved in many natural language processing applications, such as dialog systems and question answering (QA), is an important yet challenging task in practice, since conventional methods typically suffer from the issues of ignoring diverse real-world background knowledge. In this article, we extensively investigate approaches to enhancing the answer selection model with external knowledge from knowledge graph (KG). First, we present a context-knowledge interaction learning framework, Knowledge-aware Neural Network, which learns the QA sentence representations by considering a tight interaction with the external knowledge from KG and the textual information. Then, we develop two kinds of knowledge-aware attention mechanism to summarize both the context-based and knowledge-based interactions between questions and answers. To handle the diversity and complexity of KG information, we further propose a Contextualized Knowledge-aware Attentive Neural Network, which improves the knowledge representation learning with structure information via a customized Graph Convolutional Network and comprehensively learns context-based and knowledge-based sentence representation via the multi-view knowledge-aware attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on four widely used benchmark QA datasets, including WikiQA, TREC QA, InsuranceQA, and Yahoo QA. Results verify the benefits of incorporating external knowledge from KG and show the robust superiority and extensive applicability of our method.}

	abstract = {Group recommendation aims to recommend items to a group of users. In this work, we study group recommendation in a particular scenario, namely occasional group recommendation, where groups are formed ad hoc and users may just constitute a group for the first time—that is, the historical group-item interaction records are highly limited. Most state-of-the-art works have addressed the challenge by aggregating group members’ personal preferences to learn the group representation. However, the representation learning for a group is most complex beyond the aggregation or fusion of group member representation, as the personal preferences and group preferences may be in different spaces and even orthogonal. In addition, the learned user representation is not accurate due to the sparsity of users’ interaction data. Moreover, the group similarity in terms of common group members has been overlooked, which, however, has the great potential to improve the group representation learning. In this work, we focus on addressing the aforementioned challenges in the group representation learning task, and devise a hierarchical hyperedge embedding-based group recommender, namely HyperGroup. Specifically, we propose to leverage the user-user interactions to alleviate the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, and design a graph neural network-based representation learning network to enhance the learning of individuals’ preferences from their friends’ preferences, which provides a solid foundation for learning groups’ preferences. To exploit the group similarity (i.e., overlapping relationships among groups) to learn a more accurate group representation from highly limited group-item interactions, we connect all groups as a network of overlapping sets (a.k.a. hypergraph), and treat the task of group preference learning as embedding hyperedges (i.e., user sets/groups) in a hypergraph, where an inductive hyperedge embedding method is proposed. To further enhance the group-level preference modeling, we develop a joint training strategy to learn both user-item and group-item interactions in the same process. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HyperGroup in comparison to the state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Recommendation systems are often evaluated based on user’s interactions that were collected from an existing, already deployed recommendation system. In this situation, users only provide feedback on the exposed items and they may not leave feedback on other items since they have not been exposed to them by the deployed system. As a result, the collected feedback dataset that is used to evaluate a new model is influenced by the deployed system, as a form of closed loop feedback. In this article, we show that the typical offline evaluation of recommender systems suffers from the so-called Simpson’s paradox. Simpson’s paradox is the name given to a phenomenon observed when a significant trend appears in several different sub-populations of observational data but disappears or is even reversed when these sub-populations are combined together. Our in-depth experiments based on stratified sampling reveal that a very small minority of items that are frequently exposed by the deployed system plays a confounding factor in the offline evaluation of recommendation systems. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation methodology that takes into account the confounder, i.e., the deployed system’s characteristics. Using the relative comparison of many recommendation models as in the typical offline evaluation of recommender systems, and based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, we show that our proposed evaluation methodology exhibits statistically significant improvements of 14% and 40% on the examined open loop datasets (Yahoo! and Coat), respectively, in reflecting the true ranking of systems with an open loop (randomised) evaluation in comparison to the standard evaluation.}

Despite the advances in abstractive summarization, custom generation of summaries (e.g., towards a user’s preference) remains unexplored. In this article, we present  CATS,  an abstractive neural summarization model that summarizes content in a sequence-to-sequence fashion while also introducing a new mechanism to control the underlying latent topic distribution of the produced summaries. We empirically illustrate the efficacy of our model in producing customized summaries and present findings that facilitate the design of such systems. We use the well-known CNN/DailyMail dataset to evaluate our model. Furthermore, we present a transfer-learning method and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a low resource setting, i.e., abstractive summarization of meetings minutes, where combining the main available meetings’ transcripts datasets, AMI and  International Computer Science Institute(ICSI) , results in merely a few hundred training documents.}

	abstract = {In recommender systems, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that affect user-item interaction. Recently, several studies have utilized disentangled representation learning to discover such hidden factors from user-item interaction data, which shows promising results. However, without any external guidance signal, the learned disentangled representations lack clear meanings, and are easy to suffer from the data sparsity issue. In light of these challenges, we study how to leverage knowledge graph (KG) to guide the disentangled representation learning in recommender systems. The purpose for incorporating KG is twofold, making the disentangled representations interpretable and resolving data sparsity issue. However, it is not straightforward to incorporate KG for improving disentangled representations, because KG has very different data characteristics compared with user-item interactions. We propose a novel  K nowledge-guided  D isentangled  R epresentations approach ( KDR ) to utilizing KG to guide the disentangled representation learning in recommender systems. The basic idea, is to first learn more interpretable disentangled dimensions (explicit disentangled representations) based on structural KG, and then align implicit disentangled representations learned from user-item interaction with the explicit disentangled representations. We design a novel alignment strategy based on mutual information maximization. It enables the KG information to guide the implicit disentangled representation learning, and such learned disentangled representations will correspond to semantic information derived from KG. Finally, the fused disentangled representations are optimized to improve the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both performance and interpretability.}

To address these challenges, we proposed to explore the category hierarchy knowledge graph of POIs via an attention mechanism to learn the robust representations of POIs even when there is insufficient data. We also proposed a spatial-temporal decay LSTM and a Discrete Fourier Series-based periodic attention to better facilitate the capturing of the personalized behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on two commonly adopted real-world  location-based social networks (LBSNs)  datasets proved that the inclusion of the aforementioned modules helps to boost the performance of next and next new POI recommendation tasks significantly. Specifically, our model in general outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.}

	abstract = {User engagement is crucial to the long-term success of a mobile app. Several metrics, such as dwell time, have been used for measuring user engagement. However, how to effectively predict user engagement in the context of mobile apps is still an open research question. For example, do the mobile usage contexts (e.g.,\xa0time of day) in which users access mobile apps impact their dwell time? Answers to such questions could help mobile operating system and publishers to optimize advertising and service placement. In this article, we first conduct an empirical study for assessing how user characteristics, temporal features, and the short/long-term contexts contribute to gains in predicting users’ app dwell time on the population level. The comprehensive analysis is conducted on large app usage logs collected through a mobile advertising company. The dataset covers more than 12K anonymous users and 1.3 million log events. Based on the analysis, we further investigate a novel mobile app engagement prediction problem—can we predict simultaneously what app the user will use next and how long he/she will stay on that app? We propose several strategies for this joint prediction problem and demonstrate that our model can improve the performance significantly when compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. Our work can help mobile system developers in designing a better and more engagement-aware mobile app user experience.}

However, the majority of existing collaborative filtering systems are not well designed to handle missing data. Particularly, in order to inject the negative signals in the training phase, these solutions largely rely on negative sampling from unobserved user-item interactions and simply treating them as negative instances, which brings the recommendation performance degradation. To address the issues, we develop a  C ollaborative  R eflection-Augmented  A utoencoder  N etwork (CRANet), that is capable of exploring transferable knowledge from observed and unobserved user-item interactions. The network architecture of CRANet is formed of an integrative structure with a reflective receptor network and an information fusion autoencoder module, which endows our recommendation framework with the ability of encoding implicit user’s pairwise preference on both interacted and non-interacted items. Additionally, a parametric regularization-based tied-weight scheme is designed to perform robust joint training of the two-stage CRANetmodel. We finally experimentally validate CRANeton four diverse benchmark datasets corresponding to two recommendation tasks, to show that debiasing the negative signals of user-item interactions improves the performance as compared to various state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

In this article, we focus on how to utilize another kind of useful data signal (i.e., peer review text) to improve both the performance and interpretability of the prediction models. Specially, we propose a novel aspect-aware capsule network for citation count prediction based on review text. It contains two major capsule layers, namely the feature capsule layer and the aspect capsule layer, with two different routing approaches, respectively. Feature capsules encode the local semantics from review sentences as the input of aspect capsule layer, whereas aspect capsules aim to capture high-level semantic features that will be served as final representations for prediction. Besides the predictive capacity, we also enhance the model interpretability with two strategies. First, we use the topic distribution of the review text to guide the learning of aspect capsules so that each aspect capsule can represent a specific aspect in the review. Then, we use the learned aspect capsules to generate readable text for explaining the predicted citation count. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in both performance and interpretability.}

	abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of portable devices and the popularity of community Question Answering (cQA) sites, users can seamlessly post and answer many questions. To effectively organize the information for precise recommendation and easy searching, these platforms require users to select topics for their raised questions. However, due to the limited experience, certain users fail to select appropriate topics for their questions. Thereby, automatic question tagging becomes an urgent and vital problem for the cQA sites, yet it is non-trivial due to the following challenges. On the one hand, vast and meaningful topics are available yet not utilized in the cQA sites; how to model and tag them to relevant questions is a highly challenging problem. On the other hand, related topics in the cQA sites may be organized into a directed acyclic graph. In light of this, how to exploit relations among topics to enhance their representations is critical. To settle these challenges, we devise a graph-guided topic ranking model to tag questions in the cQA sites appropriately. In particular, we first design a topic information fusion module to learn the topic representation by jointly considering the name and description of the topic. Afterwards, regarding the special structure of topics, we propose an information propagation module to enhance the topic representation. As the comprehension of questions plays a vital role in question tagging, we design a multi-level context-modeling-based question encoder to obtain the enhanced question representation. Moreover, we introduce an interaction module to extract topic-aware question information and capture the interactive information between questions and topics. Finally, we utilize the interactive information to estimate the ranking scores for topics. Extensive experiments on three Chinese cQA datasets have demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.}

While there are a number of possible organizations, document-ordered indexes are the most common, since they are amenable to various query types, support index updates, and allow for efficient dynamic pruning operations. One disadvantage with document-ordered indexes is that high-scoring documents can be distributed across the document identifier space, meaning that index traversal algorithms that terminate early might put search effectiveness at risk. The alternative is impact-ordered indexes, which primarily support top-  disjunctions but also allow for  anytime  query processing, where the search can be terminated at any time, with search quality improving as processing latency increases. Anytime query processing can be used to effectively reduce high-percentile tail latency that is essential for operational scenarios in which a service level agreement (SLA) imposes response time requirements. In this work, we show how document-ordered indexes can be organized such that they can be queried in an anytime fashion, enabling strict latency control with effective early termination. Our experiments show that processing document-ordered topical segments selected by a simple score estimator outperforms existing anytime algorithms, and allows query runtimes to be accurately limited to comply with SLA requirements.}

	abstract = {Question generation is an important yet challenging problem in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to generate natural and relevant questions from various input formats, e.g., natural language text, structure database, knowledge base, and image. In this article, we focus on question generation from natural language text, which has received tremendous interest in recent years due to the widespread applications such as data augmentation for question answering systems. During the past decades, many different question generation models have been proposed, from traditional rule-based methods to advanced neural network-based methods. Since there have been a large variety of research works proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights for future development. In contrast to existing reviews, in this survey, we try to provide a more comprehensive taxonomy of question generation tasks from three different perspectives, i.e., the types of the input context text, the target answer, and the generated question. We take a deep look into existing models from different dimensions to analyze their underlying ideas, major design principles, and training strategies We compare these models through benchmark tasks to obtain an empirical understanding of the existing techniques. Moreover, we discuss what is missing in the current literature and what are the promising and desired future directions.}

	abstract = {The job interview is considered as one of the most essential tasks in talent recruitment, which forms a bridge between candidates and employers in fitting the right person for the right job. While substantial efforts have been made on improving the job interview process, it is inevitable to have biased or inconsistent interview assessment due to the subjective nature of the traditional interview process. To this end, in this article, we propose three novel approaches to intelligent job interview by learning the large-scale real-world interview data. Specifically, we first develop a preliminary model, named Joint Learning Model on Interview Assessment (JLMIA), to mine the relationship among job description, candidate resume, and interview assessment. Then, we further design an enhanced model, named Neural-JLMIA, to improve the representative capability by applying neural variance inference. Last, we propose to refine JLMIA with Refined-JLMIA (R-JLMIA) by modeling individual characteristics for each collection, i.e., disentangling the core competences from resume and capturing the evolution of the semantic topics over different interview rounds. As a result, our approaches can effectively learn the representative perspectives of different job interview processes from the successful job interview records in history. In addition, we exploit our approaches for two real-world applications, i.e., person-job fit and skill recommendation for interview assessment. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our models, which can lead to substantially less bias in job interviews and provide an interpretable understanding of job interview assessment.}

	abstract = {Domain adaptation aims at improving the performance of learning tasks in a target domain by leveraging the knowledge extracted from a source domain. To this end, one can perform knowledge transfer between these two domains. However, this problem becomes extremely challenging when the data of these two domains are characterized by different types of features, i.e., the feature spaces of the source and target domains are different, which is referred to as heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). To solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Knowledge Preserving and Distribution Alignment (KPDA), which learns an augmented target space by jointly minimizing information loss and maximizing domain distribution alignment. Specifically, we seek to discover a latent space, where the knowledge is preserved by exploiting the Laplacian graph terms and reconstruction regularizations. Moreover, we adopt the Maximum Mean Discrepancy to align the distributions of the source and target domains in the latent space. Mathematically, KPDA is formulated as a minimization problem with orthogonal constraints, which involves two projection variables. Then, we develop an algorithm based on the Gauss–Seidel iteration scheme and split the problem into two subproblems, which are solved by searching algorithms based on the Barzilai–Borwein (BB) stepsize. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Massive nonlinguistic audio data brings a novel opportunity for user profiling due to the prevalence of studying spontaneous face-to-face communication. Nonlinguistic audio is coarse-grained audio data without linguistic content. It is collected due to privacy concerns in private situations like doctor-patient dialogues. The opportunity facilitates optimized organizational management and personalized healthcare, especially for chronic diseases. In this article, we are the first to build a user profiling system to infer gender and personality based on nonlinguistic audio. Instead of linguistic or acoustic features that are unable to extract, we focus on conversational features that could reflect AoIs. We firstly develop an adaptive voice activity detection algorithm that could address individual differences in voice and false-positive voice activities caused by people nearby. Secondly, we propose a gender-assisted multi-task learning method to combat dynamics in human behavior by integrating gender differences and the correlation of personality traits. According to the experimental evaluation of 100 people in 273 meetings, we achieved 0.759 and 0.652 in F1-score for gender identification and personality recognition, respectively.}

To help them complete their search, search engine usually provide query suggestions. A good query suggestion system requires to model user behavior during the search session. In this article, we study multiple Transformer architectures applied to the query suggestion task and compare them with recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models. We experiment Transformer models with different tokenizers, with different Encoders (large pretrained models or fully trained ones), and with two kinds of architectures (flat or hierarchic). We study the performance and the behaviors of these various models, and observe that Transformer-based models outperform RNN-based ones. We show that while the hierarchical architectures exhibit very good performances for query suggestion, the flat models are more suitable for complex and long search tasks. Finally, we investigate the flat models behavior and demonstrate that they indeed learn to recover the hierarchy of a search session.}

	abstract = {Several recent studies have explored the interaction effects between topics, systems, corpora, and components when measuring retrieval effectiveness. However, all of these previous studies assume that a topic or information need is represented by a single query. In reality, users routinely reformulate queries to satisfy an information need. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the notion of “query variations” which are essentially multiple user formulations for an information need. Like many retrieval models, some queries are highly effective while others are not. This is often an artifact of the collection being searched which might be more or less sensitive to word choice. Users rarely have perfect knowledge about the underlying collection, and so finding queries that work is often a trial-and-error process. In this work, we explore the fundamental problem of system interaction effects between collections, ranking models, and queries. To answer this important question, we formalize the analysis using ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) models to measure multiple components effects across collections and topics by nesting multiple query variations within each topic. Our findings show that query formulations have a comparable effect size of the topic factor itself, which is known to be the factor with the greatest effect size in prior ANOVA studies. Both topic and formulation have a substantially larger effect size than any other factor, including the ranking algorithms and, surprisingly, even query expansion. This finding reinforces the importance of further research in understanding the role of query rewriting in IR related tasks.}

	abstract = {Sequential recommenders capture dynamic aspects of users’ interests by modeling sequential behavior. Previous studies on sequential recommendations mostly aim to identify users’ main recent interests to optimize the recommendation accuracy; they often neglect the fact that users display multiple interests over extended periods of time, which could be used to improve the diversity of lists of recommended items. Existing work related to diversified recommendation typically assumes that users’ preferences are static and depend on post-processing the candidate list of recommended items. However, those conditions are not suitable when applied to sequential recommendations. We tackle sequential recommendation as a list generation process and propose a unified approach to take accuracy as well as diversity into consideration, called  multi-interest, diversified, sequential recommendation . Particularly, an implicit interest mining module is first used to mine users’ multiple interests, which are reflected in users’ sequential behavior. Then an interest-aware, diversity promoting decoder is designed to produce recommendations that cover those interests. For training, we introduce an interest-aware, diversity promoting loss function that can supervise the model to learn to recommend accurate as well as diversified items. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public datasets and the results show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding diversity while producing comparable or better accuracy for sequential recommendation.}

	abstract = {Social media is an attention economy where broadcasters are constantly competing for attention in their followers’ feeds. Broadcasters are likely to elicit greater attention from their followers if their posts remain visible at the top of their followers’ feeds for a longer period of time. However, this depends on the rate at which their followers receive information in their feeds, which in turn depends on the broadcasters they follow. Motivated by this observation and recent calls for fairness of exposure in social networks, in this article, we look at the task of recommending links from the perspective of visibility optimization. Given a set of candidate links provided by a link recommendation algorithm, our goal is to find a subset of those links that would provide the highest visibility to a set of broadcasters. To this end, we first show that this problem reduces to maximizing a nonsubmodular nondecreasing set function under matroid constraints. Then, we show that the set function satisfies a notion of approximate submodularity that allows the standard greedy algorithm to enjoy theoretical guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real data gathered from Twitter show that the greedy algorithm is able to consistently outperform several competitive baselines.}

	abstract = {Accurately recommending the next point of interest (POI) has become a fundamental problem with the rapid growth of location-based social networks. However, sparse, imbalanced check-in data and diverse user check-in patterns pose severe challenges for POI recommendation tasks. Knowledge-aware models are known to be primary in leveraging these problems. However, as most knowledge graphs are constructed statically, sequential information is yet integrated. In this work, we propose a meta-learned sequential-knowledge-aware recommender (Meta-SKR), which utilizes sequential, spatio-temporal, and social knowledge to recommend the next POI for a location-based social network user. The framework mainly contains four modules. First, in the graph construction module, a novel type of knowledge graph—the sequential knowledge graph, which is sensitive to the check-in order of POIs—is built to model users’ check-in patterns. To deal with the problem of data sparsity, a meta-learning module based on latent embedding optimization is then introduced to generate user-conditioned parameters of the subsequent sequential-knowledge-aware embedding module, where representation vectors of entities (nodes) and relations (edges) are learned. In this embedding module, gated recurrent units are adapted to distill intra- and inter-sequential knowledge graph information. We also design a novel knowledge-aware attention mechanism to capture information surrounding a given node. Finally, POI recommendation is provided by inferring potential links of knowledge graphs in the prediction module. Evaluations on three real-world check-in datasets show that Meta-SKR can achieve high recommendation accuracy even with sparse data.}

	abstract = {Social recommendation has achieved great success in many domains including e-commerce and location-based social networks. Existing methods usually explore the user-item interactions or user-user connections to predict users’ preference behaviors. However, they usually learn both user and item representations in Euclidean space, which has large limitations for exploring the latent hierarchical property in the data. In this article, we study a novel problem of hyperbolic social recommendation, where we aim to learn the compact but strong representations for both users and items. Meanwhile, this work also addresses two critical domain-issues, which are under-explored. First, users often make trade-offs with multiple underlying aspect factors to make decisions during their interactions with items. Second, users generally build connections with others in terms of different aspects, which produces different influences with aspects in social network. To this end, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework with multiple aspect learning, namely, HyperSoRec. Specifically, we first embed all users, items, and aspects into hyperbolic space with superior representations to ensure their hierarchical properties. Then, we adapt a GNN with novel multi-aspect message-passing-receiving mechanism to capture different influences among users. Next, to characterize the multi-aspect interactions of users on items, we propose an adaptive hyperbolic metric learning method by introducing learnable interactive relations among different aspects. Finally, we utilize the hyperbolic translational distance to measure the plausibility in each user-item pair for recommendation. Experimental results on two public datasets clearly demonstrate that our HyperSoRec not only achieves significant improvement for recommendation performance but also shows better representation ability in hyperbolic space with strong robustness and reliability.}

	abstract = {Learning to rank from logged user feedback, such as clicks or purchases, is a central component of many real-world information systems. Different from human-annotated relevance labels, the user feedback is always noisy and biased. Many existing learning to rank methods infer the underlying relevance of query–item pairs based on different assumptions of examination, and still optimize a relevance based objective. Such methods rely heavily on the correct estimation of examination, which is often difficult to achieve in practice. In this work, we propose a general framework  U-rank+  for learning to rank with logged user feedback from the perspective of graph matching. We systematically analyze the biases in user feedback, including examination bias and selection bias. Then, we take both biases into consideration for unbiased utility estimation that directly based on user feedback, instead of relevance. In order to maximize the estimated utility in an efficient manner, we design two different solvers based on Sinkhorn and LambdaLoss for  U-rank+ . The former is based on a standard graph matching algorithm, and the latter is inspired by the traditional method of learning to rank. Both of the algorithms have good theoretical properties to optimize the unbiased utility objective while the latter is proved to be empirically more effective and efficient in practice. Our framework  U-rank+  can deal with a general utility function and can be used in a widespread of applications including web search, recommendation, and online advertising. Semi-synthetic experiments on three benchmark learning to rank datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of  U-rank+ . Furthermore, our proposed framework has been deployed on two different scenarios of a mainstream App store, where the online A/B testing shows that  U-rank+  achieves an average improvement of 19.2% on click-through rate and 20.8% improvement on conversion rate in recommendation scenario, and 5.12% on platform revenue in online advertising scenario over the production baselines.}

	abstract = {Sequential product recommendation, aiming at predicting the products that a target user will interact with soon, has become a hotspot topic. Most of the sequential recommendation models focus on learning from users’ interacted product sequences in a purely data-driven manner. However, they largely overlook the knowledgeable substitutable and complementary relations between products. To address this issue, we propose a novel Substitutable and Complementary Graph-based Sequential Product Recommendation model, namely, SCG-SPRe. The innovations of SCG-SPRe lie in its two main modules: (1) The module of interactive graph neural networks jointly encodes the high-order product correlations in the substitutable graph and the complementary graph into two types of relation-specific product representations. (2) The module of kernel-enhanced transformer networks adaptively fuses multiple temporal kernels to characterize the unique temporal patterns between a candidate product to be recommended and any interacted product in a target behavior sequence. Thanks to the seamless integration of the two modules, SCG-SPRe obtains candidate-dependent user representations for different candidate products to compute the corresponding ranking scores. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating SCG-SPRe is superior to competitive sequential recommendation baselines and validating the benefits of explicitly modeling the product-product relations.}

	abstract = {Personalized recommendation has become more and more important for users to quickly find relevant items. The key issue of the recommender system is how to model user preferences. Previous work mostly employed user historical data to learn users’ preferences, but faced with the data sparsity problem. The prevalence of online social networks promotes increasing online discussion groups, and users in the same group often have similar interests and preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate group information for personalized recommendation. The existing work on group-information-enhanced recommender systems mainly relies on the item information related to the group, which is not expressive enough to capture the complicated preference dependency relationships between group users and the target user. In this article, we solve the problem with the graph neural networks. Specifically, the relationship between users and items, the item preferences of groups, and the groups that users participate in are constructed as bipartite graphs, respectively, and the user preferences for items are learned end to end through the graph neural network. The experimental results on the Last.fm and Douban Movie datasets show that considering group preferences can improve the recommendation performance and demonstrate the superiority on sparse users compared}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of online social recommendation system, substantial methods have been proposed. Unlike traditional recommendation system, social recommendation performs by integrating social relationship features, where there are two major challenges, i.e., early summarization and data sparsity. Thus far, they have not been solved effectively. In this article, we propose a novel social recommendation approach, namely Multi-Graph Heterogeneous Interaction Fusion (MG-HIF), to solve these two problems. Our basic idea is to fuse heterogeneous interaction features from multi-graphs, i.e., user–item bipartite graph and social relation network, to improve the vertex representation learning. A meta-path cross-fusion model is proposed to fuse multi-hop heterogeneous interaction features via discrete cross-correlations. Based on that, a social relation GAN is developed to explore latent friendships of each user. We further fuse representations from two graphs by a novel multi-graph information fusion strategy with attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine meta-path with social relation representation. To evaluate the performance of MG-HIF, we compare MG-HIF with seven states of the art over four benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that MG-HIF achieves better performance.}

	abstract = {User recommendation aims at recommending users with potential interests in the social network. Previous works have mainly focused on the undirected social networks with symmetric relationship such as friendship, whereas recent advances have been made on the asymmetric relationship such as the following and followed by relationship. Among the few existing direction-aware user recommendation methods, the random walk strategy has been widely adopted to extract the asymmetric proximity between users. However, according to our analysis on real-world directed social networks, we argue that the asymmetric proximity captured by existing random walk based methods are insufficient due to the inbalance in-degree and out-degree of nodes. To tackle this challenge, we propose InfoWalk, a novel informative walk strategy to efficiently capture the asymmetric proximity solely based on random walks. By transferring the direction information into the weights of each step, InfoWalk is able to overcome the limitation of edges while simultaneously maintain both the direction and proximity. Based on the asymmetric proximity captured by InfoWalk, we further propose the qualitative (DNE-L) and quantitative (DNE-T) directed network embedding methods, capable of preserving the two properties in the embedding space. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DNE model over several state-of-the-art approaches in various tasks.}

	abstract = {The cold-start recommendation is an urgent problem in contemporary online applications. It aims to provide users whose behaviors are literally sparse with as accurate recommendations as possible. Many data-driven algorithms, such as the widely used matrix factorization, underperform because of data sparseness. This work adopts the idea of meta-learning to solve the user’s cold-start recommendation problem. We propose a meta-learning-based cold-start sequential recommendation framework called metaCSR, including three main components: Diffusion Representer for learning better user/item embedding through information diffusion on the interaction graph; Sequential Recommender for capturing temporal dependencies of behavior sequences; and Meta Learner for extracting and propagating transferable knowledge of prior users and learning a good initialization for new users. metaCSR holds the ability to learn the common patterns from regular users’ behaviors and optimize the initialization so that the model can quickly adapt to new users after one or a few gradient updates to achieve optimal performance. The extensive quantitative experiments on three widely used datasets show the remarkable performance of metaCSR in dealing with the user cold-start problem. Meanwhile, a series of qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed metaCSR has good generalization.}

	abstract = {In recent years, advances in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have given new insights into the development of social recommendation. However, many existing GCN-based social recommendation methods often directly apply GCN to capture user-item and user-user interactions, which probably have two main limitations: (a) Due to the power-law property of the degree distribution, the vanilla GCN with static normalized adjacency matrix has limitations in learning node representations, especially for the long-tail nodes; (b) multi-typed social relationships between users that are ubiquitous in the real world are rarely considered. In this article, we propose a novel Bilateral Filtering Heterogeneous Attention Network (BFHAN), which improves long-tail node representations and leverages multi-typed social relationships between user nodes. First, we propose a novel graph convolutional filter for the user-item bipartite network and extend it to the user-user homogeneous network. Further, we theoretically analyze the correlation between the convergence values of different graph convolutional filters and node degrees after stacking multiple layers. Second, we model multi-relational social interactions between users as the multiplex network and further propose a multiplex attention network to capture distinctive inter-layer influences for user representations. Last but not least, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art GCN-based methods for social recommendation tasks.}

	abstract = {Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has been the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is supplier exposure fairness, where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage of items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is especially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may be important to optimize utilities not just for the end user but also for other stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair representation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes accomplished by attempting to increase aggregate diversity to mitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in recommendations. In this article, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based algorithm that works as a post-processing approach after recommendation generation to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm iteratively adds high-quality items that have low visibility or items from suppliers with low exposure to the users’ final recommendation lists. A comprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, although it significantly improves exposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of relevance of the recommendations.}

	abstract = {Recommendation in legal scenario (Legal-Rec) is a specialized recommendation task that aims to provide potential helpful legal documents for users. While there are mainly three differences compared with traditional recommendation: (1) Both the structural connections and textual contents of legal information are important in the Legal-Rec scenario, which means feature fusion is very important here. (2) Legal-Rec users prefer the newest legal cases (the latest legal interpretation and legal practice), which leads to a severe new-item problem. (3) Different from users in other scenarios, most Legal-Rec users are expert and domain-related users. They often concentrate on several topics and have more stable information needs. So it is important to accurately model user interests here. To the best of our knowledge, existing recommendation work cannot handle these challenges simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a legal information enhanced graph neural network–based recommendation framework (LegalGNN). First, a unified legal content and structure representation model is designed for feature fusion, where the Heterogeneous Legal Information Network (HLIN) is constructed to connect the structural features (e.g., knowledge graph) and contextual features (e.g., the content of legal documents) for training. Second, to model user interests, we incorporate the queries users issued in legal systems into the HLIN and link them with both retrieved documents and inquired users. This extra information is not only helpful for estimating user preferences, but also valuable for cold users/items (with less interaction history) in this scenario. Third, a graph neural network with relational attention mechanism is applied to make use of high-order connections in HLIN for Legal-Rec. Experimental results on a real-world legal dataset verify that LegalGNN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods significantly. As far as we know, LegalGNN is the first graph neural model for legal recommendation.}

	abstract = {In this article, we study the task of user profiling in question answering communities (QACs). Previous user profiling algorithms suffer from a number of defects: they regard users and words as atomic units, leading to the mismatch between them; they are designed for other applications but not for QACs; and some semantic profiling algorithms do not co-embed users and words, leading to making the affinity measurement between them difficult. To improve the profiling performance, we propose a neural Flow-based Constrained Co-embedding Model, abbreviated as\xa0FCCM. FCCM jointly co-embeds the vector representations of both users and words in QACs such that the affinities between them can be semantically measured. Specifically, FCCM extends the standard variational auto-encoder model to enforce the inferred embeddings of users and words subject to the voting constraint, i.e., given a question and the users who answer this question in the community, representations of the users whose answers receive more votes are closer to the representations of the words associated with these answers, compared with representations of whose receiving fewer votes. In addition, FCCM integrates normalizing flow into the variational auto-encoder framework to avoid the assumption that the distributions of the embeddings are Gaussian, making the inferred embeddings fit the real distributions of the data better. Experimental results on a Chinese Zhihu question answering dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\xa0FCCM model for the task of user profiling in QACs.}

	abstract = {For present e-commerce platforms, it is important to accurately predict users’ preference for a timely next-item recommendation. To achieve this goal, session-based recommender systems are developed, which are based on a sequence of the most recent user-item interactions to avoid the influence raised from outdated historical records. Although a session can usually reflect a user’s current preference, a local shift of the user’s intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the interactions that take place in the early positions within a session generally indicate the user’s initial intention, while later interactions are more likely to represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely considered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the significance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the positional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed in this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We formally define the properties of  forward-awareness  and  backward-awareness  to evaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial and the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional encoding schemes are generally  forward-aware  only, which can hardly represent the dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding scheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE) is proposed to account for both  forward-awareness  and  backward-awareness . Based on DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a well-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit the positional information for session-based recommendation tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets,  Yoochoose  and  Diginetica  and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by comparing it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.}

To address this task, we propose the PSAM model, a Personalized, Sequential, Attentive and Metric-aware (PSAM) model, that learns the semantic representations of three different categories of entities, i.e., users, queries, and products, based on user sequential purchase historical data and the corresponding sequential queries. Specifically, a query-based attentive LSTM (QA-LSTM) model and an attention mechanism are designed to infer users dynamic embeddings, which is able to capture their short-term and long-term preferences. To obtain more fine-grained embeddings of the three categories of entities, a metric-aware objective is deployed in our model to force the inferred embeddings subject to the triangle inequality, which is a more realistic distance measurement for product search. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that our PSAM model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art product search baselines in terms of effectiveness by up to 50.9% improvement under NDCG@20. Our visualization experiments further illustrate that the learned product embeddings are able to distinguish different types of products.}

However, most existing SRS focus on social influence and ignore another essential social phenomenon, i.e., social homophily. Social homophily, which is the premise of social influence, indicates that people tend to build social relations with similar people and form influence propagation paths. In this article, we propose a generic framework Social PathExplorer (SPEX) to enhance neural SRS. SPEX treats the neural recommendation model as a black box and improves the quality of recommendations by modeling the social recommendation task, the formation of social homophily, and their mutual effect in the manner of multi-task learning. We design a Graph Neural Network based component for influence propagation path prediction to help SPEX capture the rich information conveyed by the formation of social homophily. We further propose an uncertainty based task balancing method to set appropriate task weights for the recommendation task and the path prediction task during the joint optimization. Extensive experiments have validated that SPEX can be easily plugged into various state-of-the-art neural recommendation models and help improve their performance.

	abstract = {A session-based recommender system (SBRS) captures users’ evolving behaviors and recommends the next item by profiling users in terms of items in a session. User intent and user preference are two factors affecting his (her) decisions. Specifically, the former narrows the selection scope to some item types, while the latter helps to compare items of the same type. Most SBRSs assume one arbitrary user intent dominates a session when making a recommendation. However, this oversimplifies the reality that a session may involve multiple types of items conforming to different intents. In current SBRSs, items conforming to different user intents have cross-interference in profiling users for whom only one user intent is considered. Explicitly identifying and differentiating items conforming to various user intents can address this issue and model rich contextual information of a session. To this end, we design a framework modeling user intent and preference explicitly, which empowers the two factors to play their distinctive roles. Accordingly, we propose a key-array memory network (KA-MemNN) with a hierarchical intent tree to model coarse-to-fine user intents. The two-layer weighting unit (TLWU) in KA-MemNN detects user intents and generates intent-specific user profiles. Furthermore, the hierarchical semantic component (HSC) integrates multiple sets of intent-specific user profiles along with different user intent distributions to model a multi-intent user profile. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of KA-MemNN over selected state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {We study the effect of contextual information obtained from a user’s digital trace on Web search performance. Contextual information is modeled using Dirichlet–Hawkes processes (DHP) and used in augmenting Web search queries. The context is captured by monitoring all naturally occurring user behavior using continuous 24/7 recordings of the screen and associating the context with the queries issued by the users. We report a field study in which 13 participants installed a screen recording and digital activity monitoring system on their laptops for 14 days, resulting in data on all Web search queries and the associated context data. A query augmentation (QAug) model was built to expand the original query with semantically related terms. The effects of context window and source were determined by training context models with temporally varying context windows and varying application sources. The context models were then utilized to re-rank the QAug model. We evaluate the context models by using the Web document rankings of the original query as a control condition compared against various experimental conditions: (1) a search context condition in which the context was sourced from search history; (2) a non-search context condition in which the context was sourced from all interactions excluding search history; (3) a comprehensive context condition in which the context was sourced from both search and non-search histories; and (4) an application-specific condition in which the context was sourced from interaction histories captured on a specific application type. Our results indicated that incorporating more contextual information significantly improved Web search rankings as measured by the positions of the documents on which users clicked in the search result pages. The effects and importance of different context windows and application sources, along with different query types are analyzed, and their impact on Web search performance is discussed.}

	abstract = {Modern search services often provide multiple options to rank the search results, e.g., sort “by relevance”, “by price” or “by discount” in e-commerce. While the traditional rank by relevance effectively places the relevant results in the top positions of the results list, the rank by attribute could place many marginally relevant results in the head of the results list leading to poor user experience. In the past, this issue has been addressed by investigating the relevance-aware filtering problem, which asks to select the subset of results maximizing the relevance of the attribute-sorted list. Recently, an exact algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem optimally. However, the high computational cost of the algorithm makes it impractical for the Web search scenario, which is characterized by huge lists of results and strict time constraints. For this reason, the problem is often solved using efficient yet inaccurate heuristic algorithms. In this article, we first prove the performance bounds of the existing heuristics. We then propose two efficient and effective algorithms to solve the relevance-aware filtering problem. First, we propose OPT-Filtering, a novel exact algorithm that is faster than the existing state-of-the-art optimal algorithm. Second, we propose an approximate and even more efficient algorithm, ϵ-Filtering, which, given an allowed approximation error ϵ, finds a (1-ϵ)–optimal filtering, i.e., the relevance of its solution is at least (1-ϵ) times the optimum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the two proposed algorithms against state-of-the-art competitors on two real-world public datasets. Experimental results show that OPT-Filtering achieves a significant speedup of up to two orders of magnitude with respect to the existing optimal solution, while ϵ-Filtering further improves this result by trading effectiveness for efficiency. In particular, experiments show that ϵ-Filtering can achieve quasi-optimal solutions while being faster than all state-of-the-art competitors in most of the tested configurations.}

	abstract = {Multi-modal hashing supports efficient multimedia retrieval well. However, existing methods still suffer from two problems: (1) Fixed multi-modal fusion. They collaborate the multi-modal features with fixed weights for hash learning, which cannot adaptively capture the variations of online streaming multimedia contents. (2) Binary optimization challenge. To generate binary hash codes, existing methods adopt either two-step relaxed optimization that causes significant quantization errors or direct discrete optimization that consumes considerable computation and storage cost. To address these problems, we first propose a Supervised Multi-modal Hashing with Online Query-adaption method. A self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal features into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. Besides, the hash codes are efficiently learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Further, we propose an efficient Unsupervised Multi-modal Hashing with Online Query-adaption method with an adaptive multi-modal quantization strategy. The hash codes are directly learned without the reliance on the specific objective formulations. Finally, in both methods, we design a parameter-free online hashing module to adaptively capture query variations at the online retrieval stage. Experiments validate the superiority of our proposed methods.}

	abstract = {Personalized search tailors document ranking lists for each individual user based on her interests and query intent to better satisfy the user’s information need. Many personalized search models have been proposed. They first build a user interest profile from the user’s search history, and then re-rank the documents based on the personalized matching scores between the created profile and candidate documents. In this article, we attempt to solve the personalized search problem from an alternative perspective of clarifying the user’s intention of the current query. We know that there are many ambiguous words in natural language such as “Apple.” People with different knowledge backgrounds and interests have personalized understandings of these words. Therefore, we propose a personalized search model with personal word embeddings for each individual user that mainly contain the word meanings that the user already knows and can reflect the user interests. To learn great personal word embeddings, we design a pre-training model that captures both the textual information of the query log and the information about user interests contained in the click-through data represented as a graph structure. With personal word embeddings, we obtain the personalized word and context-aware representations of the query and documents. Furthermore, we also employ the current session as the short-term search context to dynamically disambiguate the current query. Finally, we use a matching model to calculate the matching score between the personalized query and document representations for ranking. Experimental results on two large-scale query logs show that our designed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalization models.}

	abstract = {Cross-lingual entity alignment has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Past studies using conventional approaches to match entities share the common problem of missing important structural information beyond entities in the modeling process. This allows graph neural network models to step in. Most existing graph neural network approaches model individual knowledge graphs (KGs) separately with a small amount of pre-aligned entities served as anchors to connect different KG embedding spaces. However, this characteristic can cause several major problems, including performance restraint due to the insufficiency of available seed alignments and ignorance of pre-aligned links that are useful in contextual information in-between nodes. In this article, we propose DuGa-DIT, a dual gated graph attention network with dynamic iterative training, to address these problems in a unified model. The DuGa-DIT model captures neighborhood and cross-KG alignment features by using intra-KG attention and cross-KG attention layers. With the dynamic iterative process, we can dynamically update the cross-KG attention score matrices, which enables our model to capture more cross-KG information. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and a case study in cross-lingual personalized search. Our experimental results demonstrate that DuGa-DIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely used to characterize entities of various types and their complex relations. Recent attempts either rely on explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness or graph neighborhood to learn heterogeneous network representations before predictions. These weakly coupled manners overlook the rich interactions among neighbor nodes, which introduces an early summarization issue. In this article, we propose GraphHINGE ( H eterogeneous  IN teract and aggre G at E ), which captures and aggregates the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through their structured neighborhoods. Specifically, we first introduce Neighborhood-based Interaction (NI) module to model the interactive patterns under the same metapaths, and then extend it to Cross Neighborhood-based Interaction (CNI) module to deal with different metapaths. Next, in order to address the complexity issue on large-scale networks, we formulate the interaction modules via a convolutional framework and learn the parameters efficiently with fast Fourier transform. Furthermore, we design a novel neighborhood-based selection (NS) mechanism, a sampling strategy, to filter high-order neighborhood information based on their low-order performance. The extensive experiments on six different types of heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the performance gains by comparing with state-of-the-arts in both click-through rate prediction and top-N recommendation tasks.}

	abstract = {Complex user behavior, especially in settings such as social media, can be organized as time-evolving networks. Through network embedding, we can extract general-purpose vector representations of these dynamic networks which allow us to analyze them without extensive feature engineering. Prior work has shown how to generate network embeddings while preserving the structural role proximity of nodes. These methods, however, cannot capture the temporal evolution of the structural identity of the nodes in dynamic networks. Other works, on the other hand, have focused on learning microscopic dynamic embeddings. Though these methods can learn node representations over dynamic networks, these representations capture the local context of nodes and do not learn the structural roles of nodes. In this article, we propose a novel method for learning structural node embeddings in discrete-time dynamic networks. Our method, called  HR2vec , tracks historical topology information in dynamic networks to learn dynamic structural role embeddings. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal datasets, we show that our method outperforms other well-known methods in tasks where structural equivalence and historical information both play important roles.  HR2vec  can be used to model dynamic user behavior in any networked setting where users can be represented as nodes. Additionally, we propose a novel method (called network fingerprinting) that uses  HR2vec  embeddings for modeling whole (or partial) time-evolving networks. We showcase our network fingerprinting method on synthetic and real-world networks. Specifically, we demonstrate how our method can be used for detecting foreign-backed information operations on Twitter.}

	abstract = {With the development of e-commerce, fraud behaviors have been becoming one of the biggest threats to the e-commerce business. Fraud behaviors seriously damage the ranking system of e-commerce platforms and adversely influence the shopping experience of users. It is of great practical value to detect fraud behaviors on e-commerce platforms. However, the task is non-trivial, since the adversarial action taken by fraudsters. Existing fraud detection systems used in the e-commerce industry easily suffer from performance decay and can not adapt to the upgrade of fraud patterns, as they take already known fraud behaviors as supervision information to detect other suspicious behaviors. In this article, we propose a competitive graph neural networks (CGNN)-based fraud detection system (eFraudCom) to detect fraud behaviors at one of the largest e-commerce platforms, “Taobao”. In the eFraudCom system, (1) the competitive graph neural networks (CGNN) as the core part of eFraudCom can classify behaviors of users directly by modeling the distributions of normal and fraud behaviors separately; (2) some normal behaviors will be utilized as weak supervision information to guide the CGNN to build the profile for normal behaviors that are more stable than fraud behaviors. The algorithm dependency on fraud behaviors will be eliminated, which enables eFraudCom to detect fraud behaviors in presence of the new fraud patterns; (3) the mutual information regularization term can maximize the separability between normal and fraud behaviors to further improve CGNN. eFraudCom is implemented into a prototype system and the performance of the system is evaluated by extensive experiments. The experiments on two Taobao and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed deep framework CGNN is superior to other baselines in detecting fraud behaviors. A case study on Taobao datasets verifies that CGNN is still robust when the fraud patterns have been upgraded.}

Relational topic models (RTMs) have shown promise on citation prediction via joint modeling of document contents and citations. However, existing RTMs can only capture pairwise or direct (first-order) citation relationships among documents. The indirect (high-order) citation links have been explored in graph neural network–based methods, but these methods suffer from the well-known explainability problem. In this article, we propose a model called Graph Neural Collaborative Topic Model that takes advantage of both relational topic models and graph neural networks to capture high-order citation relationships and to have higher explainability due to the latent topic semantic structure. Experiments on three real-world citation datasets show that our model outperforms several competitive baseline methods on citation recommendation. In addition, we show that our approach can learn better topics than the existing approaches. The recommendation results can be well explained by the underlying topics.}

To help users better engage in online conversations, this article presents a novel framework to automatically recommend conversations to users based on what they said and how they behaved in their chatting histories. While prior work mostly focuses on post-level recommendation, we aim to explore conversation context and model the interaction patterns therein. Furthermore, to characterize personal interests from interleaving user interactions, we learn (1)  global interactions , represented by topic and discourse word clusters to reflect users’ content and pragmatic preferences, and (2)  local interactions , encoding replying relations and chronological order of conversation turns to characterize users’ prior behavior. Built on collaborative filtering, our model captures global interactions via discovering word distributions to represent users’ topical interests and discourse behaviors, while local interactions are explored with graph-structured networks exploiting both reply structure and temporal features. Extensive experiments on three datasets from Twitter and Reddit show that our model coupling global and local interactions significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model. Further analyses show that our model is able to capture meaningful features from global and local interactions, which results in its superior performance in conversation recommendation.}

	abstract = {Mobile advertising has undoubtedly become one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. The influx of capital attracts increasing fraudsters to defraud money from advertisers. Fraudsters can leverage many techniques, where bots install fraud is the most difficult to detect due to its ability to emulate normal users by implementing sophisticated behavioral patterns to evade from detection rules defined by human experts. Therefore, we proposed BotSpot for bots install fraud detection previously. However, there are some drawbacks in BotSpot, such as the sparsity of the devices’ neighbors, weak interactive information of leaf nodes, and noisy labels. In this work, we propose BotSpot++ to improve these drawbacks: (1) for the sparsity of the devices’ neighbors, we propose to construct a super device node to enrich the graph structure and information flow utilizing domain knowledge and a clustering algorithm; (2) for the weak interactive information, we propose to incorporate a self-attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of various leaf nodes; and (3) for the noisy labels, we apply a label smoothing mechanism to alleviate it. Comprehensive experimental results show that BotSpot++ yields the best performance compared with six state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy our model to the advertising platform of Mobvista, a leading global mobile advertising company. The online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a Latent Dirichlet Allocation– (LDA) based topic-graph probabilistic personalization model for Web search. This model represents a user graph in a latent topic graph and simultaneously estimates the probabilities that the user is interested in the topics, as well as the probabilities that the user is not interested in the topics. For a given query issued by the user, the webpages that have higher relevancy to the interested topics are promoted, and the webpages more relevant to the non-interesting topics are penalized. In particular, we simulate a user’s search intent by building two profiles: A positive user profile for the probabilities of the user is interested in the topics and a corresponding negative user profile for the probabilities of being not interested in the the topics. The profiles are estimated based on the user’s search logs. A clicked webpage is assumed to include interesting topics. A skipped (viewed but not clicked) webpage is assumed to cover some non-interesting topics to the user. Such estimations are performed in the latent topic space generated by LDA. Moreover, a new approach is proposed to estimate the correlation between a given query and the user’s search history so as to determine how much personalization should be considered for the query. We compare our proposed models with several strong baselines including state-of-the-art personalization approaches. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real user search log collection illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.}

	abstract = {Person search has long been treated as a crucial and challenging task to support deeper insight in personalized summarization and personality discovery. Traditional methods, e.g., person re-identification and face recognition techniques, which profile video characters based on visual information, are often limited by relatively fixed poses or small variation of viewpoints and suffer from more realistic scenes with high motion complexity (e.g., movies). At the same time, long videos such as movies often have logical story lines and are composed of continuously developmental plots. In this situation, different persons usually meet on a specific occasion, in which informative social cues are performed. We notice that these social cues could semantically profile their personality and benefit person search task in two aspects. First, persons with certain relationships usually co-occur in short intervals; in case one of them is easier to be identified, the social relation cues extracted from their co-occurrences could further benefit the identification for the harder ones. Second, social relations could reveal the association between certain scenes and characters (e.g., classmate relationship may only exist among students), which could narrow down candidates into certain persons with a specific relationship. In this way, high-level social relation cues could improve the effectiveness of person search. Along this line, in this article, we propose a social context-aware framework, which fuses visual and social contexts to profile persons in more semantic perspectives and better deal with person search task in complex scenarios. Specifically, we first segment videos into several independent scene units and abstract out social contexts within these scene units. Then, we construct inner-personal links through a graph formulation operation for each scene unit, in which both visual cues and relation cues are considered. Finally, we perform a relation-aware label propagation to identify characters’ occurrences, combining low-level semantic cues (i.e., visual cues) and high-level semantic cues (i.e., relation cues) to further enhance the accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets validate that our solution outperforms several competitive baselines.}

	abstract = {Reducing user effort in finding relevant information is one of the key objectives of search systems. Existing approaches have been shown to effectively exploit the context from the current search session of users for automatically suggesting queries to reduce their search efforts. However, these approaches do not accomplish the end goal of a search system—that of retrieving a set of potentially relevant documents for the evolving information need during a search session. This article takes the problem of query prediction one step further by investigating the problem of contextual recommendation within a search session. More specifically, given the partial context information of a session in the form of a small number of queries, we investigate how a search system can effectively predict the documents that a user would have been presented with had he continued the search session by submitting subsequent queries. To address the problem, we propose a model of contextual recommendation that seeks to capture the underlying semantics of information need transitions of a current user’s search context. This model leverages information from a number of past interactions of other users with similar interactions from an existing search log. To identify similar interactions, as a novel contribution, we propose an embedding approach that jointly learns representations of both individual query terms and also those of queries (in their entirety) from a search log data by leveraging session-level containment relationships. Our experiments conducted on a large query log, namely the AOL, demonstrate that using a joint embedding of queries and their terms within our proposed framework of document retrieval outperforms a number of text-only and sequence modeling based baselines.}

	abstract = {Explicit and implicit knowledge about users and items have been used to describe complex and heterogeneous side information for recommender systems (RSs). Many existing methods use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to learn the representation of a user-item knowledge graph (KG) in low-dimensional space. In this article, we propose a lightweight end-to-end joint learning framework for fusing the tasks of KGE and RSs at the model level. Our method proposes a lightweight KG embedding method by using bidirectional bijection relation-type modeling to enable scalability for large graphs while using self-adaptive negative sampling to optimize negative sample generating. Our method further generates the integrated views for users and items based on relation-types to explicitly model users’ preferences and items’ features, respectively. Finally, we add virtual “recommendation” relations between the integrated views of users and items to model the preferences of users on items, seamlessly integrating RS with user-item KG over a unified graph. Experimental results on multiple datasets and benchmarks show that our method can achieve a better accuracy of recommendation compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. Complexity and runtime analysis suggests that our method can gain a lower time and space complexity than most of existing methods and improve scalability.}

	abstract = {The broad adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to vast amounts of data being accumulated on a patient’s history, diagnosis, prescriptions, and lab tests. Advances in recommender technologies have the potential to utilize this information to help doctors personalize the prescribed medications. However, existing medication recommendation systems have yet to make use of all these information sources in a seamless manner, and they do not provide a justification on why a particular medication is recommended. In this work, we design a two-stage personalized medication recommender system called PREMIER that incorporates information from the EHR. We utilize the various weights in the system to compute the contributions from the information sources for the recommended medications. Our system models the drug interaction from an external drug database and the drug co-occurrence from the EHR as graphs. Experiment results on MIMIC-III and a proprietary outpatient dataset show that PREMIER outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation systems while achieving the best tradeoff between accuracy and drug-drug interaction. Case studies demonstrate that the justifications provided by PREMIER are appropriate and aligned to clinical practices.}

In this article, we show that the upper bound of the normalized term frequency ( tf ) from the relevant documents is much smaller than the upper bound of the normalized  tf  from the whole collection. As a result, the existing models suffer from two major problems: (i) the domain mismatch causes data modeling error, (ii) since the outliers have very large magnitude and the retrieval models follow  tf  hypothesis, the combination of these two factors tends to overestimate the relevance score. In an attempt to address these problems, we propose novel weighted probabilistic models based on truncated distributions. We evaluate our models on a set of large document collections. Significant performance improvement over six existing probabilistic models is demonstrated.}

	abstract = {Venue categories used in location-based social networks often exhibit a hierarchical structure, together with the category sequences derived from users’ check-ins. The two data modalities provide a wealth of information for us to capture the semantic relationships between those categories. To understand the venue semantics, existing methods usually embed venue categories into low-dimensional spaces by modeling the linear context (i.e., the positional neighbors of the given category) in check-in sequences. However, the hierarchical structure of venue categories, which inherently encodes the relationships between categories, is largely untapped. In this article, we propose a venue  C ategory  E mbedding  M odel named  Hier-CEM , which generates a latent representation for each venue category by embedding the  Hier archical structure of categories and utilizing multiple types of context. Specifically, we investigate two kinds of hierarchical context based on any given venue category hierarchy and show how to model them together with the linear context collaboratively. We apply Hier-CEM to three tasks on two real check-in datasets collected from Foursquare. Experimental results show that Hier-CEM is better at capturing both semantic and sequential information inherent in venues than state-of-the-art embedding methods.}

	abstract = {Network-based information has been widely explored and exploited in the information retrieval literature. Attributed networks, consisting of nodes, edges as well as attributes describing properties of nodes, are a basic type of network-based data, and are especially useful for many applications. Examples include user profiling in social networks and item recommendation in user-item purchase networks. Learning useful and expressive representations of entities in attributed networks can provide more effective building blocks to down-stream network-based tasks such as link prediction and attribute inference. Practically, input features of attributed networks are normalized as unit directional vectors. However, most network embedding techniques ignore the  spherical  nature of inputs and focus on learning representations in a Gaussian or Euclidean space, which, we hypothesize, might lead to less effective representations. To obtain more effective representations of attributed networks, we investigate the problem of mapping an attributed network with unit normalized directional features into a non-Gaussian and non-Euclidean space. Specifically, we propose a hyperspherical variational co-embedding for attributed networks (HCAN), which is based on generalized variational auto-encoders for heterogeneous data with multiple types of entities. HCAN jointly learns latent embeddings for both nodes and attributes in a unified hyperspherical space such that the affinities between nodes and attributes can be captured effectively. We argue that this is a crucial feature in many real-world applications of attributed networks. Previous Gaussian network embedding algorithms break the assumption of uninformative prior, which leads to unstable results and poor performance. In contrast, HCAN embeds nodes and attributes as von Mises-Fisher distributions, and allows one to capture the uncertainty of the inferred representations. Experimental results on eight datasets show that HCAN yields better performance in a number of applications compared with nine state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Web page segmentation (WPS) aims to break a web page into different segments with coherent intra- and inter-semantics. By evidencing the morpho-dispositional semantics of a web page, WPS has traditionally been used to demarcate informative from non-informative content, but it has also evidenced its key role within the context of non-linear access to web information for visually impaired people. For that purpose, a great deal of ad hoc solutions have been proposed that rely on visual, logical, and/or text cues. However, such methodologies highly depend on manually tuned heuristics and are parameter-dependent. To overcome these drawbacks, principled frameworks have been proposed that provide the theoretical bases to achieve optimal solutions. However, existing methodologies only combine few discriminant features and do not define strategies to automatically select the optimal number of segments. In this article, we present a multi-objective clustering technique called MCS that relies on  𝐾 -means, in which (1) visual, logical, and text cues are all combined in a early fusion manner and (2) an evolutionary process automatically discovers the optimal number of clusters (segments) as well as the correct positioning of seeds. As such, our proposal is parameter-free, combines many different modalities, does not depend on manually tuned heuristics, and can be run on any web page without any constraint. An exhaustive evaluation over two different tasks, where (1) the number of segments must be discovered or (2) the number of clusters is fixed with respect to the task at hand, shows that MCS drastically improves over most competitive and up-to-date algorithms for a wide variety of external and internal validation indices. In particular, results clearly evidence the impact of the visual and logical modalities towards segmentation performance.}

Our approach is based on the hypothesis that some workers are more risk-inclined and tend to gamble with their use of time when put to compete with other workers. This hypothesis is supported by our previous simulation study. We test our approach with 35 topics from experiments on the TREC-8 collection being assessed as relevant or non-relevant by crowdsourced workers both in a competitive (referred to as “Game”) and non-competitive (referred to as “Base”) scenario. We find that competition changes the distributions of TCT, making them sensitive to the quality (i.e., wrong or right) and outcome (i.e., relevant or non-relevant) of the assessments. We also test an optimal function of TCT as weights in a weighted majority voting scheme. From probabilistic considerations, we derive a theoretical upper bound for the weighted majority performance of cohorts of 2, 3, 4, and 5 workers, which we use as a criterion to evaluate the performance of our weighting scheme. We find our approach achieves a remarkable performance, significantly closing the gap between the accuracy of the obtained relevance judgements and the upper bound. Since our approach takes advantage of TCT, which is an available quantity in any CS tasks, we believe it is cost-effective and, therefore, can be applied for quality assurance in crowdsourcing for micro-tasks.}

	abstract = {In many search scenarios, such as exploratory, comparative, or survey-oriented search, users interact with dynamic search systems to satisfy multi-aspect information needs. These systems utilize different dynamic approaches that exploit various user feedback granularity types. Although studies have provided insights about the role of many components of these systems, they used black-box and isolated experimental setups. Therefore, the effects of these components or their interactions are still not well understood. We address this by following a methodology based on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). We built a Grid Of Points that consists of systems based on different ways to instantiate three components: initial rankers, dynamic rerankers, and user feedback granularity. Using evaluation scores based on the TREC Dynamic Domain collections, we built several ANOVA models to estimate the effects. We found that (i) although all components significantly affect search effectiveness, the initial ranker has the largest effective size, (ii) the effect sizes of these components vary based on the length of the search session and the used effectiveness metric, and (iii) initial rankers and dynamic rerankers have more prominent effects than user feedback granularity. To improve effectiveness, we recommend improving the quality of initial rankers and dynamic rerankers. This does not require eliciting detailed user feedback, which might be expensive or invasive.}

	abstract = {In Information Retrieval, numerous retrieval models or document ranking functions have been developed in the quest for better retrieval effectiveness. Apart from some formal retrieval models formulated on a theoretical basis, various recent works have applied heuristic constraints to guide the derivation of document ranking functions. While many recent methods are shown to improve over established and successful models, comparison among these new methods under a common environment is often missing. To address this issue, we perform an extensive and up-to-date comparison of leading term-independence retrieval models implemented in our own retrieval system. Our study focuses on the following questions: (RQ1) Is there a retrieval model that consistently outperforms all other models across multiple collections; (RQ2) What are the important features of an effective document ranking function? Our retrieval experiments performed on several TREC test collections of a wide range of sizes (up to the terabyte-sized Clueweb09 Category B) enable us to answer these research questions. This work also serves as a reproducibility study for leading retrieval models. While our experiments show that no single retrieval model outperforms all others across all tested collections, some recent retrieval models, such as MATF and MVD, consistently perform better than the common baselines.}

	abstract = {Review based recommendation utilizes both users’ rating records and the associated reviews for recommendation. Recently, with the rapid demand for explanations of recommendation results, reviews are used to train the encoder–decoder models for explanation text generation. As most of the reviews are general text without detailed evaluation, some researchers leveraged auxiliary information of users or items to enrich the generated explanation text. Nevertheless, the auxiliary data is not available in most scenarios and may suffer from data privacy problems. In this article, we argue that the reviews contain abundant semantic information to express the users’ feelings for various aspects of items, while these information are not fully explored in current explanation text generation task. To this end, we study how to generate more fine-grained explanation text in review based recommendation without any auxiliary data. Though the idea is simple, it is non-trivial since the aspect is hidden and unlabeled. Besides, it is also very challenging to inject aspect information for generating explanation text with noisy review input. To solve these challenges, we first leverage an advanced unsupervised neural aspect extraction model to learn the aspect-aware representation of each review sentence. Thus, users and items can be represented in the aspect space based on their historical associated reviews. After that, we detail how to better predict ratings and generate explanation text with the user and item representations in the aspect space. We further dynamically assign review sentences which contain larger proportion of aspect words with larger weights to control the text generation process, and jointly optimize rating prediction accuracy and explanation text generation quality with a multi-task learning framework. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model for both recommendation accuracy and explainability.}

	abstract = {Content representation is a fundamental task in information retrieval. Representation learning is aimed at capturing features of an information object in a low-dimensional space. Most research on representation learning for heterogeneous information networks (HINs) focuses on static HINs. In practice, however, networks are dynamic and subject to constant change. In this article, we propose a novel and scalable representation learning model,  M-DHIN , to explore the evolution of a dynamic HIN. We regard a dynamic HIN as a series of snapshots with different time stamps. We first use a static embedding method to learn the initial embeddings of a dynamic HIN at the first time stamp. We describe the features of the initial HIN via metagraphs, which retains more structural and semantic information than traditional path-oriented static models. We also adopt a complex embedding scheme to better distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric metagraphs. Unlike traditional models that process an entire network at each time stamp, we build a so-called  change dataset  that only includes nodes involved in a triadic closure or opening process, as well as newly added or deleted nodes. Then, we utilize the above metagraph-based mechanism to train on the change dataset. As a result of this setup,  M-DHIN  is scalable to large dynamic HINs since it only needs to model the entire HIN once while only the changed parts need to be processed over time. Existing dynamic embedding models only express the existing snapshots and cannot predict the future network structure. To equip  M-DHIN  with this ability, we introduce an LSTM-based deep autoencoder model that processes the evolution of the graph via an LSTM encoder and outputs the predicted graph. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model,  M-DHIN , on real-life datasets and demonstrate that it significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.}

	abstract = {POI recommendation has become an essential means to help people discover attractive places. Intuitively, activities have an important impact on users’ decision-making, because users select POIs to attend corresponding activities. However, many existing studies ignore the social motivation of user behaviors and regard all check-ins as influenced only by individual user interests. As a result, they cannot model user preferences accurately, which degrades recommendation effectiveness. In this article, from the perspective of activities, this study proposes a probabilistic generative model called STARec. Specifically, based on the social effect of activities, STARec defines users’ social preferences as distinct from their individual interests and combines these with individual user activity interests to effectively depict user preferences. Moreover, the inconsistency between users’ social preferences and their decisions is modeled. An activity frequency feature is introduced to acquire accurate user social preferences because of close correlation between these and the key impact factor of corresponding check-ins. An alias sampling-based training method was used to accelerate training. Extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed STARec model achieves superior performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data sparsity, effectiveness in handling cold-start problems, efficiency, and interpretability.}

	abstract = {Multi-stage ranking pipelines have been a practical solution in modern search systems, where the first-stage retrieval is to return a subset of candidate documents and latter stages attempt to re-rank those candidates. Unlike re-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts over the past decades, the first-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models. Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which may block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning. Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future development. In this article, we describe the current landscape of the first-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the connection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic retrieval methods, and neural semantic retrieval methods. Moreover, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research on these important yet less investigated topics.}

	abstract = {Session-based recommendation aims to generate recommendations merely based on the ongoing session, which is a challenging task. Previous methods mainly focus on modeling the sequential signals or the transition relations between items in the current session using RNNs or GNNs to identify user’s intent for recommendation. Such models generally ignore the dynamic connections between the local and global item transition patterns, although the global information is taken into consideration by exploiting the global-level pair-wise item transitions. Moreover, existing methods that mainly adopt the cross-entropy loss with softmax generally face a serious over-fitting problem, harming the recommendation accuracy. Thus, in this article, we propose a Graph Co-Attentive Recommendation Machine (GCARM) for session-based recommendation. In detail, we first design a Graph Co-Attention Network (GCAT) to consider the dynamic correlations between the local and global neighbors of each node during the information propagation. Then, the item-level dynamic connections between the output of the local and global graphs are modeled to generate the final item representations. After that, we produce the prediction scores and design a Max Cross-Entropy (MCE) loss to prevent over-fitting. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Diginetica, Gowalla, and Yoochoose. The experimental results show that GCARM can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of Recall and MRR, especially on boosting the ranking of the target item.}

The burden of organizing and scheduling time for tasks continues to reside with users of these systems, despite the high cognitive load associated with these activities. Users stand to benefit greatly from a task management system capable of prioritizing their pending tasks, thus saving them time and effort. In this article, we make three main contributions. First, we propose the problem of task prioritization, formulating it as a ranking over a user’s pending tasks given a history of previous interactions with a task management system. Second, we perform an extensive analysis on the large-scale anonymized, de-identified logs of a popular task management application, deriving a dataset of grounded, real-world tasks from which to learn and evaluate our proposed system. We also identify patterns in how people record tasks as complete, which vary consistently with the nature of the task. Third, we propose a novel contextual deep learning solution capable of performing personalized task prioritization. In a battery of tests, we show that this approach outperforms several operational baselines and other sequential ranking models from previous work. Our findings have implications for understanding the ways people prioritize and manage tasks with digital tools, and in the design of support for users of task management applications.}

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for the representation learning of various structured graph data, typically through message passing among nodes by aggregating their neighborhood information via different operations. While promising, most existing GNNs oversimplify the complexity and diversity of the edges in the graph and thus are inefficient to cope with ubiquitous heterogeneous graphs, which are typically in the form of multi-relational graph representations. In this article, we propose  RioGNN , a novel Reinforced, recursive, and flexible neighborhood selection guided multi-relational Graph Neural Network architecture, to navigate complexity of neural network structures whilst maintaining relation-dependent representations. We first construct a multi-relational graph, according to the practical task, to reflect the heterogeneity of nodes, edges, attributes, and labels. To avoid the embedding over-assimilation among different types of nodes, we employ a label-aware neural similarity measure to ascertain the most similar neighbors based on node attributes. A reinforced relation-aware neighbor selection mechanism is developed to choose the most similar neighbors of a targeting node within a relation before aggregating all neighborhood information from different relations to obtain the eventual node embedding. Particularly, to improve the efficiency of neighbor selecting, we propose a new recursive and scalable reinforcement learning framework with estimable depth and width for different scales of multi-relational graphs.  RioGNN  can learn more discriminative node embedding with enhanced explainability due to the recognition of individual importance of each relation via the filtering threshold mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on real-world graph data and practical tasks demonstrate the advancements of effectiveness, efficiency, and the model explainability, as opposed to other comparative GNN models.}

	abstract = {As a major component of strategic talent management, learning and development (L&D) aims at improving the individual and organization performances through planning tailored training for employees to increase and improve their skills and knowledge. While many companies have developed the learning management systems (LMSs) for facilitating the online training of employees, a long-standing important issue is how to achieve personalized training recommendations with the consideration of their needs for future career development. To this end, in this article, we present a focused study on the explainable personalized online course recommender system for enhancing employee training and development. Specifically, we first propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical framework, namely Demand-aware Collaborative Bayesian Variational Network (DCBVN), to jointly model both the employees’ current competencies and their career development preferences in an explainable way. In DCBVN, we first extract the latent interpretable representations of the employees’ competencies from their skill profiles with autoencoding variational inference based topic modeling. Then, we develop an effective demand recognition mechanism for learning the personal demands of career development for employees. In particular, all the above processes are integrated into a unified Bayesian inference view for obtaining both accurate and explainable recommendations. Furthermore, for handling the employees with sparse or missing skill profiles, we develop an improved version of DCBVN, called the  Demand-aware Collaborative Competency Attentive Network (DCCAN) framework , by considering the connectivity among employees. In DCCAN, we first build two employee competency graphs from learning and working aspects. Then, we design a graph-attentive network and a multi-head integration mechanism to infer one’s competency information from her neighborhood employees. Finally, we can generate explainable recommendation results based on the competency representations. Extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and the interpretability of both of our frameworks, as well as their robustness on sparse and cold-start scenarios.}

However, the intermediate data generated in factorization models’  decision making process  (or  training process ,  footprint ) have been overlooked even though they may provide rich information to further improve recommendations. In this article, we introduce the concept of Convergence Pattern, which records how ratings are learned step-by-step in factorization models in the field of CF. We show that the concept of Convergence Patternexists in both the model perspective (e.g., classical  Matrix Factorization  ( MF ) and deep-learning factorization) and the training (learning) perspective (e.g.,  stochastic gradient descent  ( SGD ),  alternating least squares  ( ALS ), and  Markov Chain Monte Carlo  ( MCMC )). By utilizing the Convergence Pattern, we propose a prediction model to estimate the prediction reliability of missing ratings and then improve the quality of recommendations. Two applications have been investigated: (1) how to evaluate the reliability of predicted missing ratings and thus recommend those ratings with high reliability. (2) How to explore the estimated reliability to adjust the predicted ratings to further improve the predication accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several benchmark datasets on three recommendation tasks: decision-aware recommendation, rating predicted, and Top- N  recommendation. The experiment results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various aspects.}

	abstract = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) , which mainly relies on a user’s limited interactions with items to generate recommendations, is a widely investigated task. Existing methods often apply RNNs or GNNs to model user’s sequential behavior or transition relationship between items to capture her current preference. For training such models, the supervision signals are merely generated from the sequential interactions inside a session, neglecting the correlations of different sessions, which we argue can provide additional supervisions for learning the item representations. Moreover, previous methods mainly adopt the cross-entropy loss for training, where the user’s ground truth preference distribution towards items is regarded as a one-hot vector of the target item, easily making the network over-confident and leading to a serious overfitting problem. Thus, in this article, we propose a  Collaborative Graph Learning (CGL)  approach for session-based recommendation. CGL first applies the Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNNs) to learn item embeddings and then is trained by considering both the main supervision as well as the self-supervision signals simultaneously. The main supervisions are produced by the sequential order while the self-supervisions are derived from the global graph constructed by all sessions. In addition, to prevent overfitting, we propose a  Target-aware Label Confusion (TLC)  learning method in the main supervised component. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, i.e., Retailrocket, Diginetica, and Gowalla. The experimental results show that CGL can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Recall and MRR.}

Both solve the task of node classification, but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information. However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relationship between LPA and GCN has not yet been systematically investigated. Moreover, it is unclear how LPA and GCN can be combined under a unified framework to improve the performance. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of  feature/label influence , in which we characterize how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node in GCN/LPA. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that combines GCN and LPA. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved performance. Our model can also be seen as learning the weights of edges based on node labels, which is more direct and efficient than existing feature-based attention models or topology-based diffusion models. In a number of experiments for semi-supervised node classification and knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.}

We use the Recipe1M dataset for the technical description and empirical validation. In preprocessing, we perform deep feature engineering by combining deep feature engineering with semantic context features derived from raw text-image input data. We leverage LSTM to identify key terms, deep NLP models from the BERT family, TextRank, or TF-IDF to produce ranking scores for key terms before generating the vector representation for each key term by using Word2vec. We leverage Wide ResNet50 and Word2vec to extract and encode the image category semantics of food images to help semantic alignment of the learned recipe and image embeddings in the joint latent space. In joint embedding learning, we perform deep feature engineering by optimizing the batch-hard triplet loss function with soft-margin and double negative sampling, taking into account also the category-based alignment loss and discriminator-based alignment loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SEJE approach with deep feature engineering significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) enjoys the advantages of high recommendation accuracy and ease in online penalization and thus is favored by the industrial recommender systems. ICF recommends items to a target user based on their similarities to the previously interacted items of the user. Great progresses have been achieved for ICF in recent years by applying advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep neural networks) to learn the item similarity from data. The early methods simply treat all the historical items equally and recently proposed methods attempt to distinguish the different importance of historical items when recommending a target item. Despite the progress, we argue that those ICF models neglect the diverse intents of users on adopting items (e.g., watching a movie because of the director, leading actors, or the visual effects). As a result, they fail to estimate the item similarity on a finer-grained level to predict the user’s preference to an item, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose a general feature-level attention method for ICF models. The key of our method is to distinguish the importance of different factors when computing the item similarity for a prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we design a light attention neural network to integrate both item-level and feature-level attention for neural ICF models. It is model-agnostic and easy-to-implement. We apply it to two baseline ICF models and evaluate its effectiveness on six public datasets. Extensive experiments show the feature-level attention enhanced models consistently outperform their counterparts, demonstrating the potential of differentiating user intents on the feature-level for ICF recommendation models.}

	abstract = {In the context of depth- k  pooling for constructing web search test collections, we compare two approaches to ordering pooled documents for relevance assessors: The prioritisation strategy (PRI) used widely at NTCIR, and the simple randomisation strategy (RND). In order to address research questions regarding PRI and RND, we have constructed and released the WWW3E8 dataset, which contains eight independent relevance labels for 32,375 topic-document pairs, i.e., a total of 259,000 labels. Four of the eight relevance labels were obtained from PRI-based pools; the other four were obtained from RND-based pools. Using WWW3E8, we compare PRI and RND in terms of inter-assessor agreement, system ranking agreement, and robustness to new systems that did not contribute to the pools. We also utilise an assessor activity log we obtained as a byproduct of WWW3E8 to compare the two strategies in terms of assessment efficiency. Our main findings are: (a)\xa0The presentation order has no substantial impact on assessment efficiency; (b)\xa0While the presentation order substantially affects which documents are judged (highly) relevant, the difference between the inter-assessor agreement under the PRI condition and that under the RND condition is of no practical significance; (c)\xa0Different system rankings under the PRI condition are substantially more similar to one another than those under the RND condition; and (d)\xa0PRI-based relevance assessment files (qrels) are substantially and statistically significantly more robust to new systems than RND-based ones. Finding\xa0(d) suggests that PRI helps the assessors identify relevant documents that affect the evaluation of many existing systems, including those that did not contribute to the pools. Hence, if researchers need to evaluate their current IR systems using legacy IR test collections, we recommend the use of those constructed using the PRI approach unless they have a good reason to believe that their systems retrieve relevant documents that are vastly different from the pooled documents. While this robustness of PRI may also mean that the PRI-based pools are biased against future systems that retrieve highly novel relevant documents, one should note that there is no evidence that RND is any better in this respect.}

	abstract = {Search systems are often used to support learning-oriented goals. This trend has given rise to the “search-as-learning” movement, which proposes that search systems should be designed to support learning. To this end, an important research question is: How does a searcher’s  type  of learning objective (LO) influence their trajectory (or  pathway ) toward that objective? We report on a lab study (N = 36) in which participants gathered information to meet a specific type of LO. To characterize LOs  and pathways , we leveraged Anderson and Krathwohl’s (A&K’s) taxonomy\xa0[ 3 ]. A&K’s taxonomy situates LOs at the intersection of two orthogonal dimensions: (1)  cognitive process  (CP) (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create) and (2)  knowledge type  (factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge). Participants completed learning-oriented search tasks that varied along three CPs (apply, evaluate, and create) and three knowledge types (factual, conceptual, and procedural knowledge). A  pathway  is defined as a sequence of  learning instances  (e.g., subgoals) that were also each classified into cells from A&K’s taxonomy. Our study used a think-aloud protocol, and pathways were generated through a qualitative analysis of participants’ think-aloud comments and recorded screen activities. We investigate three research questions. First, in RQ1, we study the impact of the LO on pathway characteristics (e.g., pathway length). Second, in RQ2, we study the impact of the LO on the types of A&K cells traversed along the pathway. Third, in RQ3, we study common and uncommon  transitions  between A&K cells along pathways conditioned on the knowledge type of the objective. We discuss implications of our results for designing search systems to support learning.}

	abstract = {SimRank is an attractive link-based similarity measure used in fertile fields of Web search and sociometry. However, the existing deterministic method by Kusumoto et\xa0al.\xa0[ 24 ] for retrieving SimRank does not always produce high-quality similarity results, as it fails to accurately obtain diagonal correction matrix\xa0 D . Moreover, SimRank has a “connectivity trait” problem: increasing the number of paths between a pair of nodes would decrease its similarity score. The best-known remedy, SimRank++ [ 1 ], cannot completely fix this problem, since its score would still be zero if there are no common in-neighbors between two nodes. In this article, we study fast high-quality link-based similarity search on billion-scale graphs. (1) We first devise a “varied- D ” method to accurately compute SimRank in linear memory. We also aggregate duplicate computations, which reduces the time of [ 24 ] from quadratic to linear in the number of iterations. (2) We propose a novel “cosine-based” SimRank model to circumvent the “connectivity trait” problem. (3) To substantially speed up the partial-pairs “cosine-based” SimRank search on large graphs, we devise an efficient dimensionality reduction algorithm,  PSR # , with guaranteed accuracy. (4) We give mathematical insights to the semantic difference between SimRank and its variant, and correct an argument in [ 24 ] that “if  D  is replaced by a scaled identity matrix (1-Ɣ)I, their top-K rankings will not be affected much”. (5) We propose a novel method that can accurately convert from Li et\xa0al.\xa0 SimRank ~{S} to Jeh and Widom’s SimRank  S . (6) We propose  GSR # , a generalisation of our “cosine-based” SimRank model, to quantify pairwise similarities across two distinct graphs, unlike SimRank that would assess nodes across two graphs as completely dissimilar. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches in terms of high search quality, computational efficiency, accuracy, and scalability on billion-edge graphs.}

	abstract = {User-generated contents (UGC) in social media are the direct expression of users’ interests, preferences, and opinions. User behavior prediction based on UGC has increasingly been investigated in recent years. Compared to learning a person’s behavioral patterns in each social media site separately, jointly predicting user behavior in multiple social media sites and complementing each other (cross-site user behavior prediction) can be more accurate. However, cross-site user behavior prediction based on UGC is a challenging task due to the difficulty of cross-site data sampling, the complexity of UGC modeling, and uncertainty of knowledge sharing among different sites. For these problems, we propose a Cross-Site Multi-Task (CSMT) learning method to jointly predict user behavior in multiple social media sites. CSMT mainly derives from the hierarchical attention network and multi-task learning. Using this method, the UGC in each social media site can obtain fine-grained representations in terms of words, topics, posts, hashtags, and time slices as well as the relevances among them, and prediction tasks in different social media sites can be jointly implemented and complement each other. By utilizing two cross-site datasets sampled from Weibo, Douban, Facebook, and Twitter, we validate our method’s superiority on several classification metrics compared with existing related methods.}

We conduct an in situ study to understand information needs arising in a home cooking context as well as how they are verbally communicated to an assistant. A human experimenter plays this role in our study. Based on the transcriptions of utterances, we derive a detailed hierarchical taxonomy of diverse information needs occurring in this context, which require different levels of assistance to be solved. The taxonomy shows that needs can be communicated through different linguistic means and require different amounts of context to be understood. In a second contribution, we perform classification experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting the type of information need a user has during a dialogue using the turn provided. For this multi-label classification problem, we achieve average F1 measures of 40% using BERT-based models. We demonstrate with examples which types of needs are difficult to predict and show why, concluding that models need to include more context information in order to improve both information need classification and assistance to make such systems usable.}

	abstract = {In recent years, conversational agents have provided a natural and convenient access to useful information in people’s daily life, along with a broad and new research topic, conversational question answering (QA). On the shoulders of conversational QA, we study the conversational open-domain QA problem, where users’ information needs are presented in a conversation and exact answers are required to extract from the Web. Despite its significance and value, building an effective conversational open-domain QA system is non-trivial due to the following challenges: (1) precisely understand conversational questions based on the conversation context; (2) extract exact answers by capturing the answer dependency and transition flow in a conversation; and (3) deeply integrate question understanding and answer extraction. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an end-to-end Dynamic Graph Reasoning approach to Conversational open-domain QA (DGRCoQA for short). DGRCoQA comprises three components, i.e., a dynamic question interpreter (DQI), a graph reasoning enhanced retriever (GRR), and a typical Reader, where the first one is developed to understand and formulate conversational questions while the other two are responsible to extract an exact answer from the Web. In particular, DQI understands conversational questions by utilizing the QA context, sourcing from predicted answers returned by the Reader, to dynamically attend to the most relevant information in the conversation context. Afterwards, GRR attempts to capture the answer flow and select the most possible passage that contains the answer by reasoning answer paths over a dynamically constructed  context graph . Finally, the Reader, a reading comprehension model, predicts a text span from the selected passage as the answer. DGRCoQA demonstrates its strength in the extensive experiments conducted on a benchmark dataset. It significantly outperforms the existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.}

	abstract = {Relation extraction (RE), an important information extraction task, faced the great challenge brought by limited annotation data. To this end, distant supervision was proposed to automatically label RE data, and thus largely increased the number of annotated instances. Unfortunately, lots of noise relation annotations brought by automatic labeling become a new obstacle. Some recent studies have shown that the teacher-student framework of knowledge distillation can alleviate the interference of noise relation annotations via label softening. Nevertheless, we find that they still suffer from two problems:  propagation of inaccurate dark knowledge  and  constraint of a unified distillation temperature . In this article, we propose a simple and effective Multi-instance Dynamic Temperature Distillation (MiDTD) framework, which is model-agnostic and mainly involves two modules: multi-instance target fusion (MiTF) and dynamic temperature regulation (DTR). MiTF combines the teacher’s predictions for multiple sentences with the same entity pair to amend the inaccurate dark knowledge in each student’s target. DTR allocates alterable distillation temperatures to different training instances to enable the softness of most student’s targets to be regulated to a moderate range. In experiments, we construct three concrete MiDTD instantiations with BERT, PCNN, and BiLSTM-based RE models, and the distilled students significantly outperform their teachers and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.}

	abstract = {Language modeling is essential in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval related tasks. After the statistical language models, Quantum Language Model (QLM) has been proposed to unify both single words and compound terms in the same probability space without extending term space exponentially. Although QLM achieved good performance in ad hoc retrieval, it still has two major limitations: (1) QLM cannot make use of supervised information, mainly due to the iterative and non-differentiable estimation of the density matrix, which represents both queries and documents in QLM. (2) QLM assumes the exchangeability of words or word dependencies, neglecting the order or position information of words. This article aims to generalize QLM and make it applicable to more complicated matching tasks (e.g., Question Answering) beyond ad hoc retrieval. We propose a complex-valued neural network-based QLM solution called C-NNQLM to employ an end-to-end approach to build and train density matrices in a light-weight and differentiable manner, and it can therefore make use of external well-trained word vectors and supervised labels. Furthermore, C-NNQLM adopts complex-valued word vectors whose phase vectors can directly encode the order (or position) information of words. Note that complex numbers are also essential in the quantum theory. We show that the real-valued NNQLM (R-NNQLM) is a special case of C-NNQLM. The experimental results on the QA task show that both R-NNQLM and C-NNQLM achieve much better performance than the vanilla QLM, and C-NNQLM’s performance is on par with state-of-the-art neural network models. We also evaluate the proposed C-NNQLM on text classification and document retrieval tasks. The results on most datasets show that the C-NNQLM can outperform R-NNQLM, which demonstrates the usefulness of the complex representation for words and sentences in C-NNQLM.}

Many recent works and shared tasks in both natural language processing and information retrieval communities have focused on identifying the need to ask clarifying questions and methodologies of generating them. These works assume that asking a clarifying question is a safe alternative to retrieving results. As existing conversational search models are far from perfect, it is possible and common that they could retrieve/generate bad clarifying questions. Asking too many clarifying questions can also drain a user’s patience when the user prefers searching efficiency over correctness. Hence, these models can backfire and harm a user’s search experience due to these risks from asking clarifying questions. \xa0\xa0In this work, we propose a simulation framework to simulate the risk of asking questions in conversational search and further revise a risk-aware conversational search model to control the risk. We show the model’s robustness and effectiveness through extensive experiments on three conversational datasets — MSDialog, Ubuntu Dialog Corpus, and Opendialkg — in which we compare it with multiple baselines. We show that the risk-control module can work with two different re-ranker models and outperform all of the baselines in most of our experiments.}

In dialogue systems, researchers have explored driving a dialogue based on a plan, while in story generation, a storyline has also been proved to be useful. In this article, we address a new task—generating movie scripts based on a predefined narrative. As an early exploration, we study this problem in a “retrieval-based” setting. We propose a model (ScriptWriter-CPre) to select the best response (i.e., next script line) among the candidates that fit the context (i.e., previous script lines) as well as the given narrative. Our model can keep track of what in the narrative has been said and what is to be said. Besides, it can also predict which part of the narrative should be paid more attention to when selecting the next line of script. In our study, we find the narrative plays a different role than the context. Therefore, different mechanisms are designed for deal with them. Due to the unavailability of data for this new application, we construct a new large-scale data collection  GraphMovie  from a movie website where end-users can upload their narratives freely when watching a movie. This new dataset is made available publicly to facilitate other studies in text generation under the guideline. Experimental results on the dataset show that our proposed approach based on narratives significantly outperforms the baselines that simply use the narrative as a kind of context.}

	abstract = {Recently, Product Question Answering (PQA) on E-Commerce platforms has attracted increasing attention as it can act as an intelligent online shopping assistant and improve the customer shopping experience. Its key function, automatic answer generation for product-related questions, has been studied by aiming to generate content-preserving while question-related answers. However, an important characteristic of PQA, i.e., personalization, is neglected by existing methods. It is insufficient to provide the same “completely summarized” answer to all customers, since many customers are more willing to see personalized answers with customized information only for themselves, by taking into consideration their own preferences toward product aspects or information needs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Personalized Answer GEneration method with multi-perspective preference modeling, which explores historical user-generated contents to model user preference for generating personalized answers in PQA. Specifically, we first retrieve question-related user history as external knowledge to model knowledge-level user preference. Then, we leverage the Gaussian Softmax distribution model to capture latent aspect-level user preference. Finally, we develop a persona-aware pointer network to generate personalized answers in terms of both content and style by utilizing personal user preference and dynamic user vocabulary. Experimental results on real-world E-Commerce QA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by generating informative and customized answers and show that answer generation in E-Commerce can benefit from personalization.}

	abstract = {As the popularity of Location-based Social Networks increases, designing accurate models for Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation receives more attention. POI recommendation is often performed by incorporating contextual information into previously designed recommendation algorithms. Some of the major contextual information that has been considered in POI recommendation are the location attributes (i.e., exact coordinates of a location, category, and check-in time), the user attributes (i.e., comments, reviews, tips, and check-in made to the locations), and other information, such as the distance of the POI from user’s main activity location and the social tie between users. The right selection of such factors can significantly impact the performance of the POI recommendation. However, previous research does not consider the impact of the combination of these different factors. In this article, we propose different contextual models and analyze the fusion of different major contextual information in POI recommendation. The major contributions of this article are as follows: (i) providing an extensive survey of context-aware location recommendation; (ii) quantifying and analyzing the impact of different contextual information (e.g., social, temporal, spatial, and categorical) in the POI recommendation on available baselines and two new linear and non-linear models, which can incorporate all the major contextual information into a single recommendation model; and (iii) evaluating the considered models using two well-known real-world datasets. Our results indicate that while modeling geographical and temporal influences can improve recommendation quality, fusing all other contextual information into a recommendation model is not always the best strategy.}
