	abstract = {Contextual path retrieval  (CPR) refers to the task of finding contextual path(s) between a pair of entities in a knowledge graph that explains the connection between them in a given context. For this novel retrieval task, we propose the Embedding-based Contextual Path Retrieval (ECPR) framework. ECPR is based on a three-component structure that includes a context encoder and path encoder that encode query context and path, respectively, and a path ranker that assigns a ranking score to each candidate path to determine the one that should be the contextual path. For context encoding, we propose two novel context encoding methods, i.e., context-fused entity embeddings and contextualized embeddings. For path encoding, we propose PathVAE, an inductive embedding approach to generate path representations. Finally, we explore two path-ranking approaches. In our evaluation, we construct a synthetic dataset from Wikipedia and two real datasets of Wikinews articles constructed through crowdsourcing. Our experiments show that methods based on ECPR framework outperform baseline methods, and that our two proposed context encoders yield significantly better performance than baselines. We also analyze a few case studies to show the distinct features of ECPR-based methods.}

	abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the importance of mixed-initiative interactions in conversational search. To enable mixed-initiative interactions, information retrieval systems should be able to ask diverse questions, such as information-seeking, clarification, and open-ended ones.  question generation (QG)  of open-domain conversational systems aims at enhancing the interactiveness and persistence of human-machine interactions. The task is challenging because of the sparsity of question generation (QG)-specific data in conversations. Current work is limited to single-turn interaction scenarios. We propose a  context-enhanced neural question generation (CNQG)  model that leverages the conversational context to predict question content and pattern, then perform question decoding. A hierarchical encoder framework is employed to obtain the discourse-level context representation. Based on this, we propose  Review  and  Transit  mechanisms to respectively select contextual keywords and predict new topic words to further construct the question content. Conversational context and the predicted question content are used to produce the question pattern, which in turn guides the question decoding process implemented by a recurrent decoder with a joint attention mechanism. To fully utilize the limited QG-specific data to train our question generator, we perform multi-task learning with three auxiliary training objectives, i.e., question pattern prediction,  Review , and  Transit  mechanisms. The required additional labeled data is obtained in a self-supervised way. We also design a weight decaying strategy to adjust the influences of various auxiliary learning tasks. To the best of our acknowledge, we are the first to extend the application of QG to the multi-turn open-domain conversational scenario. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal and its main components on generating relevant and informative questions, with robust performance for contexts with various lengths.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid accumulation of massive electronic medical records, which highly support intelligent medical services such as drug recommendation. However, although there are multiple interaction types between drugs, e.g., synergism and antagonism, which can influence the effect of a drug package significantly, prior arts generally neglect the interaction between drugs or consider only a single type of interaction. Moreover, most existing studies generally formulate the problem of package recommendation as getting a personalized scoring function for users, despite the limits of discriminative models to achieve satisfactory performance in practical applications. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Drug Package Generation (DPG) framework, which develops a new generative model for drug package recommendation that considers the interaction effects between drugs that are affected by patient conditions. Specifically, we propose to formulate the drug package generation as a sequence generation process. Along this line, we first initialize the drug interaction graph based on medical records and domain knowledge. Then, we design a novel message-passing neural network to capture the drug interaction, as well as a drug package generator based on a recurrent neural network. In detail, a mask layer is utilized to capture the impact of patient condition, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is leveraged to reduce the dependence on the drug order. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from a first-rate hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPG framework compared with several competitive baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) into recommender systems to provide explainable recommendation has attracted much attention recently. The multi-hop paths in KGs can provide auxiliary facts for improving recommendation performance as well as explainability. However, existing studies may suffer from two major challenges: error propagation and weak explainability. Considering all paths between every user-item pair might involve irrelevant ones, which leads to error propagation of user preferences. Defining meta-paths might alleviate the error propagation, but the recommendation performance would heavily depend on the pre-defined meta-paths. Some recent methods based on graph convolution network (GCN) achieve better recommendation performance, but fail to provide explainability. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel method named  K nowledge-aware  R easoning with  G raph  C onvolution  N etwork (KR-GCN). Specifically, to alleviate the effect of error propagation, we design a transition-based method to determine the triple-level scores and utilize nucleus sampling to select triples within the paths between every user-item pair adaptively. To improve the recommendation performance and guarantee the diversity of explanations, user-item interactions and knowledge graphs are integrated into a heterogeneous graph, which is performed with the graph convolution network. A path-level self-attention mechanism is adopted to discriminate the contributions of different selected paths and predict the interaction probability, which improves the relevance of the final explanation. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that KR-GCN consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. And human evaluation proves the superiority of KR-GCN on explainability.}

	abstract = {Result ranking is one of the major concerns for Web search technologies. Most existing methodologies rank search results in descending order of relevance. To model the interactions among search results, reinforcement learning (RL algorithms have been widely adopted for ranking tasks. However, the online training of RL methods is time and resource consuming at scale. As an alternative, learning ranking policies in the simulation environment is much more feasible and efficient. In this article, we propose two different simulation environments for the offline training of the RL ranking agent: the Context-aware Click Simulator (CCS) and the Fine-grained User Behavior Simulator with GAN (UserGAN). Based on the simulation environment, we also design a User Behavior Simulation for Reinforcement Learning (UBS4RL) re-ranking framework, which consists of three modules: a feature extractor for heterogeneous search results, a user simulator for collecting simulated user feedback, and a ranking agent for generation of optimized result lists. Extensive experiments on both simulated and practical Web search datasets show that (1) the proposed user simulators can capture and simulate fine-grained user behavior patterns by training on large-scale search logs, (2) the temporal information of user searching process is a strong signal for ranking evaluation, and (3) learning ranking policies from the simulation environment can effectively improve the search ranking performance.}

	abstract = {The sequential recommendation (also known as the next-item recommendation), which aims to predict the following item to recommend in a session according to users’ historical behavior, plays a critical role in improving session-based recommender systems. Most of the existing deep learning-based approaches utilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model the sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical behavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these methods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users’ dynamic states from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items over time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item interactions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and items, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential recommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to model user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new recommendation approach based on a  Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph Convolutional Network (PTGCN)  for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models the sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by defining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and learning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the bipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the high-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph convolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different sizes compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results indicate that PTGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models in terms of two commonly-used evaluation metrics for ranking. In particular, it can make a better trade-off between recommendation performance and model training efficiency, which holds great potential for online session-based recommendation scenarios in the future.}

Most existing approaches focus on extracting query-related sentences to construct a summary, where the logical connection of natural language and the hierarchical interpretable semantic association are often neglected, thus degrading performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel question-driven abstractive answer summarization model, called the  H ierarchical  S liding  I nference  G enerator (HSIG), to form inferable and interpretable summaries by explicitly introducing hierarchical information reasoning between questions and corresponding answers. Specifically, we first apply an elaborately designed hierarchical sliding fusion inference model to determine the most relevant question sentence-level representation that provides a deeper interpretable basis for sentence selection in summarization, which further increases computational performance on the premise of following the semantic inheritance structure. Additionally, to improve summary fluency, we construct a double-driven selective generator to integrate various semantic information from two mutual question-and-answer perspectives. Experimental results illustrate that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our model achieves remarkable improvement on two benchmark datasets and specifically improves the 2.46 ROUGE-1 points on PubMedQA, which demonstrates the superiority of our model on abstractive summarization with hierarchical sequential reasoning.}

	abstract = {We focus on Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), which is an essential problem in many machine learning communities. Given a query, MIPS finds the most similar items with the maximum inner products. Methods for Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) which is usually defined on metric space do not exhibit the satisfactory performance for MIPS problem since inner product is a non-metric function. However, inner products exhibit many good properties compared with metric functions, such as avoiding vanishing and exploding gradients. As a result, inner product is widely used in many recommendation systems, which makes efficient Maximum Inner Product Search a key for speeding up many recommendation systems. Graph-based methods for NNS problem show the superiorities compared with other class methods. Each data point of the database is mapped to a node of the proximity graph. Nearest neighbor search in the database can be converted to route on the proximity graph to find the nearest neighbor for the query. This technique can be used to solve MIPS problem. Instead of searching the nearest neighbor for the query, we search the item with a maximum inner product with query on the proximity graph. In this article, we propose a reinforcement model to train an agent to search on the proximity graph automatically for MIPS problem if we lack the ground truths of training queries. If we know the ground truths of some training queries, our model can also utilize these ground truths by imitation learning to improve the agent’s searchability. By experiments, we can see that our proposed mode which combines reinforcement learning with imitation learning shows the superiorities over the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Today, timestamped web documents related to a general news query flood the Internet, and timeline summarization targets this concisely by summarizing the evolution trajectory of events along the timeline. Unlike traditional document summarization, timeline summarization needs to model the time series information of the input events and summarize important events in chronological order. To tackle this challenge, in this article we propose our Unified Timeline Summarizer, which can generate abstractive and extractive timeline summaries in time order. Concretely, in the encoder part, we propose a graph-based event encoder that relates multiple events according to their content dependency and learns a global representation of each event. In the decoder part, to ensure the chronological order of the abstractive summary, we propose to extract the feature of event-level attention in its generation process with sequential information retained and use it to simulate the evolutionary attention of the ground truth summary. The event-level attention can also be used to assist in extracting a summary, where the extracted summary also comes in time sequence. We augment the previous Chinese large-scale timeline summarization dataset and collect a new English timeline dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on these datasets and on the out-of-domain Timeline 17 dataset show that our Unified Timeline Summarizer achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both automatic and human evaluations.}

	abstract = {Relation ties, defined as the correlation and mutual exclusion between different relations, are critical for distant supervised relation extraction. Previous studies usually obtain this property by greedily learning the local connections between relations. However, they are essentially limited because of failing to capture the global topology structure of relation ties and may easily fall into a locally optimal solution. To address this issue, we propose a novel force-directed graph to comprehensively learn relation ties. Specifically, we first construct a graph according to the global co-occurrence of all relations. Then, we borrow the idea of Coulomb’s law from physics and introduce the concept of attractive force and repulsive force into this graph to learn correlation and mutual exclusion between relations. Finally, the obtained relation representations are applied as an inter-dependent relation classifier. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of modeling global correlation and mutual exclusion between relations, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, the proposed force-directed graph can be used as a module to augment existing relation extraction systems and improve their performance.}

	abstract = {Sequential recommendation has become a trending research topic for its capability to capture dynamic user intents based on historical interaction sequence. To train a sequential recommendation model, it is a common practice to optimize the next-item recommendation task with a pairwise ranking loss. In this paper, we revisit this typical training method from the perspective of contrastive learning and find it can be taken as a specialized contrastive learning task conceptually and mathematically, named  context-target contrast . Further, to leverage other self-supervised signals in user interaction sequences, we propose another contrastive learning task to encourage sequences after augmentation, as well as sequences with the same target item, to have similar representations, called  context-context contrast . A general framework, ContraRec, is designed to unify the two kinds of contrast signals, leading to a holistic joint-learning framework for sequential recommendation with different contrastive learning tasks. Besides, various sequential recommendation methods (e.g., GRU4Rec, Caser, and BERT4Rec) can be easily integrated as the base sequence encoder in our ContraRec framework. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that ContraRec achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.}

	abstract = {Recommendation systems play an important role in alleviating the information overload issue. Generally, a recommendation model is trained to discern between positive (liked) and negative (disliked) instances for each user. However, under the open-world assumption, there are only positive instances but no negative instances from users’ implicit feedback, which poses the imbalanced learning challenge of lacking negative samples. To address this, two types of learning strategies have been proposed before, the negative sampling strategy and non-sampling strategy. The first strategy samples negative instances from missing data (i.e., unlabeled data), while the non-sampling strategy regards all the missing data as negative. Although learning strategies are known to be essential for algorithm performance, the in-depth comparison of negative sampling and non-sampling has not been sufficiently explored by far. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze the role of negative sampling and non-sampling for implicit recommendation in this work. Specifically, we first theoretically revisit the objection of negative sampling and non-sampling. Then, with a careful setup of various representative recommendation methods, we explore the performance of negative sampling and non-sampling in different scenarios. Our results empirically show that although negative sampling has been widely applied to recent recommendation models, it is non-trivial for uniform sampling methods to show comparable performance to non-sampling learning methods. Finally, we discuss the scalability and complexity of negative sampling and non-sampling and present some open problems and future research topics that are worth being further explored.}

	abstract = {Mobile devices have become an increasingly ubiquitous part of our everyday life. We use mobile services to perform a broad range of tasks (e.g.,\xa0booking travel or conducting remote office work), leading to often lengthy interactions with several distinct apps and services. Existing mobile systems handle mostly simple user needs, where a single app is taken as the unit of interaction. To understand users’ expectations and to provide context-aware services, it is important to model users’ interactions with their performed task in mind. To provide a comprehensive picture of common mobile tasks, we first conduct a small-scale user study to understand annotated mobile tasks in-depth, while we demonstrate that by using a set of features (temporal, similarity, and log sequence), we can identify if a pair of app usage belong to the same task effectively. Secondly, the proposed best task detection model is applied to a large-scale data set of commercial mobile app usage logs to infer characteristics of complex (multi-app) mobile tasks in the wild. By applying an unsupervised learning framework, we discover common mobile task types that span multiple apps based on various extracted characteristics. We observe that users generally perform 17 common tasks with 47 sub-tasks, ranging from “social media browsing” to “dining out” and “family entertainments”. Finally, we demonstrate that we can predict the next complex mobile task that users are likely to perform by leveraging features from the historically inferred mobile tasks and user contexts. Our work facilitates an in-depth understanding of mobile tasks at scale, enabling applications for promoting task-aware services.}

	abstract = {Cross domain recommendation (CDR) is one popular research topic in recommender systems. This article focuses on a popular scenario for CDR where different domains share the same set of users but no overlapping items. The majority of recent methods have explored the shared-user representation to transfer knowledge across domains. However, the idea of shared-user representation resorts to learning the overlapped features of user preferences and suppresses the domain-specific features. Other works try to capture the domain-specific features by an MLP mapping but require heuristic human knowledge of choosing samples to train the mapping. In this article, we attempt to learn both features of user preferences in a more principled way. We assume that each user’s preferences in one domain can be expressed by the other one, and these preferences can be mutually converted to each other with the so-called equivalent transformation. Based on this assumption, we propose an equivalent transformation learner (ETL), which models the joint distribution of user behaviors across domains. The equivalent transformation in ETL relaxes the idea of shared-user representation and allows the learned preferences in different domains to preserve the domain-specific features as well as the overlapped features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ETL compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.

	abstract = {Recently, research on open domain dialogue systems have attracted extensive interests of academic and industrial researchers. The goal of an open domain dialogue system is to imitate humans in conversations. Previous works on single turn conversation generation have greatly promoted the research of open domain dialogue systems. However, understanding multiple single turn conversations is not equal to the understanding of multi turn dialogue due to the coherent and context dependent properties of human dialogue. Therefore, in open domain multi turn dialogue generation, it is essential to modeling the contextual semantics of the dialogue history rather than only according to the last utterance. Previous research had verified the effectiveness of the hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder framework on open domain multi turn dialogue generation. However, using an RNN-based model to hierarchically encoding the utterances to obtain the representation of dialogue history still face the problem of a vanishing gradient. To address this issue, in this article, we proposed a static and dynamic attention-based approach to model the dialogue history and then generate open domain multi turn dialogue responses. Experimental results on the Ubuntu and Opensubtitles datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed static and dynamic attention-based approach on automatic and human evaluation metrics in various experimental settings. Meanwhile, we also empirically verify the performance of combining the static and dynamic attentions on open domain multi turn dialogue generation.}

Yet, understanding the extent of the effect of CQs on user behavior and the ability to identify relevant information remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we conduct a large user study to understand the interaction of users with CQs in various quality categories, and the effect of CQ quality on user search performance in terms of finding relevant information, search behavior, and user satisfaction. Analysis of implicit interaction data and explicit user feedback demonstrates that high-quality CQs improve user performance and satisfaction. By contrast, low- and mid-quality CQs are harmful, and thus allowing the users to complete their tasks without CQ support may be preferred in this case. We also observe that user engagement, and therefore the need for CQ support, is affected by several factors, such as search result quality or perceived task difficulty. The findings of this study can help researchers and system designers realize why, when, and how users interact with CQs, leading to a better understanding and design of search clarification systems.}

	abstract = {Medicine recommendation systems target to recommend a set of medicines given a set of symptoms which play a crucial role in assisting doctors in their daily clinics. Existing approaches are either rule-based or supervised. However, the former heavily relies on expert labeling, which is time-consuming and costly to collect, and the latter suffers from the data sparse problem. To automate medicine recommendation on sparse data, we propose MedRec, which introduces two graphs in modeling: (1) a knowledge graph connecting diseases, medicines, symptoms, and examinations; (2) an attribute graph connecting medicines via shared attributes and molecular structures. These two graphs enhance the connectivity between symptoms and medicines, which thus alleviate the data sparse problem. By learning the interrelationship between diseases, medicines, symptoms and examinations and the inner relationship within medicine, we can acquire unified embedding representations of symptoms and medicines which can be used in medicine recommendation. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we find that these two tasks: learning graph representation and medical recommendation can benefit each other.}

	abstract = {While current systems are effective in helping searchers resolve simple information needs (e.g., fact-finding), they provide less support for searchers working on complex information-seeking tasks. Complex search tasks involve a wide range of (meta)cognitive activities, including goal-setting, organizing information, drawing inferences, monitoring progress, and revising mental models and search strategies. We report on a lab study ( N  = 32) that investigated the influences of a  knowledge representation  tool called the OrgBox, developed to support searchers with complex tasks. The OrgBox tool was integrated into a custom-built search system and allowed study participants to drag-and-drop textual passages into the tool, organize passages into logical groupings called “boxes”, and make notes on passages and boxes. The OrgBox was compared to a baseline tool (called the Bookmark) that allowed participants to save textual passages, but not organize them nor make notes. Knowledge representation tools such as the OrgBox may provide special benefits for users with different cognitive profiles. In this article, we explore two cognitive abilities: (1) working memory (WM) capacity and (2) switching (SW) ability. Participants in the study were asked to gather information on a complex subject and produce an outline for a hypothetical research article. We investigate the influences of the tool (OrgBox vs. Bookmark) and the participant’s working memory capacity and switching ability on three types of outcomes: (RQ1) search behaviors, (RQ2) post-task perceptions, and (RQ3) the quality of outlines produces by participants.}

	abstract = {To characterize complex and heterogeneous side information in recommender systems, the heterogeneous information network (HIN) has shown superior performance and attracted much research attention. In HIN, the rich entities, relations, and paths can be utilized to model the correlations of users and items; such a task setting is often called  HIN-based recommendation . Although HIN provides a general approach to modeling rich side information, it lacks special consideration on the goal of the recommendation task. The aggregated context from the heterogeneous graph is likely to incorporate irrelevant information, and the learned representations are not specifically optimized according to the recommendation task. Therefore, there is a need to rethink how to leverage the useful information from HIN to accomplish the recommendation task. To address the above issues, we propose a Curriculum pre-training based HEterogeneous Subgraph Transformer (called  CHEST ) with new  data characterization ,  representation model,  and  learning algorithm . Specifically, we consider extracting useful information from HIN to compose the interaction-specific heterogeneous subgraph, containing highly relevant context information for recommendation. Then, we capture the rich semantics (e.g., graph structure and path semantics) within the subgraph via a heterogeneous subgraph Transformer, where we encode the subgraph into multi-slot sequence representations. Besides, we design a curriculum pre-training strategy to provide an elementary-to-advanced learning process. The elementary course focuses on capturing local context information within the subgraph, and the advanced course aims to learn global context information. In this way, we gradually capture useful semantic information from HIN for modeling user-item interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over a number of competitive baselines, especially when only limited training data is available.}

	abstract = {Event extraction is an essential task in natural language processing. Although extensively studied, existing work shares issues in three aspects, including (1) the limitations of using original syntactic dependency structure, (2) insufficient consideration of the node level and type information in Graph Attention Network (GAT), and (3) insufficient joint exploitation of the node dependency type and part-of-speech (POS) encoding on the graph structure. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for open event extraction in documents. Specifically, to obtain an enhanced dependency structure with powerful encoding ability, our model is capable of handling an enriched parallel structure with connected ellipsis nodes. Moreover, through a bidirectional dependency parsing graph, it considers the sequence of order structure and associates the ancestor and descendant nodes. Subsequently, we further exploit node information, such as the node level and type, to strengthen the aggregation of node features in our GAT. Finally, based on the coordination of triple-channel features (i.e., semantic, syntactic dependency and POS), the performance of event extraction is significantly improved. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method, and the results confirm its superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, in-depth analyses are provided to explore the essential factors determining the extraction performance.}

	abstract = {Recent studies show that historical behaviors (such as queries and their clicks) contained in a search session can benefit the ranking performance of subsequent queries in the session. Existing neural context-aware ranking models usually rank documents based on either latent representations of user search behaviors or the word-level interactions between the candidate document and each historical behavior in the search session. However, these two kinds of models both have their own drawbacks. Representation-based models neglect fine-grained information on word-level interactions, whereas interaction-based models suffer from the length restriction of session sequence because of the large cost of word-level interactions. To complement the limitations of these two kinds of models, we propose a unified context-aware document ranking model that takes full advantage of both representation and interaction. Specifically, instead of matching a candidate document with every single historical query in a session, we encode the session history into a latent representation and use this representation to enhance the current query and the candidate document. We then just match the enhanced query and candidate document with several matching components to capture the fine-grained information of word-level interactions. Rich experiments on two public query logs prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our model for leveraging representation and interaction.}

However, in practice, the aspect categories are changing rather than keeping fixed over time. Dealing with unseen aspect categories is under-explored in existing methods. In this article, we formulate a new few-shot aspect category sentiment analysis (FSACSA) task, which aims to effectively predict the sentiment polarity of previously unseen aspect categories. To this end, we propose a novel Aspect-Focused Meta-Learning (AFML) framework that constructs aspect-aware and aspect-contrastive representations from external knowledge to match the target aspect with aspects in the training set. Concretely, we first construct two auxiliary contrastive sentences for a given sentence with the incorporation of external knowledge, enabling the learning of sentence representations with a better generalization. Then, we devise an aspect-focused induction network to leverage the contextual sentiment toward a given aspect to refine the label vectors. Furthermore, we employ the episode-based meta-learning algorithm to train the whole network, so as to learn to generalize to novel aspects. Extensive experiments on multiple real-life datasets show that our proposed AFML framework achieves the state-of-the-art results for the FSACSA task.}

	abstract = {Online games make up the largest segment of the booming global game market in terms of revenue as well as players. Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Our work has been implemented and deployed in many online games released from NetEase Games. Online A/B testing in production shows that perCLTV achieves a prominent improvement in two precision marketing applications of popup recommendation and churn intervention.}

	abstract = {We propose a simple model of an idealized online cultural market in which  N  items, endowed with a hidden quality metric, are recommended to users by a ranking algorithm possibly biased by the current items’ popularity. Our goal is to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the well-known fact that popularity bias can prevent higher-quality items from becoming more popular than lower-quality items, producing an undesirable misalignment between quality and popularity rankings. We do so under the assumption that users, having limited time/attention, are able to discriminate the best-quality only within a random subset of the items. We discover the existence of a harmful regime in which improper use of popularity can seriously compromise the emergence of quality, and a benign regime in which wise use of popularity, coupled with a small discrimination effort on behalf of users, guarantees the perfect alignment of quality and popularity ranking. Our findings clarify the effects of algorithmic popularity bias on quality outcomes, and may inform the design of more principled mechanisms for techno-social cultural markets.}

	abstract = {Reasoning on knowledge graph (KG) has been studied for explainable recommendation due to its ability of providing explicit explanations. However, current KG-based explainable recommendation methods unfortunately ignore the temporal information (such as purchase time, recommend time, etc.), which may result in unsuitable explanations. In this work, we propose a novel  Time-aware Path reasoning for Recommendation  (TPRec for short) method, which leverages the potential of temporal information to offer better recommendation with plausible explanations. First, we present an efficient time-aware interaction relation extraction component to construct collaborative knowledge graph with time-aware interactions (TCKG for short), and then we introduce a novel time-aware path reasoning method for recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed TPRec could successfully employ TCKG to achieve substantial gains and improve the quality of explainable recommendation.}

	abstract = {Information extraction aims at extracting entities, relations, and so on, in text to support information retrieval systems. To extract information, researchers have considered multitask learning (ML) approaches. The conventional ML approach learns shared features across tasks, with the assumption that these features capture sufficient task interactions to learn expressive shared representations for task classification. However, such an assumption is flawed in different perspectives. First, the shared representation may contain noise introduced by another task; tasks coupled for multitask learning may have different complexities but this approach treats all tasks equally; the conventional approach has a flat structure that hinders the learning of explicit interactions. This approach, however, learns implicit interactions across tasks and often has a generalization ability that has benefited the learning of multitasks. In this article, we take advantage of implicit interactions learned by conventional approaches while alleviating the issues mentioned above by developing a Recurrent Interaction Network with an effective Early Prediction Integration (RIN-EPI) for multitask learning. Specifically, RIN-EPI learns implicit and explicit interactions across two different but related tasks. To effectively learn explicit interactions across tasks, we consider the correlations among the outputs of related tasks. It is, however, obvious that task outputs are unobservable during training, so we leverage the predictions at intermediate layers (referred to as early predictions) as proxies as well as shared features across tasks to learn explicit interactions through attention mechanisms and sequence learning models. By recurrently learning explicit interactions, we gradually improve predictions for the individual tasks in the multitask learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIN-EPI on the learning of two mainstream multitasks for information extraction: (1) entity recognition and relation classification and (2) aspect and opinion term co-extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RIN-EPI architecture, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.}

	abstract = {Each link prediction task requires different degrees of answer diversity. While a link prediction task may expect up to a couple of answers, another may expect nearly a hundred answers. Given this fact, the performance of a link prediction model can be estimated more accurately if a flexible number of obtained answers are estimated instead of a predefined number of answers. Inspired by this, in this article, we analyze two evaluation criteria for link prediction tasks, respectively ranking-based protocol and sampling-based protocol. Furthermore, we study two classes of models on link prediction task, direct model and latent-variable model respectively, to demonstrate that latent-variable model performs better under the sampling-based protocol. We then propose a latent-variable model where the framework of Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) is applied. Experimental study suggests that the proposed model performs comparably to the current state-of-the-art even under the conventional rank-based protocol. Under the sampling-based protocol, the proposed model is shown to outperform various state-of-the-art models.}

	abstract = {Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the information retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to developing effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new data. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike the effectiveness, which is about the average performance of a system under normal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst case or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into the real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in average, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So, we raise the question in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this question, first, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the robustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a multi-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: (1) the  performance variance  under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) setting; (2) the  out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability ; and (3) the  defensive ability  against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions can be further specified into two different perspectives, respectively, leading to five robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding benchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze the robustness of several representative neural ranking models against traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The empirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While neural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases, some of them can still win two out of five tasks. This is the first comprehensive study on the robustness of neural ranking models. We believe the way we study the robustness as well as our findings would be beneficial to the IR community. We will also release all the data and codes to facilitate the future research in this direction.}

	abstract = {In most E-commerce platforms, whether the displayed items trigger the user’s interest largely depends on their most eye-catching multimodal content. Consequently, increasing efforts focus on modeling multimodal user preference, and the pressing paradigm is to incorporate complete multimodal deep features of the items into the recommendation module. However, the existing studies  ignore the mismatch problem between multimodal feature extraction (MFE) and user interest modeling (UIM) . That is, MFE and UIM have different emphases. Specifically, MFE is migrated from and adapted to upstream tasks such as image classification. In addition, it is mainly a content-oriented and non-personalized process, while UIM, with its greater focus on understanding user interaction, is essentially a user-oriented and personalized process. Therefore, the direct incorporation of MFE into UIM for purely user-oriented tasks, tends to introduce a large number of preference-independent multimodal noise and contaminate the embedding representations in UIM. This paper aims at solving the mismatch problem between MFE and UIM, so as to generate high-quality embedding representations and better model multimodal user preferences. Towards this end, we develop a novel model,  m ultimodal  e ntity  g raph  c ollaborative  f iltering, short for MEGCF. The UIM of the proposed model captures the semantic correlation between interactions and the features obtained from MFE, thus making a better match between MFE and UIM. More precisely, semantic-rich entities are first extracted from the multimodal data, since they are more relevant to user preferences than other multimodal information. These entities are then integrated into the user-item interaction graph. Afterwards, a symmetric linear  Graph Convolution Network (GCN)  module is constructed to perform message propagation over the graph, in order to capture both high-order semantic correlation and collaborative filtering signals. Finally, the sentiment information from the review data are used to fine-grainedly weight neighbor aggregation in the GCN, as it reflects the overall quality of the items, and therefore it is an important modality information related to user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of MEGCF.}

	abstract = {The cold-start issue is a fundamental challenge in Recommender Systems. The recent self-supervised learning (SSL) on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model, PT-GNN, pre-trains the GNN model to reconstruct the cold-start embeddings and has shown great potential for cold-start recommendation. However, due to the over-smoothing problem, PT-GNN can only capture up to 3-order relation, which cannot provide much useful auxiliary information to depict the target cold-start user or item. Besides, the embedding reconstruction task only considers the intra-correlations within the subgraph of users and items, while ignoring the inter-correlations across different subgraphs. To solve the above challenges, we propose a multi-strategy-based pre-training method for cold-start recommendation (MPT), which extends PT-GNN from the perspective of model architecture and pretext tasks to improve the cold-start recommendation performance. Specifically, in terms of the model architecture, in addition to the short-range dependencies of users and items captured by the GNN encoder, we introduce a Transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies. In terms of the pretext task, in addition to considering the intra-correlations of users and items by the embedding reconstruction task, we add an embedding contrastive learning task to capture inter-correlations of users and items. We train the GNN and Transformer encoders on these pretext tasks under the meta-learning setting to simulate the real cold-start scenario, making the model able to be easily and rapidly adapted to new cold-start users and items. Experiments on three public recommendation datasets show the superiority of the proposed MPT model against the vanilla GNN models, the pre-training GNN model on user/item embedding inference, and the recommendation task.}

	abstract = {In recommender systems, top- N  recommendation is an important task with implicit feedback data. Although the recent success of deep learning largely pushes forward the research on top- N  recommendation, there are increasing concerns on appropriate evaluation of recommendation algorithms. It therefore is important to study how recommendation algorithms can be reliably evaluated and thoroughly verified. This work presents a large-scale, systematic study on six important factors from three aspects for evaluating recommender systems. We carefully select 12 top- N  recommendation algorithms and eight recommendation datasets. Our experiments are carefully designed and extensively conducted with these algorithms and datasets. In particular, all the experiments in our work are implemented based on an open sourced recommendation library, Recbole\xa0[ 139 ], which ensures the reproducibility and reliability of our results. Based on the large-scale experiments and detailed analysis, we derive several key findings on the experimental settings for evaluating recommender systems. Our findings show that some settings can lead to substantial or significant differences in performance ranking of the compared algorithms. In response to recent evaluation concerns, we also provide several suggested settings that are specially important for performance comparison.}

	abstract = {This article presents a novel model named Adversarial Auto-encoder Domain Adaptation to handle the recommendation problem under cold-start settings. Specifically, we divide the hypergraph into two hypergraphs, i.e., a positive hypergraph and a negative one. Below, we adopt the cold-start user recommendation for illustration. After achieving positive and negative hypergraphs, we apply hypergraph auto-encoders to them to obtain positive and negative embeddings of warm users and items. Additionally, we employ a multi-layer perceptron to get warm and cold-start user embeddings called regular embeddings. Subsequently, for warm users, we assign positive and negative pseudo-labels to their positive and negative embeddings, respectively, and treat their positive and regular embeddings as the source and target domain data, respectively. Then, we develop a matching discriminator to jointly minimize the classification loss of the positive and negative warm user embeddings and the distribution gap between the positive and regular warm user embeddings. In this way, warm users’ positive and regular embeddings are connected. Since the positive hypergraph maintains the relations between positive warm user and item embeddings, and the regular warm and cold-start user embeddings follow a similar distribution, the regular cold-start user embedding and positive item embedding are bridged to discover their relationship. The proposed model can be easily extended to handle the cold-start item recommendation by changing inputs. We perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets for both cold-start user and cold-start item recommendations. Promising results in terms of precision, recall, normalized discounted cumulative gain, and hit rate verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Search result diversification aims to generate diversified search results so as to meet the various information needs of users. Most of those existing diversification methods greedily select the optimal documents one-by-one comparing with the selected document sequences. Due to the fact that the information utilities of the candidate documents are not independent, a model based on greedy document selection may not produce the global optimal ranking results. To address this issue, some work proposes to model global document interactions regardless of whether a document is selected, which is inconsistent with actual user behavior. In this article, we propose a new supervised diversification framework as an ensemble of global interaction and document selection. Based on a self-attention encoder-decoder structure and an RNN-based document selection component, the model can simultaneously leverage both the global interactions among all the documents and the interactions between the selected sequence and each unselected document. This framework is called Greedy Diversity Encoder with Self-Attention (GDESA). Experimental results show that GDESA outperforms previous methods that rely just on global interactions, and our further analysis demonstrates that using both global interactions and document selection is necessary and beneficial.}

Nowadays, enormous user-generated contents that convey personal information are released and shared on the Internet. One may abuse a retrieval system to pinpoint sensitive information of a particular Internet user, causing privacy leakage. In this article, we propose a data-centric Proactive Privacy-preserving Cross-modal Learning algorithm that fulfills the protection purpose by employing a generator to transform original data into adversarial data with quasi-imperceptible perturbations before releasing them. When the data source is infiltrated, the inside adversarial data can confuse retrieval models under the attacker’s control to make erroneous predictions. We consider the protection under a realistic and challenging setting where the prior knowledge of malicious models is agnostic. To handle this, a surrogate retrieval model is instead introduced, acting as the target to fool. The whole network is trained under a game-theoretical framework, where the generator and the retrieval model persistently evolve to fight against each other. To facilitate the optimization, a Gradient Reversal Layer module is inserted between two models, enabling a one-step learning fashion. Extensive experiments on widely used realistic datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Funnelling  ( Fun ) is a recently proposed method for cross-lingual text classification (CLTC) based on a two-tier learning ensemble for heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL). In this ensemble method, 1st-tier classifiers, each working on a different and language-dependent feature space, return a vector of calibrated posterior probabilities (with one dimension for each class) for each document, and the final classification decision is taken by a meta-classifier that uses this vector as its input. The meta-classifier can thus exploit class-class correlations, and this (among other things) gives  Fun  an edge over CLTC systems in which these correlations cannot be brought to bear. In this article, we describe  Generalized Funnelling  ( gFun ), a generalization of  Fun  consisting of an HTL architecture in which 1st-tier components can be arbitrary  view-generating functions , i.e., language-dependent functions that each produce a language-independent representation (“view”) of the (monolingual) document. We describe an instance of  gFun  in which the meta-classifier receives as input a vector of calibrated posterior probabilities (as in  Fun ) aggregated to other embedded representations that embody other types of correlations, such as word-class correlations (as encoded by  Word-Class Embeddings ), word-word correlations (as encoded by  Multilingual Unsupervised or Supervised Embeddings ), and word-context correlations (as encoded by  multilingual BERT ). We show that this instance of  gFun  substantially improves over  Fun  and over state-of-the-art baselines by reporting experimental results obtained on two large, standard datasets for multilingual multilabel text classification. Our code that implements  gFun  is publicly available.}

	abstract = {Event representation targets to model the event-reasoning process as a machine-readable format. Previous studies on event representation mostly concentrate on a sole modeling perspective and have not well investigated the scenario-level knowledge, which can cause information loss. To cope with this dilemma, we propose a unified fine-tuning architecture-based approach ( UniFA-S ) that integrates all levels of trainings, including the scenario-level knowledge. However, another challenge for existing models is the ever-increasing computation overheads, restricting the deployment ability on limited resources devices. Hence, in this article, we aim to compress the cumbersome model  UniFA-S  into a lighter and easy-to-deploy one without much performance damage. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware knowledge distillation model (SaKD) that employs a dynamic self-distillation on the  decouple-compress-couple  framework for compressing  UniFA-S , which cannot only realize the model compression, but also retain the integrity of individual components. We also design two fitting strategies to address the less-supervised issue at the distillation stage. Comprehensive experiments on representation-and-inference ability-based tasks validate the effectiveness of SaKD. Compared to  UniFA-S , SaKD realizes a more portable event representation model at the cost of only 1.0% performance drop in terms of accuracy or Spearman’s correlation, which is far less than other knowledge distillation models.}

	abstract = {Query performance prediction (QPP) methods, which aim to predict the performance of a query, often rely on evidences in the form of different characteristic patterns in the distribution of Retrieval Status Values (RSVs). However, for neural IR models, it is usually observed that the RSVs are often less reliable for QPP because they are bounded within short intervals, different from the situation for statistical models. To address this limitation, we propose a model-agnostic QPP framework that gathers additional evidences by leveraging information from the characteristic patterns of RSV distributions computed over a set of  automatically generated  query variants, relative to that of the current query. Specifically, the idea behind our proposed method—Weighted Relative Information Gain (WRIG), is that a substantial relative decrease or increase in the standard deviation of the RSVs of the query variants is likely to be a relative indicator of how easy or difficult the original query is. To cater for the absence of human-annotated query variants in real-world scenarios, we further propose an automatic query variant generation method. This can produce variants in a controlled manner by substituting terms from the original query with new ones sampled from a weighted distribution, constructed either via a relevance model or with the help of an embedded representation of query terms. Our experiments on the TREC-Robust, ClueWeb09B, and MS MARCO\xa0datasets show that WRIG, by the use of this relative changes in QPP estimate, leads to significantly better results than a state-of-the-art baseline method that leverages information from (manually created) query variants by the application of additive smoothing [ 64 ]. The results also show that our approach can improve the QPP effectiveness of neural retrieval approaches in particular.}

	abstract = {In the social network, each user has attributes for self-description called user attributes, which are semantically hierarchical. Attribute inference has become an essential way for social platforms to realize user classifications and targeted recommendations. Most existing approaches mainly focus on the flat inference problem neglecting the semantic hierarchy of user attributes, which will cause serious inconsistency in multi-level tasks. In this article, we propose a multi-level model MLI, where information propagation part collects attribute information by mining the global graph structure, and the attribute correction part realizes the mutual correction between different levels of attributes. Further, we put forward the concept of generalized semantic tree, a way of representing the hierarchical structure of user attributes, whose nodes are allowed to have multiple parent nodes unlike the regular tree. Both regular and generalized semantic trees are commonly used in practice, and can be handled by our model. Besides, by making the inference start from sub-networks with sufficient attribute information, we design a “Ripple” algorithm to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our model. For evaluation purposes, we conduct extensive verification experiments on DBLP datasets. The experimental results show the superior effect of MLI, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {With the implementation of privacy protection laws such as GDPR, it is increasingly difficult for organizations to legally collect users’ data. However, a typical machine learning-based recommendation algorithm requires the data to learn users’ preferences. Some recent works thus turn to develop federated learning-based recommendation algorithms, but most of them either cannot protect the users’ privacy well, or sacrifice the model accuracy. In this article, we propose a lossless and generic federated recommendation framework via fake marks and secret sharing (FMSS). Our FMSS can not only protect the two types of users’ privacy, i.e., rating values and rating behaviors, without sacrificing the recommendation performance, but can also be applied to most recommendation algorithms for rating prediction, item ranking, and sequential recommendation. Specifically, we extend existing fake items to fake marks, and combine it with secret sharing to perturb the data uploaded by the clients to a server. We then apply our FMSS to six representative recommendation algorithms, i.e., MF-MPC and NeuMF for rating prediction, eALS and VAE-CF for item ranking, and Fossil and GRU4Rec for sequential recommendation. The experimental results demonstrate that our FMSS is a lossless and generic framework, which is able to federate a series of different recommendation algorithms in a lossless and privacy-aware manner.}

	abstract = {Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), a core component of the task-oriented dialogue system, expects a shorter inference facing the impatience of human users. Existing work increases inference speed by designing non-autoregressive models for single-turn SLU tasks but fails to apply to multi-turn SLU in confronting the dialogue history. The intuitive idea is to concatenate all historical utterances and utilize the non-autoregressive models directly. However, this approach seriously misses the salient historical information and suffers from the uncoordinated-slot problems. To overcome those shortcomings, we propose a novel model for multi-turn SLU named Salient History Attention with Layer-Refined Transformer (SHA-LRT), which comprises a SHA module, a Layer-Refined Mechanism (LRM), and a Slot Label Generation (SLG) task. SHA captures salient historical information for the current dialogue from both historical utterances and results via a well-designed history-attention mechanism. LRM predicts preliminary SLU results from Transformer’s middle states and utilizes them to guide the final prediction, and SLG obtains the sequential dependency information for the non-autoregressive encoder. Experiments on public datasets indicate that our model significantly improves multi-turn SLU performance (17.5% on Overall) with accelerating (nearly 15 times) the inference process over the state-of-the-art baseline as well as effective on the single-turn SLU tasks.}

The core idea of CDR is to leverage information collected from other domains to alleviate the two problems in one domain. Since the early 2010s, many efforts have been engaged for cross-domain recommendation. Recently, with the development of deep learning and neural networks, a large number of methods have emerged. However, there is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding the latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks they address. In this survey article, we first proposed a two-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation that classifies different recommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and summarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different recommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets commonly used. We conclude this survey by providing several potential research directions about this field.}

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs)  have been widely applied in the recommendation tasks and have achieved very appealing performance. However, most GNN-based recommendation methods suffer from the problem of data sparsity in practice. Meanwhile, pre-training techniques have achieved great success in mitigating data sparsity in various domains such as  natural language processing (NLP)  and  computer vision (CV) . Thus, graph pre-training has the great potential to alleviate data sparsity in GNN-based recommendations. However, pre-training GNNs for recommendations faces unique challenges. For example, user-item interaction graphs in different recommendation tasks have distinct sets of users and items, and they often present different properties. Therefore, the successful mechanisms commonly used in NLP and CV to transfer knowledge from pre-training tasks to downstream tasks such as sharing learned embeddings or feature extractors are not directly applicable to existing GNN-based recommendations models. To tackle these challenges, we delicately design an  adaptive graph pre-training framework for localized collaborative filtering (ADAPT) . It does not require transferring user/item embeddings, and is able to capture both the common knowledge across different graphs and the uniqueness for each graph simultaneously. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of ADAPT.}

	abstract = {News recommender systems have become an effective manner to help users make decisions by suggesting the potential news that users may click and read, which has shown the proliferation nowadays. Many representative algorithms made great efforts to discover users’ preferences from the histories for triggering news recommendations. However, there exist some limitations due to the following two main issues. First, they mainly rely on the sufficient user data, which cannot well capture users’ temporal interests with very limited records. Second, always perceiving users’ histories for recommendation may ignore some important news (e.g., breaking news). In this article, we propose a novel Multi-factors Fusion model for news recommendation by integrating both user-dependent preference effect and user-independent timeliness effect together. First, to track the preference of a certain user, we decompose her reading history into two user-related factors, including the long-term habit and the short-term interest. Specifically, we extract her persistent habit by exploring the category effect of news that she focuses on from her whole records. Then, we characterize her temporary interests by proposing a recurrent neural network of analyzing the homogeneous relations between her latest clicked news and the candidate ones. Second, to describe the user-independent news timeliness effect, we propose a novel survival analysis model to estimate the instantaneous click probability of a certain news as the occurring probability of an event, where much sensational news tends to be picked out. Last, we fuse all effects to determine the probability of a user clicking on a certain news under the independent event assumption. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate better news recommendations on both general scenario and cold-start scenario.}

	abstract = {Online shopping platforms, such as Amazon and AliExpress, are increasingly prevalent in society, helping customers purchase products conveniently. With recent progress in natural language processing, researchers and practitioners shift their focus from traditional product search to conversational product search. Conversational product search enables user-machine conversations and through them collects explicit user feedback that allows to actively clarify the users’ product preferences. Therefore, prospective research on an intelligent shopping assistant via conversations is indispensable. Existing publications on conversational product search either model conversations independently from users, queries, and products or lead to a vocabulary mismatch. In this work, we propose a new conversational product search model, ConvPS, to assist users in locating desirable items. The model is first trained to jointly learn the semantic representations of user, query, item, and conversation via a unified generative framework. After learning these representations, they are integrated to retrieve the target items in the latent semantic space. Meanwhile, we propose a set of greedy and explore-exploit strategies to learn to ask the user a sequence of high-performance questions for conversations. Our proposed ConvPS model can naturally integrate the representation learning of the user, query, item, and conversation into a unified generative framework, which provides a promising avenue for constructing accurate and robust conversational product search systems that are flexible and adaptive. Experimental results demonstrate that our ConvPS model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {The generation of large amounts of personal data provides data centers with sufficient resources to mine idiosyncrasy from private records. User modeling has long been a fundamental task with the goal of capturing the latent characteristics of users from their behaviors. However, centralized user modeling on collected data has raised concerns about the risk of data misuse and privacy leakage. As a result, federated user modeling has come into favor, since it expects to provide secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing federated learning methods that ignore the inconsistency among clients cannot be applied directly to practical user modeling scenarios, and moreover, they meet the following critical challenges: 1)  Statistical heterogeneity . The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed (IID), which leads to unique clients with needful personalized information; 2)  Privacy heterogeneity . User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy, indicating that we should balance different information shared and protected; 3)  Model heterogeneity . The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous, and thus require a flexible aggregation in the server; 4)  Quality heterogeneity . Low-quality information from inconsistent clients poisons the reliability of user models and offsets the benefit from high-quality ones, meaning that we should augment the high-quality information during the process. To address the challenges, in this paper, we first propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL), with a primary goal of serving federated learning for user modeling in inconsistent clients. More specifically, the client train and deliver the local user model via the hierarchical components containing hierarchical information from privacy heterogeneity to join collaboration in federated learning. Moreover, the client updates the personalized user model with a fine-grained personalized update strategy for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server flexibly aggregates hierarchical components from heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity with a differentiated component aggregation strategy. In order to augment high-quality information and generate high-quality user models, we expand HPFL to the Augmented-HPFL (AHPFL) framework by incorporating the augmented mechanisms, which filters out low-quality information such as noise, sparse information and redundant information. Specially, we construct two implementations of AHPFL, i.e., AHPFL-SVD and AHPFL-AE, where the augmented mechanisms follow SVD (singular value decomposition) and AE (autoencoder), respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of both HPFL and AHPFL frameworks.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, most online services are hosted on multi-stakeholder marketplaces, where consumers and producers may have different objectives. Conventional recommendation systems, however, mainly focus on maximizing consumers’ satisfaction by recommending the most relevant items to each individual. This may result in unfair exposure of items, thus jeopardizing producer benefits. Additionally, they do not care whether consumers from diverse demographic groups are equally satisfied. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework for fairness-aware recommendation,  Multi-FR , that adaptively balances accuracy and fairness for various stakeholders with Pareto optimality guarantee. We first propose four fairness constraints on consumers and producers. In order to train the whole framework in an end-to-end way, we utilize the smooth rank and stochastic ranking policy to make these fairness criteria differentiable and friendly to back-propagation. Then, we adopt the multiple gradient descent algorithm to generate a Pareto set of solutions, from which the most appropriate one is selected by the Least Misery Strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that  Multi-FR  largely improves recommendation fairness on multiple stakeholders over the state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining almost the same recommendation accuracy. The training efficiency study confirms our model’s ability to simultaneously optimize different fairness constraints for many stakeholders efficiently.}

	abstract = {As recommender systems become increasingly important in daily human decision-making, users are demanding convincing explanations to understand why they get the specific recommendation results. Although a number of explainable recommender systems have recently been proposed, there still lacks an understanding of what users really need in a recommendation explanation. The actual reason behind users’ intention to examine and consume (e.g., click and watch a movie) can be the window to answer this question and is named as  self-explanation  in this work. In addition, humans usually make recommendations accompanied by explanations, but there remain fewer studies on how humans explain and what we can learn from human-generated explanations. To investigate these questions, we conduct a novel multi-role, multi-session user study in which users interact with multiple types of system-generated explanations as well as human-generated explanations, namely  peer-explanation . During the study, users’ intentions, expectations, and experiences are tracked in several phases, including before and after the users are presented with an explanation and after the content is examined. Through comprehensive investigations, three main findings have been made: First, we observe not only the positive but also the negative effects of explanations, and the impact varies across different types of explanations. Moreover, human-generated explanation,  peer-explanation , performs better in increasing user intentions and helping users to better construct preferences, which results in better user satisfaction. Second, based on users’  self-explanation , the information accuracy is measured and found to be a major factor associated with user satisfaction. Some other factors, such as unfamiliarity and similarity, are also discovered and summarized. Third, through annotations of the information aspects used in the human-generated  self-explanation  and  peer-explanation , patterns of how humans explain are investigated, including what information and how much information is utilized. In addition, based on the findings, a human-inspired explanation approach is proposed and found to increase user satisfaction, revealing the potential improvement of further incorporating more human patterns in recommendation explanations. These findings have shed light on the deeper understanding of the recommendation explanation and further research on its evaluation and generation. Furthermore, the collected data, including human-generated explanations by both the external peers and the users’ selves, will be released to support future research works on explanation evaluation.}

	abstract = {Temporal features of text have been shown to improve clustering and organization of documents, text classification, visualization, and ranking. Temporal ranking models consider the temporal expressions found in text (e.g., “in 2021” or “last year”) as time units, rather than as keywords, to define a temporal relevance and improve ranking. This article introduces a new class of ranking models called Temporal Metric Space Models (TMSM), based on a new domain for representing temporal information found in documents and queries, where each temporal expression is represented as a  time interval . Furthermore, we introduce a new frequency-based baseline called Temporal BM25 (TBM25). We evaluate the effectiveness of each proposed metric against a purely textual baseline, as well as several variations of the metrics themselves, where we change the aggregate function, the time granularity and the combination weight. Our extensive experiments on five test collections show statistically significant improvements of TMSM and TBM25 over state-of-the-art temporal ranking models. Combining the temporal similarity scores with the text similarity scores always improves the results, when the combination weight is between 2% and 6% for the temporal scores. This is true also for test collections where only 5% of queries contain explicit temporal expressions.}

	abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at automatically inferring the specific sentiment polarities toward certain aspects of products or services behind the social media texts or reviews, which has been a fundamental application to the real-world society. Since the early 2010s, ABSA has achieved extraordinarily high accuracy with various deep neural models. However, existing ABSA models with strong in-house performances may fail to generalize to some challenging cases where the contexts are variable, i.e., low robustness to real-world environments. In this study, we propose to enhance the ABSA robustness by systematically rethinking the bottlenecks from all possible angles, including model, data, and training. First, we strengthen the current best-robust syntax-aware models by further incorporating the rich external syntactic dependencies and the labels with aspect simultaneously with a universal-syntax graph convolutional network. In the corpus perspective, we propose to automatically induce high-quality synthetic training data with various types, allowing models to learn sufficient inductive bias for better robustness. Last, we based on the rich pseudo data perform adversarial training to enhance the resistance to the context perturbation and meanwhile employ contrastive learning to reinforce the representations of instances with contrastive sentiments. Extensive robustness evaluations are conducted. The results demonstrate that our enhanced syntax-aware model achieves better robustness performances than all the state-of-the-art baselines. By additionally incorporating our synthetic corpus, the robust testing results are pushed with around 10% accuracy, which are then further improved by installing the advanced training strategies. In-depth analyses are presented for revealing the factors influencing the ABSA robustness.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems are an essential tool to relieve the information overload challenge and play an important role in people’s daily lives. Since recommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job recommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair recommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of the recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender systems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple complex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the research on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we review over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including TOIS, SIGIR, and WWW. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation and provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review recommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an elaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining some promising future directions.}

	abstract = {In recommender systems, some features directly affect whether an interaction would happen, making the happened interactions not necessarily indicate user preference. For instance, short videos are objectively easier to finish even though the user may not like the video. We term such feature as  confounding feature , and video length is a confounding feature in video recommendation. If we fit a model on such interaction data, just as done by most data-driven recommender systems, the model will be biased to recommend short videos more, and deviate from user actual requirement. This work formulates and addresses the problem from the causal perspective. Assuming there are some factors affecting both the confounding feature and other item features, e.g., the video creator, we find the confounding feature opens a backdoor path behind user-item matching and introduces spurious correlation. To remove the effect of backdoor path, we propose a framework named  Deconfounding Causal Recommendation (DCR) , which performs intervened inference with  do-calculus . Nevertheless, evaluating  do-calculus  requires to sum over the prediction on all possible values of confounding feature, significantly increasing the time cost. To address the efficiency challenge, we further propose a  mixture-of-experts (MoE)  model architecture, modeling each value of confounding feature with a separate expert module. Through this way, we retain the model expressiveness with few additional costs. We demonstrate DCR on the backbone model of  neural factorization machine (NFM) , showing that DCR leads to more accurate prediction of user preference with small inference time cost. We release our code at:  https://github.com/zyang1580/DCR .}

	abstract = {Deep cross-modal hashing retrieval models inherit the vulnerability of deep neural networks. They are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for the form of subtle perturbations to the inputs. Although many adversarial attack methods have been proposed to handle the robustness of hashing retrieval models, they still suffer from two problems: (1) Most of them are based on the white-box settings, which is usually unrealistic in practical application. (2) Iterative optimization for the generation of adversarial examples in them results in heavy computation. To address these problems, we propose an Efficient Query-based Black-Box Attack (EQB 2 A) against deep cross-modal hashing retrieval, which can efficiently generate adversarial examples for the black-box attack. Specifically, by sending a few query requests to the attacked retrieval system, the cross-modal retrieval model stealing is performed based on the neighbor relationship between the retrieved results and the query, thus obtaining the knockoffs to substitute the attacked system. A multi-modal knockoffs-driven adversarial generation is proposed to achieve efficient adversarial example generation. While the entire network training converges, EQB 2 A can efficiently generate adversarial examples by forward-propagation with only given benign images. Experiments show that EQB 2 A achieves superior attacking performance under the black-box setting.}

	abstract = {Recommendation systems are popular in many domains. Researchers usually focus on the effectiveness of recommendation (e.g., precision) but neglect the popularity bias that may affect the fairness of the recommendation, which is also an important consideration that could influence the benefits of users and item providers. A few studies have been proposed to deal with the popularity bias, but they often face two limitations. Firstly, most studies only consider fairness for one side—either users or items, without achieving fairness jointly for both. Secondly, existing methods are not sufficiently tailored to each individual user or item to cope with the varying extent and nature of popularity bias. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose  FAiR , a  f airness-centric model that  a dapt i vely mitigates the popularity bias in both users and items for  r ecommendation. Concretely, we design explicit fairness discriminators to mitigate the popularity bias for each user and item locally, and an implicit discriminator to preserve fairness globally. Moreover, we dynamically adapt the model to different input users and items to handle the differences in their popularity bias. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fairness metrics, while remaining competitive in effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems can automatically recommend users with items that they probably like. The goal of them is to model the user-item interaction by effectively representing the users and items. Existing methods have primarily learned the user’s preferences and item’s features with vectorized embeddings, and modeled the user’s general preferences to items by the interaction of them. In fact, users have their specific preferences to item attributes and different preferences are usually related. Therefore, exploring the fine-grained preferences as well as modeling the relationships among user’s different preferences could improve the recommendation performance. Toward this end, we propose a  dual preference distribution learning framework (DUPLE) , which aims to jointly learn a general preference distribution and a specific preference distribution for a given user, where the former corresponds to the user’s general preference to items and the latter refers to the user’s specific preference to item attributes. Notably, the mean vector of each Gaussian distribution can capture the user’s preferences, and the covariance matrix can learn their relationship. Moreover, we can summarize a preferred attribute profile for each user, depicting his/her preferred item attributes. We then can provide the explanation for each recommended item by checking the overlap between its attributes and the user’s preferred attribute profile. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on six public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of the DUPLE method.}

	abstract = {Modern recommender systems are trained to predict users’ potential future interactions from users’ historical behavior data. During the interaction process, despite the data coming from the user side, recommender systems also generate exposure data to provide users with personalized recommendation slates. Compared with the sparse user behavior data, the system exposure data are much larger in volume since only very few exposed items would be clicked by the user. In addition, user historical behavior data are privacy sensitive and commonly protected with careful access authorization. However, the large volume of recommender exposure data generated by the service provider itself usually receives less attention and could be accessed within a relatively larger scope of various information seekers or even potential adversaries. In this article, we investigate the problem of user behavior data leakage in the field of recommender systems. We show that the privacy-sensitive user past behavior data can be inferred through the modeling of system exposure. In other words,  one can infer which items the user has clicked just from the observation of current system exposure for this user . Given the fact that system exposure data could be widely accessed from a relatively larger scope, we believe that user past behavior privacy has a high risk of leakage in recommender systems. More precisely, we conduct an attack model whose input is the current recommended item slate (i.e., system exposure) for the user while the output is the user’s historical behavior. Specifically, we exploit an encoder-decoder structure to construct the attack model and apply different encoding and decoding strategies to verify attack performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate a great danger of user behavior data leakage. To address the risk, we propose a two-stage privacy-protection mechanism that first selects a subset of items from the exposure slate and then replaces the selected items with uniform or popularity-based exposure. Experimental evaluation reveals a trade-off effect between the recommendation accuracy and the privacy disclosure risk, which is an interesting and important topic for privacy concerns in recommender systems.}

	abstract = {With recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNN), GNN-based recommender systems (gRS) have achieved remarkable success in the past few years. Despite this success, existing research reveals that gRSs are still vulnerable to  poison attacks , in which the attackers inject fake data to manipulate recommendation results as they desire. This might be due to the fact that existing poison attacks (and countermeasures) are either model-agnostic or specifically designed for traditional recommender algorithms (e.g., neighborhood-based, matrix-factorization-based, or deep-learning-based RSs) that are not gRS. As gRSs are widely adopted in the industry, the problem of how to design poison attacks for gRSs has become a need for robust user experience. Herein, we focus on the use of poison attacks to manipulate item promotion in gRSs. Compared to standard GNNs, attacking gRSs is more challenging due to the heterogeneity of network structure and the entanglement between users and items. To overcome such challenges, we propose  GSPAttack —a generative surrogate-based poison attack framework for gRSs.  GSPAttack  tailors a learning process to surrogate a recommendation model as well as generate fake users and user-item interactions while preserving the data correlation between users and items for recommendation accuracy. Although maintaining high accuracy for other items rather than the target item seems counterintuitive, it is equally crucial to the success of a poison attack. Extensive evaluations on four real-world datasets revealed that  GSPAttack  outperforms all baselines with competent recommendation performance and is resistant to various countermeasures.}

	abstract = {Neural graph collaborative filtering has received great recent attention due to its power of encoding the high-order neighborhood via the backbone graph neural networks. However, their robustness against noisy user-item interactions remains largely unexplored. Existing work on robust collaborative filtering mainly improves the robustness by denoising the graph structure, while recent progress in other fields has shown that directly adding adversarial perturbations in the embedding space can significantly improve the model robustness. In this work, we propose to improve the robustness of neural graph collaborative filtering via both denoising in the structure space and perturbing in the embedding space. Specifically, in the structure space, we measure the reliability of interactions and further use it to affect the message propagation process of the backbone graph neural networks; in the embedding space, we add in-distribution perturbations by mimicking the behavior of adversarial attacks and further combine it with contrastive learning to improve the performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the recent neural graph collaborative filtering methods especially when there are injected noisy interactions in the training data.}

	abstract = {Recently, privacy issues in web services that rely on users’ personal data have raised great attention. Despite that recent regulations force companies to offer choices for each user to opt-in or opt-out of data disclosure, real-world applications usually only provide an “all or nothing” binary option for users to either disclose all their data or preserve all data with the cost of no personalized service. In this article, we argue that such a binary mechanism is not optimal for both consumers and platforms. To study how different privacy mechanisms affect users’ decisions on information disclosure and how users’ decisions affect the platform’s revenue, we propose a privacy-aware recommendation framework that gives users fine control over their data. In this new framework, users can proactively control which data to disclose based on the tradeoff between anticipated privacy risks and potential utilities. Then we study the impact of different data disclosure mechanisms via simulation with reinforcement learning due to the high cost of real-world experiments. The results show that the platform mechanisms with finer split granularity and more unrestrained disclosure strategy can bring better results for both consumers and platforms than the “all or nothing” mechanism adopted by most real-world applications.}

	abstract = {Clicks on rankings suffer from position bias: generally items on lower ranks are less likely to be examined—and thus clicked—by users, in spite of their actual preferences between items. The prevalent approach to unbiased click-based learning-to-rank (LTR) is based on counterfactual inverse-propensity-scoring (IPS) estimation. In contrast with general reinforcement learning, counterfactual doubly robust (DR) estimation has not been applied to click-based LTR in previous literature. In this article, we introduce a novel DR estimator that is the first DR approach specifically designed for position bias. The difficulty with position bias is that the treatment—user examination—is not directly observable in click data. As a solution, our estimator uses the expected treatment per rank, instead of the actual treatment that existing DR estimators use. Our novel DR estimator has more robust unbiasedness conditions than the existing IPS approach, and in addition, provides enormous decreases in variance: our experimental results indicate it requires several orders of magnitude fewer datapoints to converge at optimal performance. For the unbiased LTR field, our DR estimator contributes both increases in state-of-the-art performance and the most robust theoretical guarantees of all known LTR estimators.}

	abstract = {Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) is known to improve the effectiveness of bag-of-words retrievers. At the same time, deep language models have been shown to outperform traditional bag-of-words rerankers. However, it is unclear how to integrate PRF directly with emergent deep language models. This article addresses this gap by investigating methods for integrating PRF signals with rerankers and dense retrievers based on deep language models. We consider text-based, vector-based and hybrid PRF approaches and investigate different ways of combining and scoring relevance signals. An extensive empirical evaluation was conducted across four different datasets and two task settings (retrieval and ranking). Text-based PRF  results show that the use of PRF had a mixed effect on deep rerankers across different datasets. We found that the best effectiveness was achieved when (i) directly concatenating each PRF passage with the query, searching with the new set of queries, and then aggregating the scores; (ii) using Borda to aggregate scores from PRF runs. Vector-based PRF  results show that the use of PRF enhanced the effectiveness of deep rerankers and dense retrievers over several evaluation metrics. We found that higher effectiveness was achieved when (i) the query retains either the majority or the same weight within the PRF mechanism, and (ii) a shallower PRF signal (i.e., a smaller number of top-ranked passages) was employed, rather than a deeper signal. Our vector-based PRF method is computationally efficient; thus, this represents a general PRF method others can use with deep rerankers and dense retrievers.}

	abstract = {Sequential recommendation (SR) learns users’ preferences by capturing the sequential patterns from users’ behaviors evolution. As discussed in many works, user–item interactions of SR generally present the intrinsic power-law distribution, which can be ascended to hierarchy-like structures. Previous methods usually handle such hierarchical information by making user–item sectionalization empirically under Euclidean space, which may cause distortion of user–item representation in real online scenarios. In this article, we propose a Poincaré-based heterogeneous graph neural network named Poincaré Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Recommendation (PHGR) to model the sequential pattern information as well as hierarchical information contained in the data of SR scenarios simultaneously. Specifically, for the purpose of explicitly capturing the hierarchical information, we first construct a weighted user–item heterogeneous graph by aliening all the user–item interactions to improve the perception domain of each user from a global view. Then the output of the global representation would be used to complement the local directed item–item homogeneous graph convolution. By defining a novel hyperbolic inner product operator, the global and local graph representation learning are directly conducted in Poincaré ball instead of commonly used projection operation between Poincaré ball and Euclidean space, which could alleviate the cumulative error issue of general bidirectional translation process. Moreover, for the purpose of explicitly capturing the sequential dependency information, we design two types of temporal attention operations under Poincaré ball space. Empirical evaluations on datasets from the public and financial industry show that PHGR outperforms several comparison methods.}

	abstract = {Recently, user cold-start recommendations have attracted a lot of attention from industry and academia. In user cold-start recommendation systems, the user attribute information is often used by existing approaches to learn user preferences due to the unavailability of user action data. However, most existing recommendation methods often ignore the sparsity of user attributes in cold-start recommendation systems. To tackle this limitation, this article proposes a novel Inductive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (IHGNN) model, which utilizes the relational information in user cold-start recommendation systems to alleviate the sparsity of user attributes. Our model converts new users, items, and associated multimodal information into a Modality-aware Heterogeneous Graph (M-HG) that preserves the rich and heterogeneous relationship information among them. Specifically, to utilize rich and heterogeneous relational information in an M-HG for enriching the sparse attribute information of new users, we design a strategy based on random walk operations to collect associated neighbors of new users by multiple times sampling operation. Then, a well-designed multiple hierarchical attention aggregation model consisting of the intra- and inter-type attention aggregating module is proposed, focusing on useful connected neighbors and neglecting meaningless and noisy connected neighbors to generate high-quality representations for user cold-start recommendations. Experimental results on three real datasets demonstrate that the IHGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Owing to its nature of scalability and privacy by design, federated learning (FL) has received increasing interest in decentralized deep learning. FL has also facilitated recent research on upscaling and privatizing personalized recommendation services, using on-device data to learn recommender models locally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant model while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems (FRSs) do not take into account the lack of resources and data availability at the end-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users and items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices (i.e., users), and that all local recommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user’s behavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be made on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources. Furthermore, users’ preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new items. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the straightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data. In this article, we propose  Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System  (ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified user preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight self-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning a user’s temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server side, ReFRS utilizes a scalable semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation within each identified cluster of similar users. The clustering module operates in an asynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and cope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by comparative experiments on real datasets.}

	abstract = {Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an indispensable functionality in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) due to its effectiveness in helping people decide the next POI to visit. However, accurate recommendation requires a vast amount of historical check-in data, thus threatening user privacy as the location-sensitive data needs to be handled by cloud servers. Although there have been several on-device frameworks for privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they are still resource intensive when it comes to storage and computation, and show limited robustness to the high sparsity of user-POI interactions. On this basis, we propose a novel  d ecentralized  c ollaborative  l earning framework for POI  r ecommendation (DCLR), which allows users to train their personalized models locally in a collaborative manner. DCLR significantly reduces the local models’ dependence on the cloud for training, and can be used to expand arbitrary centralized recommendation models. To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data when learning each local model, we design two self-supervision signals to pretrain the POI representations on the server with geographical and categorical correlations of POIs. To facilitate collaborative learning, we innovatively propose to incorporate knowledge from either geographically or semantically similar users into each local model with attentive aggregation and mutual information maximization. The collaborative learning process makes use of communications between devices while requiring only minor engagement from the central server for identifying user groups, and is compatible with common privacy preservation mechanisms like differential privacy. We evaluate DCLR with two real-world datasets, where the results show that DCLR outperforms state-of-the-art on-device frameworks and yields competitive results compared with centralized counterparts.}

	abstract = {While recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research papers on  recommender system (RS) , most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic. The summary of debiasing methods reviewed in this survey can be found at  https://github.com/jiawei-chen/RecDebiasing .}

	abstract = {With the resurgent interest in building open-domain dialogue systems, the dialogue generation task has attracted increasing attention over the past few years. This task is usually formulated as a conditional generation problem, which aims to generate a natural and meaningful response given dialogue contexts and specific constraints, such as persona. And maintaining a consistent persona is essential for the dialogue systems to gain trust from the users. Although tremendous advancements have been brought, traditional persona-based dialogue models are typically trained by leveraging a large number of persona-dense dialogue examples. Yet, such persona-dense training data are expensive to obtain, leading to a limited scale. This work presents a novel approach to learning from limited training examples by regarding consistency understanding as a regularization of response generation. To this end, we propose a novel stack-propagation framework for learning a generation and understanding pipeline. Specifically, the framework stacks a Transformer encoder and two Transformer decoders, where the first decoder models response generation and the second serves as a regularizer and jointly models response generation and consistency understanding. The proposed framework can benefit from the stacked encoder and decoders to learn from much smaller personalized dialogue data while maintaining competitive performance. Under different low-resource settings, subjective and objective evaluations prove that the stack-propagation framework outperforms strong baselines in response quality and persona consistency and largely overcomes the shortcomings of traditional models that rely heavily on the persona-dense dialogue data.}

	abstract = {Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction on cold users is a challenging task in recommender systems. Recent researches have resorted to meta-learning to tackle the cold-user challenge, which either perform few-shot user representation learning or adopt optimization-based meta-learning. However, existing methods suffer from information loss or inefficient optimization process, and they fail to explicitly model global user preference knowledge, which is crucial to complement the sparse and insufficient preference information of cold users. In this article, we propose a novel and efficient approach named RESUS, which decouples the learning of global preference knowledge contributed by collective users from the learning of residual preferences for individual users. Specifically, we employ a shared predictor to infer basis user preferences, which acquires global preference knowledge from the interactions of different users. Meanwhile, we develop two efficient algorithms based on the nearest neighbor and ridge regression predictors, which infer residual user preferences via learning quickly from a few user-specific interactions. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our RESUS approach is efficient and effective in improving CTR prediction accuracy on cold users, compared with various state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have become a popular platform for users to share their activities with friends and families, which provide abundant information for us to study issues of group venue recommendation by utilizing the characteristics of check-in data. Although there are some studies on group recommendation for venues, few studies consider the group’s venue preference in different temporal patterns. In this article, we discover that the group’s activity venue has a temporal effect, that is, the group’s preference for the activity venue is different at different times. For example, a couple of lovers prefer to travel to tropical regions in winter and relax in bars in the evening. Based on this discovery, we present a Time-aware Multi-pattern (TaMp) topic model to capture the group’s interest in the activity venue in multiple temporal patterns (including the daily pattern, the weekly pattern, the monthly pattern, and the quarterly pattern). The TaMp model takes into account the topic, members, temporality, and venue information of group activities and the latent relations among them, especially the strong correlation between the activity time and the corresponding activity venue. Then, we propose a group venue recommendation method based on the TaMp model. In addition, an improved grouping algorithm (iGA) in LBSNs is put forward to enhance the rationality of grouping and the accuracy of group venue recommendation. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of TaMp on two real-world datasets. The results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art group venue recommendation and demonstrates the significance of temporal effects in explaining group activities.}

	abstract = {One of the key challenges in sequential recommendation is how to extract and represent user preferences. Traditional methods rely solely on predicting the next item. But user behavior may be driven by complex preferences. Therefore, these methods cannot make accurate recommendations when the available information user behavior is limited. To explore multiple user preferences, we propose a transformer-based sequential recommendation model, named MrTransformer ( M ulti-p r eference  Transformer ). For training MrTransformer, we devise a  preference-editing -based  self-supervised learning (SSL)  mechanism that explores extra supervision signals based on relations with other sequences. The idea is to force the sequential recommendation model to discriminate between common and unique preferences in different sequences of interactions. By doing so, the sequential recommendation model is able to disentangle user preferences into multiple independent preference representations so as to improve user preference extraction and representation. We carry out extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets. MrTransformer with preference editing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods in terms of Recall, MRR, and NDCG. We find that long sequences of interactions from which user preferences are harder to extract and represent benefit most from preference editing.}

	abstract = {Understanding how data workers interact with data, and various pieces of information related to data preparation, is key to designing systems that can better support them in exploring datasets. To date, however, there is a paucity of research studying the strategies adopted by data workers as they carry out data preparation activities. In this work, we investigate a specific data preparation activity, namely  data quality discovery , and aim to (i)\xa0understand the behaviors of data workers in discovering data quality issues, (ii)\xa0explore what factors (e.g., prior experience) can affect their behaviors, as well as (iii)\xa0understand how these behavioral observations relate to their performance. To this end, we collect a multi-modal dataset through a data-driven experiment that relies on the use of eye-tracking technology with a purpose-designed platform built on top of iPython Notebook. The experiment results reveal that: (i)\xa0‘copy–paste–modify’ is a typical strategy for writing code to complete tasks; (ii)\xa0proficiency in writing code has a significant impact on the quality of task performance, while perceived difficulty and efficacy can influence task completion patterns; and (iii)\xa0searching in external resources is a prevalent action that can be leveraged to achieve better performance. Furthermore, our experiment indicates that providing sample code within the system can help data workers get started with their task, and surfacing underlying data is an effective way to support exploration. By investigating data worker behaviors prior to each search action, we also find that the most common reasons that trigger external search actions are the need to seek assistance in writing or debugging code and to search for relevant code to reuse. Based on our experiment results, we showcase a systematic approach to select from the top best code snippets created by data workers and assemble them to achieve better performance than the best individual performer in the dataset. By doing so, our findings not only provide insights into patterns of interactions with various system components and information resources when performing data curation tasks, but also build effective and efficient data curation processes through data workers’ collective intelligence.}

	abstract = {On a wide range of natural language processing and information retrieval tasks, transformer-based models, particularly pre-trained language models like BERT, have demonstrated tremendous effectiveness. Due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism, however, such models have difficulties processing long documents. Recent works dealing with this issue include truncating long documents, in which case one loses potential relevant information, segmenting them into several passages, which may lead to miss some information and high computational complexity when the number of passages is large, or modifying the self-attention mechanism to make it sparser as in sparse-attention models, at the risk again of missing some information. We follow here a slightly different approach in which one first selects key blocks of a long document by local query-block pre-ranking, and then few blocks are aggregated to form a short document that can be processed by a model such as BERT. Experiments conducted on standard Information Retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Leveraging the side information associated with entities (i.e., users and items) to enhance recommendation systems has been widely recognized as an essential modeling dimension. Most of the existing approaches address this task by the  integration-based scheme , which incorporates the entity side information by combining the recommendation objective with an extra side information-aware objective. Despite the growing progress made by the existing integration-based approaches, they are largely limited by the potential conflicts between the two objectives. Moreover, the heterogeneous side information among entities is still under-explored in these systems. In this article, we propose a novel  pre-training scheme  to leverage the entity side information by pre-training entity embeddings using the multi-graph neural network. Instead of jointly training with two objectives, our  pre-training scheme  first pre-trains two representation models under the entity multi/single relational graphs constructed by their side information and then fine-tunes their embeddings under an existing general representation-based recommendation model. Our proposed multi-graph and single-graph neural networks can generate within-entity knowledge-encapsulated embeddings, while capturing the heterogeneity from the entity side information simultaneously, thereby improving the performance of the underlying recommendation model. An extensive evaluation of our pre-training scheme fine-tuned under four general representation-based recommender models, namely, MF, NCF, NGCF, and LightGCN, shows that effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user’s and item’s side information can significantly improve these original models in terms of both effectiveness and stability.}

	abstract = {Recommender models are hard to evaluate, particularly under offline setting. In this article, we provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the data leakage issue in recommender system offline evaluation. Data leakage is caused by not observing global timeline in evaluating recommenders e.g., train/test data split does not follow global timeline. As a result, a model learns from the user-item interactions that are not expected to be available at the prediction time. We first show the temporal dynamics of user-item interactions along global timeline, then explain why data leakage exists for collaborative filtering models. Through carefully designed experiments, we show that all models indeed recommend future items that are not available at the time point of a test instance, as the result of data leakage. The experiments are conducted with four widely used baseline models—BPR, NeuMF, SASRec, and LightGCN, on four popular offline datasets—MovieLens-25M, Yelp, Amazon-music, and Amazon-electronic, adopting leave-last-one-out data split. 1  We further show that data leakage does impact models’ recommendation accuracy. Their relative performance orders thus become unpredictable with different amount of leaked future data in training. To evaluate recommendation systems in a realistic manner in offline setting, we propose a timeline scheme, which calls for a revisit of the recommendation model design.}

	abstract = {Legal case retrieval, which aims to retrieve relevant cases given a query case, has drawn increasing research attention in recent years. While much research has worked on developing automatic retrieval models, how to characterize relevance in this specialized information retrieval (IR) task is still an open question. Towards an in-depth understanding of relevance judgments, we conduct a laboratory user study that involves 72 participants of different domain expertise. In the user study, we collect the relevance score along with detailed explanations for the relevance judgment and various measures of the judgment process. From the collected data, we observe that both the subjective (e.g., domain expertise) and objective (e.g., query/case property) factors influence the relevance judgment process. By investigating the collected user explanations, we identify task-specific patterns of user attention distribution and re-think the criteria for relevance judgments. Moreover, we investigate the similarity in attention distribution between models and users. Further, we propose a two-stage framework that utilizes user attention to improve relevance estimation for legal case retrieval. Our study sheds light on understanding relevance judgments in legal case retrieval and provides implications for improving the design of corresponding retrieval systems.}

	abstract = {Recent years witnessed several advances in developing multi-goal conversational recommender systems (MG-CRS) that can proactively attract users’ interests and naturally lead user-engaged dialogues with multiple conversational goals and diverse topics. Four tasks are often involved in MG-CRS, including Goal Planning, Topic Prediction, Item Recommendation, and Response Generation. Most existing studies address only some of these tasks. To handle the whole problem of MG-CRS, modularized frameworks are adopted where each task is tackled independently without considering their interdependencies. In this work, we propose a novel Unified MultI-goal conversational recommeNDer system (UniMIND). Specifically, we unify these four tasks with different formulations into the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm. Prompt-based learning strategies are investigated to endow the unified model with the capability of multi-task learning. Finally, the overall learning and inference procedure consists of three stages, including multi-task learning, prompt-based tuning, and inference. Experimental results on two MG-CRS benchmarks (DuRecDial and TG-ReDial) show that UniMIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks with a unified model. Extensive analyses and discussions are provided for shedding some new perspectives for MG-CRS.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems relieve users from cognitive overloading by predicting preferred items for users. Due to the complexity of interactions between users and items, graph neural networks (GNN) use graph structures to effectively model user–item interactions. However, existing GNN approaches have the following limitations: (1) User reviews are not adequately modeled in graphs. Therefore, user preferences and item properties that are described in user reviews are lost for modeling users and items; and (2) GNNs assume deterministic relations between users and items, which lack the stochastic modeling to estimate the uncertainties in neighbor relations. To mitigate the limitations, we build tripartite graphs to model user reviews as nodes that connect with users and items. We estimate neighbor relations with stochastic variables and propose a Bayesian graph attention network (i.e., ContGraph) to accurately predict user ratings. ContGraph incorporates the prior knowledge of user preferences to regularize the posterior inference of attention weights. Our experimental results show that ContGraph significantly outperforms 13 state-of-the-art models and improves the best performing baseline (i.e., ANR) by 5.23% on 25 datasets in the five-core version. Moreover, we show that correctly modeling the semantics of user reviews in graphs can help express the semantics of users and items.}

However, existing KG-based approaches still suffer from severe data sparsity and may not be effective in capturing the preference features of similar entities across domains. Therefore, in this article, we propose a  P reference-aware  G raph  A ttention network model with  C ollaborative  K nowledge  G raph ( PGACKG ) for cross-domain recommendations. Preference-aware entity embeddings with some collaborative signals are first obtained by exploiting the graph-embedding model, which can transform entities and items in the collaborative knowledge graph into semantic preference spaces. To better learn user preference features, we devise a preference-aware graph attention network framework that aggregates the preference features of similar entities within domains and across domains. In this framework, multi-hop reasoning is employed to assist in the generation of preference features within domains, and the node random walk based on frequency visits is proposed to gather similar preferences across domains for target entities. Then, the final preference features of entities are fused, while a novel  C ross-domain  B ayesian  P ersonalized  R anking ( CBPR ) is proposed to improve cross-domain recommendation accuracy. Extensive empirical experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our PGACKG achieves strong performance in different ablation scenarios, and the interaction sparsity experiments also demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly alleviate the data sparsity issue.}

	abstract = {Graph-based recommender system has attracted widespread attention and produced a series of research results. Because of the powerful high-order connection modeling capabilities of the Graph Neural Network, the performance of these graph-based recommender systems are far superior to those of traditional neural network-based collaborative filtering models. However, from both analytical and empirical perspectives, the apparent performance improvement is accompanied with a significant time overhead, which is noticeable in large-scale graph topologies. More importantly, the intrinsic data-sparsity problem substantially limits the performance of graph-based recommender systems, which compelled us to revisit graph-based recommendation from a novel perspective. In this article, we focus on analyzing the time complexity of graph-based recommender systems to make it more suitable for real large-scale application scenarios. We propose a novel end-to-end graph recommendation model called the Collaborative Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (CVGA), which uses the information propagation and aggregation paradigms to encode user–item collaborative relationships on the user–item interaction bipartite graph. These relationships are utilized to infer the probability distribution of user behavior for parameter estimation rather than learning user or item embeddings. By doing so, we reconstruct the whole user–item interaction graph according to the known probability distribution in a feasible and elegant manner. From the perspective of the graph auto-encoder, we convert the graph recommendation task into a graph generation problem and are able to do it with approximately linear time complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that CVGA can be trained at a faster speed while maintaining comparable performance over state-of-the-art baselines for graph-based recommendation tasks. Further analysis shows that CVGA can effectively mitigate the data sparsity problem and performs equally well on large-scale datasets.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems which captures dynamic user interest based on time-ordered user-item interactions plays a critical role in the real-world. Although existing deep learning-based recommendation systems show good performances, these methods have two main drawbacks. Firstly, user interest is the consequence of the coaction of many factors. However, existing methods do not fully explore potential influence factors and ignore the user-item interaction formation process. The coarse-grained modeling patterns cannot accurately reflect complex user interest and leads to suboptimal recommendation results. Furthermore, these methods are implicit and largely operate in a black-box fashion. It is difficult to interpret their modeling processes and recommendation results. Secondly, recommendation datasets usually exhibit scale-free distributions and some existing recommender systems take advantage of hyperbolic space to match the data distribution. But they ignore that the operations in hyperbolic space are more complex than that in Euclidean space which further increases the difficulty of model interpretation. To tackle the above shortcomings, we propose an  E xplainable  H yperbolic  T emporal  P oint  P rocess  for User-Item Interaction Sequence Generation  (EHTPP) . Specifically, EHTPP regards each user-item interaction as an event in hyperbolic space and employs a temporal point process framework to model the probability of event occurrence. Considering that the complexity of user interest and the interpretability of the model,EHTPP explores four potential influence factors related to user interest and uses them to explicitly guide the probability calculation in the temporal point process. In order to validate the effectiveness of EHTPP, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of EHTPP on three datasets compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performances of EHTPP.}

	abstract = {Many click models have been proposed to interpret logs of natural interactions with search engines and extract unbiased information for evaluation or learning. The experimental setup used to evaluate them typically involves measuring two metrics, namely the test perplexity for click prediction and normalized discounted cumulative gain for relevance estimation. In both cases, the data used for training and testing is assumed to be collected using the same ranking policy. We question this assumption. Important downstream tasks based on click models involve evaluating a different policy than the training policy—that is, click models need to operate under  policy distributional shift  (PDS). We show that click models are sensitive to it. This can severely hinder their performance on the targeted task: conventional evaluation metrics cannot guarantee that a click model will perform equally well under distributional shift. To more reliably predict click model performance under PDS, we propose a new evaluation protocol. It allows us to compare the relative robustness of six types of click models under various shifts, training configurations, and downstream tasks. We obtain insights into the factors that worsen the sensitivity to PDS and formulate guidelines to mitigate the risks of deploying policies based on click models.}

	abstract = {Data sparsity has been a long-standing issue for accurate and trustworthy recommendation systems (RS). To alleviate the problem, many researchers pay much attention to cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which aims at transferring rich knowledge from related source domains to enhance the recommendation performance of sparse target domain. To reach the knowledge transferring purpose, recent CDR works always focus on designing different pairwise directed or undirected information transferring strategies between source and target domains. However, such pairwise transferring idea is difficult to adapt to multi-target CDR scenarios directly, e.g., transferring knowledge between multiple domains and improving their performance simultaneously, as such strategies may lead the following issues: (1) When the number of domains increases, the number of transferring modules will grow exponentially, which causes heavy computation complexity. (2) A single pairwise transferring module could only capture the relevant information of two domains, but ignores the correlated information of other domains, which may limit the transferring effectiveness. (3) When a sparse domain serves as the source domain during the pairwise transferring, it would easily leads the negative transfer problem, and the untrustworthy information may hurt the target domain recommendation performance. In this article, we consider the key challenge of the multi-target CDR task: How to identify the most valuable trustworthy information over multiple domains and transfer such information efficiently to avoid the negative transfer problem? To fulfill the above challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end model termed as  DR-MTCDR , standing for  D isentangled  R epresentations learning for  M ulti- T arget  CDR . DR-MTCDR aims at transferring the trustworthy domain-shared information across domains, which has the two major advantages in both efficiency and effectiveness: (1) For efficiency, DR-MTCDR utilizes a unified module on all domains to capture disentangled domain-shared information and domain-specific information, which could support all domain recommendation and be insensitive to the number of domains. (2) For effectiveness, based on the disentangled domain-shared and domain-specific information, DR-MTCDR has the capability to lead positive effect and make trustworthy recommendation for each domain. Empirical evaluations on datasets from both public datasets and real-world large-scale financial datasets have shown that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict a user’s next interacted item given his/her historical interactions. Most existing sequential recommendation systems model user preferences only with item-level representations, where a user’s interaction sequence are often modeled with sequential or graph-based method to infer the user’s sequential interaction pattern. However, since a user’s preference factors may vary over time, the user modeling on item-level could hardly represent the user’s preference precisely and sufficiently, resulting in suboptimal recommendation performance. In addition, the recommendation results based on the item-level user representations lack the interpretability of preference factors. To address these problems, we propose a novel SR model with dual-view user representations in this article, namely DUVRec, where a user’s preference is learned based on the representations of two distinct views, i.e.,  item view  and  factor view . Specifically, the item-view user representation is learned as the previous SR models to encode the user preference of item level, while the factor-view user representation is learned by an coarse-grained graph embedding method to explicitly represent the user in terms of preference factors. As a result, such dual-view user representations are more comprehensive than that in the previous SR models, leading to enhanced SR performance. Furthermore, we design a contrastive learning strategy to achieve mutual complementation between these two views. Our extensive experiments upon three benchmark datasets justify DUVRec’s superior performance over the state-of-the-art SR models, including the advantage of the dual-view contrastive learning. In addition, DUVRec’s capability of providing explanations on recommendation results is also demonstrated through some specific case studies.}

	abstract = {Graph learning-based collaborative filtering (GLCF), which is built upon the message-passing mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs), has received great recent attention and exhibited superior performance in recommender systems. However, although GNNs can be easily compromised by adversarial attacks as shown by the prior work, little attention has been paid to the vulnerability of GLCF. Questions like can GLCF models be just as easily fooled as GNNs remain largely unexplored. In this article, we propose to study the vulnerability of GLCF. Specifically, we first propose an adversarial attack against CLCF. Considering the unique challenges of attacking GLCF, we propose to adopt the greedy strategy in searching for the local optimal perturbations and design a reasonable attacking utility function to handle the non-differentiable ranking-oriented metrics. Next, we propose a defense to robustify GCLF. The defense is based on the observation that attacks usually introduce suspicious interactions into the graph to manipulate the message-passing process. We then propose to measure the suspicious score of each interaction and further reduce the message weight of suspicious interactions. We also give a theoretical guarantee of its robustness. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of both our attack and defense.}

	abstract = {Neural document ranking models perform impressively well due to superior language understanding gained from pre-training tasks. However, due to their complexity and large number of parameters these (typically transformer-based) models are often non-interpretable in that ranking decisions can not be clearly attributed to specific parts of the input documents. In this article, we propose ranking models that are inherently interpretable by generating explanations as a by-product of the prediction decision. We introduce the  Select-And-Rank  paradigm for document ranking, where we first output an explanation as a selected subset of sentences in a document. Thereafter, we solely use the explanation or selection to make the prediction, making explanations first-class citizens in the ranking process. Technically, we treat sentence selection as a latent variable trained jointly with the ranker from the final output. To that end, we propose an end-to-end training technique for  Select-And-Rank  models utilizing  reparameterizable subset sampling  using the  Gumbel-max trick . We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach is competitive to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is broadly applicable to numerous ranking tasks and furthers the goal of building models that are  interpretable by design . Finally, we present real-world applications that benefit from our sentence selection method.}

	abstract = {Neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years, especially with pre-trained language models. However, deep neural models are notorious for their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Adversarial attacks may become a new type of web spamming technique given our increased reliance on neural information retrieval models. Therefore, it is important to study potential adversarial attacks to identify vulnerabilities of NRMs before they are deployed. In this article, we introduce the Word Substitution Ranking Attack (WSRA) task against NRMs, which aims at promoting a target document in rankings by adding adversarial perturbations to its text. We focus on the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers cannot directly get access to the model information, but can only query the target model to obtain the rank positions of the partial retrieved list. This attack setting is realistic in real-world search engines. We propose a novel Pseudo Relevance-based ADversarial ranking Attack method (PRADA) that learns a surrogate model based on Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) to generate gradients for finding the adversarial perturbations. Experiments on two web search benchmark datasets show that PRADA can outperform existing attack strategies and successfully fool the NRM with small indiscernible perturbations of text.}

	abstract = {Federated recommender system (FRS) , which enables many local devices to train a shared model jointly without transmitting local raw data, has become a prevalent recommendation paradigm with privacy-preserving advantages. However, previous work on FRS performs similarity search via inner product in continuous embedding space, which causes an efficiency bottleneck when the scale of items is extremely large. We argue that such a scheme in federated settings ignores the limited capacities in resource-constrained user devices (i.e., storage space, computational overhead, and communication bandwidth), and makes it harder to be deployed in large-scale recommender systems. Besides, it has been shown that transmitting local gradients in real-valued form between server and clients may leak users’ private information. To this end, we propose a lightweight federated recommendation framework with privacy-preserving matrix factorization,  LightFR , that is able to generate high-quality binary codes by exploiting learning to hash technique under federated settings, and thus enjoys both fast online inference and economic memory consumption. Moreover, we devise an efficient federated discrete optimization algorithm to collaboratively train model parameters between the server and clients, which can effectively prevent real-valued gradient attacks from malicious parties. Through extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, we show that our LightFR model outperforms several state-of-the-art FRS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, inference efficiency, and data privacy.}

	abstract = {Similar text search aims to find texts relevant to a given query from a database, which is fundamental in many information retrieval applications, such as question search and exercise search. Since millions of texts always exist behind practical search engine systems, a well-developed text search system usually consists of recall and ranking stages. Specifically, the recall stage serves as the basis in the system, where the main purpose is to find a small set of relevant candidates accurately and efficiently. Towards this goal, deep semantic hashing, which projects original texts into compact hash codes, can support good search performance. However, learning desired textual hash codes is extremely difficult due to the following problems. First, compact hash codes (with short length) can improve retrieval efficiency, but the demand for learning compact hash codes cannot guarantee accuracy due to severe information loss. Second, existing methods always learn the unevenly distributed codes in the space from a local perspective, leading to unsatisfactory code-balance results. Third, a large fraction of textual data contains various types of noise in real-world applications, which causes the deviation of semantics in hash codes. To this end, in this article, we first propose a general unsupervised encoder-decoder semantic hashing framework, namely MASH (short for Memory-bAsed Semantic Hashing), to learn the balanced and compact hash codes for similar text search. Specifically, with a target of retaining semantic information as much as possible, the encoder introduces a novel relevance constraint among informative high-dimensional representations to guide the compact hash code learning. Then, we design an external memory where the hashing learning can be optimized in the global space to ensure the code balance of the learning results, which can promote search efficiency. Besides, to alleviate the performance degradation problem of the model caused by text noise, we propose an improved SMASH (short for denoiSing Memory-bAsed Semantic Hashing) model by incorporating a noise-aware encoder-decoder framework. This framework considers the noise degree for each text from the semantic deviation aspect, ensuring the robustness of hash codes. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in three real-world datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MASH and SMASH in generating balanced and compact hash codes, as well as the superior denoising ability of SMASH.}

	abstract = {Recently, recommender systems based on knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a popular research direction. Graph neural network (GNN) is the key technology of KG-based recommendation systems. However, existing GNNs have a significant flaw: They cannot explicitly model users’ intent in recommendations. Intent plays an essential role in users’ behaviors. For example, users may first generate an intent to purchase a certain group of items and then select a specific item from the group based on their preferences. Therefore, explicitly modeling intent has a positive significance for improving recommendation performance and providing explanations for recommendations. In this article, we propose a new model called Topic-aware Intention Network (TIN) for explainable recommendations with KGs. TIN models user representations from both preference and intent views. Specifically, we design a relational attention graph neural network to selectively aggregate information in KG to learn user preferences, and we propose a knowledge-enhanced topic model to learn user intent, which is viewed as topics hidden in user behavior sequences. Finally, we obtain the user representation by fusing user preference and intent through an attention network. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and can generate reasonable explanations for the recommendation results.}

	abstract = {In the news recommendation, users are overwhelmed by thousands of news daily, which makes the users’ behavior data have high sparsity. Therefore, only considering a single user’s personalized preferences cannot support the news recommendation. How to improve the relatedness of news and users and reduce data sparsity has become a hot issue. Recent studies have attempted to use graph models to enrich the relationship between users and news, but they are still limited to modeling the historical behaviors of a single user. To fill the gap, we integrate user-news relationships and the overall user historical clicked news sequences to construct a global heterogeneous transition graph. And a refinement approach is proposed to recognize the news transition patterns in the graph. Based on the global heterogeneous transition graph, we propose a heterogeneous transition graph attention network to capture the common behavior patterns of most users to enhance the representation of user interest. Fusing the users’ personalized and common interest, we propose the  GAINRec  model to recommend news effectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public news recommendation datasets, and the results show the superiority of the proposed  GAINRec  model compared with the state-of-the-art news recommendation models. The implementation of our model is available at  https://github.com/newsrec/GAINRec .}

This work studies automatic quotation recommendation for online conversations. Unlike the previous works that only consider semantic-level modeling, we adopt topic-level representation to facilitate the recommendation. A hierarchical architecture that is based on a pretrained language model is adopted to model the semantic-level conversation representation, and a neural topic model is employed to learn the topic-level representation. Moreover, the semantic-level conversation modeling is enhanced by a topic-aware attention mechanism, which is adopted to capture the interactive conversation structure from the perspective of word co-occurrence. The joint training of semantic- and topic-based recommendation leads to significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art models on two large-scale datasets. Apart from the novel and advanced recommendation framework, we conduct extensive quantitative experiments to investigate the difficulty of the quotation recommendation task, validate the topic-based recommendation assumption, and explore the stability of the recommendation. Some qualitative experiments and analyses are also included to interpret the quotation and topic distribution for some instances. All the extensive experiments and analyses provide persuasive explanations and interpretations of the module design and the recommendation results.}

	abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing is one of the prime movers for the orchestration of location-based tasks, and task recommendation is a crucial means to help workers discover attractive tasks. While a number of existing studies have focused on modeling workers’ geographical preferences in task recommendation, they ignore the phenomenon of workers’ travel intention drifts across geographical areas, i.e., workers tend to have different intentions when they travel in different areas, which discounts the task recommendation quality of existing methods especially for workers that travel in unfamiliar out-of-town areas. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Task Recommendation ( AdaTaskRec ) framework. Specifically, we first give a novel two-module worker preference learning architecture that can calculate workers’ preferences for POIs (that tasks are associated with) in different areas adaptively based on workers’ current locations. If we detect that a worker is in the hometown area, then we apply the hometown preference learning module, which hybrids different strategies to aggregate workers’ travel intentions into their preferences while considering the transition and the sequence patterns among locations. Otherwise, we invoke the out-of-town preference learning module, which is to capture workers’ preferences by learning their travel intentions and transferring their hometown preferences into their out-of-town ones. Additionally, to improve task recommendation effectiveness, we propose a dynamic top- k  recommendation method that sets different  k  values dynamically according to the numbers of neighboring workers and tasks. We also give an extra-reward-based and a fair top- k  recommendation method, which introduce the extra rewards for tasks based on their recommendation rounds and consider exposure-based fairness of tasks, respectively. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

One crucial advantage of this approach is that such models can exploit inverted indexes for top- k  retrieval, thereby leveraging decades of work on efficient query evaluation. Yet, there remain many open questions about how these learned representations fit within the existing literature, which our work aims to tackle using four representative learned sparse models. We find that impact weights generated by transformers appear to greatly reduce opportunities for skipping and early exiting optimizations in well-studied document-at-a-time ( DaaT ) approaches. Similarly, “off-the-shelf” application of score-at-a-time ( SaaT ) processing exhibits a mismatch between these weights and assumptions behind accumulator management strategies. Building on these observations, we present solutions to address deficiencies with both  DaaT  and  SaaT  approaches, yielding substantial speedups in query evaluation. Our detailed empirical analysis demonstrates that both methods lie on the effectiveness–efficiency Pareto frontier, indicating that the optimal choice for deployment depends on operational constraints.}

	abstract = {Cross-domain recommendation aims to exploit heterogeneous information from a data-sufficient domain (source domain) to transfer knowledge to a data-scarce domain (target domain). A majority of existing methods focus on unidirectional transfer that leverages the domain-shared information to facilitate the recommendation of the target domain. Nevertheless, it is more beneficial to improve the recommendation performance of both domains simultaneously via a dual transfer learning schema, which is known as bidirectional cross-domain recommendation (BCDR). Existing BCDR methods have their limitations, since they only perform bidirectional transfer learning based on domain-shared representations while neglecting rich information that is private to each domain. In this article, we argue that users may have domain-biased preferences due to the characteristics of that domain. Namely, the domain-specific preference information also plays a critical role in the recommendation. To effectively leverage the domain-specific information, we propose a  M ulti-level  A ttention-based  D omain  D isentanglement framework dubbed  MADD  for BCDR, which explicitly leverages the attention mechanism to construct personalized preference with both domain-invariant and domain-specific features obtained by disentangling raw user embeddings. Specifically, the domain-invariant feature is exploited by domain-adversarial learning while the domain-specific feature is learned by imposing an orthogonal loss. We then conduct a reconstruction process on disentangled features to ensure semantic-sufficiency. After that, we devise a multi-level attention mechanism for these disentangled features, which determines their contributions to the final personalized user preference embedding by dynamically learning the attention scores of individual features. We train the model in a multi-task learning fashion to benefit both domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation approaches.}

	abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) estimation plays a crucial role in modern online personalization services. It is essential to capture users’ drifting interests by modeling sequential user behaviors to build an accurate CTR estimation model. However, as the users accumulate a large amount of behavioral data on the online platforms, the current CTR models have to truncate user behavior sequences and utilize the most recent behaviors, which leads to a problem that sequential patterns such as periodicity or long-term dependency are not contained in the recent behaviors but in far back history. However, it is non-trivial to model the entire user sequence by directly using it for two reasons. Firstly, the very long input sequences will make online inference time and system load infeasible. Secondly, the very long sequences contain much noise, thus making it difficult for CTR models to capture useful patterns effectively. To tackle this issue, we consider it from the input data perspective instead of designing more sophisticated yet complex models. As the entire user behavior sequence contains much noise, it is unnecessary to input the entire sequence. Instead, we could just  retrieve  only a small part of it as the input to the CTR model. In this article, we propose the  U ser  B ehavior  R etrieval (UBR) framework which aims at  learning to retrieve  the most informative user behaviors according to each CTR estimation request. Retrieving only a small set of behaviors could alleviate the two problems of utilizing very long sequences (i.e., inference efficiency and noisy input). The distinguishing property of UBR is that it supports  arbitrary and learnable retrieval functions  instead of utilizing a fixed pre-defined function, which is different from the current retrieval-based methods. Offline evaluations on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and efficacy of the UBR framework. We further deploy UBR at the Huawei App Store, where it achieves 6.6% of eCPM gain in the online A/B test and now serves the main traffic in the Huawei App Store advertising scenario.}

	abstract = {For care of chronic diseases (e.g., depression, diabetes, hypertension), it is critical to identify effective treatment pathways that aim to promptly update the medication following the change of patient state and disease progression. This task is challenging because the optimal treatment pathway for each patient needs to be personalized due to the significant heterogeneity among individuals. Therefore, it is naturally promising to investigate how to use the abundant electronic health records to recommend effective and safe prescriptions. However, prescription recommendation needs to consider multiple aspects of life-critical evidence, such as the information relevance in terms of medical concepts, the health condition in terms of diagnosis history, and the further constraint in terms of side information (e.g., patient demographics and drug side effects). To this end, in this article, we propose a novel prescription recommendation framework named OntoPath to predict the next drug in disease treatment pathways, by building an ontology-aware hierarchical-attention model that integrates multiple medical evidence from domain knowledge guidance, medical history profiling, and side information utilization. Specifically, our method can be characterized from three aspects: (1) by incorporating the longitudinal diagnosis history, we enrich the profiling of patients in terms of comprehensive health conditions, which can largely influence a drug’s outcome on individual patients; (2) using the hierarchical disease and drug ontology structures, we are able to model the domain-specific relevance between patients and drugs at multiple levels of granularity and achieve in-depth collaborative filtering; (3) we introduce a pre-training stage to enhance the discriminativeness of network representations, which helps us obtain a premium model initialization to further boost the final recommendation training. We perform extensive experiments on a large-scale depression cohort with over 37,000 patients from a real-world medical claims database. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of OntoPath through the consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art prescription recommendation baselines and the interpretation of model mechanism in case studies.}

	abstract = {Digital experiments are routinely used to test the value of a treatment relative to a status-quo control setting—for instance, a new search relevance algorithm for a website or a new results layout for a mobile app. As digital experiments have become increasingly pervasive in organizations and a wide variety of research areas, their growth has prompted a new set of challenges for experimentation platforms. One challenge is that experiments often focus on the average treatment effect (ATE) without explicitly considering differences across major sub-groups: heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE). This is especially problematic, because ATEs have decreased in many organizations as the more obvious benefits have already been realized. However, questions abound regarding the pervasiveness of user HTEs and how best to detect them. We propose a framework for detecting and analyzing user HTEs in digital experiments. Our framework combines an array of user characteristics with double machine learning. Analysis of 27 real-world experiments spanning 1.76 billion sessions and simulated data demonstrates the effectiveness of our detection method relative to existing techniques. We also find that transaction, demographic, engagement, satisfaction, and lifecycle characteristics exhibit statistically significant HTEs in 10% to 20% of our real-world experiments, underscoring the importance of considering user heterogeneity when analyzing experiment results; otherwise, personalized features and experiences cannot happen, thus reducing effectiveness. In terms of the number of experiments and user sessions, we are not aware of any study that has examined user HTEs at this scale. Our findings have important implications for information retrieval, user modeling, platforms, and digital experience contexts, in which online experiments are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of design artifacts.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems play a significant role in information filtering and have been utilized in different scenarios, such as e-commerce and social media. With the prosperity of deep learning, deep recommender systems show superior performance by capturing non-linear information and item-user relationships. However, the design of deep recommender systems heavily relies on human experiences and expert knowledge. To tackle this problem, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is introduced to automatically search for the proper candidates for different parts of deep recommender systems. This survey performs a comprehensive review of the literature in this field. First, we propose an abstract concept for AutoML for deep recommender systems (AutoRecSys) that describes its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional AutoML techniques and recommender systems. Second, we present a taxonomy as a classification framework containing feature selection search, embedding dimension search, feature interaction search, model architecture search, and other components search. Furthermore, we put a particular emphasis on the search space and search strategy, as they are the common thread to connect all methods within each category and enable practitioners to analyze and compare various approaches. Finally, we propose four future promising research directions that will lead this line of research.}

	abstract = {On-device session-based recommendation systems have been achieving increasing attention on account of the low energy/resource consumption and privacy protection while providing promising recommendation performance. To fit the powerful neural session-based recommendation models in resource-constrained mobile devices, tensor-train decomposition and its variants have been widely applied to reduce memory footprint by decomposing the embedding table into smaller tensors, showing great potential in compressing recommendation models. However, these model compression techniques significantly increase the local inference time due to the complex process of generating index lists and a series of tensor multiplications to form item embeddings. The resultant on-device recommender fails to provide real-time responses and recommendations. To improve the online recommendation efficiency, we propose to learn compositional encoding-based compact item representations. Specifically, each item is represented by a compositional code that consists of several codewords, and we learn embedding vectors to represent each codeword instead of each item. Then the composition of the codeword embedding vectors from different embedding matrices (i.e., codebooks) forms the item embedding. Since the size of codebooks can be extremely small, the recommender model is thus able to fit in resource-constrained devices and save the codebooks for fast local inference. In addition, to prevent the loss of model capacity caused by compression, we propose a bidirectional self-supervised knowledge distillation framework. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared with existing methods, the proposed on-device recommender not only achieves an 8× inference speedup with a large compression ratio but also shows superior recommendation performance.

	abstract = {Providing user-understandable explanations to justify recommendations could help users better understand the recommended items, increase the system’s ease of use, and gain users’ trust. A typical approach to realize it is natural language generation. However, previous works mostly adopt recurrent neural networks to meet the ends, leaving the potentially more effective pre-trained Transformer models under-explored. In fact, user and item IDs, as important identifiers in recommender systems, are inherently in different semantic space as words that pre-trained models were already trained on. Thus, how to effectively fuse IDs into such models becomes a critical issue. Inspired by recent advancement in prompt learning, we come up with two solutions: find alternative words to represent IDs (called discrete prompt learning) and directly input ID vectors to a pre-trained model (termed continuous prompt learning). In the latter case, ID vectors are randomly initialized but the model is trained in advance on large corpora, so they are actually in different learning stages. To bridge the gap, we further propose two training strategies: sequential tuning and recommendation as regularization. Extensive experiments show that our continuous prompt learning approach equipped with the training strategies consistently outperforms strong baselines on three datasets of explainable recommendation.}

	abstract = {Knowledge tracing, the goal of which is predicting students’ future performance given their past question response sequences to trace their knowledge states, is pivotal for computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems. Although many technical efforts have been devoted to modeling students based on their question-response sequences, fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs within each sequence is underexplored. This causes question-response representations less contextualized and further limits student modeling. To address this issue, we first conduct a data analysis and reveal the existence of complex cross effects between different question-response pairs within a sequence. Consequently, we propose MRT-KT, a multi-relational transformer for knowledge tracing, to enable fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs. It introduces a novel relation encoding scheme based on knowledge concepts and student performance. Comprehensive experimental results show that MRT-KT outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods on four widely-used datasets, validating the effectiveness of considering fine-grained interaction for knowledge tracing.}

	abstract = {Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) is a recently proposed task that aims to extract the potential clause pairs of emotions and its corresponding causes in a document. In this article, we propose a new paradigm for the ECPE task. We cast the task as a two-turn machine reading comprehension (MRC) task, i.e., the extraction of emotions and causes is transformed to the task of identifying answer clauses from the input document specific to a query. This two-turn MRC formalization brings several key advantages: First, the QA manner provides an explicit pairing way to identify causes specific to the target emotion; second, it provides a natural way of jointly modeling the emotion extraction, the cause extraction, and the pairing of emotion and cause; and third, it allows us to exploit the well-developed MRC models. Based on the two-turn MRC formalization, we propose a dual-MRC framework to extract emotion-cause pairs in a dual-direction way, which enables a more comprehensive coverage of all pairing cases. Furthermore, we propose a consistent training strategy for the second-turn query, so the model is able to filter the errors produced by the first turn at inference. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this article, we propose a multi-auxiliary augmented collaborative variational auto-encoder (MA-CVAE) for tag recommendation, which couples item collaborative information and item multi-auxiliary information, i.e., content and social graph, by defining a generative process. Specifically, the model learns deep latent embeddings from different item auxiliary information using variational auto-encoders (VAE), which could form a generative distribution over each auxiliary information by introducing a latent variable parameterized by deep neural network. Moreover, to recommend tags for new items, item multi-auxiliary latent embeddings are utilized as a surrogate through the item decoder for predicting recommendation probabilities of each tag, where reconstruction losses are added in the training phase to constrain the generation for feedback predictions via different auxiliary embeddings. In addition, an inductive variational graph auto-encoder is designed to infer latent embeddings of new items in the test phase, such that item social information could be exploited for new items. Extensive experiments on MovieLens and citeulike datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.}

	abstract = {Sequential recommendation models aim to predict the interested items to a user based on his historical behaviors. To train sequential recommenders, implicit feedback data is widely adopted since it is easier to obtain than explicit feedback data. In the setting of implicit feedback, a user’s historical behaviors can be characterized as a chronologically ordered sequence of interacted items. From a perspective of machine learning, the historical interaction sequence and the recommended items can be considered as  context  and  label , respectively, which are usually in one-hot representations in the recommendation models. However, due to the discrete nature, one-hot representations are hard to sufficiently reflect the underlying user preference, and might also contain noise from implicit feedback that will mislead the model training. To solve these issues, we propose a general optimization framework, Multi-View Smoothness (MVS), to enhance the smoothness of sequential recommendation models in both data representations and model learning. Specifically, with the help of a complementary model, we smooth and enrich the one-hot representations of contexts and labels to better depict the underlying user preference (i.e., context smoothness and label smoothness), and devise a model regularization strategy to enforce the neighborhood smoothness of the model itself (i.e., model smoothness). Based on these strategies, we design three regularizers to constrain and improve the training of sequential recommendation models. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our approach is able to improve the performance of various base models consistently and outperform other regularization training methods.}

However, it still lacks more theoretical insights or an ideal optimization objective function compared with the other more well-studied routes without a randomized dataset. To bridge this gap, we study the debiasing problem from a new perspective and propose to directly minimize the upper bound of an ideal objective function, which facilitates a better potential solution to system-induced biases. First, we formulate a new ideal optimization objective function with a randomized dataset. Second, according to the prior constraints that an adopted loss function may satisfy, we derive two different upper bounds of the objective function: a generalization error bound with triangle inequality and a generalization error bound with separability. Third, we show that most existing related methods can be regarded as the insufficient optimization of these two upper bounds. Fourth, we propose a novel method called  debiasing approximate upper bound  ( DUB ) with a randomized dataset, which achieves a more sufficient optimization of these upper bounds. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a real product dataset to verify the effectiveness of our DUB.}

	abstract = {The development of deep neural networks and the emergence of pre-trained language models such as BERT allow to increase performance on many NLP tasks. However, these models do not meet the same popularity for tweet stream summarization, which is probably because their computation limitation requires to drastically truncate the textual input. Our contribution in this article is threefold. First, we propose a neural model to automatically and incrementally summarize huge tweet streams. This extractive model combines in an original way pre-trained language models and vocabulary frequency based representations to predict tweet salience. An additional advantage of the model is that it automatically adapts the size of the output summary according to the input tweet stream. Second, we detail an original methodology to construct tweet stream summarization datasets requiring little human effort. Third, we release the TES 2012-2016 dataset constructed using the aforementioned methodology. Baselines, oracle summaries, gold standard, and qualitative assessments are made publicly available. To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive quantitative experiments using three different tweet collections as well as an additional qualitative evaluation. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ones. We believe that this work opens avenues of research for incremental summarization, which has not received much attention yet.}

	abstract = {Lexical and semantic matching capture different successful approaches to text retrieval and the fusion of their results has proven to be more effective and robust than either alone. Prior work performs hybrid retrieval by conducting lexical and semantic matching using different systems (e.g., Lucene and Faiss, respectively) and then fusing their model outputs. In contrast, our work integrates lexical representations with dense semantic representations by densifying high-dimensional lexical representations into what we call low-dimensional dense lexical representations (DLRs). Our experiments show that DLRs can effectively approximate the original lexical representations, preserving effectiveness while improving query latency. Furthermore, we can combine dense lexical and semantic representations to generate dense hybrid representations (DHRs) that are more flexible and yield faster retrieval compared to existing hybrid techniques. In addition, we explore  jointly  training lexical and semantic representations in a single model and empirically show that the resulting DHRs are able to combine the advantages of the individual components. Our best DHR model is competitive with state-of-the-art single-vector and multi-vector dense retrievers in both in-domain and zero-shot evaluation settings. Furthermore, our model is both faster and requires smaller indexes, making our dense representation framework an attractive approach to text retrieval.

	abstract = {Recommender systems are currently widely used in various applications helping people filter information. Existing models always embed the rich information for recommendation, such as items, users, and contexts in real-value vectors, and make predictions based on these vectors. In the view of causal inference, the associations between representation vectors and user feedback are inevitably a mixture of the causal part that describes why a user prefers an item, and the non-causal part that merely reflects the statistical dependencies, for example, the display ranking position and sales promotion. However, most recommender systems assume the user-item interactions are only affected by user preferences, neglecting the striking differences between these two associations. To address this problem, we propose a model-agnostic causal learning framework called IV4Rec+ that can effectively decompose the embedding vectors into these two parts. Moreover, two strategies are proposed to utilize search queries as instrumental variables: IV4Rec+(I) only decomposes the item embeddings, while IV4Rec+(UI) decomposes both user and item embeddings. IV4Rec+ is a model-agnostic design that can be applied to many existing recommender systems, e.g., DIN, NRHUB, and SRGNN. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that IV4Rec+ significantly facilitates the performance of recommender systems and outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks.}

	abstract = {The prevalence of location-based services has generated a deluge of check-ins, enabling the task of human mobility understanding. Among the various types of information associated with the check-in venues, categories (e.g.,  Bar  and  Museum ) are vital to the task, as they often serve as excellent semantic characterization of the venues. Despite its significance and importance, a large portion of venues in the check-in services do not have even a single category label, such as up to 30% of venues in the Foursquare system lacking category labels. We, therefore, address the problem of semantic venue annotation, i.e., labeling the venue with a semantic category. Existing methods either fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the check-in sequences, or do not consider the semantic correlations across related categories. As such, we devise a Tree-guided Multi-task Embedding model (TME for short) to learn effective representations of venues and categories for the semantic annotation. TME jointly learns a common feature space by modeling multi-contexts of check-ins and utilizes the predefined category hierarchy to regularize the relatedness among categories. We evaluate TME over the task of semantic venue annotation on two check-in datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of TME over several state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Legal judgment prediction (LJP) is a fundamental task of legal artificial intelligence. It aims to automatically predict the judgment results of legal cases. Three typical subtasks are relevant law article prediction, charge prediction, and term-of-penalty prediction. Due to the wide range of potential applications, LJP has attracted a great deal of interest, prompting the development of numerous approaches. These methods mainly focus on building a more accurate representation of a case’s fact description in order to improve the performance of judgment prediction. They overlook, however, the practical judicial scenario in which human judges often compare similar law articles or possible charges before making a final decision. To this end, we propose a supervised contrastive learning framework for the LJP task. Specifically, we train the model to distinguish (1) various law articles within the same chapter of a Law and (2) similar charges of the same law article or related law articles. By this means, the fine-grained differences between similar articles/charges can be captured, which are important for making a judgment. Besides, we optimize our model by identifying cases with the same article/charge labels, allowing it to more effectively model the relationship between the case’s fact description and its associated labels. By jointly learning the LJP task with the aforementioned contrastive learning tasks, our model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models on two real-world datasets.}

	abstract = {Debiased recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Traditional models mostly rely on the inverse propensity score (IPS), which can be hard to estimate and may suffer from the high variance issue. To alleviate these problems, in this article, we propose a novel debiased recommendation framework based on user feature balancing. The general idea is to introduce a projection function to adjust user feature distributions, such that the ideal unbiased learning objective can be upper bounded by a solvable objective purely based on the offline dataset. In the upper bound, the projected user distributions are expected to be equal given different items. From the causal inference perspective, this requirement aims to remove the causal relation from the user to the item, which enables us to achieve unbiased recommendation, bypassing the computation of IPS. To efficiently balance the user distributions upon each item pair, we propose three strategies, including clipping, sampling, and adversarial learning to improve the training process. For more robust optimization, we deploy an explicit model to capture the potential latent confounders in recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work on debiased recommendation based on confounder balancing. In the experiments, we compare our framework with many state-of-the-art methods based on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is effective in promoting the recommendation performance.}

	abstract = {Recently, knowledge-grounded dialogue systems have gained increasing attention. Great efforts have been made to build response matching models where all dialogue content and knowledge sentences are leveraged. However, knowledge redundancy and distraction of irrelevant dialogue content often exist in knowledge-grounded conversations, which may affect the matching process and lead to inferior performance. In addition, irrelevant dialogue history and excessive knowledge also hinder the exploitation of popular pre-trained language models (PLMs) due to the limitation of input length. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge-grounded dialogue model based on PLMs, where a knowledge selector and a context selector are designed for filtering out irrelevant knowledge sentences and redundant dialogue history, respectively. Considering the lack of labeled data for the learning of two selectors, we pre-train them with weakly-supervised tasks and then jointly conduct the optimization of knowledge and context selection and fine-tuning of PLMs for response ranking with reinforcement learning (RL). By this means, the dialogue model can distill more accurate and concise knowledge and dialogue content for subsequent response ranking module, and the overall model can converge and perform better. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks and evaluation results indicate that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The goal of a next basket recommendation (NBR) system is to recommend items for the next basket for a user, based on the sequence of their prior baskets. We examine whether the performance gains of the NBR methods reported in the literature hold up under a fair and comprehensive comparison. To clarify the mixed picture that emerges from our comparison, we provide a novel angle on the evaluation of next basket recommendation (NBR) methods, centered on the distinction between repetition and exploration: the next basket is typically composed of previously consumed items (i.e., repeat items) and new items (i.e., explore items). We propose a set of metrics that measure the repetition/exploration ratio and performance of NBR models. Using these new metrics, we provide a second analysis of state-of-the-art NBR models. The results help to clarify the extent of the actual progress achieved by existing NBR methods as well as the underlying reasons for any improvements that we observe. Overall, our work sheds light on the evaluation problem of NBR, provides a new evaluation protocol, and yields useful insights for the design of models for this task.}
