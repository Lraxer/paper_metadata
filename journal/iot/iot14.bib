	abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by frequent seizures, which severely impact the quality of life of epilepsy patients and sometimes are accompanied by loss of consciousness. The most widely accepted and used tool by epileptologists to identify seizures and diagnose epilepsy is the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG). Seizure detection on EEG signals is a long process, which is done manually by epileptologists. This paper describes how to analyze EEG signal using Data Mining methods and techniques with the main objective of automatically detect a seizure within EEG signals. We have designed and developed a multipurpose and extendable tool for feature extraction from time series data, named Training Builder. Our trained classifier, based on signal processing, sliding window paradigm, features extraction and selection, and Support Vector Machines, showed excellent results, reaching an accuracy of over 99% during the test made on publicly available EEG datasets.}

	abstract = {The theft and exfiltration of sensitive data (e.g. state secrets, trade secrets, company records, etc.) represent one of the most damaging threats that can be carried by malicious insiders against institutions and organizations. In the last decade, data leak prevention (DLP) has emerged as a new mechanism to detect and block unauthorized data transfer from the organization perimeter. While DLP has gained traction and led to several commercial products in industry, there are still many unresolved challenges hampering its operation and full adoption. Existing DLP systems exhibit relatively limited accuracy and can be circumvented using various evasive tactics. In this paper, we present a new DLP model that tracks sensitive data using a summarized version of the content semantic called document semantic signature (DSS). The DSS can be updated dynamically as the protected content change and it is resilient against evasion tactics, such as content rewriting. The evaluation of the DSS model on a public dataset achieved very encouraging results in terms of detection effectiveness.}

Today, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being integrated with various types of medical systems in order to provide cost-effective, ubiquitous, on-time healthcare services to people who need them. Presently, the healthcare system has evolved into a complex ecosystem which consists of a wide range of devices, databases, communication technologies that work together to provide different healthcare services. In many healthcare information systems, these technologies and resources need to interact and collaborate with or without human intervention to enable the healthcare system to achieve its goal of providing efficient healthcare services. The Internet of Things technology has the potential to provide connectivity for a global network of billions of devices and it can therefore be harnessed to improve the quality and delivery of healthcare services. We explore and discuss how IoT-based connectivity can deliver improved healthcare solutions. We describe IoT-based healthcare solutions that have been implemented recently. Finally, we discuss future opportunities that can be explored for improved healthcare solutions based on the IoT concept.}

In this paper, a service oriented IoT architecture for an early warning system (EWS) through implementation of machine learning (ML) algorithm in a cloud server is presented. Unlike other EWS approaches, our implementation includes layer level IoT architecture with a triple modular redundancy fault tolerant scheme for sensor network to guarantee availability of reliable and fault free sensor data to the cloud for accurate predictions. A ML algorithm is implemented for three sensor parameters viz., MQ4, MQ7 and force sensing resistor on the AWS cloud.

This can generate significant unpredictable and unbalanced data loads for the bearing IoT network to support its application and service demands. We thus propose a wireless routing scheme designed to use the Particle Filter algorithm to empower portable smart devices with intelligent capacities for the radio communication system. This facilitates the offloading of traffic from traditional wireless networks and enables the IoT system to adopt unmanned aerial vehicles, thus also offering further innovation to flying network platforms. The proposed PaFiR routing protocol offers the network more scalability, tolerance and resilience, to achieve the goal of smart relaying. Simulation results that demonstrate the routing algorithm designed offers excellent performance when compared with existing wireless relaying schemes. It provides delivery ratios that are improved by up to 40% without unmanageable increases in latency or overheads.}

	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) that deploys an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for the data gathering process differs from the common WSN system. In a UAV-WSN, the sensor nodes have a limited time to communicate with the UAV. Thus, the sensor nodes have to contend with each other to transmit their data to the UAV within a short amount of time. The fairness among the contended nodes is degraded, which affects the network performance in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio (PDR). To overcome this issue, an effective protocol that can maintain or increase fairness among nodes is needed. This paper proposes a novel protocol named HP-MAC which is a hybrid medium access control (MAC) protocol for data gathering in a UAV-WSN. This proposed scheme works by setting the UAV to periodically send a beacon frame to sensor nodes in order to inform its presence, then each sensor node that receives the beacon frame contends to send a registration frame to the UAV. A second beacon frame then transmitted by the UAV to the registered nodes regarding their transmission schedule. HP-MAC uses CSMA/CA during the registration process of the sensor nodes and allocates the registered sensor nodes time slots in the data gathering process. The time-slot scheme is used to determine the transmission schedule of each sensor based on their priority during the registration process. The results show that the proposed MAC protocol achieved fairness while enhancing network performance in terms of PDR and throughput.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast growing and rapidly evolving field. Everyday objects from smart home appliances (e.g. toasters and refrigerators) to health monitoring products (e.g. pacemakers and blood pressure monitors), to minuscule sensors and actuators, are being redesigned to be able to transfer data over a network. The connection of billions of these new objects to the Internet will cause a dramatic increase in the amount of shared data, which will simultaneously introduce a plethora of security risks. Understanding how to secure the data being sent over IoT links is necessary for the IoT paradigm to succeed. A popular data transfer protocol connecting IoT devices is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). We used an open-source implementation of CoAP along with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to implement secure data transfer between IoT devices. We studied the impact of DTLS on CoAP in the real IoT testbed we have developed using resource-constrained IoT devices and open-source software. Our tests showed that utilizing a CoAP-DTLS implementation with a symmetric key cipher suite resulted in noticeable performance costs. A secure connection with DTLS over CoAP used approximately 10% more energy than an unsecure connection. In addition, our latency tests revealed over a 100% increase in average latency time for secure messages compared to when no encryption is used. We also highlight some of the implementation challenges encountered while developing a real IoT testbed for secure experimentation.}

As UWB technology re-emerges as a suitable solution for the Internet of Things (IoT), we consider the use of this technology for e-health applications. The dynamic channel coding (DCC-MAC) protocol was designed for very low radiated power UWB ad-hoc networks based on dynamic channel coding with interference mitigation. This protocol combines the physical and the MAC layer where the main idea is to optimize the rate by allowing interfering sources to transmit if they are outside the exclusion region. In this paper, the existing DCC-MAC protocol is modified by introducing node energy consumption with simultaneously switching the power level between the nodes. We use a joint consideration of physical and multiple access layers to minimize the energy consumption of the network, and hence increasing its lifetime.}

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an important tool for protecting the Internet of Things (IoT) networks against cyber-attacks. Traditional IDSs can only distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors. On the other hand, modern techniques can identify the kind of attack so that the appropriate reactions can be carried out against each type of attack. However, these techniques always suffer from the class-imbalance which affects the performance of IDS. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive stacked auto-encoder, CSSAE, to deal with class imbalance problem in IDS. CSSAE generates a cost matrix in which a unique cost is assigned to each class based on the distribution of different classes. This matrix is created in the first stage of CSSAE. In the second phase, a two-layer stacked auto-encoder is applied to learn features with better distinguish between the minority and the majority classes. These costs are used in the feature learning of deep learning, where the parameters of the neural network are modified by applying the corresponding costs in the cost function layer. The proposed method is able to perform on both binary-class data and multiclass data. Two well-known KDD CUP 99 and NSL-KDD datasets are used to evaluate the performance of CSSAE. Compared with other IDSs that have not considered class imbalance problem, CSSAE shows better performance in the detection of low-frequency attacks.}

	abstract = {The air pollution caused by PM2.5, PM10, and O3 is an emerging problem that threatens public health, especially in China’s megacities. Meteorological factors have significant impacts on the dilution and diffusion of air pollutants which further affect the distribution and concentration of pollutants. In this paper, we analyze the relationships between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Beijing from January 2017 to January 2018. We observe that: (1) the influence of a single meteorological factor on the concentration of pollutants is limited; (2) the temperature-wind speed combination, temperature-pressure combination, and humidity-wind speed combination are highly correlated with the concentration of pollutants, indicating that a variety of meteorological factors combine to affect the concentration of pollutants; and (3) different meteorological factors have different effects on the concentration of the same pollutant, while the same meteorological conditions have different effects on the concentration of different pollutants. Our findings can assist in predicting the air quality according to meteorological conditions while further improving the urban management performance.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most promising technologies that aims to enhance humans’ quality of life (QoL). IoT plays a significant role in several fields such as healthcare, automotive industries, agriculture, education, and many cross-cutting business applications. Addressing and analyzing IoT security issues is crucial because the working mechanisms of IoT applications vary due to the heterogeneity nature of IoT environments. Therefore, discussing the IoT security concerns in addition to available and potential solutions would assist developers and enterprises to find appropriate and timely solutions to tackle specific threats, providing the best possible IoT-based services. This paper provides a comprehensive study on IoT security issues, limitations, requirements, and current and potential solutions. The paper builds upon a taxonomy that taps into the three-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security properties and requirements for each layer. The main contribution of this survey is classifying the potential IoT security threat and challenges by an architectural view. From there, IoT security challenges and solutions are further grouped by the layered architecture for readers to get a better understanding on how to address and adopt best practices to avoid the current IoT security threats on each layer.}

	abstract = {Urbanization is imposing many challenges, and vehicular traffic management is one such challenge. It hampers smooth traffic flow, wastes time, and threats of road safety. Moreover, it also impacts the environment, economy, health, and other essential services. The root cause of traffic mismanagement is the dynamic nature of the traffic on roads and the incapability of legacy systems to interpret such dynamics in real-time. The data analysis services based on Edge Cloud frameworks in technology outfitted urban spaces provide real-time robust and smart solutions to ever facing challenges from urbanization. Hence, Edge Cloud-based traffic management can be used to manage urban vehicular traffic in real-time. In this paper, Edge Cloud-centric IoT based smart traffic management system is developed for traffic inflow prediction and time optimized smart navigation of the vehicles. The traffic inflow prediction adapts the traffic movement phase time accordingly and avoids long waiting queues and congestions at intersections. The smart navigation enables the optimal distribution of traffic to possible paths and subsequently improves road safety at intersections. Baseline classifiers are used to predict the traffic inflow, and the statistical analyses acknowledge the prediction efficiency of the J48 decision tree as compared to other utilized classifiers. Edge Computing is used for time optimized smart navigation of vehicles and, subsequently, optimal traffic load balancing in real-time. The road safety perspective of vehicles at intersections is also get benefited from the optimal traffic load balancing. The results depict the efficiency of the proposed system for smart navigation, optimal traffic load balancing, and improved road safety at intersections.}

In order to better preserve valid structural information and detail textures of source images, we propose a novel medical image fusion method in this paper. Firstly, we adopt a Rolling Guidance Filter to separate source medical images into structural component and detail component. The Laplacian Pyramid based fusion rule is used to merge the structural component. For the detail component, a sum-modified-laplacian (SML) based method is employed. At last, the result is acquired by integrating the fused structural and detail components. Experimental results demonstrate that the method is superior to conventional medical image fusion methods.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the world by connecting billions of physical and virtual objects with distinctive identities to the Internet. This fusion results in generating huge volumes of data that might not be manageable using today's storage and data analytics technologies. Although cloud computing offers services to tackle this issue at infrastructural level, its efficiency for time sensitive applications (e.g. oil, gas, and traffic monitoring) is still questionable. Arguably, transferring massive amount of data to the cloud for storage and processing may lead to cloud overloading and saturation of network bandwidth. In this study, an integrated fog and cloud computing framework is introduced to overcome the limitations of real-time analytics, latency and network congestion of basic cloud services for traffic monitoring. The proposed approach is implemented to prototype a smart traffic monitoring system (STMS). The proposed monitoring system is designed for congestion monitoring and traffic light management. It can also be tuned to detect traffic incidents that requires immediate assistance during congestion. In this framework, a tiny computer-on-module serves as a fog node to collect real-time data from geographically distributed sensors and to transfer it to the cloud for storage and processing. The results show the efficiency of the fog network in improving the performance of the cloud platform in terms of reducing the response time and increasing the bandwidth. Furthermore, the proposed integrated fog and cloud framework is interfaced with Tweeter to send alerts about traffic congestion to be subscribed users in the form of Tweet messages .}

	abstract = {The Millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum band, with its high bandwidth, will significantly satisfy the need for high data-demand of the next-generation communication networks. However, transmission over the mmWave band suffers from a short communication range due to its high frequency. Such short-range communication can dramatically affect the network connectivity in mesh-based networks, leading to excessive packet loss. To improve the network connectivity and thus the throughput, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)/drones can be utilized as relays. Along with UAVs, multi-path routing is needed to ensure better network reliability through different routes. In this paper, we propose maximizing mmWave-based mesh network connectivity via optimally deploying a number of UAVs/drones and enabling multiple parallel paths at the upper network layers. We model the optimization problem for minimizing end-to-end delay with a minimum number of drones, we further perform a delay analysis for the received queues and obtain the link layer end-to-end delay. The evaluation is first performed through MATLAB and then verified using a realistic scenario in the NS-3 simulator by assuming an IEEE 802.11ad-based wireless mesh network. The results show that the proposed UAV-assisted schemes achieve higher throughput and shorter delay compared to baselines scenario with no deployment of UAVs or single transmissions.}

The presented approach combines Internet of Things, Cloud, and Mobile technologies with the use of custom designed smart tags applied to each bottle of wine in order to provide food track and trace capabilities. The smart tags combine QR code with additional information printed with an invisible photochromatic ink. The tags are activated by flashlight on mobile devices during the scanning. Before scanning, users are prompted to select the context of the wine bottle (in store, sold, consumed) in order to provide additional information about each bottle as it moves through the supply chain. This information is used by the custom-made heuristic to help users and wine makers detect issues with individual instances of the product. The system was implemented as a pilot project that was executed during a period of 6 months. End users showed a great interest in the possibility to implement such a system, consumers liked the interaction with the product using the mobile app and smart tags, while wine makers expressed their interest in the solution. Besides counterfeit that affects profit, the benefits of such systems include improved brand protection and reduced risk of health hazards.}

This has therefore increased the cost and storage overheads in IIoT and cloud server, respectively. Aside from this, outsourcing IIoT data to semi-trusted distributed cloud servers increases the security challenges in IIoT. Although, many encryption techniques had been proposed to perform secure de-duplication over outsourced data in the cloud server. However, some of these schemes are computational intensive, do not allow data searching over the ciphertext, and could not enforce necessary security requirements especially Inside Keyword Guess Attack (IKGA). In this paper, we propose a novel faster server-aided data de-duplication scheme with an efficient authenticated key agreement. The scheme enforces data singularity, confidentiality, integrity in the IIoT and allows secure data searching over the ciphertext in the semi-trusted cloud server. The effectiveness of the scheme revolves around its capability to generate a tokenized-tag and trapdoor for every uploaded data on the server.}

There is a need for research in automated diagnosis for speeding up the process while maintaining accuracy and reducing the computational requirements. This work proposes an automated diagnosis of COVID-19 infection from CT scans of the patients using deep learning technique. The proposed model, ReCOV-101, uses full chest CT scans to detect varying degrees of COVID-19 infection. To improve the detection accuracy, the CT-scans were preprocessed by employing segmentation and interpolation. The proposed scheme is based on the residual network that takes advantage of skip connection, allowing the model to go deeper. The model was trained on a single enterprise-level GPU. It can easily be provided on a network’s edge, reducing communication with the cloud, often required for larger neural networks. This work aims to demonstrate a less hardware-intensive approach for COVID-19 detection with excellent performance that can be combined with medical equipment and help ease the examination procedure. With the proposed model, an accuracy of 94.9% was achieved.}

	abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) is a leading low-power wide-area networking technology, and LoRaWAN is the open MAC layer specification for LoRa technology. LoRaWAN operates in a star network topology, thus LoRaWAN forms single-hop network. LoRa technology allows customization of its PHY layer transmission parameters, such as bandwidth, spreading factor, transmission power, and coding rate, therefore long coverage can be achieved by using a lower bandwidth. However, a single-hop LoRaWAN network cannot achieve high data rate and long coverage simultaneous. To simultaneously achieve high data rate and long coverage, the LoRa PHY layer setting that yields the fastest data rate can be used, however it reduces coverage. To makeup for the reduced coverage multi-hop communication can be used. To enable multi-hop communication here a routing protocol for LoRa-based networks is presented. Moreover, to enable traffic engineering in LoRa-based networks, such as traffic load balancing a software-defined networking (SDN) extension for the protocol is also presented. Performance evaluation has shown that the proposed protocol and its SDN-based extension can match the coverage of LoRa PHY layer setting that offers maximum coverage at a relatively very high data rate and lower energy consumption. The protocol demonstrates up to 5 times higher packet reception ratio, and\n63\n%\nlower energy consumption compared to the LoRa PHY layer setting that offers maximum coverage and reliability. Moreover, the protocols also outperform an existing state-of-the-are routing protocol for low-power wireless networks.}

	abstract = {Distracted driving on roads has been a perennial problem. There is increasing consensus now among various stakeholders that this practice will not be eliminated with mere warnings from subject matter experts. Instead, these warnings must also be augmented with appropriate technological assistance to facilitate safer driving. There has been an urgent interest in the community to devise newer technologies for detecting when drivers are distracted on roads. In this paper, we design a computer vision techniques that process image data recorded from inside of cars to automatically infer when subjects are driving distracted. However, our innovation lies in adding context to the predictions. We do so, by first detecting and localizing a number of objects in cars that contribute to distracted driving (e.g., hands, smartphones, radio etc.) from images. Then, we process the relative locations of these objects using machine learning algorithms within an image to make predictions on distracted driving. We believe that our proposed context-driven approach is unique. We expect it to better facilitate correction of distracted driving, when real-time feedback to subjects come with appropriate contextual interpretation of the specific aspects that contributed to distracted driving. Performance evaluations of our techniques reveal a) mAP score of 63.90 for an IoU of 0.5 in object localization; and b) an overall accuracy of\n94\n%\nin detecting instances of distracted driving based on object localization. Processing time incurred by our technique is around 200ms only. As such, we believe that our system is accurate, fast, practical and context-aware also.}

	abstract = {In the field of agriculture, there are many individual micro businesses with low investment capacity and awareness of IT utilization, and it is difficult to obtain a return on investment. In recent years, edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have attracted a lot of attention in the agricultural industry to cover the labor shortage. Also, safer vegetables are required by peoples due to COVID-19 epidemic and radioactive pollution. In this paper, we propose an agricultural support system called VegeCareAI for agricultural workers. The proposed system supports vegetable classification, plant disease classification and insect pest classification to improve the crops’ productively. The support system can show the growth condition of vegetables. When there are some problems, the VegeCareAI presents information on how to deal with diseases and insect pests. From the results, we found that our proposed VegeCareAI tool has advantage for supporting several crops. For vegetable classification, our training data for 300 epochs predicted six kinds of vegetables correctly. For plant disease classification, for 400 epochs the accuracy is more than 96% accuracy for both potato and corn leaves. For insect pest classification, the accuracy of corn insect pests is more than 73%, but the results of different life cycles showed low classification accuracy, which present a future challenge.}

	abstract = {Fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure which extends the traditional cloud computing to the edge of the network, bringing data, storage, computing, and communication resources closer to end users. However, since fog servers are very close to end users and may collect sensitive information, they must be trustworthy for delegation. The traditional cryptographic solutions cannot be deployed to handle internal attacks such as that from a rogue fog that has been authenticated and has become part of the system. To this end, we put forward a bi-directional trust management system (TMS) for secure offloading and fog-to-fog collaboration, allowing a service requester (SR) to determine the trustworthiness of a service provider (SP) and the SP to check the level of trust of the SR before initiating a connection. The proposed TMS uses quality of service (QoS), quality of security (QoSec), and social relationships for direct trust computation through self-observation, and past reputation and recommendations to determine the indirect trust. The trust aggregation is based on fuzzy logic which is capable of handling the uncertainty, imprecision, and inaccuracy in a dynamic and highly mobile fog computing environment. A decay function is used to model the effect of past reputation on the present trust value and a credence function to mitigate the impact of false recommendations on the overall trust score. The results of the simulation show that the TMS could detect and mitigate about 71% and 74% of attacks, when 70% of the clients and fogs are malicious.}

In this sense, using a deep learning approach that focuses on utilizing the agents in the environment to fulfill the message routing task has proven to be effective. This paper proposes a novel routing scheme for OppNets called Reinforcement Learning-based Fuzzy Geocast Routing Protocol (RLFGRP) for OppNets, in which a fuzzy controller makes use of the node’s Q-value, reward value and remaining buffer space as input parameters to determine the likelihood of that node to be selected as suitable forwarder of a message from source towards its destination. Through simulations using real mobility traces, the proposed RLFGRP protocol is shown to outperform the established Geocast Fuzzy-Based Check-and-Spray routing (FCSG) [4] and the Fuzzy logic-based Q-learning routing (FQLRP) [9] protocols in terms of overhead ratio, delivery ratio and average latency.}

	abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak is in its growing stage due to the lack of standard diagnosis for the patients. In recent times, various models with machine learning have been developed to predict and diagnose novel coronavirus. However, the existing models fail to take an instant decision for detecting the COVID-19 patient immediately and cannot handle multiple medical sensor data for disease prediction. To handle such challenges, we propose an intelligent health monitoring and prediction framework, namely the iCovidCare model for predicting the health status of COVID-19 patients using the ensemble Random Forest (eRF) technique in edge networks. In the proposed framework, a rule-based policy is designed on the local edge devices to detect the risk factor of a patient immediately using monitoring Temperature sensor values. The real-time health monitoring parameters of different medical sensors are transmitted to the centralized cloud servers for future health prediction of the patients. The standard eRF technique is used to predict the health status of the patients using the proposed data fusion and feature selection strategy by selecting the most significant features for disease prediction. The proposed iCovidCare model is evaluated with a synthetic COVID-19 dataset and compared with the standard classification models based on various performance matrices to show its effectiveness. The proposed model has achieved 95.13% accuracy, which is higher than the standard classification models.}

	abstract = {LoRa is a rising LPWAN technology designed to use a simple Aloha-like medium access mechanism exploiting free ISM frequency bands. This makes LoRa packets inevitably exposed to the threat of the same LoRa network interference (intra-system interference). Additionally, they are also exposed to disturbances caused by packets from other networks using the license-free spectrum (inter-system interference). LoRa-LPWAN is actively being deployed in the literature state-of-the-art. The capture effect essentially reflects the joint relation between the physical layer capabilities of LoRa modulation in relation to the LoRaWAN Aloha-based MAC operation. Moreover, most efforts adopted in the literature have ignored the impact of inter-system ISM interference signals on LoRa-LPWAN transmissions. This paper devises a new paradigm for modeling LoRa modulation performance that incorporates the joint impact of SNR and SIR in order to represent the intra- system interference behavior during LoRAWAN operation. The physical layer abstractions are then combined with comprehensive implementation of the LoRaWAN MAC protocol standard in an OMNeT++ module, delivering a hybrid bit-level and packet-level simulation model. The devised LoRa simulation model framework also introduces a representative abstraction for LoRa reception capabilities under ISM interference in accordance with the IEEE 802.15.4 interference model [1] that has been recently introduced in the literature of long-range, low-power communication. The developed OMNeT++ Simulation model acts as a reliable platform to test different potential bottlenecks in LoRa-LPWAN operating in the free, unlicensed frequency bands. The proposed simulation framework has the potential to support high accuracy of error performance prediction in a realistic LoRa-LPWAN deployment.}

	abstract = {Parking slots have become a widespread problem in urban development. In this context, the growth of vehicles inside the university's campus is rapidly outpacing the available parking spots for students and staff as well. This issue can be mitigated by the introduction of parking management for the smart campus which targets to assist individually match drivers to vacant parking slots, saving time, enhance parking space utilization, decrease management costs, and alleviate traffic congestion. This paper develops an IoT Raspberry Pi-based parking management system (IoT-PiPMS) to help staff/students to easily find available parking spots with real-time vision and GPS coordinates, all by means of a smartphone application. Our system composes of Raspberry Pi 4 B+ (RPi) embedded computer, Pi camera module, GPS sensor, and ultrasonic sensors. In the IoT-PiPMS, RPi 4 B+ is used to gather and process data input from the sensors/camera, and the data is uploaded via Wi-Fi to the Blynk IoT server. Ultrasonic sensors and LEDs are exploited to detect the occupancy of the parking spots with the support of the Pi camera to ensure data accuracy. Besides, the GPS module is installed in the system to guide drivers to locate parking areas through the Blynk App. that discovers parking spaces availability over the Internet. The system prototype is fabricated and tested practically to prove its functionality and applicability. According to the results, the IoT-PiPMS can effectively monitor the occupancy of outdoor parking spaces in the smart campus environment, and its potency in terms of updating the data to the IoT server in real-time is also validated..}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a result of the explosive growth of smart and internet-enabled devices that integrated our physical world into the virtual one. These ever-growing numbers of devices gather a huge quantity of data that contains very useful data. However, the gathered data contains highly redundant data for a variety of reasons. Redundant data is desirable for its positive impact as it is used to improve the accuracy and reliability of sensed data and make the network fault-tolerant. It also leads to different issues in terms of the network’s longevity, data processing cost, network bottleneck, delay in data throughput, and network congestion and contention. This paper presents a spatial redundancy reduction approach for IoT data to reduce the issues of redundant data without compromising the accuracy and reliability of data. In the proposed approach, spatial redundancy reduction is performed through two algorithms. The first algorithm is Correlation Tree Construction (CTC), which is constructed based on the spatial correlation of sensor nodes. Based on the correlation tree, the second algorithm is Data Fusion (DF) to carry out data fusion for correlated sensor nodes to maintain the accuracy and reliability of data and reduce redundancy. The simulation of the proposed approach is carried out using the Cooja simulator and Python. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows efficiency in terms of spatial redundancy reduction, accuracy, and integrity.}

	abstract = {Transformers have an important role in the uninterrupted and reliable flow of electrical power in power systems. For this reason, it is necessary to monitor and control the proper and efficient operation of transformers regularly. The increase in the number of transformers, the differentiation of transformer operations, and the prolongation of the transformers’ operating time, accelerates the importance of remote monitoring. When remote monitoring structures are compared, even if conventional monitoring methods can perform many tasks, it has become suitable to establish lower cost, safer and simpler structures by using the Internet of Things (IoT). Apart from monitoring the electrical parameters of the transformer, it is possible to obtain information about the operation and fault status of the transformer by monitoring the physical and chemical changes in the environment. In this study, a measurement and remote monitoring system that detects temperature, humidity, light level and gas densities are employed for low and medium voltage transformers in the indoor environment. Tests are conducted to establish a connection between the obtained ambient data and transformer operating voltages. Different classification algorithms such as Bayesian Networks (BN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest (RF) are used to classify the operating voltages versus ambient data.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are inherently vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. Aggressive behavior changes, due to increased attacker’s sophistication, and the heterogeneity of the data in IoT have proven that securing IoT devices trigger multiple challenges. It includes complex and dynamic attack detection, data imbalance, data heterogeneity, real-time response, and prediction capability. Most researchers are not focusing on the class imbalance, dynamic attack detection, and data heterogeneity problems together in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enabled IoT anomaly detection. Thus, to address these challenging tasks, we propose DeL-IoT, a deep ensemble learning framework for IoT anomaly detection and prediction using SDN, having three primary modules including anomaly detection, intelligent flow management, and device status forecasting. The DeL-IoT employs deep and stacked autoencoders to extract handy features for stacking into an ensemble learning model. This framework yields efficient detection of anomalies, manages flows dynamically, and forecasts both short and long-term device status for early action. We validate the proposed DeL-IoT framework with testbed and benchmark datasets. We demonstrate that in even a 1% imbalanced dataset, the performance of our proposed method, deep feature extraction with a deep ensemble learning model, is around 3% better than the single model. The extensive experimental results show that our models have a better and more reliable performance than the competing models showcased in the relevant related work.}

Analysis of the data showed a strong relationship between humidity and air quality (correlation coefficients of −0.624 in summer and −0.692 in autumn), with air quality degrading in the autumn. As humidity increases, air quality decreases; temperature has a weaker relationship with air quality. Further analysis showed that cleaning products can adversely impact on the air quality. Poor air quality can be mitigated by opening a window to speed up the dissipation rate of pollutants. The quantification of indoor air quality can inform activities such as cooking, heating, usage of disinfectants and monitoring of ventilation, which can potentially benefit of people with respiratory illness.}

	abstract = {Detecting cyber-anomalies and attacks are becoming a rising concern these days in the domain of cybersecurity. The knowledge of artificial intelligence, particularly, the machine learning techniques can be used to tackle these issues. However, the effectiveness of a learning-based security model may vary depending on the security features and the data characteristics. In this paper, we present “CyberLearning”, a machine learning-based cybersecurity modeling with correlated-feature selection, and a comprehensive empirical analysis on the effectiveness of various machine learning based security models. In our CyberLearning modeling, we take into account a binary classification model for detecting anomalies, and multi-class classification model for various types of cyber-attacks. To build the security model, we first employ the popular ten machine learning classification techniques, such as naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, Support vector machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, as well as Linear discriminant analysis. We then present the artificial neural network-based security model considering multiple hidden layers. The effectiveness of these learning-based security models is examined by conducting a range of experiments utilizing the two most popular security datasets, UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for data-driven security modeling through our experimental analysis and findings in the context of cybersecurity.}

	abstract = {The Deep Q-Network (DQN) is one of the key methods in the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which has a deep neural network structure used to estimate\nQ\n-values in Q-learning methods. We have previously implemented a simulation system considering DQN for control of actuator nodes in Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs). In addition, we have designed and implemented a DQN based Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) testbed. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a Tabu List Strategy based DQN (TLS-DQN) for AAV mobility control. For evaluation, we compared the simulation results of the mobility control of AAV in indoor single-path environment using normal DQN and the TLS-DQN. The simulation results show that the TLS-DQN has a better performance than the normal DQN.}

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of an Internet of Things-assisted architecture for QRS complex detection in an electrocardiogram regardless of the age and physiological characteristics of the patient. Detection of the QRS complex is affected by the abnormalities and quality in electrocardiogram recordings; the proposed method can detect QRS complex despite these challenges. Electrocardiogram continuous signal acquisition is performed with the BITalino biomedical data acquisition card. Electrocardiogram signals typically suffer from (a) premature atrial complexes, (b) premature ventricular complexes, (c) low signal-to-noise ratio, (d) right bundle branch blocks, (e) left bundle branch blocks, and (f) non-stationary effects. Interestingly, the signal processing is implemented by means of a bandpass filter, followed by a numerical derivative. Next, the Hilbert transform and the adaptive threshold technique are implemented to detect the QRS complex. Tests are performed to evaluate the Internet of Things-assisted architecture using the obtained signal in real time. Results, and the simplicity of the architecture, demonstrate that it is suitable for wearable, portable, and battery-operated electrocardiogram acquisition card.}

	abstract = {Massive IoT scenarios involve a huge number of devices where deployment, provisioning and configuration are carried out without any human intervention. Well-known mechanisms of resource discovery and management attempt to enable some of this functionality typically associated with zero-configuration schemes. In this paper we explore the novel use of Protocol Stack Virtualization (PSV) to provide flexibility in the deployment and management of constrained sensors, actuators and controllers in massive IoT access networks. Specifically, these devices exhibit low power consumption that limits processor computational capabilities and transmission rates that affect, among other things, deployment and maintenance. In this scenario, we present and analyze an end-to-end PSV massive IoT solution. We describe the different building blocks, their interaction and what role they play as part of the overall mechanism. Additionally, we focus on the performance of the solution by looking at how network impairments, like packet loss and latency, affect deployment of the virtualized protocol stacks.}

	abstract = {We have studied packet transmission scheduling on multi-hop wireless sensor networks with 3-egress gateway linear topology, called Y-shaped topology. In every one cycle period, each node generates and forwards data packets that are bounded for either of the gateways at edges. In this paper, we focus on centrally-managed Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)-based slot allocations and design a packet transmission scheduling framework combining with the basic redundant transmission to reduce and recover packet losses. On each of three types of path models to cover all possible routing on Y-shaped topology, we efficiently derive a global static time-slot allocation. The derived time-slot allocation exactly maximizes the probability that all packets are successfully delivered to one of the gateways within one cycle period, which cannot be achieved by existing scheduling schemes.}

	abstract = {By analogy to cells that grow, split, merge, and die, this paper applies same operations to things residing in an open Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem. Despite the growing interest in IoT, things are mainly “busy” with sensing and (some) actuating, which prevents them from being responsive to changes in this ecosystem. To address this limitation, this paper proposes mutation as a novel mechanism for making things responsive and hence, capable of either satisfying “unseen” needs or seizing “unexpected” opportunities. To approve/deny mutation, a decision-making process is initiated progressing over 4 stopovers (obligation, permission, prohibition, and dispensation) along with 4 stages (awareness, pre-mutation, mutation-itself, and post-mutation) that would allow to answer questions such as why to approve/deny mutation, how to prepare mutation, and how to evaluate mutation. A testbed demonstrating the technical doability of thing mutation along with the conducted experiments are also discussed in the paper.}
