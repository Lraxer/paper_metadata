	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a core concern for the digital transformation of the industry. However, the development of IoT systems, starting from creating specifications, is a serious and time-consuming effort, which requires high levels of expertise. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models, specifically ChatGPT, to streamline the generation of IoT system specifications from initial, unstructured customer requirements. A framework, adapting the ISO IEC/IEEE 12,207:2017 standard, is developed for this purpose. The utility of this framework is validated through the development and expert evaluation of a specification for a campus laboratory IoT use case. The findings demonstrate ChatGPT's effectiveness in producing specifications that are understandable, complete, and unambiguous, thus offering a substantial aid to the industry in overcoming the complexities of IoT system specification development. At the same time, the study identified specific tasks within the requirements engineering process for IoT systems that ChatGPT could not effectively perform, such as verification, obtaining agreements, and maintaining traceability of requirements between stakeholders. The findings offer valuable insights into the practical applications of AI in the domain of IoT development, particularly in automating the specification generation process. These contributions not only advance the understanding of AI's role in IoT development but also open pathways for further research on refining AI-assisted methodologies for system specification and beyond.}

	abstract = {The zero-trust (ZT) model assumes that all users, devices, and network traffic should not considered as trusted until proven. The Zero-trust model emphasizes the importance of verifying and authenticating every user and device, and limiting access to resources based on the principle of least privilege. Under the principle of the zero-trust model, devices are granted access after they have been successfully presented with their authentication credentials and access rights based on different factors, such as user identity, device health, location, and behaviour. Access controls are then continuously evaluated and updated as user properties, locations and behaviour change. The zero-trust model can be applied in various domains (healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, government etc.) to provide a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that helps organizations to reduce risk and protect critical assets. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the zero-trust model, its principles, and its applications, as well as to propose recommendations for organizations looking to adopt this approach. We explore the major components of the zero-trust framework and their integration across different practical domains. Finally, we provide insightful discussions on open research issues within the zero-trust model in terms of the security and privacy of users and devices. This paper should help researchers and practitioners understand the importance of a zero-trust framework and adopt the zero-trust model for effective security, privacy, and resilience of their networks.}

A critical concern is the vulnerability of current cryptographic methods to potential future quantum computing capabilities. This paper focuses on addressing these challenges by exploring the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in IoT-based consumer health electronics. Specifically, it evaluates the application of PQC methods in conjunction with Transport Layer Security 1.3 (TLS 1.3) for robust authentication in these systems. The study analyzes the performance and security efficacy of these schemes, comparing them to existing cryptographic approaches.

	abstract = {As wireless communication systems evolve, the transition from homogeneous structures to heterogeneous ones intensifies. The need for continuous connectivity, fairness, and spectrum efficiency, such as in massive Internet of Things (IoT) networks and ultra reliable low latency communications (uRLLC), necessitates the utilization of base stations with diverse capabilities and coverage areas. As a result, the need for advanced interference management, user-cell association, and resource allocation techniques increases. This study proposes an innovative solution for the problem of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) user-cell association in multi-tier ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (UD-HetNet). The proposed network constitutes a general framework that can be applied to next generation cellular communications, massive IoT, non-terrestrial and uRLLC type communications. Differing from previous studies that ignore interference and primarily focus on the received signal powers for user-cell association, this investigation advances the subject by considering the interplay between downlink received signal/interference power and uplink inter-cell interference. Due to the non-convex integer programming nature of the problem, it is proposed to employ an innovative relaxation algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution for the total signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). As verified through simulation results, the proposed association method permits concurrent communication participation of multiple users while managing the interference, rendering it as an ideal approach for systems emphasizing fairness and continuous connectivity.}

	abstract = {Face emotion recognition (FER) has found several applications across numerous industries. One such application area lies in the field of human–computer interaction, where it can improve user experiences by allowing systems to adjust based on users’ emotional states by leveraging the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate more responsive interactions. The increasing demand for precise and immediate emotion analysis across various applications drives the need for FER utilizing deep transfer learning (DTL). In this study, a novel Mist-Fog framework for real-time FER is introduced, which employs a DTL algorithm called Mobile-Net for quick and easy image classification on mobile and embedded devices. It addresses the challenges of operating deep neural networks (DNN) under limits on power and processing resources. By utilizing depth-wise separable convolutions, the MobileNet algorithm reduces computational complexity while maintaining reasonable accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset. A Fog-based architecture, in which a mist layer comprising edge devices like Raspberry-Pi (RPi), an ARM-based single-board computer, was considered for a smart city scenario. Further, the M/M/1/K queuing system was considered, which follows the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling criteria and a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) arrival rate to evaluate the system’s performance. The effectiveness of this novel approach towards industrial computer vision paradigms is assessed pertaining to different performance criteria.}

The proposed paper optimizes vehicle traffic by incorporating reroute recommendations, increasing the use of public transportation, and providing onboard vehicle drivers with intelligent health assistance using Federated Learning (FL). This research also focuses on resolving complex transportation issues such as a vehicle’s current location, exact vehicle count information on each route, and onboard vehicle vacant seat information. Furthermore, vehicle communication contributes to the proposed system’s efficiency by avoiding communication delays or information loss to registered users and the cloud server. An intelligent FL-based scheme for vehicle route optimization has been proposed as part of this research to prevent vehicle traffic in a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) connected IoV transportation system. The vehicle detection approach determines the number of vehicles traveling on each route to recommend the best route to registered users.

	abstract = {In the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, quantum computers offer the promise of addressing complex computational issues that traditional cryptographic methods find challenging. The unparalleled computational power of quantum computers makes existing cryptographic schemes, tailored to mitigate computational complexity, ineffective. This research introduces a robust encryption scheme designed specifically for digital data exchanged between IoT devices such as smartphones, smart sensors, and smart health monitoring devices. The proposed encryption framework is based on bit-plane extraction-based encryption, the chaotic sine model, the hyperchaotic map, the quantum baker map, and quantum operations such as quantum selective scrambling. The proposed methodology involves three key phases: the first and last phase related to permutation, which is performed at the bit level based on discrete bit-plane scrambling, bit-plane extraction, and hyperchaotic mapping. However, the second phase is based on diffusion, which depends on the chaotic sine model. During the initial stage, creating correlations among image pixels, along with a couple of chaotic sequences using a quantum baker map, is accomplished through a superposition of quantum-states. Before applying diffusion, the pixels of the grayscale image are encoded using a single qubit, and quantum operations are based on a quantum circuit featuring swap gates. To introduce pixel-level permutation, a hyperchaotic map generates random sequences within the range of 0 to 255. A circular shift further shuffles the pixel rows and pixel columns of the permuted image pixels. To enhance the digital image security further, bit-planes are extracted from the permuted bit-planes. Then, the bits within each bit plane are scrambled using a random sequence generated by the hyperchaotic map. Finally, the encoded bit planes are merged to produce a final encrypted image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with security parameters such as correlation, entropy, and key space measuring at 0.0001, 7.999, and\n>\n2\n100\n, respectively. Furthermore, to assess performance in relation to computational complexity, a detailed analysis of computational time is conducted. The results reveal that the proposed encryption scheme can execute all encryption steps presented in the proposed method in less than one second. These findings demonstrate the secure transmission of digital data between IoT devices and show the suitability of the proposed encryption scheme for real-time applications.}

Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) presents a methodology for training models on IoT devices without centralizing data, thereby addressing privacy, security, and bandwidth concerns. However, current FedRL methods encounter challenges in dynamic and heterogeneous IoT environments, struggling to allocate resources efficiently and accommodate diverse device capabilities. Our work introduces a Three-Stage Asynchronous Federated Reinforcement Learning (TAS-FedRL) framework to optimize resource allocation and local training epochs in heterogeneous IoT environments. We propose a novel Affinity-Based Spectral Client Grouping (ASCG) for dynamic device allocation and implement Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) for adaptive epoch adjustment and resource allocation. We also introduce the Dynamic Temporal-Weighted Reward Aggregation (DTW-RA) technique for updating edge hosts’ models, reducing network strain and enabling adaptable device participation. Furthermore, our central server implements a Dynamic Hierarchical-Weighted Reward Aggregation (DH-WRA) mechanism to manage the entire network. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TAS-FedRL framework in enhancing system performance, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and mitigating issues arising from IoT heterogeneity.}

We used a three-dimensional coordinate conversion formula to convert the coordinates of each axis of the robot arm into the coordinates of the smartphone so that the doctor can control the robot arm remotely using the smartphone. The force sensor embedded in the robot arm provides transparency to the doctor during operation, enabling them to monitor whether the force applied by the robotic arm on the human body is excessive. In addition, through the jelly mechanism installed on the robot arm, the doctor only needs to use a smartphone to control the jelly mechanism to achieve remote control needs.

	abstract = {The popularity of cyberspace is skyrocketing as the need to make systems digital, transparent, and fast is becoming indispensable, increasing the need for enhanced security against cyber threats predominantly in a critical area in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks. In an AMI system, the network components become vulnerable to threats and attacks from intruders. Most existing threat models are complex, time-consuming, and sometimes redundant in the rules used to model these threats, posing extra security concerns in such systems. This study proposes an enhanced Spoofing, Tampering, and Information Disclosure (STI) model for threats in an AMI network. The STI model is concise and fast, and it evaluates the impacts of components while maintaining a high-security level. The model uses a set of rules, similar to Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege (STRIDE), to identify threats in a network based on certain behavioural characteristics. The proposed model identifies threats by grouping them into three main categories: Spoofing, Tampering, and Information Disclosure. The model then assesses the likelihood of the identified threats occurring and their impact on the network based on a stochastic probability equation called the PoiBer equation. The equation develops an overall risk baseline assessment to identify the Threat Score. The study proposed a novel standardised Framework model to calculate the probability of threat occurrence and reduce runtime for early threat detection using the STI model. By leveraging mathematical equations for evaluation, the research provides an effective and efficient approach to securing AMI networks for the renewable energy sector. The results indicate that the proposed equation serves as a reference point for monitoring the likelihood of threat occurrence and the impact on the components in an AMI network. Based on the developed model, Tampering had the highest likelihood of occurrence, whereas Spoofing had the highest impact on the AMI networks.}

	abstract = {The use of Controller Area Network in advanced automobiles as a communication technology is becoming more common. However, there is a lack of adequate privacy standards, such as data verification and cryptography. Therefore, the controller area network system is also susceptible to innumerable data breaches that can lead to serious consequences. To address this issue, multiple anomaly identification technologies were designed to identify these kinds of breaches. Nonetheless, the extraordinary standardisation characteristics of artificial intelligence enable anomaly detection techniques a viable preventative strategy against vehicle data security breach by the hackers. This study provides a comprehensive review of anomaly detection strategies facilitated by artificial intelligence and implemented between January 2018 and January 2024 It examines identification methodologies, threat varieties, characteristics, and standard information sets. Moreover, the paper also addresses the privacy concerns of AI designs, the prerequisites needed to design AI-based anomaly detection approaches in the controller area network channels, the constraints of currently available recommendations, and potential future study proposals. Additionally, to help researchers, and automobile manufacturers, in the rapidly growing field of protecting controller area network systems in modern car industries, the present research aims to shed light on the complicated landscape of anomaly detection within the domain of AI.}

	abstract = {Many proposals have arisen to integrate a patient’s health information produced by different heterogeneous sources. Ones trying to physically integrate this information and others making interoperable the data that remain stored in current health systems. Interoperable approaches have become the preferred solutions because of data security and privacy constraints, and blockchain technology is currently being used for integrating distributed health data. However, despite many approaches for performing such integration, there are unresolved issues around them such as the definition of who should keep this data structure alive and who should manage access to it. This makes difficult for health institutions to keep the global vision of patient’s always up to date. This paper offers a new patient-centered solution to achieve a global view of patient health that we call Personal Health Trajectory (PHT), which makes use of the blockchains’ federation concept. We provide a reference implementation architecture of PHT that has been validated over a case study on 50 sociosanitary institutions with 1156 patients. We have obtained a delay of 2.87s in write operations and 0.16s in reading ones—regarding the separate interaction with each health institution, which is not significant with respect to the benefits obtained.}

	abstract = {Wildfires are a significant natural hazard, resulting in financial losses, human deaths, and environmental damage. Due to the rising severity and frequency of wildfires, wildfire management and detection have recently received increased attention worldwide. Monitoring potential risk areas and early fire detection are critical factors for shortening the reaction time and reducing the potential damage. Conventional wildfire detection techniques like satellite imaging and remote camera-based sensing need more latency and low reliability. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel airborne UAV-based IoT (UIoT) system for wildfire sensing, detection, and extinguishing. It presents the design of low-cost and low-maintenance fire-detecting IoT nodes for large-scale deployment. It also proposes, investigates, and reports on several connectivity architectures using the LoRaWAN protocol for UIoT systems. We geolocate forest trees in a terrain-mapping exercise for precise fire localization. We then deploy an autonomous drone with a visual camera that utilizes our novel classification network to detect the presence of fire followed by fire detection and particle filter-based tracking to center fire at the center of the frame. We use a cloud back-end server for monitoring, analysis, and reporting. Our results show that our low-cost and long-range IoT nodes accurately detect fire within 1-5 min after fire ignition. Our fire classification network achieved an accuracy of 99.46% and a mean average precision of 99.64%. Numerical results suggest that the proposed UAV-IoT-based fire classification offers a fast and reliable wildfire recognition and extinguishing solution while minimizing power consumption and increasing the battery lifespan.}

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has introduced digitalization and intelligence to the industrial field. However, the terminal in IIoT has a low computing power and limited storage resources, thus it is necessary to calculate and unload the data generated by the terminal and to allocate resources. Aiming to resolve the issues of computation offloading and resource allocation in IIoT, a blockchain-assisted data communication and computing service strategy of IIoT was constructed in this study. First, a blockchain-assisted computing and communication resource allocation model in IIoT was established, which embeds resource allocation and computation offloading into a block-chain to ensure the credibility of data during the process. In order to find the minimum value of the weighted sum of system energy cost, as well as the delay in blockchain-assisted resource allocation and computation offloading, a Levy flight-enhanced JAYA optimization algorithm(p-JAVA) based on blockchain resource allocation was proposed, which was embedded into the blockchain system to ensure the security of the data when allocating resources. Simultaneously, Levy flight was used to modify the algorithm to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. The simulation results demonstrated that the Levy flight-enhanced JAYA optimization algorithm consumed 21% of the energy compared with the genetic algorithm, and 17.7% energy compared with the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The load balancing ability of the Levy flight-enhanced JAYA optimization algorithm is relative to the particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms, which significantly increases the energy and delay consumption in the resource allocation of IIoT and improves the system performance.}

	abstract = {Medical internet of things (MIoT) environments continue to expand, and numerous MIoT services are available to improve the quality of human life. However, these services, facilitated by a multitude of interconnected IoT devices analyzing the environment, face significant security challenges due to the volume of interconnected devices and the exchange of data through open channels. Moreover, the vulnerability is exacerbated by the centralized infrastructure commonly used by IoT services, where compromising a trusted third party (TTP) or service provider jeopardizes the entire system’s security. Existing privacy-preserving schemes for IoT, while aiming for decentralization, often rely on a TTP to sustain the system. In such environments, users typically either entrust their secret keys and parameters to a TTP or store their data in cloud servers. Consequently, as the TTP assumes control over the actual keys and data, a significant challenge arises regarding the assurance of user and data sovereignty. In this paper, we propose a complete decentralized privacy-preserving scheme for MIoT that ensures data self-sovereignty, transparency, and complete decentralization without TTP intervention. In the proposed scheme, users can directly manage their keys with secret parameters. Then, they can upload encrypted data directly to distributed storage and securely share it with other users based on the security levels they have set themselves. We perform informal and formal (mathematical and simulation) security analysis to prove the security of the proposed scheme and conduct comparative analysis to evaluate the security functionalities, communication costs, and computational costs of our scheme compared with those of previous schemes. Further, we implement our scheme in a practical setting through simulations on Ethereum blockchain networks, validating its complete decentralization, security, efficiency, and suitability for MIoT environments. The specificity of our research lies in addressing the critical security concerns inherent in MIoT through a complete decentralized, TTP-independent framework.}

These weaknesses pose serious risks such as damage to manufacturing systems, theft of intellectual property, and substantial financial losses. This study introduces an advanced deep hybrid learning model in an asynchronous federated learning setup, aimed at improving the detection of cyberattacks and ensuring robust data privacy. The combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks provides an effective solution for quickly identifying anomalies in IIoT sensor traffic. Our model operates asynchronously, ensuring data remains localised to improve security while avoiding the need for complete node synchronisation. Demonstrating outstanding effectiveness, the model achieves an accuracy of 1.00%, precision of 1.00%, recall of 1.00%, and an F1 score of 1.00% across a variety of IIoT environments. These results highlight the model’s exceptional adaptability and its capability to rapidly respond to emergent threats, marking a significant step forward in the protection of IIoT infrastructures and the rigorous maintenance of data privacy.}

Crowd management’s overall goal is to ensure the safety and security of the crowd and the surrounding community, minimizing disruptions and ensuring the smooth flow of people and traffic. There could be two main challenges in smart crowd management in a smart city environment, i.e., real-time processing of large magnitude of data and privacy preservation. Edge computing devices can be used to process large amounts of data, and privacy concerns can be addressed with the help of federated learning. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we have proposed an edge-assisted four-layered conceptual framework (i.e., data acquisition, edge computing, cloud computing, and application layers) using federated learning. Practical implications and their potential solutions using the proposed framework are suggested. To fully utilize the benefits of edge-assisted federated learning for crowd management within smart cities, various research challenges are highlighted that need to be addressed. Moreover, a case study in the context of smart cities is presented to highlight the potential benefits of the proposed framework. Simulation results for federated learning-based anomaly detection using three to five local clients are also presented as well to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The effect of label poisoning attacks on FL-based anomaly detection is also discussed.}

The smart speed of industrialization and the conspicuous significance of horticulture with cultivating pesticides have impelled water contamination to a colossal degree. Safe water is likewise worried about its verdure. In this article, a low-cost and low-power is proposed to screen the nature of water that can be utilized in all networks wherever consumption of water is typically provided by means of the water dispersion framework. Planned Sensor hubs are viable with existing circulation organizations. Sensor nodes can collect the data for the electrochemical properties of water to the server. A developed algorithm using the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes methods identifies cloud predictions for safe drinkable water and alerts on divergence from a World Health Organization-specified safer range. For efficacy, the suggested method is scientifically evaluated in two villages, Mandalgarh and Bassi, Rajasthan, India, where drinking water is in short supply. Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosted Classifier, support vector machine, and artificial neural network models are applied to collected data of water quality and analyzed by the Naive Bayes. The obtained results efficiently with 0.56 F1-Score. The nodes of the distributed network can work in harsh conditions as well and low power consumption and information transmission viability are precisely estimated. The empirical results are verified by laboratory studies, and it is demonstrated that the method has a significant impact on the prevention of water-borne infections, especially in rural regions.}

In our work, data collected from a patient’s automated health device is distributed to the communities through the blockchain network. Blockchain technology paves the way for the health sector to run in a decentralized system. To achieve a secure decentralized data dissemination, the transmitted health data must be reliable, that is, data is assured originated from a legitimate device without unlawful alteration. However, verification of such reliability may jeopardize a patient’s privacy. In healthcare, privacy is of the utmost importance to protect sensitive health data. At the same time, should misbehavior arise, malicious entities should be held accountable. We satisfy these conflicting requirements of reliability, privacy and accountability with our proposed secure decentralized data dissemination scheme for smart healthcare that integrates a certificate-based signcryption with a proxy re-encryption (Sign-Proxy) scheme and an Improved Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol for the system construction. The Sign-Proxy provides users a desirable level of security while delivering lightweight computation for limited computing capabilities of automated health devices. In parallel, the Improved DPoS facilitates the streamlined and secure adoption of a consortium blockchain framework. The security and performance analysis indicate that the proposed scheme is resilience against adversarial attacks, achieves overall efficiency, and feasible for real-world deployment.}

However, considering the high mobility of vehicles that frequently transmit delay-intolerant safety and informative messages, two problems exist in some ring signature-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes for VANETs: first, vehicles cannot detect the malicious vehicles when a malicious vehicle signs a message multiple times; and second, the TAs cannot reveal vehicles’ identities when some vehicles engage in illegal activities. To address these concerns, we propose a CPPA scheme based on revocable one-time ring signature (CPPA-RORS) scheme, leveraging the properties of ring signatures. The scheme ensures anonymity of the honest vehicles while providing TAs with the ability to reveal malicious vehicles at any time. We allow one vehicle only can sign one signature on one message, called one-time, to safeguard vehicle privacy with high security. CPPA-RORS scheme provides the formal security model for VANETs, and in particular simultaneously offers message-linkability and mandatory revocability, effectively preventing the double-spending attack (Shrestha et al. 2020) and enabling TAs to revoke the anonymity of any vehicle at any time for further enhancing the security and trustworthiness of the networks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that CPPA-RORS provides robust security measures and privacy for vehicles in VANETs.}

	abstract = {To develop safer smart city solutions, it is crucial to investigate new technologies for malware analysis and detection to enhance existing malware prevention systems. Deep learning (DL) techniques have surpassed conventional machine learning as the dominant method for network security; therefore, it is crucial for researchers to utilise DL techniques to address the velocity, volume, and complexity of modern malware, as these approaches can effectively handle large amounts of data and extract representative information robustly. This study investigates the application of deep learning techniques, specifically different autoencoders (AEs), to improve malware analysis and prevention in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities. This research evaluates different convolutional neural network based AE structures and aims to establish a robust malware analysis method by focusing on image classification. By experimenting on both greyscale and RGB malware imagery datasets, it has been demonstrated that variational AE can not only detect nearly all malware but also illustrate the generalisability and efficacy of AE in addressing malware threats. The study systematically evaluates different AE configurations, and this comparative analysis can inspire further research into deep learning techniques for IoT security measures.}

	abstract = {Badminton is a fast-paced sport that requires a high level of skill and coordination. To improve their skills, players can use activity trackers to monitor different shots and activities. These trackers utilize inertial measurement units (IMUs), which measures acceleration and angular velocity on the rackets, and the ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors, which measure the location of the player. This study first analyzes the use of UWB localization for tracking badminton players on the court and analyzes the location where shots are played. Furthermore, this study focuses on using both IMU at the racket and wrist and UWB sensors to recognize strategies utilized in badminton matches, employing convolutional neural network (CNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The goal is to classify thirteen badminton shots, as well as an extra class that contains non-shot activities. The output of this shot classifier is provided to the strategy recognition model, which can identify four main strategies, with eleven variations in total, alongside an additional class designated for non-strategy instances such as movement or rest intervals. We trained and tested the models on data from six skilled badminton players. The best results were achieved by using both IMU and UWB data. The proposed 2D-CNN achieved a shot classification accuracy of 90.9%, while the proposed LSTM achieved a strategy recognition accuracy of 80%. The results of this study suggest that neural networks can be used to effectively classify badminton shots and strategies to improve the training of badminton players, as well as to analyze match data.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication shows great potential in reducing data redundancy and improving data collection efficiency in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, IoT devices have limited energy storage capacity, so it is not possible to transmit semantic information to cloud center all the time. To this end, we propose an energy-efficient uploading mechanism in the UAV-assisted semantic awareness data collection system. Specially, we minimize the maximum energy consumption of IoT devices via jointly optimizing user scheduling and UAV trajectory. Since the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a feasible solution. As the number of iterations increases, the user min–max energy consumption gradually converges to a steady state. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good convergence. In addition, the simulation results of our proposed scheme show that the system performance is greatly improved compared with the conventional bit information transmission and non-optimization schemes.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in IoT devices for applications like pattern recognition. However, slight variations in the input data may cause considerable accuracy loss, while capturing all data variations to provide a rich training dataset is almost unrealistic. Online learning can assist by offering to continue adapting the model to the data variations even during inference, however at the expense of higher resource demands, namely a challenging requirement for resource-constrained IoT devices. Furthermore, training on a data sample must be concluded in a timely manner, to have the model updated for subsequent data inferences, compelling the data inter-arrival time as a time constraint. Distributed learning can mitigate the per-device resource demand by splitting the model and placing the partitions on the IoT devices. However, the previous distributed learning studies primarily aim to improve the throughput (through accelerating the training by large-scale CPU or GPU clusters), with less attention to the timeliness constraints. This paper, however, pays attention to some application-specific constraints of timeliness and accuracy under IoT device resource limitations using modular neural networks (MNNs). The MNN clusters the input space using a proposed online approach, where a module is specialized to each of the dynamic data clusters to perform inference. The MNN adjusts its computational complexity adaptively by adding, removing, and tuning the module clusters as new data arrives. The simulation results show that the proposed method effectively adheres to the application constraints and the device resource limitations.}

	abstract = {The amount of data on the Internet has risen noticeably due to the exponential increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is acknowledged as a suitable framework for creating IoT network protocols. One notable feature of ICN is in-network caching, which stores the data packets on intermediate routers/nodes that can be accessed by the subscribers when required. This work proposes a novel Distance-based dynamic caching and replacement strategy (DBDCRS) which involves a light weight calculation that utilizes the request aggregation to find the request weight of the requests stored in Pending interest table (PIT) and node weight of a node based on the distance from the subscriber and IoT publisher to accomplish the caching decision. To eliminate the data redundancy, the scheme caches a particular content on a single node along the specific interest-data path. Additionally, a custom cache replacement policy is introduced which retains the essential contents in cache. Simulation results show that our proposed DBDCRS scheme outperform other in-network cache placement schemes in terms of cache hit ratio, server hit reduction ratio, average response latency, and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {Long-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) is a low-cost solution to deploy very-large scale Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures with minimal requirements following a classic producer/consumer model. Inevitably such deployments will require a shift towards low-latency, distributed and collaborative data aggregation models. The cloud edge computing continuum (CECC) has been proposed as an evolution of the traditional central ultra-high-end processing cloud into a continuum of collaborative processing elements distributed from the cloud to the network edge. Until today, incorporating existing centralized and monolithic LPWAN architectures in the CECC faces multiple security-related implications. We propose Edge2LoRa, a complete secure solution to incorporate LPWAN architectures in CECC enabling faster data processing while reducing the transmission of sensitive data. It improves network performance through data pre-processing, traffic flow optimization, and real-time local analysis. Edge2LoRa gradually transform existing LPWAN deployments into agile and versatile infrastructures that enable the seamless and efficient processing of data throughout the CECC while guaranteeing service continuity and full-backwards compatibility. We implement Edge2LoRa in hardware compliant with the Things Stack and the LoRaWAN v1.0.4 and v1.1. We evaluate the performance in terms of networking and computing resource utilization, quality of service and security. The results provide a clear indication of the improvements to public and private LoRaWAN infrastructures without any disruption or service degradation for existing legacy services. In public LoRaWAN deployments where large-scale IoT data streams drive big data analytics, we demonstrate core network bandwidth usage reductions of up to 90% and data processing latency improvements by a\n×\n10\nfactor.}

	abstract = {Traditional highway safety and monitoring solutions, reliant on surveillance cameras, face limitations due to their dependence on high-speed internet connectivity and the remote processing of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. This reliance introduces latency, undermining the real-time detection and analysis crucial for highway applications. The fusion of AI with the Internet of Things (IoT) opens new avenues for highway safety and surveillance innovation. Yet, most existing solutions are confined to vehicle detection and tracking, hindered by edge-IoT platforms’ limited power and processing capabilities. Addressing these limitations, this paper presents VegaEdge, an AI framework optimized for edge-IoT devices capable of real-time vehicle detection and tracking, trajectory forecasting, and identifying anomalous driving behaviors, such as road departures, sudden stops, and hazardous merges. A novel lightweight anomaly detection algorithm based on trajectory prediction is used for identifying hazardous driving on highways. VegaEdge demonstrates its versatility and efficiency across various traffic conditions and roadway configurations and has been evaluated on platforms like the Nvidia Jetson Orin and Xavier NX. The Nvidia Jetson Orin processes up to 738 trajectories per second and detects up to 140 vehicles in a single frame. Additionally, the Carolinas Anomaly Dataset (CAD) an extension of the Carolinas Highway Dataset (CHD) is introduced. While CHD consists of standard highway vehicle videos and trajectories, CAD includes video data of anomalous driving behaviors, providing a crucial resource for enhancing anomaly detection algorithms.

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for optimizing communications in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, particularly for ensuring physical layer security by dynamically maximizing signal strength for legitimate users while minimizing leakage towards eavesdroppers. However, existing approaches often overfit the DRL agent to a non-stochastic environment, where the trajectories of users and eavesdroppers are fixed. This results in a single-task DRL agent that cannot generalize beyond the training environment/task. In response, this study introduces a novel multi-task DRL framework to address this limitation. Firstly, recognizing that not all tasks share the same solution, we proposed a reward-driven clustering method to group similar tasks based on their reward scores. This enables the training of a shared multi-task DRL agent for each cluster. Each cluster can be treated as an expertise, and the cluster-specific multi-task DRL agents are considered the 'experts'. Meanwhile, we leverage federated learning (FL) to speed up the training of the shared multi-task DRL agent. By combining these two techniques, our reward-driven clustered FL autonomously groups similar tasks together rapidly. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction in the number of agents from 50 to 10 specialized 'experts', while achieving a 10X speedup compared to conventional single-task DRL training. Furthermore, the study presents a mixture of experts (MoE) model that unifies these 'experts' into a single model. The MoE is trained to select the most suitable 'expert' when encountering new tasks. Our MoE exhibits robustness by effectively generalizing to 50 novel tasks without fine-tuning.}

	abstract = {Indoor localization is challenging in densely populated urban areas due to the multipath effect, attenuation, noise, and difficulty finding reliable Wi-Fi access points. In urban flats, multiple access points are not easily available or require infrastructure setup, which increases cost. To address the above issues, the article proposes a new algorithm called ‘H2LWRF-PDR’ based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting using a single access point with extended features. This algorithm is designed for static and moving objects. The proposed algorithm first converts the received signal strengths from a single access point into five statistical features used as fingerprints. Then, hierarchical clustering is applied to remove outliers from the fingerprints. Then, a random forest classifier is used to predict the cluster values. Finally, the lowess filters are used to smoothen the output values from the classifier. Furthermore, these outputs are combined with the proposed Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithm. In the end, a Savitzky–Golay filter is utilized to remove the fluctuations in the trajectories. The proposed approach has been validated in urban flat and laboratory environments and compared with state-of-the-art localization algorithms. The proposed algorithm ‘H2LWRF-PDR’ showed 50% improvements in an urban flat dataset and at least 30% in the laboratory dataset.}

During an earthquake, furniture and mobile equipment can either become obstacles or act as passive life safety systems by providing safe shelter for people involved in the event. The combination of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and anti-seismic furniture could serve as a means to transform them into intelligent protection systems to protect people in case of an earthquake, facilitating their detection and localization during the rescue operations through the integration of a supportive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. In this article, we report about the design and development of the SAFE ICT Platform which comprises wireless IoT devices integrated into anti-seismic furniture that activate in response to earthquakes to signal the presence of individuals needing rescue. The SAFE ICT Platform also includes local and cloud computing systems for device management and monitoring, alongside a localization and support system to assist rescuers in pinpointing and aiding individuals. A comprehensive evaluation scenario of the proposed solution is also discussed.}

In addition to providing a framework for the study of EU citizenship and digital citizenship, postmodernism can be used to challenge essentialist claims about these two concepts by presenting an anti-foundationalist perspective that takes heterogeneous and fluid identities into account Another roadmap for the interconnection of European citizenship and digitization is the better development of digital human rights in the European context. This paper emphasizes that the main shortcoming of the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles is that it does not include the concept of human dignity on which the idea of human rights is based and which is emphasized by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and other European legal documents. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that the idea of human rights is dynamic and constantly evolving.}

	abstract = {Integrating blockchain (BC) with Federated Learning (FL) shows promise but presents challenges, particularly in the selection of the most appropriate IoT nodes for sensitive tasks. Existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches are tailored to dynamic environments, but they are complex and resource-intensive. On the other hand, score-based methods are faster to implement but lack flexibility. In this paper, we propose a two-step hybrid solution which uses the reputation score approach to train a DRL model, creating a framework that combines the efficiency of deterministic methods with the adaptability of AI-based solutions. In fact, we designed a score-based method relying on devices attributes and behavior making the system operational from the outset. Also, this allows the gathering of relevant real-time data for training the DRL model. Besides, the variations in the performances of IoT devices pose a challenge in achieving synchronous aggregation. To address this, we designed a multi-level aggregation mechanism, which allows local models to be uploaded to the BC, where an aggregator is in charge of validation. The validated models are then aggregated into intermediate models. This process continues until a global model is formed. To evaluate our approach, we created several simulation scenarios including the number of nodes to assess scalability, the dropout rate to estimate availability, and the percentage of malicious nodes to evaluate the robustness of the system against attacks. These experiments aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The obtained results are promising highlighting its robustness and flexibility showing improved performance, security, and availability.}

Edge Computing, known for its lower latency compared to the Cloud, has sparked interest in managing the execution of tasks within a huge ecosystem that acts as a cover upon the IoT infrastructure. The primary challenge lies in maximizing the use of limited edge resources while minimizing response time, prompting numerous research endeavors. However, existing efforts often overlook shifts in the collected data that may affect the execution of tasks and the production of knowledge. This paper focuses on developing a mechanism that considers data and concept drifts to optimize the management of tasks. The ultimate goal is to maximize the accuracy levels while optimizing resource utilization, through a tasks’ offloading scheme that accounts for distribution-based similarity, offering substantial benefits in managing these constrained resources efficiently. The shifts in data can help determine if the execution of a task is efficient in a specific node and become part of a reasoning model that guides the offloading decisions. Finally, we evaluate our model using a large set of experimental scenarios.}

Maintenance engineers who manually audit diesel generators for anomaly detection require significant expertise and knowledge. This study proposes a real-time intelligent AIoT system-based convolution neural network long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to enhance efficiency and decrease labor costs of industrial diesel generator maintenance service. The AIoT system could autonomously classify abnormal conditions of industrial diesel generators through supervised learning techniques. Several anomaly failure conditions are identified by maintenance experts and are simulated in the laboratory to collect the working parameters based on developed IoT modules. Pearson product-moment coefficients are computed to effectively evaluate the interdependence between collected variables and the target anomaly types. The proposed CNN-LSTM structure is hyperparameter fine-tuning for identifying the most critical configurations in failure-diagnosing applications. The developed approach is comprehensively analyzed and evaluated with other state-of-the-art individual deep learning algorithms, including recurrent neural network (RNN), LSTM, gate-recurrent unit (GRU), and CNN. The experiment results indicate that the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM could achieve distinguished diagnosis precision of anomaly conditions of industrial diesel generators and significantly improve the classified performance in Industry 4.0.}

Besides, emerging AI frameworks have entirely changed the landscape of UAVs quality of experience (QoE) by contributing to diverse issues. Meanwhile, owing to the novelty of the subject, AI-based frameworks for UAVs security were not carefully surveyed. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive survey of AI-based solutions for UAVs security provisioning through different techniques and algorithms. We assess and identify the recent AI solutions and the open research problems in the emerging field of UAV security. The study begins with an overview of UAV basics, their primary components, and the different communication links among networked UAVs. In addition, the paper explores UAVs security issues, threats, and attacks. This led to a discussion of proposed AI-based solutions for prevention and detection. Moreover, the paper categorizes AI-based solutions for UAV security and proposes a taxonomy to organize these approaches effectively. Finally, the review identifies open issues and future directions, offering valuable insights for researchers. The study methodology includes an extensive review of relevant publications in the past five years across UAVs, cyber-attacks, and AI.

	abstract = {The Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) with special focus on enabling mobility to the ‘things’. Several IoMT applications such as group of robots or drones performing collaborative search and rescue operation, identification of mines, warehouse management, goods delivery, etc can be considered as examples of IoMT systems. In the applications mentioned above, the nodes may send the information in a multi-hop manner to the root or coordinator node which may be static or mobile. While the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is extensively utilized in static IoT networks, it encounters significant limitations in handling mobility and providing resilience against routing attacks in mobile IoT networks. In this work, we propose a modified RPL, RPL* which is robust to handling mobility in nodes and is resilient towards routing attacks. In RPL*, any deviation from the normal behaviors of the network are identified as anomalies using an unsupervised Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) strategy. In RPL*, we propose a novel mobility detection mechanism that will identify the mobility in the network in an energy efficient manner without incurring additional communication overhead. To maintain the connectivity with parent node, we propose a novel proactive connectivity management mechanism in RPL* which will ensure a smooth transition from one parent to another if required, thus avoiding the network partitioning due to mobility. The performance analysis of the system has demonstrated an improvement in packet delivery ratio of the mobile nodes by 40% due to the proposed RPL* when compared to RPL. Also, the proposed XAI strategy provided an F1-score of over 95% for the detection of sink hole and black hole attacks in the tested IoMT network scenarios. It was observed that RPL* improves the performance of the IoMT network when compared to RPL. However it may be noted that the mechanisms introduced to support mobility does not lead to a drop in PDR or increase in control packet overhead for static networks. Hence, RPL* can be considered as an alternative to RPL for IoT as well as IoMT networks.}

	abstract = {Black carbon (BC) has been under the spotlight of research during the last few years due to its non-regulation, its role in air pollution, and its hazardous effects. Given the high cost of the instrumentation needed to measure BC concentrations, data-driven techniques have been adopted to implement proxies that provide BC measurements from other sensor measurements. These sensors may present data quality issues due to maintenance actions, loss of data, or relocation, among others. In this paper, we propose a data-driven proxy model for BC estimation that is powered by a hybrid sensor array, including physical and virtual sensors created from machine learning techniques and governmental air quality monitoring networks. Therefore, the proposed method provides an accurate alternative to traditional data-driven BC proxies in scenarios where some physical sensors are unavailable. The results show how a BC proxy can be partially implemented using virtual sensors, obtaining only an increase in the estimation error of around 4%, allowing the estimation of BC levels even when some physical sensors are absent.}

In the large-scale deployment of sensor networks, extending network life and improving network energy balance remains a significant challenge. The existing routing protocols adopt the path planning method based on the routing information database, which can effectively transmit data packets. However, the methods consume additional energy when establishing and maintaining routing tables, significantly reducing the nodes’ lifespan and leading to unstable data transmission quality. This paper proposes a dynamic random multipath routing method (DRMRM) for LWSNs. The technique combines the node depth and residual energy models to select the optimal next-hop relay node without relying on the transmission routing table. At the same time, we designed a data loss retransmission mechanism and a data loop retreat mechanism to prevent data packets from reaching a dead end. The experimental results demonstrate that our routing method is superior to existing energy consumption balance and network lifespan protocols.}

	abstract = {Understanding your customers is among one of the most important strategies to boost retail profit. In this research, we propose a WiFi-based sensing method to analyze customer behaviors. The monitoring of customer behaviors may lead to revenue growth. Specifically, the strategy is focused on understanding and grouping customers’ behaviors in which we track customers who share similar visiting patterns through WiFi sensing. Accordingly, we can have group-based prediction done for customers who own similar behaviors. We extract customers’ visiting patterns including the customers’ Service Set Identifier list and related information. After all, the proposed system is realized in a cafeteria place where we have the deployed WiFi access points continuously collect data over a time horizon of three months to serve as the inputs for data analysis. The data samples include the number of customers’ devices, number of products and revenue amounts. The dataset also integrates group information and weather conditions. We adopt several machine learning methods including Support Vector Regression and Random Forest for model induction. We conduct these models in terms of three main prediction tasks consisting of coffee shop’s revenue, the number of products, and the number of customers’ devices for evaluation. Furthermore, considering these predictions, we separate between the staying-in and to-go parts. Based on the experiment result, customers’ group information helps, as well as weather conditions. Overall, we can achieve the best prediction result when both the group information and weather conditions are included where we can enjoy as good as 6% to 10% in MAPE.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a three-stage optimization mechanism designed to enhance Federated Learning (FL) in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. Traditional FL optimizations, which typically focus on a single aspect, fall short in IIoT environments. Our approach integrates a multi-criteria enhancement: first, an Ensembled Client Selection Mechanism (ECSM) selects participants based on accuracy, reputation, and randomness. Second, Adaptive Distributed Client Training (ADCT) dynamically adjusts based on participant performance. Lastly, a Secure and Efficient Communication Channel (SECC), backed by blockchain, meets IIoT’s stringent security demands. The evaluation shows TSFed outperforms baseline methods, enhancing FL performance by increasing accuracy and F1-score. Importantly, TSFed improves the efficiency of achieving 80% accuracy on the MNIST dataset by 29.09% over baseline methods, showcasing significant gains in both security and efficiency. This mechanism also exhibits robustness against malicious attacks, setting a new benchmark for FL in IIoT environments.}

	abstract = {In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) is the hottest topics in the research and implementation of wireless networks. Most of the research of IoT-based applications is related with the data collecting and processing using sensors and actuators. As the network environment for connecting IoT devices are considered WLAN or Bluetooth. The Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are the most suitable networks for the Internet of Things (IoT) due to their numerous benefits. However, they have several issues related to wireless communications. One solution is the optimization of position and location of mesh routers. But finding the best location of mesh routers is an NP-hard problem. To deal with this issue, we propose and implement an intelligent simulation system based on the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm called WMN-CS. In the implemented system, the hyperparameters should be tuned to find better solutions. This paper evaluates the WMN-CS performance for various combination of hyperparameters by tuning host bird discovery rate (\np\na\n) and scale parameter (\nγ\n). The simulation results show that a better performance is achieved when the scale parameter (\nγ\n) is between 0.07 and 0.09 and the host bird recognition rate (\np\na\n) is between 0.900 and 0.925.}

	abstract = {Since sensor networks are deployed in harsh and unattended environments, and the nodes are not tamper-resistant, security is crucial for all the impending sensor network applications. When physically compromised, confidential credential of sensor nodes may be revealed to adversaries. Upon obtaining the credentials, an adversary can produce a number of replicas of a compromised legitimate node. These replicas interfere with or prevent the normal operation of the network through attacks called\nr\ne\np\nl\ni\nc\na\nor\ni\nm\np\no\ns\nt\ne\nr\na\nt\nt\na\nc\nk\ns\n. Hence detection, identification and quarantining of replicas attacks are crucial. Existing schemes mostly focus on static sensor networks while solutions for MWSN’s are also available. Upon discovering that an id is used by multiple nodes, these schemes quarantine all nodes with the same id without distinguishing the legitimate node from its replicas. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed light-weight and memory efficient signature-based protocol for quarantining malicious replicas in the presence of Byzantine replicas in MWSN’s. This protocol quarantines only the replicas that present wrong sensed data in the presence of Byzantine replicas that modify and communicate its data and send false claims. The proposed protocol uses a signature generation, exchange and verification scheme to detect, uniquely identify and distinguish replicas with the same id among multiple replicas for a single legitimate node. The protocol quarantines only the malicious replicas that present wrong sensed data among all the detected replicas of each legitimate node by uniquely identifying the malicious replicas using their unique signatures.}

Employing the innovative Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology, this article thoroughly investigates AMDT within wireless healthcare monitoring. The study focuses on analyzing AMDT during the transmission and reception of messages from base stations (BS) to remote healthcare data aggregators (HDAs) serving remote patients (RPs). Various vital parameters are considered, including modulation rate, average message length (AML), the average number of hops per path (H) required to reach remote patients, patient count, sub-carrier spacing (SS), and the modulation type within the communication range of the BS. This proposed assessment of health network performance offers a brief overview based on essential criteria, facilitating swift and precise evaluations of the efficacy of mobile health applications. The results obtained and the in-depth discussion of the outcomes of AMDT analysis provide valuable insights that can be harnessed to enhance the design and operation of wireless healthcare monitoring systems.}

It establishes a comprehensive legal framework with a risk-based approach, aiming to achieve a balance between protecting the health, safety, and fundamental rights of European citizens and ensuring that the growing AI industry in Europe remains competitive and continues to innovate. The AIA also includes governance mechanisms oriented towards achieving effective implementation throughout the EU. For this purpose, a European Artificial Intelligence Office has already been established. In accordance with the provisions of the forthcoming AIA, it will establish a European Artificial Intelligence Board, an advisory forum, and a scientific panel. Furthermore, it will be set up at the national level the so-called national competent authorities. In this way, a single European governance system for AI is emerging, inspired by collaborative governance, which is essential for achieving fair and effective implementation of AI regulations across the EU. The main objective of this text is to critically examine the governance system established by the AIA. Using the contents of the current version of the AIA (April 2024), this analysis delves into the mechanisms and structures designed to implement AI across the EU. As a conclusion, it offers a critical perspective on the collaborative governance, highlighting its strengths and potential areas for improvement.}

It forms the foundation for other techniques such as resource allocation, task delegation, load balancing, and service placement. Fog consumers have the task of choosing the most suitable and reliable fog node(s) from the available options, based on specific criteria. The study presents the Fog Node Selection Engine (FNSE) as an intelligent and reliable fog node selection framework to select appropriate and reliable fog nodes in a trustworthy manner. The FNSE predicts the trust value of fog nodes to help the fog consumer select a reliable fog node based on its trust value. We propose three AI-driven models within the FNSE framework: FNSE based on fuzzy logic (FL), FNSE based on logistic regression (LR), and FNSE based on a deep neural network (DNN). We implement these three models separately using MATLAB for FL and Python for LR and DNN. The performance of the proposed models is compared based on the performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and execution time. The experiment results show that the FL-based FNSE approach achieves the best performance with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score values. The FL-based FNSE approach also consumes less time and can make predictions quickly. The FNSE framework based on FL improves the overall performance of the selection process of fog nodes.}

Designing and engineering these applications is still a challenge due to the lack of systematic approaches and reference architectures. In this paper, we introduce the Behavior-enabled IoT paradigm to help architects and engineers design complex IoT applications based on the integration of cyber–physical systems with behavior-enabled models. We instantiate the approach by designing the architecture of a platform for governing a renewable energy community to provide an optimal trade-off between quality of service (i.e., maximizing shared load) and quality of experience (i.e., ensuring a satisfying comfort to community people) through the production of day-ahead scheduling based on expressed people preferences. The architecture is designed following a specific methodology for developing BeT systems and the obtained platform has been tested in a simulated environment. The results show the potential benefits for the community in terms of revenues, quality of experience, and quality of services. BeT-driven strategies, such as day-ahead scheduling for user device activation, provide a cost-effective way to match consumption to renewable energy production and prove to be an alternative to battery storage support systems or even an improvement.}

The contributions of this development were to implement low-cost and maintained-free hardware devices with wireless data transmission based on Sigfox LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) technology, evaluation of the application, and overcome the aggressive environment where nodes were placed. Nodes have a low power consumption, which allows to be supplied by batteries, and these batteries are recharged by an energy harvesting module with solar panels. These nodes include different sensors for monitoring physical parameters such as: temperature, relative humidity, ultraviolet index, etc. Sensors’ data are transmitted via the network base stations to an IoT platform and from there to an application server. A database has been designed to save the data and make it available to tourists via a mobile application. In this way, the proposed IoT system achieves real-time monitoring of the existing environmental conditions at beaches and provides tourists with information on the environmental situation of the beach. The node developed presents an average current and power consumption of 1.88 mA and 6 mW, respectively. This consumption allows an autonomous operation without solar panels for around 10 days with a full charged 500 mA battery. Conducted experiments with real deployments at beaches in the Mediterranean coast of Spain have proved that, in case of operating the nodes with solar panels and protecting them adequately, they can run for several years without maintenance thanks to a ruggedized electronic.}

However, most scientific research analyzes the accuracy of AoA in one specific environment for which the estimator is trained. In this paper, we analyze the performance of various AoA estimation algorithms, such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), multiple signal classification (MUSIC), and phase difference of arrival (PDoA), in unseen environments. Prior work already demonstrated the superior performance of ML for AoA estimation compared to PDoA or MUSIC. We show that MUSIC, PDoA and ML solutions suffer from degradation in unseen environments at the 90th percentile of error, with ML-based AoA estimation degrading by about 14 degrees in unseen environments compared to 4 degrees for PDoA. We demonstrate that while PDoA more effectively corrects AoA at the median level in unseen environments, ML-based methods excel at correcting higher-percentile AoA errors, including outliers. Finally, we propose a novel framework to further improve the correction of AoA outliers for DCNN-based AoA estimators using data augmentation and transfer learning, resulting in a median angular error of only 5 degrees in unseen environments, even considering a field of view up to 90 degrees.}

As a result, the IoT infrastructure needs more data transmission cycles, leading to data redundancy and low network up-time due to the drainage of limited battery capacity. Conversely, if the data is communicated at a lower rate, it may cause absolute data delivery to the processing unit, which is useless. As a result, a well-designed data aggregation algorithm is required. This paper proposes the\nA\nD\nA\n2\n−\nI\no\nT\n, an Adaptive Data Aggregation Algorithm for IoT Infrastructure tailored to optimize parameters such as low data redundancy, limited data communication cycles, and high IoT infrastructure up times. The proposed algorithm consists of two key components: the Route Data Aggregator (RDA) performs aggregation during data transit towards the Edge node or gateway, and the Node Data Aggregator (NDA) performs data aggregation during capturing or sensing data. The algorithm employs metrics like Age of Information (AoI) and data freshness factor during the node and route data aggregation phase to capture and timely deliver data to the Edge node, where this data is processed for informed decision-making. The proposed algorithm was efficiently tested on a simulation and IoT hardware deployment environment. Both simulation and hardware results demonstrate a substantial improvement in QoS parameters, such as a decrease in data redundancy and packet exchanges, leading to considerable energy savings and prolonging the lifespan of IoT infrastructure.}

	abstract = {In this study, we address the challenge of online malware detection for IoT devices. We propose a method that monitors malware behavior, extracts dynamic features, and converts them into sparse binary images for analysis. The primary problem is to identify the most effective approach among clustering, probabilistic, and deep learning methods for analyzing this unique image dataset. We extract dynamic features from the monitored malware behavior, transforming them into binary images, which are then subjected to three different analysis methods. The clustering, probabilistic, and deep learning approaches are compared and evaluated in terms of various metrics. Our study contributes insights into the performance of various online malware detection approaches for IoT devices. We demonstrate that deep learning outperforms other methods, achieving the best results in seven out of eight metrics. The results of our analysis reveal that the deep learning approach exhibits the highest accuracy in seven of the eight evaluated metrics. We found that the lattice-based approach consistently returns the maximum maliciousness level, which can be instrumental in label flipping scenarios.}

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have attracted attention as a result of enhancements in artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and communication technologies. There is a priority for new testing frameworks to keep up with the increasing complexity of decision-making, connectivity, data interchange, and data transmission speed. Traditional vehicle testing tools and methods cannot meet the new testing requirements imposed by the upgrading of autonomous driving (AD) technology. They are expensive, time-intensive, and present safety hazards during testing, as well as cannot simulate hybrid real-world situations and manage real-time data efficiently. Therefore, in terms of test efficiency, cost, and safety, a smart vehicle testing in hybrid reality and evaluation method based on a digital twin (DT) is presented to speed up the development and testing of AD functions. Our model uses three-dimensional coordinate mapping, a collision detection model, and virtual scene registration to plot the AD information in the actual environment to the virtual scenario. In addition, the consistent mixed reality-based AD test model is constructed at the same time. Using this model, we demonstrated that our proposal allows for better performance of an AD test. Furthermore, the collision test demonstrates that the mixed reality system has interactive features. The performance of the system under the sampling rate of 50 ms, 200 ms, and 800 ms is compared and analyzed. Also, the experiments show that the algorithm described in this paper works better when the sampling frequency is 200 ms or more.}

	abstract = {To minimize data traffic in industrial IoT applications, vibration-based condition monitoring should be conducted on sensors and without requiring machine-specific information. The proposed method enables blind estimation of vibration sources, eliminating the need for information about the monitored equipment or external measurements. Vibrations in rotating machinery primarily originate from two sources: dominant gear-related vibrations and low-energy signals associated with bearing faults. Both sources are distorted by the machine's transfer function before reaching the sensor. This method estimates both sources in two stages: first, the gear signal is isolated using a dilated CNN; second, the bearing fault signal is estimated using the squared log envelope of the residual. The effect of the transfer function is removed from both sources using a novel whitening-based deconvolution method (WBD). Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to detect bearing failures early without additional information. This study considers both local and distributed bearing faults, assuming the vibrations are recorded under stable operating conditions.}

In considered system, a base station (BS) transmits confidential information for individual IoT users using the short-packet communication technique under the wiretap of eavesdroppers. To enhance physical layer security, the BS injects additional dedicated AN symbols to degrade the information retrieval ability at eavesdroppers. In this paper, we aim to joint design the transmit beamforming and AN symbol to maximize the minimum URLLC secrecy rate of IoT user subject to the power budget of the BS. The optimization design problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled variables in the URLLC secrecy rate and channel dispersion expressions, and thus it is mathematically challenging to solve this problem directly. To overcome this issue, we first introduce various convex inner approximations to convexify the nonconvex terms, and then we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on the sequential convex programming approach. Extensive numerical simulation results are conducted to investigate the URLLC secrecy rate region. In conclusion, the two new URLLC parameters, i.e., the transmit packet blocklength and block error probability, will cause the considerable degradation on the URLLC secrecy rate region when comparing to that of the traditional beamforming design based on the Shannon capacity.}

Our focus was on enhancing the research environment at Cheng Shiu University's laboratory through the creation of a dynamic network monitoring setup and lighting control system. Our aim was to simplify equipment management and promote energy efficiency. The core of our development is the Raspberry Pi 4B embedded Linux platform, which serves as a host for both a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker and a Node-RED server. Python programs, developed in PyCharm IDE, utilize multiple threads for efficient data exchange via Modbus TCP and MQTT protocols, facilitating seamless interaction between PLCs and MQTT broker servers. The Node-RED IoT development tool was instrumental in crafting a cross-platform Human-Machine Interface (HMI) web server with MQTT Publish/Subscribe capabilities, ensuring smooth communication with the MQTT broker server. By configuring the Apache HTTP server to direct to the Node-RED web directory, we can effectively monitor laboratory conditions and manage the lighting system. The experimental results validate the cost-effectiveness of our approach in transforming traditional control systems into a web-based supervisory control system, thereby enhancing the overall functionality of existing equipment. This project underscores our commitment to advancing IoT solutions in practical settings.}

	abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has posed a new challenge for forensic investigators, who find themselves carrying out examinations in a very heterogeneous and novel scenario. Aspects such as the high number of devices, the unlikelihood of having physical access to them, the short lifetime of the data, or the difficulty of acquiring it, demand changes in some of the key processes of forensic investigations. In this regard, the identification, acquisition, and analysis phases call for an IoT-centred approach that can fulfil the requirements of the environment. Due to the interoperability of the IoT, and the way in which the data is handled and exchanged, the network traffic becomes a very useful source of evidence. In view of this, this paper presents an automatic procedure for identifying, analysing, and acquiring IoT network traffic and using it as a basis for forensic examinations by employing an edge node capable of performing real-time traffic monitoring and analysis on the most popular IoT protocols. Furthermore, by pairing it with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, the proposal is capable of following a proactive approach, detecting threats and taking the corresponding measures to assure the correct initiation of a forensic process.}

	abstract = {In recent times, a new paradigm has emerged in the field of Cloud computing, namely Fog computing. This paradigm has proven to be highly useful in a wide range of domains where both delay and cost were important metrics. Notably, the Internet of Things (IoT) strongly benefits from this, as small devices can gain access to strong computation power quickly and at a low cost. To achieve this, task offloading is used to decide which task should be executed on which node. The development of an efficient algorithm to address this problem could significantly enhance the sustainability of systems in various industrial, agricultural, autonomous vehicle, and other domains. This paper proposes a new variant of the Niche Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA) called Local search Drafting-NPGA (LD-NPGA) to optimize resource allocation in a Cloud/Fog environment, with the objective of minimizing makespan and cost simultaneously. It generates Pareto solutions allowing the user to make choices closer to its intentions. Thus, it addresses various shortcomings identified in the state of the art, including scalability and aggregation formula. A drafting step is implemented to maintain diversity in the population of solutions, resulting in a more varied Pareto set than basic NPGA. LD-NPGA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art metaheuristics in makespan and cost by 15%. Finally, the scalability of our approach and the variety of solutions generated are confirmed in the different experiments.}

These objects collaborate to deliver ubiquitous services based on the user mode and context. For more real-time applications, IoT is integrated with quantum computing technologies and tools for enhancing the conventional structure into more different aspects, revolutionizing the processing speed, enhancing communication, and increasing security features. All these objects are equipped with sensors that collect real-time data from their surroundings and share it with neighboring objects. This data is then broadcast into the environment, enabling users to access services without understanding the underlying complex and hybrid IoT infrastructure of heterogeneous devices. These minute and plugable sensors are capable of data collection and are always busy handling data management. However, these sensors often have limited resources, creating significant issues when dealing with massive and repetitive operations. Most of the time, these low-energy sensors are busy with excessive sensing and broadcasting, resulting in overhearing and passive listening. These factors not only create congestion on communication channels but also increase delays in data transmission and adversely affect system performance. To assess the network traffic for securing the IoT resources in the quantum computing environment, in this research work, we have proposed a novel scheme called “Self-Adaptive and Content-Based Scheduling (CACS) for Reducing Idle Listening and Overhearing in Securing the Quantum IoT Sensors”. This scheme reduces idle listening and minimizes overhearing by adaptively configuring network conditions according to the contents of sensed data packets. It minimizes extensive sensing, decreases over-cost processing, and reduces frequent communication that lessens the overall system traffic and secures the resources from being overwhelmed. The simulation results demonstrate a 0.80% increase in delay across various baud rates, resulting in a general increase of 0.44 s. Moreover, it ensures a notable 22.23% reduction in BER and lowers energy consumption by approximately 20%, which is actual energy enhancement in the connected system.}

	abstract = {The new smart home protocol, Matter, has garnered worldwide attention for its ability to tackle the most significant obstacle to fully unlock the potential of smart homes: interoperability. The increasing support for Matter among numerous vendors in their products is having a noticeable impact on interoperability at the device level. This work expands the reach of Matter to the IoT platform level by integrating it with an open and standardized platform, oneM2M. One of the key strengths of oneM2M is its ability to provide an open, common, and flexible interface at the platform level, facilitating seamless interconnection across various domains. This integration pave the way to provide Matter’s smart homes user with advanced intelligence services, including AI/ML applications, and emerging concepts like the metaverse. The proposed Interworking Proxy Entity (IPE) for Matter has been successfully implemented, and multiple scenarios have been tested using both commercial and experimental Matter devices within the oneM2M ACME and Mobius platforms. The results demonstrate seamless integration of Matter devices into the oneM2M platform, enabling other applications to interact with them solely through oneM2M standard interfaces. Additionally, the IPE proves to be practical for real-world applications with negligible overhead, offering mutual benefits for both Matter and oneM2M ecosystems.}

Our framework addresses current limitations in securing sensitive health data and demonstrates resilience against emerging quantum computing threats. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed configuration outperforms existing solutions by delivering unmatched security, processing speed, and energy efficiency. It employs a robust yet streamlined approach, meticulously designed to ensure simplicity and practicality, facilitating seamless integration into existing systems without imposing undue complexity. Our investigation affirms the framework's capability to resist common cybersecurity threats like MITM, replay, and Sybil attacks while proactively considering quantum resilience. The proposed method excels in processing speed (0.006 seconds for client and server) and energy efficiency (3.65W client, 95.4W server), offering a quantum-resistant security level comparable to AES-128. This represents a security-efficiency ratio of 21.33 bits per millisecond, a 25.6% improvement in client-side processing speed, and up to 44% reduction in server-side energy consumption compared to conventional RSA-2048 methods. These improvements enable real-time encryption of continuous health data streams in IoT environments, making it ideal for IoT devices where AES-128′s smaller footprint is advantageous. By prioritizing high-grade encryption alongside ease of use and implementation, the proposed framework presents a future-proof solution that anticipates the trajectory of cryptographic standards amid advancing quantum computing technologies, signifying a pivotal advancement in safeguarding IoT-driven healthcare data.}

	abstract = {The scalability of blockchain technology remains a critical challenge, hindering its widespread adoption across various sectors. This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by proposing the adaptive restructuring of Merkle trees, fundamental components of blockchain architecture responsible for ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient verification processes. Unlike traditional static tree structures, our adaptive model dynamically adjusts the configuration of these trees based on usage patterns, significantly reducing the average path length required for verification and, consequently, the computational overhead associated with these processes. Through a comprehensive conceptual framework, we delineate the methodology for adaptive restructuring, encompassing both binary and non-binary tree configurations. This framework is validated through a series of detailed examples, demonstrating the practical feasibility and the efficiency gains achievable with our approach. To empirically assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted rigorous experiments using real-world data from the Ethereum blockchain. The results provide compelling evidence for the superiority of adaptive Merkle trees, with efficiency gains of up to 30% and higher observed during the initial stages of tree restructuring. Moreover, we present a comparative analysis with existing scalability solutions, highlighting the unique advantages of adaptive restructuring in terms of simplicity, security, and efficiency enhancement without introducing additional complexities or dependencies. This study’s implications extend beyond theoretical advancements, offering a scalable, secure, and efficient method for blockchain data verification that could facilitate broader adoption of blockchain technology in finance, supply chain management, and beyond. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, the principles, methodologies, and empirical findings outlined herein are poised to contribute significantly to its growth and maturity.

What was the interplay between digital measures and other explanatory factors, such respect for the rule of law (RoL) at the domestic level and presence/absence of fast-track measures? Drawing on qualitative content analysis, the article demonstrates that the three explanatory factors reinforce each other. If respect for the RoL is deficient and fast-track measures are allowed, digitalization is not capable of upholding parliamentary powers in emergency situations. At the same time, parliamentary resilience is also possible without digitalization. The condition is that the domestic context guarantees both the respect for the RoL and the absence of fast-track measures.}

	abstract = {During the digital age of healthcare, it is crucial to utilize medical data scattered across different healthcare institutions to improve diagnostic precision and customize treatment strategies. A common solution to achieve this is establishing an authorization service that facilitates secure sharing of medical data and promotes interoperability among various healthcare institutions. However, there is a risk of a single point of failure because the majority of authorization systems in use rely on a central trusted service. This paper proposes DAMFSD, a decentralized authorization model with flexible and secure permissions delegation for medical data sharing. Specifically, patients can transfer their permissions to reliable institutions or individuals for flexible management and delegation while they retain control and monitor their permissions. We use cryptographic techniques for secure and fine-grained delegation and smart contracts to enable decentralized and flexible delegation. Finally, we performed a security analysis to demonstrate DAMFSD’s feasibility and conducted a performance evaluation on the permissioned blockchain to show its applicability.}

Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are extensively used in both the military and commercial sectors, substantially reducing transaction costs and enhancing safety. Researchers have addressed secure control and communication protocols between software, firmware, and hardware components. This study focuses on the design of three critical elements: the hardware architecture, the software ground control station (GCS), and the firmware tasks within the UAV embedded system. These components are interconnected via an enhanced MAVLink protocol (EMP). Furthermore, various sensors are integrated into the UAV's peripheral devices. We discuss flight control (FC) approaches, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and the Kalman filter (KF), detailing the process of the hovering algorithm. Additionally, we explain how access is messaged and how message commands are implemented at the protocol layer. We propose a large-scale UAV system architecture suitable for commercial and military applications, supported by a real-life scenario. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the UAV in outdoor activities. Our findings confirm that the proposed UAV architecture is a robust and efficient system in practical applications.}

To enhance the quality of service (QoS) while prolonging the energy efficiency of smart sensors, a novel optimization algorithm is introduced. Referred to as the ”Adaptation-Based Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm,” this innovative approach combines the strengths of Grey Wolf Optimizers (GWO) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms. The methodology involves a new adaptation-based strategy and incorporates a hybrid algorithm that synergizes the exploratory and exploitative capabilities of both GWO and DE algorithms. This hybrid approach is leveraged to meticulously select optimal mutation new adaptation services, drawing from the GWO and DE algorithm frameworks. Notably, the algorithm’s control parameters autonomously adjust through insights gained from prior evolutionary searches. Furthermore, we enhance the DE-based crossover technique by integrating the proficient search capabilities of the GWO algorithm, renowned for tackling continuous global optimization problems. To validate our approach, we apply it to IoT scenarios and optimize QoS through a fitness function that comprehensively accounts for energy consumption, coverage rate, lifespan, and latency. Comparative evaluations against standard algorithms underscore the superior performance of our proposed methodology, particularly evident in its application to IoT-smart agriculture settings.}

	abstract = {Defect detection is crucial in manufacturing processes but traditional AI-based algorithms require large datasets for accurate results. For new or customized products, the number of images with detected defects is limited. Therefore, we developed a few-shot learning approach integrating a prototypical and relation network (PRN), algorithms with meta-learning, and the Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT). For rapid defect detection with IoT sensors, such minimal data are used for a smart manufacturing ecosystem., making it ideal for dynamic production environments. We tested the AIOT-enhanced PRN on two datasets using the following data augmentation methods: random rotation and horizontal translation (RH), random rotation and vertical translation (RV), and horizontal and vertical translation (HV). The developed PRN efficiently learned from minimal data to reduce the occurrence of overfitting issues in the MVTec 3D-AD dataset which are caused by a limited number of defect sample images. When testing the AIOT-enhanced PRN with the NEU-DET dataset, accuracies in 5-way 5-shot settings using RV, RH, 15° rotation, and HV were 100 %. Under Gaussian noise, the AIOT-enhanced PRN showed an accuracy of 100 % in 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 1-shot scenarios using HV. For salt-and-pepper noise, the accuracy of the AIOT-enhanced PRN ranged from 98.49 to 99.04 %. The developed AIOT-enhanced PRN improved defect detection accuracy and real-time monitoring capability with minimal data. The developed AIOT-enhanced PRN can be used for efficient and flexible product quality control in Industry 4.0.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an innovative blockchain deployment mechanism tailored for resource-constrained rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address the storage limitations and security concerns inherent in IoT environments, our approach includes several advanced techniques. First, we utilize a Block Allocation Strategy Contract (BASC) to manage storage efficiently. Second, we employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to dynamically perform block assignment, ensuring optimal storage utilization. To accommodate the resource constraints of IoT devices, we adopt the Smart Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT) consensus mechanism, which offers low latency and energy efficiency. Our framework demonstrates superior performance in storage optimization and reduced running time compared to existing methods, making it well-suited for large-scale IoT networks. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in enhancing security and operational efficiency in RSMA IoT networks.}

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoTs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), improving security and energy efficiency are key concerns. Clustering, which involves managing cluster heads, plays a pivotal role in extending network lifetime. The selection of a cluster head, responsible for data transfer between nodes, is a key aspect of network management. This paper proposes two variants of a novel algorithm designed for energy efficient communication in a resource constrained IoT environments. One variant considers remaining energy, distance, and node degree for cluster head selection, while the other focuses on remaining energy and distance only. Including node degree ensures cluster heads do not waste energy by remaining idle or performing unnecessary tasks such as the cluster head selection process in every round. The authors tested these variants against several well known algorithms using MATLAB simulation environment, evaluating factors such as operating nodes, number of clusters, transmission energy, and remaining energy. The proposed algorithm extends network lifetime by maintaining more operating nodes for longer, not changing clusters or cluster heads frequently, minimizing energy consumption for transmission, and conserving more remaining energy. Consequently, the proposed algorithm outperforms existing approaches by addressing issues like zero cluster head selection, compulsory cluster head selection in every round, avoiding cluster heads that connect to no nodes, and preventing network destabilization due to unnecessary re-elections.}

	abstract = {We developed a two-stage traffic sign recognition system to enhance safety and prevent tragic traffic incidents involving self-driving cars. In the first stage, YOLOv7 was employed as the detection model for identifying 31 types of traffic signs. Input images were set to 640 × 640 pixels to balance speed and accuracy, with high-definition images split into overlapping sub-images of the same size for training. The YOLOv7 model achieved a training accuracy of 99.2 % and demonstrated robustness across various scenes, earning a testing accuracy of 99 % in both YouTube and self-recorded driving videos. In the second stage, extracted road sign images underwent rectification before processing with OCR tools such as EasyOCR and PaddleOCR. Post-processing steps addressed potential confusion, particularly with city/town names. After extensive testing, the system achieved recognition rates of 97.5 % for alphabets and 99.4 % for Chinese characters. This system significantly enhances the ability of self-driving cars to detect and interpret traffic signs, thereby contributing to safer road travel.}

	abstract = {Following the establishment of the draft standardization for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), cryptographic systems across various sectors have undergone a paradigm shift. Although the theoretical strength of PQC has provided a robust foundation for securing communications against quantum threats, physical implementations of PQC algorithms remain vulnerable to Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs). Existing SCA studies predominantly focus on the attack process, lacking thorough side-channel leakage assessments and comparisons of inherent vulnerabilities at different attack points and with different countermeasures. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive assessment of side-channel leakage and resistance of four attack points within an ARM Cortex-M4 implementation of Kyber, including its masked version. This assessment employs a range of countermeasures such as noise addition, random delays, clock jitter, and their combinations. Besides, we also build deep-learning models for attacking, thereby verifying the results of the leakage assessments. By collaboratively utilizing three distinct leakage assessment approaches and deep learning-based attack results, we experimentally demonstrate that different algorithmic intermediate values of Kyber are suited to different countermeasures, which advances our understanding of the capacity and vulnerability of PQC implementations.}

	abstract = {The booming development of automation in industry has seen robotic arms replace much of manual labor for tasks such as casting, processing, packaging, and gripping on production lines. The Internet of Things (IoT) framework enables machines to transmit data over networks, and combining it with artificial intelligence can create smarter systems with higher operational efficiency and quality. However, artificial intelligence models need to be optimized for different applications. This paper proposes a You Only Look Once–uniform experimental design (YOLO–UED) model for gripping tasks performed by an IoT-based robotic arm. The YOLO–UED model was designed by combining the YOLOv4 model with UED to optimize the model architecture, resulting in improved performance in various applications. Considering the huge expense of computational resources required for visual inspection with robotic arms, pairing each robotic arm with a high-performance computing device would substantially increase costs. This study proposed an IoT framework to transmit the images captured by the robotic arm to a computing server for object recognition. Utilizing the IoT framework helps reduce costs and provides scalability and flexibility in handling computational tasks. The proposed method was found to effectively enhance the model's mean average precision to 95 %. The YOLO–UED model exhibited 7–10 % improvement over the YOLOv4 model in terms of target recognition accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method attained a success rate of 90% in gripping tasks performed on objects placed at various angles.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems across diverse applications has led to a notable increase in connected smart devices. Nevertheless, this surge in connectivity has induced a broad spectrum of vulnerabilities and threats, jeopardizing the security and safety of IoT applications. Security risk assessment methods are commonly employed to analyze risks. However, traditional IT and existing IoT-tailored security assessment methods often fail to fully address key IoT aspects: complex assets intercommunication, dynamic system changes, assets’ potential as attack platforms, safety impacts of security breaches, and assets resource constraints. Such oversights lead to significant risks being overlooked in the IoT ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a novel vulnerability-oriented risk identification framework comprising a four-step process as a core element of IoT security risk assessment, applicable to any IoT system. Our process enhances both traditional and IoT-specific security risk assessment methods by providing tailored approaches that address their crucial oversights for comprehensive IoT risk assessment. We validate our process with a case study of an IoT smart healthcare system using a proposed expert-driven approach. The results confirm that our process effectively identifies critical attack scenarios originating from the lack of proper security measures, mobility, and intercommunication processes of IoT devices in the healthcare system. Furthermore, our analysis reveals potential attacks that exploit the IoT devices as platforms to target the backend and user domains. We demonstrate the feasibility of our process for identifying realistic risks by conducting simulations of two derived attack scenarios using the Contiki Cooja network simulator.}
