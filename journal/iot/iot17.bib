	abstract = {This study proposes Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) routing strategies for disaster information delivery under the existence of obstacles that are based on the message relay decision (MRD) method. The proposed methods include a new added obstacle detection procedure to deliver messages to destinations while bypassing the obstacles. Efficient and precise relief activities are required immediately after disasters, and it is well known that obstacles appearing after a disaster will degrade message forwarding performance. Hence, the proposed schemes maintain communication performance by using a node to detect the existence of obstacles around itself. If there are obstacles, the message strategy is altered to bypass the obstacle. In this study, human-beings are the main mobile nodes and mobile phones are the creators and forwarders of messages. A multiple obstacle model is used to evaluate the schemes in terms of obstacle-resistance. Three routing schemes are proposed: MRD with area increase (MRDAI), Sub-Relay Station (SRS), and Adapted Predict Obstacle (APO). This model tests MRDAI and SRS at the macro level and APO under the existence of concave obstacles. The MRDAI scheme could autonomously perceive the existence of a huge obstacle and intelligently enlarge the original message relay area. The SRS scheme could re-establish sub-relay areas based on MRDAI. The APO scheme demonstrated resistance to concave obstacles, stability (less affected by environmental changes), and a high delivery ratio while ensuring low energy consumption. These proposed strategies for information delivery in a disaster area can be used to launch rescue activities more quickly.}

	abstract = {Opportunistic networks (OppNets) are dispersed in nature, with nodes acting as resource restrictions, with intermittent connectivity. These nodes are subject to various types of attacks, posing a security risk in data transmission. One of the most common attacks that cause jamming among the message forwarding nodes in infrastructure-less networks is Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Most of the methods addressing this type of attack rely on cryptographic algorithms, which are too difficult to implement. In this paper, a novel jamming attack detection technique (JADT) for OppNets, is proposed, which relies on the use of some statistical measures collected from the relay nodes and a prescribed threshold on the packet delivery ratio (PDR) to discover a jamming attack while decrypting the acknowledgement, stopping the message transmission and rebroadcasting the message through a different channel. The proposed JADT is evaluated using the ONE simulator, showing its superiority against the Fuzzy Geocasting mechanism in Opportunistic Networks (F-GSAF) scheme in terms of packet delivery ratio and overhead ratio, under varying TTL and buffer size.}

	abstract = {The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been at the forefront of progressing societal functionality. However, the addition of IoT devices in conventional information technology (IT) infrastructure has raised and prioritized the concern of information security and data privacy. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a framework for providing information to the public about the impact of vulnerabilities and exploits executed on a multitude of devices. While the CVSS addresses a plethora of conditions for vulnerabilities, it does not adequately make end-users aware of the impact data privacy can have on their devices. The primary objective of this research work is to extend the existing CVSS and propose a new model that acknowledges Transparency, Unlinkability, and Intervenability (TUI) to address the data privacy issues of IoT devices when scoring impacts of vulnerabilities. Our research has developed this model to provide a new sufficient score for analyzing the true impact of compromised data privacy. After the development of the new scoring for TUI, our research highlights case studies to emphasize the impact our TUI model will have on the CVSS. We strongly believe that our proposed model benefit both the individual users (consumers of IoT devices) and the industry to portray the possible vulnerabilities from a user standpoint as well as a manufacturer standpoint.}

	abstract = {The increasing global population and the growing demand for high-quality products have called for the modernization of agriculture. “Internet of Things” is one of the technologies that is predicted to offer many solutions. We conducted a discourse analysis of 19 interviews with farmers in Ontario, Canada, asking them to describe their experience of working with IoT and related technologies. One main discourse with two opposing tendencies was identified: farmers recognize their relationship with IoT and related technology and view technology as a kind of “employee”, but some tend to emphasize (1) an optimistic view which is discourse of technology is a “Helpful Employee”; while others tend to emphasize (2) a pessimistic view which is a discourse of technology is an “Untrustworthy Employee”. We examine these tendencies in the light of the literature on organizational behavior and identify potential outcomes of these beliefs. The results suggest that a farmer's style of approaching technology can be assessed on a similar scale as managers’ view of their employees and provide a framework for further research.}

	abstract = {Electrical load prediction has become an integral part of power system operation. Deep learning models have found popularity for this purpose. However, to achieve a desired prediction accuracy, they require huge amounts of data for training. Sharing electricity consumption data of individual households for load prediction may compromise user privacy and can be expensive in terms of communication resources. Therefore, edge computing methods, such as federated learning, are gaining more importance for this purpose. These methods can take advantage of the data without centrally storing it. This paper evaluates the performance of federated learning for short-term forecasting of individual house loads as well as the aggregate load. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this method by comparing it to centralized and local learning schemes. Moreover, a new client clustering method is proposed to reduce the convergence time of federated learning. The results show that federated learning has a good performance with a minimum root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.117 kWh for individual load forecasting.}

	abstract = {Underwater applications are becoming more and more interesting to industry and academy. They include data gathering for human safety and environment monitoring, control of underwater robots for various tasks and so on. Because of the accessibility limitations in underwater environment, applications tend to be automated and delay tolerant. In this paper, we consider IoT applications in underwater environment, while using Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) carry–store–forwarding paradigm. DTN routing protocols are used to forward data from the monitoring mobile sensors to collecting devices at the water surface and vice-versa. One characteristic of routing protocols for DTN is flooding of messages to increase the delivery probability. For instance, Epidemic Routing (ER) protocol creates a copy of each message for each new node that does not already have the message in its memory. This increases the probability of delivery, but on the other hand, creates overhead in each node’s buffer, and uses a lot of valuable energy from the forwarding and receiving nodes. This work aims to analyze by simulations the performance of Focused Beam Routing (FBR) protocol for different FBR angles and different applications. We use Delivery Probability, Average Number of Hops, Overhead Ratio and Buffer Occupancy to simulate our scenarios by The ONE simulator. Simulation results show that for narrow angles of FBR the performance is better. In case of FBR-45, average hop count and overhead ratio are decreased by 10.9% and 16.6% respectively, compared to FBR-180. However, delivery probability decreases by only 3.9%.}

Having a correct sitting posture over time is the greatest way to protect workers from the back pains according to the latest medical researchers. In this paper, we present the architecture and design details of the proposed posture monitoring system. The aim of this study is to propose a tracking posture system include complete information about the back posture. The existing posture monitoring systems in literature were limited to trunk flexion monitoring. In this proposal we introduce the shoulder bent monitoring in addition to the trunk flexion monitoring in order to provide complete information about the back posture. The proposed posture monitoring system is a smart belt equipped by inertial sensors to detect the trunk flexion and a shoulder bent to monitor the posture over time. A smartphone application was developed to notify the person in case of bad posture detection. The proposed system demonstrates encouraging results to monitor the posture over time of seating persons and improves their seating behavior by receiving a real time notification in case of bad posture detection.}

	abstract = {In the context of the global health crisis of 2020, the tendency of many people to self-diagnose at home virtually, prior to any physical interaction with medical professionals, has been increased. Existing self-diagnosis systems include those accessible via the Internet, which involve entering one’s symptoms. Several other methods do exist, for example, people read medical blogs or notes, which are often wrongly interpreted by them and they arrive at a completely different assumption regarding the cause of their symptoms. In this paper, a system called HealthCloud is proposed, for monitoring health status of heart patients using machine learning and cloud computing. This study aims to offer the ‘best of both worlds’, by combining the information required for the person to understand the disease in sufficient detail, with an accurate prediction as to whether they may have (in this case) heart disease or not. The presence of heart disease is predicted using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Trees. This paper evaluates these machine learning algorithms to obtain the most accurate model, in compliance with Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The performance of these machine learning models is measured and compared using the metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity, AUC scores, Execution Time, Latency, and Memory Usage. For better establishment of the results, these machine learning algorithms have been cross validated with 5-fold cross validation technique. With an accuracy rate of 85.96%, it has been found that Logistic Regression is the most responsive and accurate model amongst those models assessed. The Precision, Recall, Cross Validation mean and AUC Score for this model were 95.83%, 76.67%, 81.68% and 96% respectively. The algorithm and the mobile application were tested on Google Cloud Firebase with existing user inputs from the dataset, as well as with unseen new data. The use of this system can assist patients, both in reaching self-diagnosis decisions and in monitoring their health.}

	abstract = {Behavioral analysis (BA) on ubiquitous sensor data is the task of finding the latent distribution of features for modeling user-specific characteristics. These characteristics, in turn, can be used for a number of tasks including resource management, power efficiency, and smart home applications. In recent years, the employment of topic models for BA has been found to successfully extract the dynamics of the sensed data. Topic modeling is popularly performed on text data for mining inherent topics. The task of finding the latent topics in textual data is done in an unsupervised manner. In this work we propose a novel clustering technique for BA which can find hidden routines in ubiquitous data and also captures the pattern in the routines. Our approach efficiently works on high dimensional data for BA without performing any computationally expensive reduction operations. We evaluate three different techniques namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) for comparative study. We have analyzed the efficiency of the methods by using performance indices like perplexity and silhouette on three real-world ubiquitous sensor datasets namely, the Intel Lab, Kyoto, and MERL. Through rigorous experiments, we achieve silhouette scores of 0.7049 over the Intel Lab dataset, 0.6547 over the Kyoto dataset, and 0.8312 over the MERL dataset for clustering. In these cases, however, it is di cult to validate the results obtained as the datasets do not contain any ground truth information. Towards that, we investigate a self-supervised method that will be capable of capturing the inherent ground truths that are available in the dataset. We design a self-supervised technique which we apply on datasets containing ground truth and also without. We see that our performance on data without ground truth differs from that with ground truth by approximately 8% (F-score) hence showing the efficacy of self-supervised techniques towards capturing ground truth information.}

Low-resolution thermal imaging sensors are especially suitable for applications that require non-intrusive monitoring with proper privacy protection. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of a low-resolution thermal imaging sensor (i.e., Melexis MLX90640) focusing on algorithm design issues and solutions when detecting moving objects. This type of sensors are designed to operate with a two-subpage chessboard reading pattern, which gives rise to blob displacements across two subpages when target objects are in motion. We have conducted systematic characterization of the sensor and demonstrated issues through experimental measurements and analysis. We have also proposed a subpage bilinear interpolation method and an enhanced sensor data preprocessing method for occupancy estimation with moving objects. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed by training and testing classification algorithms using two datasets collected with objects of different moving speeds. Our performance results indicate that the proposed method could be used for occupancy estimation in various smart building and Internet of Things applications.}

The International Tennis Number (ITN) test was used to verify the accuracy of this IoT system in evaluating participant level. We conducted the ITN test on thirty-six participants and conducted one-way ANOVA on the ITN test results using IBM SPSS 26. The IMU in this study contained a tri-axis accelerometer (± 16 g) and tri-axis gyroscope (± 2000° /s) worn on the participants’ wrist connected to a wireless low-energy Bluetooth smart-phone with data sent to the computer terminal by cloud storage. Data processing including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms. One-way ANOVA analysis predicting participants’ ITN level and ITN field test scores yielded p < 0.001 at the three different skill levels tested. SVM (MinMax), SVM (Standardiser) and SVM (MaxAbsScaler) classified unique tennis strokes precision and recall factors at the three different skill levels reliably yielded in f1-scores above 0.90 for serve, forehand and backhand, with f1-scores for forehand and backhand volley scores falling below that. The results of this study suggest using a single six-axial 50 Hz IMU in combination with SVM and SVM + PCA represents a significant step towards a more reliable wearable tennis stroke performance and skill level real-time evaluation and feedback technology.}
