	abstract = {Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMs) device is the most developed technology, which has reshaped manual diabetes management with smart features having sensor, transmitter and monitor. However, the number of users for CGMs device is still very low compared to existing manual systems although this device provides a smart landmark in blood glucose monitoring for diabetes management. Consequently, the aspire of the assessment is to explore the factors that influence users’ intention to adopt CGMs device on the Internet of Things (IoT) based healthcare. This paper provides an adoption model for CGMs device by integrating some factors from different theories in existing studies of wearable healthcare devices. The proposed adoption model also examines current factors as a guideline for the users to adopt the CGMs device. We have collected data from 97 actual CGMs device users. Partial least square and structural equation modelling were involved for measurement and structural model assessment of this study. The experiential study specifies that interpersonal influence and trustworthiness are the strong predictors of attitude toward a wearable device, which shows significant relationships to use for CGMs device's adoption. Personal innovativeness shows no significant relationship with attitude toward a wearable device. Besides, self-efficacy has no direct influence on a person's health interest where heath interest directly influences users’ intention to use CGMs device. Moreover, perceived value is not found to be significant for measuring intention to use CGMs devices. The results from this research provide suggestions for the developers to ensure users’ intention to adopt CGMs device.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to become a new collaboration modality. Building on this proposition, we developed a taxonomy to explore how the IoT can enable collaboration, and conversely, how current knowledge on collaboration systems can guide IoT system development and research. The taxonomy is grounded in IoT use cases and bridges the technical and human aspects by drawing on collaboration and computer network theories. Our preliminary analysis of a subset of the taxonomy suggested that providing awareness support to IoT system users is likely to be a fundamental challenge in IoT system design. Our subsequent conceptualization of the entire taxonomy—what we present in this paper—applies awareness theory to arrive at a novel, comprehensive, and structured understanding of the awareness needs of IoT system users. This understanding can be leveraged as a formative tool by system developers to identify requirements and by researchers to develop design guidance for effective collaboration in IoT systems.}

	abstract = {While traditional malware relies on executables to function, fileless malware resides in memory to evade traditional detection methods. PowerShell which is a legitimate management tool used by system administrators provides an ideal cover for attackers. Many studies attempted to detect unknown malware with machine learning techniques. However, there are a few studies for detecting malicious PowerShell. Previous studies proposed methods of detecting malicious PowerShell with deep neural networks. Previous methods require decoding obfuscated samples for dynamic code evaluation. Decoding obfuscated samples is a troublesome task and is often time consuming. Security devices such as intrusion detection system (IDS) or sandbox are located at a point that can monitor all inbound traffic. In general, this traffic contains too massive samples to analyze by dynamic analysis. Therefore, a light-weight static method is desirable. In addition, some studies use their private dataset to evaluate their methods. In this paper, we propose a static method of detecting malicious PowerShell based on word embeddings. In our method, PowerShell scripts are separated into words, and these words are used as features for machine learning techniques. We improved the feature extraction method by selecting frequent words. To provide reproducibility, we obtained thousands of samples from multiple websites which are publicly available. The best F1 score achieves 0.995 in practical environment, and achieves 0.985 in 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we identified their malware families, and confirmed our method is effective to new ones.}

	abstract = {While large IT companies develop full-stack IoT services with their computing resources, there are many small/medium-sized IoT application/device developers who rely on multiple other service providers for various IoT infrastructure services such as data storage, wireless sensor networks, data analytics, and IoT platforms. While pricing decisions of these IoT services are critical to the sustainable growth of the customer base, there is a paucity of studies on the pricing of a set of services involving multiple service providers. Hence, it is challenging for IoT providers to make informed decisions in regards to the pricing of their IoT devices and services. This paper develops pricing game models involving multiple IoT providers and analyzes both a non-cooperative game and a cooperative game. Nash equilibrium prices for three IoT providers in a non-cooperative game and a cooperative game are derived. The non-cooperative Nash equilibrium price of each provider shows that the Nash equilibrium price consists of the average reservation price of the customers and the provider's cost. While the sum of the providers’ prices affects the IoT customers’ demand, the model shows that in pricing, each provider does not take the other providers’ pricing decisions into account. This paper examines how the cooperative game may generate more profits than the non-cooperative game and applies Shapley solutions for fair and efficient allocation of the payoff of the cooperative game. Contrary to conventional wisdom, consumer welfare and the IoT providers’ profit is not a zero-sum game. The three-provider pricing game model is generalized for any finite number of providers.}

Despite their benefits, the adoption of many cloud services is still limited, and many organizations are hesitant to adopt cloud technologies for several reasons. Researchers have used innovation adoption theories to explore the factors influencing users’ decisions toward accepting and using a new information system. This study presents a systematic review of the factors influencing organizational decisions concerning the acceptance of cloud-based technologies using the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. We analyze, integrate, and classify these factors and show that much of the literature has emphasized the technical aspects of technology adoption, such as cloud security. We further show factors like top management support, relative advantage, cloud complexity, and competitive pressure are the most critical factors affecting organizational attitude toward cloud technology adoption.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) systems are exposed to a large variety of threats due to the inclusion of many devices which may have different owners and manufacturers. IoT applications often include parts in clouds and fogs as well as being part of larger cyber-physical systems; that is, these systems are very complex, which also contributes to their security problems. The design of IoT-based applications must be able to handle this complexity and heterogeneity; patterns are a good approach for this purpose because of their abstraction power. When using patterns, a good catalog is necessary. We survey and classify existing IoT security patterns to see their coverage and quality to evaluate how appropriate they are to be part of a useful catalog. A practical catalog must cover most of the standard security mechanisms. Pattern descriptions include several sections according to a template. We conclude that the number of existing patterns is insufficient for a working catalog and most of them are incomplete or use different descriptions; we need to build a unified catalog. We have started in that direction by creating new patterns or rewriting existing patterns to make them follow a common description. To use the patterns, we need a secure development methodology and we survey IoT development methodologies; we find that none of them considers security or uses patterns. As a solution, we propose modifying existing pattern-based methodologies for distributed systems, of which there is a good variety, using one of them as reference for concreteness. We provide a list of possible research directions about these topics.}

	abstract = {We previously proposed a cross-referencing method for enabling multiple peer-to-peer network domains to manage their own public blockchains and periodically exchanging the state of the latest fixed block in the blockchain with hysteresis signatures among all the domains via an upper network layer. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method from three theoretical viewpoints: decentralization, scalability, and tamper resistance. We show that the performance of the entire system can be improved because transactions and blocks are distributed only inside the domain. We argue that the transaction processing capacity will increase to 56,000 transactions per second, which is as much as that of a VISA credit card system. The capacity is also evaluated by multiplying the number of domains by the average reduction in transaction-processing time due to the increase in block size and reduction in the block-generation-time interval by domain partition. For tamper resistance, each domain has evidence of the hysteresis signatures of the other domains in the blockchain. We introduce two types of tamper-resistance-improvement ratios as evaluation measures of tamper resistance for a blockchain and theoretically explain how tamper resistance is improved using our cross-referencing method. With our method, tamper resistance improves as the number of domains increases. The proposed system of 1,000 domains are 3-10 times more tamper-resistant than that of 100 domains, and the capacity is 10 times higher. We conclude that our method enables a more scalable and tamper-resistant public blockchain balanced with decentralization.}

There is a need for a comprehensive overview covering all of these challenges. Therefore, this paper provides a clear overview of the security, ethical, and privacy challenges faced by the common users and examines the current and emerging IoT laws and standards enacted by governments across different countries to combat the vulnerabilities of IoT. Trust and the potential challenges of smart contracts have also been discussed. In addition, the multitude of use cases described in this paper provides an insight into how the threats and vulnerabilities of IoT influence our lives. This study emphasizes a need for globalized IoT laws and that the common user be made aware of the security, ethical, and privacy threats imposed by modern IoT devices.

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the emergence of IoT technologies, the number of devices connected to the Internet is rapidly increasing. As a result, Network Address Translation (NAT) mechanism is widely used to let multiple devices within a private network make use of a fewer number of public IP addresses. In this research, we focus on Port Address Translation (PAT), an extension of the NAT mechanism that can translate both the IP address and the port number of a TCP/IP packet. An apparent downside of PAT is the fact that when all of the ports are used, no more new outbound connections could be made from the local addresses. In 2018, we introduced Slow-port-exhaustion DoS Attack on a virtual network, a novel type of DoS Attack that exploits some flaws of the TCP protocol and the limitation of the PAT mechanism. In this attack, a compromised internal virtual machine with a low amount of attack bandwidth can occupy the host machine’s ports for a long time and therefore makes other machines on the same virtual network could not connect to the external network. In this paper, we present SPEChecker, a testing tool that can be used to check the feasibility of the Slow-port-exhaustion attack on virtual networks. In the analysis, we also explore a case of a TCP Host that could support this attack. Our testing results also show the potential of SPEChecker in evaluating virtual network security.}

	abstract = {The healthcare Internet-of-Things (IoT) offers many benefits including data transmission in real-time mode, the ability to monitor the physiological state of the patient in a different interval of time. Devices such as blood-pressure monitors, glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG) wearable devices allow health providers to collect the patient health information locally and make a real-time decision based on the Patient Health Data (PHD). Hospitals have been adopting the IoT for many years and now they have healthcare IoT devices in patients’ rooms and their bodies. However, the medical agencies, hospitals, and companies do not consider the security risk of healthcare IoT devices connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). The IoT devices can be easily hacked and may lead to several potentially life-threatening risks due to poor authentication and encryption practices. Existing machine learning algorithms and blockchain approach working in the cloud computing environment are unable to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) like reliability, authentication, identification, and security requirements of healthcare IoT devices. Most of the traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques for healthcare IoT lacks the real-world implementation for secure data transmission. Therefore, blockchain is introduced for secure and reliable transaction in healthcare IoT. Whereas Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to extend the services of the cloud at the edge of networks. Integration of FC with blockchain can overcome the issue of healthcare IoT device identification, authentication, and verification for scalable frequent data transmission in a decentralized environment. Hence, a novel solution for the abovementioned problem is proposed using FC and blockchain. It includes an FC-based three-tier architecture, an analytical model, a mathematical framework, and an Advanced Signature-Based Encryption (ASE) algorithm for healthcare IoT device identification, verification, and Patient Health Data (PHD) authentication. The aim is to extend secure data transmission for healthcare IoT and end-users availing the real-time services. The proposed model and algorithm will be able to provide services for transaction and transmission near the edge in a secure manner. By analyzing the generated results from the proposed novel ASE algorithm for throughput, packet error, reliability, and malicious node detection accuracy; it is observed that the ASE algorithm in the FC environment easily outperforms the cloud and the other existing state of the art techniques such as FogBus, Femto cloud, Blockchain Fog-based Architecture Network (BFAN), and BeeKeeper. The malicious node detection accuracy of the ASE algorithm in the FC environment is 91% and in the cloud is 83%. Whereas the reliability percentage of the ASE algorithm in FC is 95% and in the cloud is 87%. The proposed approach is tested on simulators iFogSim (Net-Beans) and SimBlock.}

Objects are data resources which are used to store sensor data and action data. Data of an object may be stored in another object through communication among subjects and devices. A subject can get data of an object from another object even if the subject is not allowed to get the data, i.e. information illegally flows from the object to the subject. In addition, a subject can get data generated at time before which the capability token to get the data starts to be valid. Here, information flows from the object to the subject later than expected by the subject to get the data. In our previous studies, the OI (Operation Interruption) and the TBOI (Time-Based OI) protocols are proposed to interrupt operations implying illegal type of information flow and not only illegal but also late types of information flows, respectively. In this paper, the TBOI protocol is designed and implemented. In the evaluation, it is shown the late information flow is prevented in addition to the illegal one in the TBOI protocol although the request processing time is almost the same as the OI protocol.}

With the maturity of this technology, many companies have already provided various IoT devices to consumers, such as smart speakers and smart meters. These devices are wildly used not only in researches but also in many people’s daily lives. However, with the widely use of these devices, the security problems of IoT devices become more and more important. Although the device makers will provide the security solutions in technology level, users and IoT professors should have enough security knowledge as well. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generating web-based 3D and 360-degree VR materials for IoT security education. Our framework also supports the automatic generation of quizzes of IoT security, which will be used for evaluating the learning effects. The generated e-learning materials and quizzes can collect users’ log data for further analyzation. In this paper,we import two visually analyzing tools, Time Tunnel and Cubic Gantt Chart, into our framework. By using these two tools, we can obtain the activity patterns of the learners in different score ranges. Based on such result, we can improve the e-learning materials for increasing the educational effects, or provide advices to help learners effectively use our e-learning materials.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of computing devices connected through a network by using wired or wireless devices. It has been studied and implemented that optical fibre governed by semiconductor laser can be an effective medium for high-speed internet. Synchronization between lasers is an essential phenomenon to investigate several applications of IoT. In this article, we propose a synchronization scheme based on fractional-order chaotic laser models. During the synchronization process, we observed that the intermediate variable can also synchronize well and the corresponding error is significantly less, which is an indication of the compatibility of the scheme. A communication scheme is also implemented based on music signals to verify the application of the proposed scheme. The results can be effective for IoT with increased number of connected devices using semiconductor lasers.}

	abstract = {Technological interventions can play a significant role to keep optimal growing conditions in greenhouse industries with varying seasons and improve environmental performance by maintaining heating, cooling, and humidity levels. The research reported in this paper aims to integrate an Automated Climate Monitoring System (ACMS) for greenhouse in Ethiopia. Green- houses in Ethiopia require constant monitoring to properly maintain optimal climate conditions to grow plants all year round. To this end, they apply environment monitoring systems like timing devices, ON/OFF controllers and manual (human) monitoring which are prone to error. We propose a flexible ACMS prototype which can be applied without a user having the knowledge of how the system is made. The prototype system uses Advantech PC- cards and maintains the optimal climate condition (temperature, humidity and light intensity) of the greenhouses. Moreover, the easy to use graphical user interface provided by the system enables to combine the hardware and software functionalities for optimal manipulation of the environmental conditions. The system is centralized in that anyone can control several de- vices spread in the environment being monitored from one Computer. The performance of the system is found to be 88.89% which is “accurate and acceptable” result according to our confusion matrix. This indicates that better environmental supervision can be achieved when using the system. Moreover, the mean user acceptance (by the flower growers) of the ACMS and timing devices, ON/OFF implementations is 84.6% and 73.2%, respectively, highlighting the potential for integrating the ACMS into the greenhouse industry.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained considerable attention in different academic and real-world research domains. Due to the data-driven nature of IoT, the data aggregation process in such systems is significantly challenging. The main goal of data aggregation mechanisms is to achieve high Quality of Services (QoS), including optimal data transmission delay, reliability, and energy consumption. Despite various types of available review papers on this particular topic, we feel that the existing literature does not satisfy the requirements of being up to date and comprehensive. This paper presents a systematic literature review for data aggregation mechanisms on IoT that illustrates the critical challenges in the context design issues. Further, the data aggregation mechanisms are divided into two main categories: client-server-based and mobile agent-based ones. The client-server-based data aggregation mechanisms are also presented in three groups: cluster-based, tree-based, and centralized methods. Finally, we outline possible future research trends in data aggregation on IoT.}

	abstract = {Edge computing aims at improving performance by storing and processing data closer to their source. The\nk\nNearest-Neighbor (\nk\n-NN) query is a common spatial query in several applications. For example, this query can be used for distance classification of a group of points against a big reference dataset to derive the dominating feature class. Typically, GPU devices have much larger numbers of processing cores than CPUs and faster device memory than main memory accessed by CPUs, thus, providing higher computing power. However, since device and/or main memory may not be able to host an entire reference dataset, the use of secondary storage is inevitable. Solid State Disks (SSDs) could be used for storing such a dataset. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a distributed edge-computing environment where large-scale processing of the\nk\n-NN query can be accomplished by executing an efficient algorithm for processing the\nk\n-NN query on its (GPU and SSD enabled) edge nodes. We also propose a new algorithm for this purpose, a GPU-based partitioning algorithm for processing the\nk\n-NN query on big reference data stored on SSDs. We implement this algorithm in a GPU-enabled edge-computing device, hosting reference data on an SSD. Using synthetic datasets, we present an extensive experimental performance comparison of the new algorithm against two existing ones (working on memory-resident data) proposed by other researchers and two existing ones (working on SSD-resident data) recently proposed by us. The new algorithm excels in all the conducted experiments and outperforms its competitors.}
