	abstract = {This paper develops an architecture for flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) to enable monitoring of water quality in a shrimp farm. Firstly, the key monitoring parameters for the characterization of water quality are highlighted and their desired operational ranges are summarized. These parameters directly influence shrimp survival and healthy growth. Based on the considered sensing modality, a reference architecture for implementing a cost-effective FANET based mobile sensing platform is developed. The controlled mobility of the platform is harnessed to increase the spatial monitoring resolution without the need for extensive infrastructure deployment. The proposed solution will be offered to shrimp farmers in the Mexican state of Colima once the laboratory trials are concluded.}

	abstract = {Breakthrough advances on communication technology, electronics and sensors have led to integrated commercialized products ready to be deployed in several domains. Agriculture is and has always been a domain that adopts state of the art technologies in time, in order to optimize productivity, cost, convenience, and environmental protection. The deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in agriculture constitutes a recent example. A timely topic in UAV deployment is the transition from a single UAV system to a multi-UAV system. Collaboration and coordination of multiple UAVs can build a system that far exceeds the capabilities of a single UAV. However, one of the most important design problems multi-UAV systems face is choosing the right routing protocol which is prerequisite for the cooperation and collaboration among UAVs. In this study, an extensive review of Flying Ad-hoc network (FANET) routing protocols is performed, where their different strategies and routing techniques are thoroughly described. A classification of UAV deployment in agriculture is conducted resulting in six (6) different applications: Crop Scouting, Crop Surveying and Mapping, Crop Insurance, Cultivation Planning and Management, Application of Chemicals,and Geofencing. Finally, a theoretical analysis is performed that suggests which routing protocol can serve better each agriculture application, depending on the mobility models and the agricultural-specific application requirements.}

Moreover, we present the role of UAV technology in smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of UAVs in various scenarios, including irrigation, fertilization, use of pesticides, weed management, plant growth monitoring, crop disease management, and field-level phenotyping. Furthermore, the utilization of UAV systems in complex agricultural environments is also analyzed. Our conclusion is that IoT and UAV are two of the most important technologies that transform traditional cultivation practices into a new perspective of intelligence in precision agriculture.}

	abstract = {The development of IoT is increasing in our daily life. Its applications are now becoming famous in rural areas also, such as Agriculture 4.0. Cheap sensors, climate data, soil information, and drones are now used to solve many real-time problems. One of the most emerging topics in the IoT in the Agriculture field is IoT based precision agriculture. The range of IoT applications can range between water spraying from drone, soil recommendation for different crops, weather prediction and recommendation for water supply, etc. In this paper we propose a system that will recommend whether water is needed or not by predicting the rain fall using Genetic Algorithm. In this article, we proposed a unique decision making method to predict Rainfall using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to identify the necessity of manual water supply is needed or not. The sensor based system will be activated to check wheather the GA based system completes its prediction correctly or not by sensing moisture level from the soil. If the moisture level of the soil crosses the pre-defined threshold value then plant watering is performed by quadrotor UAV. A terrace gardening system is also implemented in this article, which uses a pump for water spraying. Various atmospheric parameters help to develop a rainfall prediction system to enhance efficiancy more than 80% in the proposed IopaT system to make the system more interoperable.}

	abstract = {In our world of advancing technologies, automobiles are one industry where we can see improved ergonomics and feature progressions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) is the future of most of the cutting-edge applications developed for automobile industry to enhance performance and safety. The objective of this research is to develop a new feature that can enhance the existing technology present in automobiles at low-cost. We had previously developed a technology known as Smart Accident Precognition System (SAPS) which reduces the rate of accidents in automobile and also enhance the safety of the passengers. Current research advances this technique by integrating Google Assistant with the SAPS. The proposed system integrates several embedded devices in the automobiles that monitor various aspects such as speed, distance, safety measures like seatbelt, door locks, airbags, handbrakes etc. The real-time data is stored in the cloud and the vehicle can adapt to various situations from the previous data collected. Also, with the Google Assistant user can lock and unlock, start and stop, alert and do various automated tasks such as low fuel remainder, insurance remainders etc. The proposed IoT enabled real-time vehicle system can detect accidents and adapt to change according to various conditions. Further, with RFID keyless entry authentication the vehicle is secure than ever before. This proposed system is much efficient to the existing systems and will have a great positive impact in the automobile industry and society.}

	abstract = {Contact tracing has been proven an essential practice during pandemic outbreaks and is a critical non-pharmaceutical intervention to reduce mortality rates. While traditional contact tracing approaches are gradually being replaced by peer-to-peer smartphone-based systems, the new applications tend to ignore the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem that is steadily growing in smart city environments. This work presents a contact tracing framework that logs smart space users’ co-existence using IoT devices as reference anchors. The design is non-intrusive as it relies on passive wireless interactions between each user’s carried equipment (e.g., smartphone, wearable, proximity card) with an IoT device by utilizing received signal strength indicators (RSSI). The proposed framework can log the identities for the interacting pair, their estimated distance, and the overlapping time duration. Also, we propose a machine learning-based infection risk classification method to characterize each interaction that relies on RSSI-based attributes and contact details. Finally, the proposed contact tracing framework’s performance is evaluated through a real-world case study of actual wireless interactions between users and IoT devices through Bluetooth Low Energy advertising. The results demonstrate the system’s capability to accurately capture contact between mobile users and assess their infection risk provided adequate model training over time.}

	abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health services around the globe are struggling. An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients’ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients’ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS.}

Using a series of experiments on real hardware as a demonstration, we show the shortcomings of the cache hit rate metric and introduce the two new metrics cache access factor and cache latency factor that provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of in-network caching strategies.}

ISM bands, however, are associated with a myriad of problems responsible for signal degradation and pollution that lead to application Quality of Service (QoS) issues. In this context, the use of alternative transmission mechanisms serve as backup to traditional schemes. One of such mechanisms relies on sub-ultrasonic and ultrasonic signals for the propagation of IoT device traffic. In this paper, we recycle a well known acoustic modulation scheme intended to be used in legacy Public Switching Telephone Networks (PSTNs) to support sub-ultrasonic and ultrasonic channels. This scheme becomes the basic building block of a physical layer that is combined with other well known elements of the IoT layered architecture. This not only includes a customized link layer but also an adaptation layer that enables full integration with upper layers.}

	abstract = {Increasing the number of business operators using anonymously processed information is a critical privacy topic in Japan. To promote the use of the information, an “anonymization dictionary” is proposed and implemented. The dictionary is the system that shares use-cases regarding the manner by which business operators produce and provide anonymously processed information. To develop this system, two technical difficulties are resolved: the lack of (i) a method to acquire the use-cases and (ii) a data structure to store the use-cases. In terms of (i), disclosed statements that specify the production and provisioning processes for anonymously processed information is focused. To recognize the statements described in the business operators’ webpages as the use-cases, a web crawler that acquires the statements is developed. The crawler acquires 331 use-cases (statements) in a short duration. In terms of (ii), to define a concrete data structure to store anonymously processed information use-cases, the structure of the use-cases acquired is analyzed. The use-cases are stored into the structure and then in the DB of the dictionary application. This enables a search function to be provided for identifying the necessary use-cases and organizing use-cases in a readable form to the business operators.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a developing technology in our time that is prone to security problems as it uses wireless and shared networks. A challenging scenario in IoT environments is Device-to-Device (D2D) communication where an authentication server, as a trusted third-party, does not participate in the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) process and only cooperates in the process of allocating and updating long-term secret keys. Various authentication protocols have been suggested for such situations but have not been able to meet security and efficiency requirements. This paper examined three related protocols and demonstrated that they failed to remain anonymous and insecure against Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI) and clogging attacks. To counter these pitfalls, a new D2D mutual AKA protocol that is anonymous, untraceable, and highly secure was designed that needed no secure channel to generate paired private and public keys in the registration phase. Formal security proof and security analysis using BAN logic, Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and Scyther tool showed that our proposed protocol satisfied security requirements. The communication and computation costs and energy consumption comparisons denoted that our design had a better performance than existing protocols.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and advances in their computing capabilities give an impetus to the Edge Computing (EC) paradigm that can facilitate localize computing and data storage. As a result, limitations like network connectivity issues, data mobility constraints, and real-time processing delays, in Cloud computing can be addressed more efficiently. EC can create a lot of opportunities across the breadth of the IT domains and cyber–physical systems. Several studies have been conducted describing EC general requirements, challenges, and issues. However, considering the complexity involved in the EC paradigm, non-functional requirements (NFRs) are equally important as functional requirements, to be thoroughly investigated. This paper discusses NFRs, namely, performance, reliability, scalability, and security that can assist in maturing the EC paradigm. To accomplish the objective, available case studies and the state-of-the-art related to non-functional requirements, real-world issues, and challenges concerning EC are reviewed. Ultimately, the paper anatomizes the aforementioned NFRs leveraging the six-part scenario form of source-stimulus-artifact-environment-response-response measure to assert Quality of Service (QoS) in EC.}

	abstract = {Water management, distribution, and consumption are not visualized in real time in conventional systems; this delays the leakage detection process. Nowadays, an increase in the development of smart water- meter trials and demand management requires higher spatial and temporal decisions. This paper proposes a solution for the water management and distribution problem. The solution is based on the IoT technology. First, a prototype abstracting the water distribution network (WDN) is developed. Second, sensors are installed on the network to capture the targeted physical quantities such as water pH level, turbidity, and flow rates. Third, sensor network is established to send the readings to Firebase platform. Fourth, an IoT testbed architecture is proposed to comprehensively interface all the IoT modules. Leakage detection scenarios are conducted to sense and warn admins and users to fix it. Application of the proposed system to smart homes would enable monitoring of water quality, measurement of consumption, and detection of leakage. Moreover, it provides an awareness highlight to users about consumption, and a monitoring platform for both users and admins for leakage detection.}

	abstract = {Due to globalization, supply chain networks are moving towards higher complexity and becoming vulnerable to various kinds of attacks such as counterfeiting, information tampering, and so on. Appropriate approaches are necessary to tackle different types of attacks and to ensure the required supply chain security. In this paper, we have addressed the product counterfeiting issue using Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) enabled Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag. In this research, as a preferred alternative to the traditional centralized databases, blockchain technology has been leveraged to support anti-counterfeiting. Applying blockchain technology to supply chains can add many useful features such as decentralization, immutability, transparency, traceability, non-repudiation, complicated record-keeping, and so on. We have also used a reputation-based consensus algorithm for the blockchain which is less resource-intensive and thus will not indirectly impose additional cost on supply chain products. In the same research direction, we have devised our system architecture that is suitable for lightweight supply chain devices. The proposed three protocols namely: registration protocol, verification protocol, and transaction protocol along with the blockchain technology help to transfer the ownership of the authentic product and keep the sensitive supply chain information safe. An encryption-based secret sharing technique has also been introduced to assist data protection.}

	abstract = {Printing over a network and calling over VoIP technology are routine at present. This article investigates to what extent these services can be attacked using freeware in the real world if they are not configured securely. In finding out that attacks of high impact, termed the Printjack and Phonejack families, could be mounted at least from insiders, the article also observes that secure configurations do not appear to be widely adopted. Users with the necessary skills may put existing security measures in place with printers, but would need novel measures, which the article prototypes, with phones in order for a pair of peers to call each other securely and without trusting anyone else, including sysadmins.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) market has shown strong growth in recent years, where many manufacturers of IoT devices and IoT-related service providers are competing. Time to market has become essential to be competitive. The faster a competitor develops and integrates his product, the more likely he is to dominate the market. This competition could lead to critical security issues due to the lack of testing or the short development time. Moreover, lots of IoT devices present some vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. They are also constantly subject to Zero-days, which require quick intervention to maintain the security of the environments in which they are deployed in. For these purposes, the quick update of the firmware image of these IoT devices is an effective way to counter most of these attacks. This document starts by defining the firmware update mechanisms for IoT, and in particular the ones done Over-The-Air. Then presents a state-of-the-art of the currently proposed solutions, with the particularity of surveying from the literature, the standardization bodies and from some well-known industrial solutions. It also proposes a new classification of the different types of System on Chip (SoC) present in the marketed IoT devices together with an analysis of the different challenges and threats related to the OTA update. The objective is to open up the horizon for future research directions.}

	abstract = {The use of face masks is an important way to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we envision the Smart Mask, an IoT supported platform and ecosystem aiming to prevent and control the spreading of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses. The integration of sensing, materials, AI, wireless, IoT, and software will help the gathering of health data and health-related event detection in real time from the user as well as from their environment. In the larger scale, with the help of AI-based analysis for health data it is possible to predict and decrease medical costs with accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, where the comparison of personal data to large-scale public data enables drawing up a personal health trajectory, for example. Key research problems for smart respiratory protective equipment are identified in addition to future research directions. A Smart Mask prototype was developed with accompanying user application, backend and heath AI to study the concept.}
