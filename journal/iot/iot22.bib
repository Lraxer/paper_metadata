	abstract = {The last decade has seen the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is enabling a range of new applications based on the connection of physical objects to the Internet. The growing diversity of IoT connectivity technologies is bringing new challenges to IoT solution designers. Indeed, it is increasingly difficult to choose and configure the network technology for a given use-case. In this article, we formalize and investigate the design optimization problem for selecting and configuring the IoT connectivity technology of an application that can evolve over time. Finding the right abstractions and the good balance between performance and evaluation complexity to compare networking options is a key research challenge. To address this problem we propose to separate the concerns of IoT application architects from those of network experts and to provide a methodology, HINTS, to help designers in making customized decision. HINTS combines IoT application requirements and goals abstraction, IoT network modeling, discrete-event network simulation and a multiple attribute decision making method. The application of the methodology on three use-cases highlights how it helps in (i) selecting the best network technology option, (ii) defining an appropriate configuration and (iii) anticipating the behavior when device density or workload intensity scales up. The main contribution of this paper is to propose the first formal approach and associated algorithm to automatically optimize the design of the IoT connectivity of an application. Results show that it can yield up to a factor two improvement in the solution performance.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, from companies to academics, researchers across the world are interested in developing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) due to their incredible feats in various applications, such as image recognition, playing complex games, and large-scale information retrieval such as web search. However, when people enjoy the advantages of DNNs, the high computational and power demands on resource-constrained electronic devices of the DNN model have received more attention. Optimizing the DNN model, such as model compression, is crucial to ensure wide deployment of DNNs and promote DNNs to implement most resource-constrained scenarios. Among many techniques, tensor train (TT) decomposition is considered a very promising technology. Although our previous efforts achieve (1) expanding limits of the number of multiplications eliminating all redundant computations; and (2) decomposing into multistage processing to reduce memory traffic, the potential of this work is not fully explored.}

Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been presented as a promising alternative for detecting DoS attacks. Therefore, understanding the impact of the different ML techniques in a comprehensive way is quite important. In this work, we present an extended evaluation covering both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques considering three feature selection algorithms. Our experiments are based on Flooding, Grayhole, and Blackhole DoS attacks from a public WSN-based dataset. As an additional contribution, we investigate the adjustable parameter\nK\nto maximize the performance of unsupervised techniques. Experimental comparison is guided by the accuracy, recall, precision, F1-Score, and processing time metrics. Results reveal that, among the studied ML algorithms, the supervised techniques present better performance than the unsupervised ones: the highest F1-Score (95.69%) was obtained by the REPTree with the OneR feature selection algorithm for detecting blackhole attacks. In general, supervised techniques are faster than unsupervised. REPTree is the fastest, spending 0.931 \nÎ¼\ns\non average to classify a sample.}

	abstract = {IoMT has been gradually gaining traction in the healthcare industry and holds up the prospect of a time when it will not only be common but also fully expanded outside the confines of clinics and hospitals. IoMT deployment in real life calls for improved responsiveness and healthcare quality while reducing patient care expenses. But the cybercriminals try every computer, every hospital, every day several times. Consequently, shoddy security is one of the biggest problems of IoT in healthcare. IoMT demands more stringent security since medical data is sensitive and its contents are essential. IoMT devices are accessible for attackers to acquire control of, and once they do, they can start modifying the course of treatment possibly leading to patient fatalities. To satisfy the security requirements, this research suggests a group-based efficient authentication and key agreement (GBEAKA) protocol, which is suitable for low-power IoMT devices. The suggested protocol meets security objectives like authentication & key agreement between the devices, privacy of subscribers, unlinkability, key confirmation, and perfect forward/backward key secrecy between the sessions. More conclusive AVISPA tool and BAN logic has been used to analyze the security claims of the suggested protocol, and the findings show that it is secure against various cryptographic attacks. According to a mathematical study of the protocol, the suggested protocol is also compatible with low-power IoMT (LPIoMT) devices since it accomplishes its goals with the least amount of signaling overhead, bandwidth consumption, and computational cost.}

Along with the rapid growth of these technologies, new architectures at mobile edge caching (MEC) are also evolving. One of the aspects of smartphone's popularity is using social networks and sharing content between users of these networks. Generating various types of content on social networks is impressive and has caused huge data traffic in the network. Therefore, providing edge caching mechanisms in terms of social relationships and behavioral characteristics of users to reduce network traffic and delays in accessing popular content should be considered. As far as we know, no review paper has been provided in this context. In this paper, we intend to express the literature on the subject and then review the social-aware edge caching mechanisms. Then, we consider users' social and behavioral characteristics that are effective in caching strategies. Furthermore, we provide a taxonomy of social-aware edge caching approaches consisting of game theory-based, machine learning-based, model-based, and heuristic-based approaches. Finally, this study concludes by outlining some of the challenges ahead and research future directions.}

	abstract = {IoT has enabled the rapid growth of smart remote healthcare applications. These IoT-based remote healthcare applications deliver fast and preventive medical services to patients at risk or with chronic diseases. However, ensuring data security and patient privacy while exchanging sensitive medical data among medical IoT devices is still a significant concern in remote healthcare applications. Altered or corrupted medical data may cause wrong treatment and create grave health issues for patients. Moreover, current remote medical applicationsâ efficiency and response time need to be addressed and improved. Considering the need for secure and efficient patient care, this paper proposes a lightweight Blockchain-based and Fog-enabled remote patient monitoring system that provides a high level of security and efficient response time. Simulation results and security analysis show that the proposed lightweight blockchain architecture fits the resource-constrained IoT devices well and is secure against attacks. Moreover, the augmentation of Fog computing improved the responsiveness of the remote patient monitoring system by 40%.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a last mile delivery selection model using crowdsourced workers that optimizes the trade-off between cost, time, and workersâ performance. Most of the current methods utilize either greedy workerâtask assignments or a task-by-task basis selection to reach a sufficient workerâtask assignment. However, a better trade-off between the distance traveled and delivery time can be further obtained by considering the quality of performance on the tasks as a whole rather than treating tasks individually. As a solution, we present a novel framework for last mile delivery which separates the routing and assignment aspects of the problem and solves the assignment problem by maximizing the overall quality of the delivery. The Quality of Service (QoS) is defined as a non-linear function of the number of allocated tasks, distance traveled, timeliness of the delivery, workersâ reputation, and confidence in delivery completion. In the first step, the delivery tasks to be shipped from a single warehouse are clustered using k-medoids. The set of tasks in each cluster are to be delivered by the same worker. The shipping provider will send a truck to handover the corresponding parcels to each worker. Accordingly, the shortest route for the truck is computed using Tabu search, where the handover points to the potential workers are the centroids of the clusters. Tabu search is also used to compute the potential workersâ routes from the handover point through all the tasks in the cluster. Finally, genetic algorithm is used to effectively solve the assignment problem where each worker is assigned to several neighboring tasks. The performance of the proposed assignment mechanism is evaluated and compared to greedy solutions with respect to the QoS as well as its components. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 100% task allocation ratio while outperforming greedy selections in terms of QoS. Moreover, it is able to increase confidence in task completion by 20.3% on average and prevent delays to the schedule of the truck.}

	abstract = {The substantial acceptance of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in digital healthcare systems necessitates secure data processing before storing it on a cloud server. Since resource-limited IoT devices engender complexity in secure processing, edge computing technology is adopted. Edge-assisted IoT locates edge nodes in proximity to user devices enabling computation offloading and seamless interaction between IoT applications and cloud servers. Integration of these entities results in severe security and privacy issues due to large amount of sensitive information transmitted over vulnerable communication channels. As such, information protection and data integrity in edge-assisted IoT have become critical factors for improvement. Several data processing models have been proposed regarding the above-stated concerns. However, under a powerful adversarial scenario, traditional solutions lack in preserving robust security and privacy. This motivates us to address critical challenges of communication security and privacy-preserving computation offloading in edge-assisted IoT systems. In this article, we design a homomorphic cryptosystem-based secure data processing model (HC-SDPM), enabling secure data collection and aggregation offloading on edge nodes for our hypothesized edge-assisted IoT healthcare system. Paillier homomorphic encryption and certificateless linear homomorphic ID-based signatures are utilized to achieve end-to-end confidentiality and data integrity during transmission and aggregation. Moreover, HC-SDPM involves a semi-trusted authority to enable key-escrow resilience. The security analysis of HC-SDPM assures signatures unforgeability in the random oracle model under computational DiffieâHellman assumptions. Compared with similar modeled schemes, HC-SDPM demonstrates a relative advantage in computational overhead, communication overhead, and storage complexity.}

However, the standards of the available frameworks can no longer sustain the rapid advancement and hinder the integration of FL solutions, which can be prominent in advancing the field. In this paper, we propose ModularFed, a research-focused framework that addresses the complexity of FL implementations and the lack of adaptability and extendability in the available frameworks. We provide a comprehensive architecture that assists FL approaches through well-defined protocols covering three dominant FL paradigms: adaptable workflow, datasets distribution, and third-party application support. Within this architecture, protocols are blueprints that strictly define the frameworkâs componentsâ design, contribute to its flexibility, and strengthen its infrastructure. Further, our protocols aim to enable modularity in FL, supporting third-party plug-and-play architecture and dynamic simulators coupled with major built-in data distributors. Additionally, the framework support wrapping multiple approaches in a single environment to enable consistent replication of FL issues such as clientsâ deficiency, data distribution, and network latency, which entails a fair comparison of techniques outlying FL technologies. In our evaluation, we examine the applicability of our framework addressing major FL domains, including statistical distribution and modular-based resource monitoring tools and client selection. Moreover, our comparison analysis indicates that our architecture has an inconsiderable impact on performance compared to other approaches.}

However, the sustainability of these networks is critical so that Fog servers efficiently allocate/offload increasing task types to appropriate resources. In this paper, a novel task offloading scheme called Task Offloading Scheme with P4 (TOS-P4) is proposed for Fog-based IoT networks using Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4) technology. The proposed scheme is evaluated through an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) application scenario and compared to a conventional model called Task Offloading Scheme with Software-Defined Networking controller (TOS-SDN). In this scenario, the network traffic is regulated by P4, allowing task offload decisions to be more flexible and programmable according to server loads and predetermined forwarding rules. We present the applicability of the proposed task offloading scheme in the Fog-based IoT network and its benefits to network performance in terms of latency and computation overhead. According to the experimental results, when the serversâ load status is measured at 5 s intervals, TOS-P4 is 6.54 times more efficient than TOS-SDN in waiting times of tasks received at Resource Poor (RP) Fog servers. Also, in TOS-SDN case, the average waiting time of a task on RP Fog servers is 30 times more compared to Resource Rich (RR) Fog servers.}

The IEEE 802.15.4e-TSCH mode has been proposed to meet the needs of such networks and has been largely investigated in the literature to fully exploit its advantages for a wide range of applications, mainly in the industrial automation and process control domains. However, scheduling TSCH transmissions in the time and frequency dimensions is left to implementers. A plethora of TSCH schedulers are proposed in the literature and are developed either in a centralized or a decentralized fashion. Our work aims at giving an overview of the most relevant decentralized TSCH schedulers which we classified into : autonomous, distributed, and Reinforcement Learning based protocols. Then, an evaluation of a selection of these schedulers is carried out in a scenario considering highly heterogeneous traffic, i.e, considering the coexistence of very high and very low data rates in the network. These traffic conditions can be faced in current and future IoT applications, especially surveillance applications. Based on the experiment results, a set of conclusions is drawn for each of the considered schedulers to gain insights into their relevance for applications that need to handle highly heterogeneous traffic.}

Here most energy is consumed in finding suitable virtual machines (VMs) that can execute IoT tasks without resource fragments. Therefore, a significant problem is minimizing energy consumption through efficient task placement that leads to load balance and minimizes resource leakage. To resolve this problem, we proposed a dual-phase metaheuristic algorithm called CSSA-DE. First, we conduct a clustering approach to group computing nodes into effective clusters. Each node is trained at different utilization levels, and the one that can yield the highest Performance-to-Power Ratio (PPR) is selected as the mega cluster head (MCH). Then, we integrated the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to expand the high search efficiency of finding an appropriate pair task-VM combination. Further, the integration phase can exploit the count of overloaded and underloaded VMs, reducing resource fragments. The performance of CSSA-DE is highly competitive and relatively better in multiple cases compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.}

OCF Iotivity sends/receives the modelsâ weights to/from the server, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to monitor clientsâ local training. After receiving partially trained models from clients, the server performs the optimal model selection using the normal distribution method by considering the performance of the model. Finally, the best-selected models are aggregated, and the final model is broadcasted to the clients. The framework utilizes Raspberrypi 4 devices as clients with limited computational capabilities, due to which the experiments are conducted with structured energy consumption data. The dataset comprises of 8 multistory residential buildings located in different geographical locations of the Republic of Korea. Each residential building is treated as an FL client and registered on DT using the IP address and port number. The DT-FL framework can be used with classification and regression datasets, and the model architecture for that data can be designed on the DT platform. The experiments are conducted with the partial and full participation of clients. The results show the minimum delay time in physical and virtual object synchronization and better performance and generalization of the global model for each client. The source code of the proposed DT-FL framework is available on\nGitHub\n.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is likely to revolutionize healthcare, energy, education, transportation, manufacturing, military, agriculture, and other industries. However, for the successful deployment of IoT in various industries, methods for detecting and preventing security breaches need to be designed and implemented. Over the past decade, a number of researchers in academia and industry have used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for computer networks in general; however, not much work has been done for intrusion detection in IoT. Datasets collected by various organizations were used by many of these researchers to train ML models for predicting intrusions. It is common for datasets used in such systems to be imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have equal number of samples). Predictive models developed using machine learning algorithms can produce unsatisfactory results if imbalanced datasets are used for training the models. To remedy this problem, techniques such as random oversampling and undersampling do not produce robust models. Furthermore, ML models trained using traditional loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss, fail to accurately predict minority class instances. To overcome the data imbalance problem for intrusion detection in IoT, we leverage the specialized loss function, called focal loss, that automatically down-weighs easy examples and focuses on the hard negatives by facilitating dynamically scaled-gradient updates for training effective ML models. We implemented our approach using two well-known Deep Learning (DL) neural network architectures. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using three datasets from diverse IoT domains and compared our proposed approach with state-of-the-art intrusion detection models. We found that, our approach (training DL models using focal loss function) performed better with respect to accuracy, precision,\nF\n1\nscore and MCC score by as much as 24%, 39%, 39%, and 60%, respectively, compared to training them on the same datasets using cross-entropy loss function. We also compare our approach with two other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our approach performs better than these state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Internet of Things systems connect several smart devices to provide required services. The IoT applications employ Machine Type Communications to meet the requirements of IoT applications. In such systems, one of the most important challenges is providing a proper security level for each IoT device. The LTE network is an appropriate network for IoT systems. One of the most important objectives in an LTE-enabled IoT network is to manage a great number of IoT devices with a high level of security. In addition, when plenty of IoT devices connect to the LTE system simultaneously, all the IoT devices need to run a full AKA process, which might make problematic signaling congestion. Thus, supporting a huge number of IoT nodes (i.e., devices) is a fundamental requirement of IoT systems. In this paper, taking into consideration the important performance and security issues, we suggest a lightweight group-based AKA protocol for IoT applications called Robust Evolved Packet System-Authentication and Key Agreement 5 (REPS-AKA5) protocol. The proposed method presents a strong mutual authentication between all involved nodes. In addition, the suggested approach presents considerable confidentiality in the data/control plan using an optimized combination of symmetric and asymmetric keys. By the proposed method, a huge number of IoT devices can be simultaneously verified by the LTE system. We verified the proposed AKA method by using the AVISPA tool and BAN logic, Scyther tool to check that the REPS-AKA5 method is resistant to different known security attacks. Furthermore, the obtained results show that the proposed method provides better performance compared with other AKA methods in terms of computational cost, storage overhead, bandwidth consumption, and signaling overhead. Hence, the REPS-AKA5 approach is able to achieve not only defined security requirements but also a considerable improvement in network performance.}

	abstract = {Person reidentification (re-ID) is becoming one of the most significant application areas of computer vision due to its importance for science and social security. Due to enormous size and scale of camera systems it is beneficial to develop edge computing re-ID applications where at least part of the analysis could be performed by the cameras. However, conventional re-ID relies heavily on deep learning (DL) computationally demanding models which are not readily applicable for edge computing. In this paper we adapt a recently proposed re-ID method that combines DL human parsing with analytical feature extraction and ranking schemes to be more suitable for edge computing re-ID. First, we compare parsers that use ResNet101, ResNet18, MobileNetV2, and OSNet backbones and show that parsing can be performed using compact backbones with sufficient accuracy. Second, we transfer parsers to tensor processing unit (TPU) of Google Coral Dev Board and show that it can act as a portable edge computing re-ID station. We also implement the analytical part of re-ID method on Coral CPU to ensure that it can perform a complete re-ID cycle. For quantitative analysis we compare inference speed, parsing masks, and re-ID accuracy on GPU and Coral TPU depending on parser backbone. We also discuss possible application scenarios of edge computing in re-ID taking into account known limitations mainly related to memory and storage space of portable devices.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of the Internet of Things(IoT) and pervasive computing applications, it provides a better opportunity to understand the behavior of the aging population. However, in a nursing home scenario, common sensors and techniques used to track an elderly living alone are not suitable. In this paper, we design a location-based tracking system for a four-story nursing home - The Salvation Army, Peacehaven Nursing Home in Singapore. The main challenge here is to identify the group activity among the nursing homeâs residents and to detect if they have any deviated activity behavior. We propose a location-based deviated activity behavior detection system to detect deviated activity behavior by leveraging data fusion technique. In order to compute the features for data fusion, an adaptive method is applied for extracting the group and individual activity time and generate daily hybrid norm for each of the residents. Next, deviated activity behavior detection is executed by considering the difference between daily norm patterns and daily input data for each resident. Lastly, the deviated activity behavior among the residents are classified using a rule-based classification approach. Through the implementation, there are 44.4% of the residents do not have deviated activity behavior, while 37% residents involved in one deviated activity behavior and 18.6% residents have two or more deviated activity behaviors.}

IoE demands security services in terms of data or entity authentication, data confidentiality, data integrity, data or services availability, and non-repudiation. There are multiple security protocols that work with secret keys to provide security services. The key exchange or key distribution between two parties over the insecure network is the main challenge. Researchers introduced several state-of-the-art symmetric or asymmetric key exchange algorithms such as RSA, ECC, DH, ECDH, and Curve25519. Asymmetric algorithms are considered heavyweight in terms of computation and communication costs while symmetric key exchange algorithms are considered lightweight. Symmetric key exchange algorithms do not provide authentication services. As a result, the algorithms are exposed to a man-in-the-middle attack. In this research paper, we propose a lightweight and robust symmetric key exchange algorithm for smart devices which have short computational processing power. Furthermore, we implement our proposed algorithm on the Linux-based Ubuntu virtual operating systems by using system programming in C/C++. In addition, we prove the robustness of our proposed algorithm with the help of informal and formal security analysis through the AVISPA tool. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithm with existing algorithms in terms of computation cost, communication overhead, and security features. The comparison results with existing state-of-the-art key exchange algorithms show that our proposed key exchange algorithm is more suitable for smart devices.}

	abstract = {The emergence of the Internet of Things is expected to produce a huge amount of data streams for sensing the phenomenon from the real world. These data patterns i.e. data distributions keep on evolving and are subject to change based on the changes in the external environment. Valuable and useful information should be extracted from this data stream in real-time- to find out the events of interest. Pattern extraction from stored data and its analytics is convenient, though stream analytics has major challenges associated with it like identifying the event patterns from limited data in the stream, concept drift detection, outlier detection, and handling, limited storage, and processing capacity etc. Traditional methods, in general, work well with historical data yet have limitations while dealing with real-time data streams. Hence, the present work proposes adaptive clustering-based Event Detection Scheme for IoT (AEDS-IoT) stream data, which can infer events of interest from data distribution patterns present in streaming data. Initially, the scheme uses an adaptive window to collect the streaming data and processes it to detect the events. Further, the event patterns are detected by adaptive clustering. After identifying event patterns, the user assigns labels based on spatialâtemporal conditions. The proposed AEDS methodology updates the patterns generated from upcoming stream data received. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared against the state of the scheme using the Arhus dataset. To corroborate the scheme with experimental evidence, the scheme was applied to the data collected from the Ganga river(the life line of North India) using smart water sensors. The performance and efficacy of AEDS-IoT were also tested on these data to detect upcoming event patterns from the data stream.}

	abstract = {Drowsiness is a common problem that many drivers encounter due to long working hours, lack of sleep, and tiredness. Tired drivers are as dangerous as drunk drivers because they have slower reaction times and suffer from reduced attention, awareness, and ability to control their vehicles. Drowsy driving causes many traffic accidents, especially fatal crashes. Therefore, the best way to prevent accidents involving drowsiness is to alert the drivers ahead of time. The accuracy of the drowsiness prediction reduces if the studies only focus on facial landmarks, ignoring other fatigue features such as tilting head, blinking, and yawning. To solve these problems, we propose an approach to detect driver drowsiness efficiently and accurately using IoT and deep neural networks improved from LSTM, VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet. The use of transfer learning technique combined with multiple drowsiness signs is to improve the accuracy of the drowsiness detection in various driving conditions. The time-varying factor is also taken into consideration in the models developed from LSTM and DenseNet. When the driverâs fatigue is detected, the IoT module emits a warning message along with a sound through a Jetson Nano monitoring system. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach using deep neural networks can achieve high accuracy of up to 98%. Notably, this approach has also been verified in cases with/without wearing a mask and glasses. This has a practical meaning in the Covid-19 pandemic situation when everyone needs to comply with the wearing of masks in public places.}

	abstract = {Contemporary Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are hindered by several reliability-related issues, especially, the dynamic behavior of IoT systems caused by limited and often unstable network connectivity. Several intuitive ad-hoc approaches can be employed to test this behavior; however, the effectiveness of these approaches in detecting defects and their overall testing costs remain questionable. Therefore, we present a new specialized path-based technique to test the processes of an IoT system in scenarios wherein parts of these processes are influenced by limited or disrupted network connectivity. The proposed technique can be scaled using two levels of test coverage criteria to determine the strengths of the test cases. For this purpose, we propose two algorithms for generating test cases to implement the technique: an ant colony optimization-based search and a graph-traversal-based test case composition. We compared the efficiency of the proposed approach with possible solutions obtained using a standard path-based testing approach based on prime paths computed by a set-covering algorithm. We consider the total number of test case steps as the main proxy for test effort in experiments employing 150 problem models. For the less intensive of the two used test-coverage criteria, EachBorderOnce, an ant colony optimization-based algorithm, produced test sets with the same averaged number of steps as the graph traversal-based test-case composition; however, this algorithm performed with averaged number of steps 10% lower than a prime paths-based algorithm. For the more intensive test coverage criterion, AllBorderCombinations, these differences favoring the ant colony optimization-based algorithm were 18% and 25%, respectively. For these two types of defined test coverage criteria, the ant colony optimization-based search, graph-traversal-based algorithm, and standard path-based testing approach based on prime paths achieved the best results for 93 and 78, 14 and 24, and 13 and 17 models for AllBorderCombinations and EachBorderOnce criterion, respectively. Therefore, to guarantee the best test set, all compared algorithms are combined in a portfolio strategy that yields the best results based on the potential of the produced test sets to detect simulated defects caused by limited network connectivity. Additionally, this portfolio strategy also yields test sets, implying the lowest test effort for experimental problem instances.}

	abstract = {Attackers may attempt exploiting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to operate them unduly as well as to gather personal data of the legitimate device ownersâ. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) sessions help to verify the effectiveness of the adopted security measures. However, VAPT over IoT devices, namely VAPT targeted at IoT devices, is an open research challenge due to the variety of target technologies and to the creativity it may require. Therefore, this article aims at guiding penetration testers to conduct VAPT sessions over IoT devices by means of a new cyber Kill Chain (KC) termed PETIoT. Several practical applications of PETIoT confirm that it is general, while its main novelty lies in the combination of attack and defence steps. PETIoT is demonstrated on a relevant example, the best-selling IP camera on Amazon Italy, the TAPO C200 by TP-Link, assuming an attacker who sits on the same network as the deviceâs in order to assess all the network interfaces of the device. Additional knowledge is generated in terms of three zero-day vulnerabilities found and practically exploited on the camera, one of these with High severity and the other two with Medium severity by the CVSS standard. These are camera Denial of Service (DoS), motion detection breach and video stream breach. The application of PETIoT culminates with the proof-of-concept of a home-made fix, based on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi 4 Model B device, for the last vulnerability. Ultimately, our responsible disclosure with the camera vendor led to the release of a firmware update that fixes all found vulnerabilities, confirming that PetIoT has valid impact in real-world scenarios.}

However, the underlying open communication network and resource-constrained capabilities of devices invite manifold challenges and threats in terms of security and privacy. To alleviate such issues, we designed a private blockchain-based access control protocol for IoT-SG using Physically Unclonable Function (PUF). Our protocol allows the Service Provider (SP) and smart meters to transfer the data in an efficient and secure manner. The participating SPs form the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, and each peer node is responsible for securely creating the blocks from the gathered data. Thereafter, all the peer nodes employ a voting-based consensus mechanism to verify and add the recently created block into the blockchain network. We have rigorously validated the security of our protocol under the Random or Real (RoR) model. The testbed results and security feature analysis show that our protocol is more efficient than competing ones while it also provides significant security properties.}

	abstract = {Smart farming is a well-known and superior method of managing a farm, becoming more prevalent in today's contemporary agricultural practices. Crops are monitored for their overall health and productivity using various information and agricultural technology. This involves monitoring the state of the field crops and looking at various other indicators. The ultimate objective of smart farming is to decrease the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while maintaining the same level of quality in the final result. The Internet of Things has enabled smart farming via different data collecting and storage methods. For example, intelligent sensor networks gather field data for optimum plant irrigation in contemporary irrigation systems. As the dependency of smart farming on the IoT environment increases, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The reason is that IoT networks include so many nodes with few resources available, making securing them a challenging problem. Therefore, the need for an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can adapt to such difficulties is of the utmost importance. This paper proposes a new system that detects intrusions in IoT networks used in agriculture. The NSL KDD data set is used to evaluate the proposed method, which starts by performing several pre-processing steps on the original feature set. Important features are selected using recursive feature elimination, then converted into square color images. Now input images are suitable to be learned by different CNN architectures such as VGG16, Inception, and Xception models. Performance comparisons of CNN models with classical machine learning algorithms are evaluated using accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, and precision metrics.}

	abstract = {Fog computing allows the implementation of information processes on the native net, mainly because of its ability to process in real-time. On the other hand, the principles of Mist Computing have not been matured yet to be successfully adopted for daily use by communities. Research shows that it is possible to classify computational resources from computational paradigms, especially using multiple edge devices, so that they can perform cost-effective tasks using clustering software. However, the application of these solutions still faces several limitations in the resources that exist in the devices, including the diversity of the device and the mobility of IoT environments. Providing clustering methods for fog nodes can help address these issues. But, cooperation among things on the Internet of things faces many challenges in developing real-time applications. Mist computing infrastructure, located between the fog and the end nodes at the edge, In addition to intelligent offloading, can enable local decision-making with the help of sensors and actuators. It adopts appropriate layer-specific data transmission policies to ensure delay-tolerant data transmission of real-time information as well as big data. It can also help conserve bandwidth and battery power while single urgent information is transferred toward a server or router. Thus, collaborative clustering techniques can presumably be applied for IoT-mist. This requires a comprehensive study of clustering techniques and their applications in IoT-mist networks. In this paper, Our goal of this survey is, how collaborative clustering techniques in IoT-mist can improve network lifespan, optimize energy, and reduce delay in the network. We then review fog node clustering and how it allows more demanding applications to be processed in the mist layer, which in turn facilitates the fog of some tasks. Next, we discuss the challenges of applying clustering techniques on the IoT-mist network, and finally, we provide a conclusion and future works for this research.}

	abstract = {In smart cities, public lighting installations have a significant consumption of electrical energy. In order to measure this consumption, it is necessary to install sensors capable of obtaining electrical parameters in real time. In this way, the installations are monitored and energy saving and efficiency measures can be implemented. In this sense, this research has developed a PQ analyser meter with Long Range wireless communications technology (LoRa). This technology allows coverage of up to 5 km, which makes it ideal for public lighting applications. PQ Analyser with LoRa (PQAL) has been developed to achieve a fully functional prototype. PQAL comes in two versions for single-phase and three-phase street lighting lines, so that it adapts to any type of installation. PQAL uses the open-source Arduino platform which allows it to adapt to the monitoring needs of every installation. PQAL can monitor installations up to 100 A and 23 kW per phase. The use of non-invasive current sensors allows this device to be installed without modifying the installation to be monitored. Due to the long range of the LoRa network, it can be installed in locations far from the gateway without the need for additional cabling or Internet connection.}

While some major obstacles faced by smart-home IoT network are heterogeneity and disparate IP frameworks resulting in a connectivity and interoperability issues. In this paper we developed a new Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) based prediction assisted optimal control framework for optimizing energy consumption and maximizing occupant comfort in smart-home. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a scalable, secure, and inter-operable optimal control solution for smart-home IoT networks. The developed framework offloads machine learning models on IoT device for accurate energy and thermal comfort modeling to enable prediction assisted optimization. The system enables edge analytics using deep learning based inference models for proactive response. For optimization standard Firefly algorithm is modified based on inertia weight approach to achieve improved performance. OCF based optimal actuator control test-bed deployment and real-time experimentation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the system.

	abstract = {The use of Internet of Things (IoT) in environment monitoring has led to the development of Smart Environmental Monitoring (SEM) paradigm. Target or source localization, that determines the underlying cause of environmental occurrences, is an important aspect of SEM. To prevent an environmental event in becoming a potential disaster, swift and early localization of its source is crucial. Target localization is performed with the help of IoT sensors, which are typically deployed in hazardous environments and are not easily serviceable, making energy efficiency a requirement for SEM systems. Furthermore, IoT sensors may provide anomalous readings due to low battery, low sensor sensitivity, faults, or malicious attacks. This alters the decision-making process and leads to inaccurate localization of the source. Hence, detecting and dealing with anomalies, while utilizing a limited number of sensor nodes, are key factors in addressing reliability and energy efficiency issues. The current works are iterative in nature, employs redundant nodes, do not efficiently address anomalous readings, which leads to slow and imprecise localization, while increasing energy consumption. Moreover, they are application specific, making them less adaptable to other sensing tasks. Therefore, this work proposes a comprehensive and novel deep learning-based system that â (a) repopulates missing data from inactive sensors, (b) detects and rectifies anomalous data, and (c) instantly localizes a target. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated in a radioactive environment and compared to existing benchmark. The results show that the proposed approach achieves precise, rapid, and efficient localization by achieving 5 times better accuracy, 50 times faster speeds, and 3 times lesser energy consumption.}

However, due to a larger integration gap between HRM and SCM and fuzzy, integration of these two contemporary issues has been severely delayed even if academics in each field continue to progress SCM and HRM contribution to creating greater sustainable firms. The findings of the study show that the fuzzy based HRM-SCM strategy is workable and points to the educational requirement as the HRM element with the most positive influence. Designing and assessing the network of a supply chain is a crucial and challenging decision. In order to establish a comprehensive and synergistic foundation for the HRM-SCM relationship, this paper proposes a research program for this integration. The IoT is used in this study to maintain the supply-chain analytics for HRM. Additionally, the Butter Ant Optimization (BAO) is suggested to improve SCM performance. The IoT+FL+BAO approach is the one that this study suggests using. In comparison to other previous approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed IoT+FL+BAO approach improves the supply-chain performance proportion by 97.9%, the efficiency proportion by 98.2%, employee satisfaction by 97.03%, decision-making scale by 97.2%, prediction rate by 96.5%, and F1-score by 98.4%.}

Such plethora of IoT devices is expected to be impact sixth-generation (6G) networks. Securing 6G/massive IoT networks against threats, especially novel attacks, is a major challenge for 6G infrastructure to accommodate. Thus, new innovative architectures and paradigms empowered by intelligence, softwarization, and infrastructure virtualization are urgently needed. This manifestation depends upon the power of artificial intelligence integrated with key networking enablers such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) etc. to provide components of promising solutions and innovative approaches for securing the IoT. Researchers across the spectrum in computer science and engineering are striving to employ machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve the detection of cyber threats so that they can classify, predict, and mitigate anomalies and abnormal traffic behaviors. The challenge to design an intrusion detection system (IDS) is how to come up with a scalable solution within a realistic infrastructure architecture aimed at dealing with massive IoT applications. There is a multiplicity of factors to consider toward an optimal intelligent solution, however, we can perceive that future solutions should be tailored on native virtualized infrastructure. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study on massive IoT security aspects toward 6G networks, especially IDS systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that combines the integration of ML/DL and key networking technology enablers that support future 6G infrastructure for massive IoT security, with the aim to outline research challenges, relevant issues, and future directions.}

	abstract = {Influenced by the improvement of people's living standards, the structure of buildings is also more and more complex. The indoor population density is on the rise so that the frequency of fire gradually increases. In this paper, based on the navigation grid corner point algorithm, the evacuation of indoor fire crowd is simulated in reality. Firstly, according to the actual situation of the building with multiple exits, the dynamic planning of the evacuation path of indoor fire personnel is designed. Then, the weight determination method is given by analyzing the dynamic changing environmental factors to realize the virtual reality simulation of the evacuation of indoor fire crowd. The experimental results show that the time required for single-exit evacuation is nearly 1 min, while the time for multi-exit evacuation is less than 30 s. The design of three exits can dynamically allocate the crowd and effectively divert the evacuation crowd. The crowd evacuation simulation can generate the evacuation path in fire, which takes 706.6188 milliseconds. In the whole evacuation process, the path is dynamically updated more than 400 times, and the average update time is about 17 milliseconds each time. The virtual reality simulation of crowd evacuation in indoor fire based on the navigation grid corner point algorithm proposed in this study can solve the situation of multiple indoor exits and dynamic environmental factors, which has certain reference significance for the research and application of related problems.}

	abstract = {In the era of communicational technologies, body area networks (BAN) provide useful and applicable devices for monitoring soldiers' health, of paramount importance for the governments and countries' security. However, BANs face two main challenges of security and energy, due to limitations in energy, memory, and process of the utilized sensors. Despite the developments of many solutions to tackle the stated challenges, the simultaneous consideration of energy and security has been overlooked in the majority of them. Besides, in some of the recommended solutions, the energy consumption is not optimum, resulting from discarding information content in data sampling. In addition, another group of the current methods is not practical, not guaranteeing security, given the high computational costs and the entropic inefficiency of encryption keys. Therefore, in the present study, a lightweight and secure sensing model is recommended for BANs, applicable in biological warfare. In the proposed model, the data are sampled according to their entropies, then compressed and encrypted simultaneously considering their sparsity levels, aiming at reducing energy consumption and boosting security. To synchronize two functions of compression and encryption, a measurement matrix, a type of sub-Gaussian matrix, is used. Furthermore, the biological data associated with the under-care soldier is encrypted using a key, guaranteeing the secure transfer of data to the smart healthcare center. In this process, the key is generated from the time interval calculated from the heart rate of the under-care soldier. The simulation data reveal that the proposed sensing model causes a reduction in energy consumption while providing security, compared to the previous methods.}

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) sensing layer, targets in the monitoring area are covered by sensor nodes. So the coverage problem is a key issue of IoT application. Self-protection is an effective way to resist external attacks, which can cover the remaining nodes with a set of nodes. This paper considers the coverage problem combined with node self-protection and proposes a cellular learning automata-based method. In this method, nodes are mapped to the cellular structure, and each cell is equipped with learning automata. At the initialization stage, the activation probability is assigned to each node by the residual energy, and updated according to the reward or penalty feedback from neighbors and the random environment. At the adjustment stage, partial self-protection is applied to reduce the number of activated nodes. Consequently critical nodes could acquire protection with high priority than other normal nodes. When the desired coverage is not met, sleeping nodes will be activated according to the coverage increment value. Meanwhile, a local strategy based on the cellular structure is designed to heal the coverage hole caused by failed nodes. In accordance to this strategy, sleeping nodes around the failed nodes could be quickly activated. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing methods with respect to the number of active nodes, energy efficiency, and coverage reliability.}

In the same way, The IoT is an emerging technology designed to control challenges of the concept of circular economy. This article aims to identify and rank barriers to IoT-enabled CE in the concept of Industry 4.0. In this research, new integrated approach based on Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of the Ratio Analysis (MOORA) in the field of Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS) has been produced to cover some disadvantages of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method include lack of complete prioritization and inability to decide the different significance of risk factors in an uncertain environment. In the proposed method, the first Risk Priority Number (RPN) is ascertained by the FMEA team. Then risk factors are weighed using the SWARA method and barriers are prioritized using the MOORA method in PFS. The computational approach of the suggested method is also implemented through a case study of the problem of ranking barriers to IoT-enabled CE, which certifies the efficiency and validity of the presented method. In addition, this sensitivity analysis study was carried out to exhibit permanence of the proposed method and to make a comparison for the efficacy analysis of achieved results and the results show that produced method is compared with other developed methods, it is more efficient and usable in the field of PFS.}

	abstract = {Over the period, two significant advancements i.e. shrinking of the sensor size and improved communication capability, lead the sensor-based internet-of-things (SBIoT) to mature rapidly. SBIoT has various applications to make human life smarter such as health care IoT, smart cities, agriculture, automated industries, security etc. The sensor collects data by monitoring a natural phenomenon from the environment and the internet is used to communicate that to the end-user. Much research has been done to detect events in such environments. The present work surveys diverse methodologies designed to capture the events of interest from collected data in different application domains of SBIoT. This paper revisits the understanding of detecting events of interest using SBIoT framework and discusses the detailed requirements for event detection. Further, different types of events have been identified, discussed and categorization is made. The authors observed the need to put the different categories of event detection in one paper so that researchers can get idea about state of art of the domain. Previously published surveys focused on a specific domain of event detection such as Health IoT, security in SBIoT, agriculture IoT etc. Further such works defined the occurrences in the deployed field as events of interest in very narrow terms. Thus in most of the existing surveys, the event definition is mostly domain-specific and the focus is on the application area rather than techniques of event detection. Thus, there existed a gap for a holistic survey that conceptualizes different application domains into atomic categories and integrates different techniques available for SBIoT using a common thread of event detection. Hence, the event-based monitoring frameworks in SBIoT are segregated and diversified Event detection models are discussed based on the application domains. The paper describes event detection challenges and methodologies in different domains i.e rule-based, probability and statistics based, multimedia-based, intelligent system based and signal processing based methodologies. Further, the comparative analysis of various recently proposed methods has been carried out in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The present work also discusses the existing research gaps in the domain of event detection and the authors believe that it will be helpful for researchers in academia and industry to develop new methodologies.}

Among the plethora of data sources that exist nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is recognised as a game-changer technology that expands its applicability to a huge variety of domains. Its main asset is, precisely, the data that the myriad of sensors embedded in the environment are constantly generating. The diffusion of platforms for IoT data sharing and monetisation is one of the key success factors which may help to drive the data economy and industrial transformation. In this paper, we are presenting a data sharing platform based on Blockchain, so-called Blockchain-based IoT Data Marketplace (BIDM) over which data producers and data consumers are able to share data in a decentralised and trustworthy manner. The BIDM enables a data marketplace where owners of IoT infrastructures can expose the observations that their devices generate while retaining control over who accesses each observation and directly getting revenues according to the price they have set. The evaluation that we have carried out of the BIDMâs behaviour and performance in terms of operational execution times and scalability has been the basis for the discussion that we are presenting on the shortcomings that are typically associated with the use of Blockchain technologies as enablers for data marketplaces. This discussion also includes the evaluation of the challenges that must be considered for the creation of secure and interoperable Data Spaces based on Blockchain.}

The Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) help to prevent security risks by discovering irregular network behaviours under local sub-networks inspite of complete VANET. An optimization-driven model is devised for detecting intrusion in SDN-VANET. The network comprises several entities, like the On-Board Unit (OBU), SDN, Road-Side Unit (RSU), and Authentication Server. The proposed approach involves five phases, namely registration, key generation, data encoding, authentication, and decoding. The authentication of OBU is done with the data packets. The detection of intrusion is performed using the optimized model. The selection of features is done from log files considering the Renyi entropy. The detection of intrusion is done using the Rider-based neural network (RideNN), trained with designed Rider-based Sea Lion Optimization (RBSLO), and is produced by blending the Rider optimization algorithm (ROA) and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). The proposed RBSLO-based RideNN offered to improve the achievement with the elevated precision of 92.5%, the recall of 95.4%, the F-measures of 94%, and the smallest computation time of 135.654 s.}

Digital twin technology is a particularly promising field that builds on AI and is already being utilized to increase efficiency and decrease costs in cattle livestock agriculture. A Digital Twin (DT) is a constant-update numerical copy of smart livestock environments. The proposed research is IoT, and Digital Twins in Livestock Farming (DTLF) might expand extensive Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), technology and tools use, and farm animal health and well-being. Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), AI, and even ML are only some current technologies that may be used for automated tracking of individual animal whereabouts. There is promise in using these methods and innovations to monitor and evaluate animal welfare, but these techniques are difficult. Just like other revolutionary innovations, the utilization of the DT mechanism will improve disease analysis prediction for individual farms by a factor of 92%. The responsiveness of DTLF will be a 92% response rate in analyzing the Heartbeat, a 94% effectiveness rate in analyzing the Temperature Range, and a 94% overall effectiveness in evaluating the Humidity Range.}

Such risks stem from the lack of privacy integration into the system development process. No formalized SSIoT data flow model currently integrates privacy elements for evaluation during the system development lifecycle (SDLC). This work aims to review current data flow modeling techniques, used in most SSIoT System Development Lifecycle (SDLC), to identify privacy gaps and assess requisite privacy controls necessary to improve user privacy. To verify this, we designed a simulation experiment using Petri net to evaluate the current privacy controls and hotspots during SSIoT data transitions. We assess our Petri net model using a Barbie Smart connected toy user interaction. The results show that Petri net has unique privacy elements and verification schemes over all other data flow modeling techniques. Further, it provides privacy assurance, evaluates privacy by identifying privacy hotspots needing controls, and minimizes privacy-related risks such as breach of personally identifiable information and interaction data during SSIoT device use.}

	abstract = {Using Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as base stations for providing communication services to urban residents has emerged as a novel trend in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, UAV base stations (UAV-BSs) applications have faced some challenges, such as the finite energy capacity, the limited coverage range, and the complex flying environment. Consequently, addressing these challenges and maximizing communication service quality remains a significant problem. In order to achieve higher service quality, it is necessary for UAV-BSs to collaborate with each other, optimize their serving positions, and conserve energy. Although existing works have investigated some of these challenges, there has been a lack of work that considered all of them jointly. In this work, we propose a Local-based scheduling algorithm which aims to maximize the service quality by achieving a good balance between flying status and serving status of UAV-BSs. The proposed method has been evaluated by theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in significantly improving the communication service quality.}

	abstract = {A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a network of wireless devices that are used to monitor the health of individuals or provide them with information pertinent to their personal health. A WBAN typically consists of multiple sensors and a central sink and it enables the tracking of multiple body signals without the need for cables or other wired connections, allowing for a more comfortable user experience. The used sensors are extremely small and lightweight, making them well-suited for long-term medical monitoring. In this paper, we consider the joint problem of device positioning and data routing in WBANs leveraging relay-based multi-hop communication to address network energy consumption and reliable data transmission, which are two fundamental challenges in the WBAN design. The deployment of a WBAN is the most important factor that impacts both the network lifetime and reliability. On the other side, routing in multi-hop WBANs is of paramount importance for efficient communications between sensors and the centralized hub. For this reason, we define and assign to each relay a concave and non-increasing function (called reliability function) which permits to decrease consistently congestion occurrence in the network by balancing relays loads. In this work, we consider the problem of designing an energy-aware routing on WBANs while ensuring that all data are delivered to the sink with a sufficiently large probability. This problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming problem and proven to be NP-hard. We first present an efficient linearization technique for the problem and then propose lower- and upper-bounding schemes for the problem, which can be applied within a cutting plane algorithm-based heuristic to solve the problem. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model with a real topology scenario and compare its performance with the most notable methods presented in the literature. Numerical results show that our model, independently of patient body movement, can transfer data through reliable paths from biosensors to the sink while further offering these options: (1) the probability that each biosensor successfully transfers its data to the sink is adjustable according to the desired application; (2) congestion is limited through a careful balancing of incoming traffic to relays, and (3) a small number of relays is installed, while ensuring an energy-efficient routing of data.}

Hence, we propose an identity authentication and privacy preservation scheme based on both blockchain and ring signature. Specifically, in our approach, blockchain is leveraged to maintain anonymity yet guaranteeing traceability. We also design a new ring signature scheme based on the SM2 algorithm and analyze its security. To demonstrate utility, we evaluate our proposed approach using Ethereum smart contracts, and the findings demonstrate that our approach is efficient, supports privacy preservation, and is resilient to a range of common attacks.}

This study constructed a model to estimate mental states from multidimensional time-series indoor environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and illumination. The experiment results show that the proposed system shows higher estimation accuracy. In particular, the CNN-LSTM model with multidimensional time-series indoor environmental data shows about 90% estimation accuracy.

	abstract = {Applications and infrastructures designed to support Fog Computing in IoT (Internet of Things) environments generate large volumes of data, usually characterized as open-ended streams, thus making unfeasible the adoption of traditional modeling approaches. Namely, the main limitations with such approaches are: (i) the adoption of offline models might be out of date when new data are available; (ii) the need for high computational power to store and process all data from IoT devices; and (iii) the transmission of all monitored data might overload the network connections from devices to servers. Such limitations are accentuated in complex IoT environments that combine different devices and servers configured in Fog and Cloud Computing. Aiming at dealing with such limitations, we propose a challenging approach, referred to as Fog-DeepStream, which combines three important research areas: Signal Processing, Concept Drift, and Deep Neural Networks. Initially, our approach uses Wavelet Transform to undersample data streams without losing details about their main behavior. Next, we use Concept Drift algorithms to only transmit the data in the environment when a new behavior is detected. These two steps reduce the amount of processed and exchanged data that Deep Neural Networks will later model. Our results emphasize that the contributions of Fog-DeepStream are twofold: we provide an incremental approach to efficiently model data streams in Fog Computing and reduce data transmission between computational resources, thus making it possible to save energy in IoT scenarios.}

This is especially critical for systems that deal with precious human lives. Although these safety-critical systems can be investigated using both experimental testing and model-based verification, accurate models have the potential to permit risk-free mimicking of the system behavior even in the most extreme scenarios. To overcome the CPS modeling and design challenges, the INCOSE/OMG standard System Modeling Language (SysML) is utilized in this work to accurately specify cyberâphysical systems. For that, a bounded set of SysML constructs are defined to precisely capture the semantics of continuous-time and discrete-time system behaviors. Then, the SysML constructs are substituted by developing a new algebra, called Enhanced Activity Calculus (EAC). So, EAC helps construct equivalent priced timed automata models by developing a new systematic procedure to correctly translate the SysML models into the statistical model checking tool UPPAAL-SMC inputs. The latter checks whether the system is correct and safe or not. Moreover, the soundness of the developed translation mechanism has been proved and its effectiveness has been shown on a real use case, namely the artificial pancreas.}

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology can provide these services in MEC by turning hardware middleboxes to Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) for mobile users. Network services are chained as an ordered sequence of VNFs named Service Function Chains (SFCs), which are provided by directing traffic to the required VNFs. Meanwhile, the SFC placement problem is challenging for provisioning online service requests under limited resource availability and improving quality of service. We propose DRL-based Dynamic SFC Placement method with Parallelized VNFs (DSPPV) to solve this problem that seeks to maximize long-term expected cumulative reward. By sharing VNFs in parallel, DSPPV can achieve computational acceleration in providing online services. Any pair of VNFs that do not conflict on traffic can process the packet simultaneously, so configuring SFC with parallelized VNFs will reduce the SFC length and thus reduce the latency. In addition, DSPPV increases the ability to process future requests by extracting the distribution of initialized VNFs. The performed simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Specifically, the obtained numerical results show that the average number of accepted requests has improved between 4% and 15%.}

	abstract = {Precision agriculture generates large datasets from IoT infrastructures deployed for continuous crop monitoring. This data requires analysis to usefully transform this data deluge into insights that can deliver value-generating services to farmers in a timely manner. This paper introduces SEPARATE; a dynamic interoperable and decentralized infrastructure for executing both, training and inference stages of deep learning (DL) algorithms in smart agriculture scenarios. The presented infrastructure allows the execution of the inference stage at the edge, achieving a highly efficient and responsive local temperature prediction service to take actions based on the predictions generated. Moreover, the training stage is offloaded to the cloud along with the generated historical data, allowing the trained model to be periodically updated at the edge. On the one hand, our results show that the Convolutional Neural Network model together with the Long Short-Term Memory technique (CNNLSTM) obtains the best results in both prediction accuracy and computational time. On the other hand, an analysis has been carried out to determine how often the model must be retrained, obtaining results that indicate that from day 9â10, it would be necessary to retrain the model, although, until day 20, the precision is not greatly reduced. Moreover, the SEPARATE infrastructure enables the execution of real-time inference from sensor-generated data and seamless model retraining in an operational greenhouse for temperature forecast with satisfactory performance.}

Research suggests that certain characteristics of data sources (e.g. battery-powered power supply and wireless communication) contribute to this poor data quality. Nonetheless, to date, much of the research on data trustworthiness has only focused on data values to determine trustworthiness. Consequently, we propose to pay more attention to the characteristics of data sources in the context of data trustworthiness. Thus, this article presents an approach for assessing Industrial Internet of Things data sources to determine their data trustworthiness. The approach is based on a meta-model decomposing data sources into data stores (e.g. databases) and providers (e.g. sensors). Furthermore, the approach provides a quality model comprising quality-related characteristics of data stores to determine their data trustworthiness. Moreover, a catalogue containing properties of data providers is presented to infer the trustworthiness of their provided data. An industrial case study revealed a moderate correlation between the data source assessments of the proposed approach and experts.}

	abstract = {With the advent of Tiny Machine Learning (tinyML), it is increasingly feasible to deploy optimized ML models on constrained battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices with minimal energy availability. Due to the unpredictable and dynamic harvesting environment, successfully running tinyML on battery-less devices is still challenging. In this paper, we present the energy-aware deployment and management of tinyML algorithms and application tasks on battery-less IoT devices. We study the trade-offs between different inference strategies, analyzing under which circumstances it is better to make the decision locally or send the data to the Cloud where the heavy-weight ML model is deployed, respecting energy, accuracy, and time constraints. To decide which of these two options is more optimal and can satisfy all constraints, we define an energy-aware tinyML optimization algorithm. Our approach is evaluated based on real experiments with a prototype for battery-less person detection, which considers two different environments: (i) a controllable setup with artificial light, and (ii) a dynamic harvesting environment based on natural light. Our results show that the local inference strategy performs best in terms of execution speed when a controllable harvesting environment is considered. It can execute 3 times as frequently as remote inference at a harvesting current of 2 mA and using a capacitor of 1.5 F. In a realistic harvesting scenario with natural light and making use of the energy-aware optimization algorithm, the device will favor remote inference under high light conditions due to the better accuracy of the Cloud-based model. Otherwise, it switches to local inference.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, many Cloud companies adopt serverless computation based on the Function as a Service (FaaS) paradigm. Such an approach, built on the dynamic provisioning of serverless functions, has significantly altered the design of Cloud applications. Indeed, complex systems may now be viewed as a graph of serverless functions (i.e., workflow) distributed over the Cloud and Edge layers. However, building applications in such a complicated context and introducing security by design is still a non-trivial problem. Meanwhile, Osmotic Computing has advanced as a novel computational paradigm in recent years. This may serve as a suitable foundation for strengthening security in serverless applications throughout the CloudâEdge Continuum. In this work, we rely on Osmotic Computing principles for modifying the architecture of OpenWolf, a novel serverless engine, and improving the execution time of ciphertext data by about 65%.}

Firstly, the move to digital with IoT facilitating the use of sensor networks to support precise decision making. Secondly, the move to âecological intensificationâ; working with natural processes to lower the carbon footprint of agricultural processes and increase the biodiversity of agricultural units without sacrificing yield. Clearly data mining and machine learning have an important role to play in supporting this transformation. However, given the range of biotic, abiotic and social contexts that need to inform the development of models for decision support in agriculture, we need data mining techniques that support the use of qualitative and unstructured data as well as hard numerical data. In this tutorial we show how Bayesian Networks can be built from a wide range of sources of expert knowledge and data. Whist we use digital agriculture as a key beneficiary of these techniques, this tutorial will also be of interest to all those with an interest in building IoT systems that require combinations of social, technical and environmental understanding.}

	abstract = {Smart Livestock Farming (SLF) is an approach that utilizes technological advances to improve economic viability, operational efficacy, and ecological sustainability in the cattle industry. Among the most promising areas of smart livestock farming is extensive livestock farming, in which individual animals are monitored and studied. By keeping an eye on harvests, planning out the property, and providing them with data to establish rational methods and techniques, the IoT helps farmers save time and resources. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to transform livestock management by linking distant farmers with the biological data of their animals and environmental data collected by embedded technology. Limiting livestock's greenhouse gas emission impact is one obstacle, as is the inherent complexity, context, and repetition of day-to-day livestock management tasks. To improve customer and product identification, especially in farming supply chain operations, BlockChain (BC) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology. In this study, the paper addresses how blockchain technology may be used for livestock-based goods after analyzing the research on its uses in the food market and the farming supply chain. The framework incorporates Internet of Things technology and utilizes BlockChain technology to create a Smart Livestock Farming system (IoT-BC-SLF), allowing for a transparent and safe exchange between farmers. Finally, the study reveals that the primary concerns of blockchain implementation in this field are safeguarding the records of agricultural output, tracking the processes involved in the production, and keeping tabs on the finished goods. The sensing system that utilizes Blockchain technology helps to trace the transmission of agricultural and related goods via farmers to ultimate consumers, to track and regulate the value chain of dairy, fruits, vegetables, meat, etc., and to avoid financial losses. Real livestock farming with IoT-BC-SLF technology and management will benefit several facets of agriculture, including human resources, product costs (both agricultural and livestock), animal protection, and environmental sustainability. The farmers' exact livestock management on numerous farms is implemented after careful consideration of information security, protection, and compatibility. Based on analysis of Response time, internal temperature measurement, 92% of Livestock tracking probability, and 91% of Livestock behavioral activity with better improvement, it is clear that the proposed IoT-BC-SLF system is superior to existing approaches.}

	abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are a promising communication technology that supports various types of medical and non-medical applications with heterogeneous requirements. Generally, IEEE 802.15.6-based WBAN use one-hop star topology to establish direct communication between the hub and body sensors. The standard also supports two-hop star topology to establish communication where direct transmission between the hub and sensor nodes is not possible due to poor link quality caused by body shadowing. Data transmission reliability and network lifetime are key factors in WBANs. Therefore, we propose an optimal relaying nodes selection mechanism as an alternative to the two-hop star topology extension of IEEE 802.15.6 to enhance the packet delivery ratio, network lifetime, and throughput. In this work, while choosing a relaying node for a disconnected node, we consider the fitness value of all the relaying capable nodes and select the fittest node as relaying node. We calculate the fitness value of all the relaying capable nodes based on their link quality, residual energy, and current traffic load using the multi-criteria decision making method âTechnique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)â, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981. We use the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) to calculate the link quality index of relaying capable nodes based on various link quality parameters such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Packet Error Rate (PER). Moreover, we also designed a schedule slot allocation mechanism for all the sensor nodes based on their packet generation rate (PGR). The proposed scheme significantly improved packet delivery ratio, throughput, and network lifetime compared to the IEEE 802.15.6 standardâs two-hop extension of star topology and other relay selection mechanisms. The simulation result of the proposed mechanism shows that the packet delivery ratio and network lifetime increase by (5â30)% and 50% respectively, compared to the IEEE 802.15.6 two-hop star topology.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most rapidly evolving networking concepts, offering various applications for human benefit. Advances in embedded system architecture and compressed IPv6 have enabled IP stack functionality in resource-constrained heterogeneous smart devices. The IETF Routing Over Low power and Lossy network (ROLL) Working Group (WG) devised IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) to enable the communication between network nodes in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN). The limited resources and heterogeneity of 6LoWPAN nodes make it challenging to design a security solution for Low Power and Lossy Networks, making them vulnerable to various security threats and attacks. Numerous security mechanisms based on trust, threshold, secure routing, authentication, and encryption have shown promising results in detecting anomalous activities in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. As a result, this study systematically examines and critically analyses the existing research domain on RPL security mechanisms. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of demographic characteristics, existing and new attacks, simulation programmes, network configuration, and evaluation measures in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. In addition, it proposes a thorough discussion of current issues, research challenges, and suggestions for future research avenues. This study reveals that most of the studies are published in IEEE XploreÂ® database and mainly comprises journal articles. Furthermore, the trust-based mechanism is the most used security mechanism for securing RPL-based 6LoWPAN. Finally, the Version Number, BlackHole, and Sybil attacks are the most discussed attacks in the selected studies.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning is a much-needed technology in this golden era of big data and Artificial Intelligence, due to its vital role in preserving data privacy, and eliminating the need to transfer and process huge amounts of data, while maintaining the numerous benefits of Machine Learning. As opposed to the typical central training process, Federated Learning involves the collaborative training of statistical models by exchanging learned parameter updates. However, wide adoption of the technology is hindered by the communication and computation overhead forming due to the demanding computational cost of training, and the large-sized parameter updates exchanged. In popular applications such as those involving Internet of Things, the effects of the overhead are exacerbated due to the low computational prowess of edge and fog devices, limited bandwidth, and data capacity of internet connections. Over the years, many research activities that target this particular issue were conducted but a comprehensive review of the fragmented literature is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by providing a systematic review of recent work conducted to improve the communication and/or computation efficiency in Federated Learning. We begin by introducing the essentials of Federated Learning and its variations, followed by the literature review placed according to an encompassing, easy-to-follow taxonomy. Lastly, the work sheds light on the current challenges faced by the technology and possible directions for future work.}

The importance of maintaining privacy in data exchange has been considered by these manufacturers have added dedicated cryptographic modules that are compatible with the main cryptographic algorithms. The most significant problem with these modules is that albeit the use of cryptographic algorithms, there are information security weaknesses in hardware implementations to be considered. The purpose of this survey is to theoretically compare the characteristics of the development boards currently used for cryptographic applications in IoT systems.

IoT networks have proved their usefulness in environmental monitoring applications, including target tracking, thanks to their ease of deployment, scalability, and ability to provide real-time monitoring. Nevertheless, IoT-based target tracking approaches usually sacrifice either the accuracy of the approach or the energy efficiency. In this work, we present a predictive target tracking approach, capable of tracking a mobile target with high accuracy and low overall energy cost. A convolutional long short-term memory (CNNâLSTM) model that can extract both spatial and temporal patterns is proposed to predict the mobility of a source using time-delayed data readings obtained from the IoT sensors. The predicted location is used to dynamically select a set of sensors that can carry out continuous tracking. Moreover, a mechanism to detect possible target loss and its subsequent recovery is also proposed. A use-case of tracking a radioactive source carried by a walking person, in varying settings and for different benchmarks, is used to validate the proposed approach performance. The results demonstrate accurate prediction of the targetâs location, and efficient tracking which saves up to 90% of the networkâs energy.}

	abstract = {With the widespread application of IoT devices, some new scenarios with insufficient coverage of communication infrastructure have arisen, such as wildlife habit monitoring. For these IoT applications, how to efficiently backhaul data collected by IoT devices has become a key technology. As a new data collecting mode for environments lacking communication infrastructure, UAV-enabled data offloading has attracted increasing research interest. Nevertheless, the fairness of data offloading is rarely studied, which directly influences the quality of service. Therefore, we investigate the fairness-aware task scheduling for data offloading enabled by heterogeneous UAVs. To reduce the uncertainty of user status information caused by poor communication, a service time related data arrival rate estimation model is proposed. The fairness-aware heterogeneous UAV-enabled data offloading model is proposed to ensure that all users share system resources fairly. Then, we creatively propose a dynamic incentive-based coordinate descent optimization framework-DISCO, which can progressively improve resource utilization while maximizing service fairness. Besides, we theoretically analyze and experimentally demonstrate its convergence and low time complexity. The performance of DISCO is verified by a series of simulation experiments. Compared with four baseline algorithms, DISCO shows distinct advantages in terms of service fairness, energy efficiency, adaptability and data throughput.}

The end devices used for reading water meters transmit their measurements through cluster heads with dual wireless connectivity.

Specifically, it utilizes a grouped reversible residual connection with a graph isomorphism network to learn expressive node representations from botnet communication graphs. The explainer, based on the GNNExplainer and saliency map in XG-BoT, can perform automatic network forensics by highlighting suspicious network flows and related botnet nodes. We evaluated XG-BoT using real-world, large-scale botnet network graph datasets. Overall, XG-BoT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of key evaluation metrics.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) requires seamless mobility and services with low power consumption, low packet loss ratio, ultra-low latency, and high reliability. Ultra-dense deployment of small coverage radio access networks improves network throughput, latency, and packet loss ratio but increases the frequency of vertical handovers. Optimal network selection to ensure ultra-reliable, low-latency, seamless connectivity to provide massive machine-type communication to support a wide range of services for the emergence of IoT and Industry 5.0 through the next generation heterogeneous networks is one of the most challenging fields of research. The best network selection is one of the most crucial phases of the vertical handover decision algorithm in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network. Inadequate network selection can lead to failed handovers and ping pong handovers, which drastically affect the quality of services and the quality of experience. In this article, we have developed a new improved method based on improved removal effects of criteria- technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (I-MEREC-TOPSIS) network selection scheme. It is based on the removal effect of alternativesâ attributes. It is an intelligent integration of the I-MEREC weight method of alternative criteria and the TOPSIS alternative ranking multi-attribute decision-making technique. In the proposed scheme, optimal network selection is not only dependent on the best performance score of candidate networks but also on the statistically defined threshold value of servicing and target networks. In comparison to CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) TOPSIS, Entropy-TOPSIS, Statistical Variance Procedure(SVP) TOPSIS, and MEREC-TOPSIS, the proposed scheme has reduced ping-pong handovers and handover failures.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the performance of Googleâs Edge TPU on feed-forward neural networks. We consider Edge TPU as a hardware platform and explore different architectures of deep neural network classifiers, which traditionally have been a challenge to run on resource-constrained edge devices. Based on the use of a joint-timeâfrequency data representation, also known as a spectrogram, we explore the trade-off between classification performance and the energy consumed for inference. The energy efficiency of Edge TPU is compared with that of the widely-used embedded CPU ARM Cortex-A53. Our results quantify the impact of neural network architectural specifications on the Edge TPUâs performance, guiding decisions on the TPUâs optimal operating point, where it can provide high classification accuracy with minimal energy consumption. Also, our evaluations highlight the crossover in performance between Edge TPU and Cortex-A53, depending on the neural network specifications. Based on our analysis, we provide a decision chart to guide decisions on platform selection based on the model parameters and context.}

	abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is a developing technology that has produced remarkable advancements and contributions in numerous applications. IoT refers to a system of wirelessly inter-connected heterogeneous nodes or sensors over Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The main routing protocol of the LLNs is the Routing Protocol over Low power and Lossy network (RPL). RPL is a lightweight routing protocol designed to meet the memory, energy, and bandwidth constraints of LLNs and IoT devices. Because of their constraints, IoT systems are subject to challenges such as reliable data transmission, and network security. This work will review several security mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature to secure RPL-based IoT systems against sinkhole attack. The proposed mechanisms will be discussed, classified, and analyzed in terms of their performance, datasets, implementation details, and limitations. This work will also present some research gap analysis and suggestions for future research topics in this general area.}

	abstract = {Compared with traditional service provision methods, cloud computing has many advantages, such as on-demand services and flexible pricing systems, attracting widespread attention from both academia and industry. However, the abundance of cloud services makes it difficult for users to choose suitable ones. Furthermore, the cloud is usually a dynamically changing execution environment, requiring users to constantly switch service carriers for the best experience. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of service interactions in a multi-cloud environment and cope with the high concurrency demands, this paper proposes a multi-agent and distributed broker-based cloud service provisioning model. Equipped with a decision tree-based user preference learning module, brokers in the proposed model can continuously adjust their resource introduction strategy through training on historical data. In the process of cloud service interaction, brokers select the best cost-effective service for users within a limited time through a two-layer Restricted Monte Carlo Tree Search (RMTCS) algorithm. This paper develops a multi-cloud service interconnection system based on the Libcloud framework. Shielding the different interfaces of different cloud service providers in cloud virtual machine and storage services provides the most suitable services for users and realizes the unified cloud federation service supply. The experiment results prove that the proposed model achieves better performance over the traditional methods and can better meet the service requirements of users.}

One of the main challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights, including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.}

This work proposes a new, portable, cost-effective carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions sensor installed in a Light Duty Vehicle (LDV), as a novel enabler towards carbon footprint aware autonomous driving. This work achieves the ability to report real-time metrics about the instantaneous CO2 emissions whilst satisfying non-invasive procedures (weight <1 kg) by means of Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) compliant interrogators. The proposed solution is validated in compliance with European Unionâs official emissions test procedures, and compared with other commercial off-the-shelf solutions. During the test, a 50 km trip divided in 3 driving cycles is performed to obtain the instantaneous CO2 emission, achieving a measuring rate similar to other commercial, non-portable and expensive alternatives.}

The increasing availability of sensors, networks, and cloud services can facilitate real-time measurements to perform data analysis on plants and the environment in which they coexist with students and teachers. This article addresses the use of plants and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology to educate students (and teachers) on the benefits of using plants in indoor learning contexts (i.e., classrooms, study rooms, offices, libraries). The contribution of this research is threefold: first, a theoretical framework to design learning activities targeting environmental awareness is presented; second, an IoT system (Spike) specifically designed to monitor plants in learning spaces is described and evaluated; third, alternative learning activities and paths for learning using plants and IoT technology are described from a teachersâ and studentsâ perspective.

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are crucial for implementing the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. A WSN can include distributed devices that can be battery powered, have a small amount of memory, have limited CPU processing capabilities and limited transmission range. WSNs are categorised into two main types that are homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous WSNs are composed of nodes that are all equal while heterogeneous ones are composed of nodes that can have different transmission rate and different initial energy. Collecting data in an energy efficient manner is one of the main goals when building wireless sensor networks since devices are battery powered and battery replacement can be difficult or impossible to be performed. Clustering protocols are one of the main approaches that have been used in order to collect data in an energy efficient way. A clustering protocol groups nodes into a set of clusters. Each cluster has a representative node that is referred to as Cluster Head (CH). This collects data from its cluster members and forwards them to an external Base Station, possibly in a multi-hop way among cluster heads. A rotation strategy for electing the cluster head is often used together with clustering in order to prolong the network lifetime. Rotation eliminates the overhead traffic that is needed for leader election and cluster formation since the old cluster heads directly designate new ones. In this work, we describe an Optimum Rotation Scheduling (ORS) that uses Integer Linear Programming in order to find the optimum rotation strategy. ORS assumes the WSN clusters are already formed by using some clustering protocol. A novel integer linear programming formulation is then used in order to define a cluster head rotation that produces the optimum cluster lifetime. Comparisons with existing heuristics and the provided optimum are then shown and discussed by means of extended simulations involving both homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs.}

	abstract = {Data transmission over power line communication (PLC) infrastructure will proliferate lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) nodes in 5G and 6G networks. Consequently, a corresponding lightweight multi-hop routing protocol (LMRP) with reduced path loss and computational complexities will be required at the edges of PLC networks to connect the cloud sinks. Using a multi-layered system architecture, we present an LMRP for optimal routing and highlight the components of a smart PLC network comprising edge power pool orchestration, edge layer service provisioning, fog latency layer, and cloud resilient backbone. The LMRP reduces path loss and node failure states at the edge while optimising throughputs, minimum cost flow, and signal stability. A multi-hop deterministic testbed is designed and applied in three different locations to estimate path loss leveraging TelosB IoT node, Raspberry Pi (RPI) with NesC, and Java scripted logger application. Three different testbeds of varying path loss characteristics at the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) are used while the analysis was completed at Manchester Metropolitan University engineering LAB. The result of PL mitigation in Location 1 (sonic FUTO) shows 33.89%, 33.25%, and 32.77% with genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), and the proposed LMRP, respectively. In Location 2 (Old SEET Complex, FUTO), the PL obtained are 33.81%, 33.57%, and 32.62%, while Location 3 (New SEET Complex, FUTO) yields 33.65%, 33.41%, and 32.74% in PL mitigation for GA, PSO, and LMRP, respectively. Despite improved PL mitigation, the results also show that the proposed scheme offers a lightweight routing performance of at least 76.30% compared to similar schemes.}

It provides communication between the digital and physical worlds, transforming the way people do business quickly. The IoT is a network of physical objects (things) equipped with sensors, intelligent networking, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and other technologies that communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices online. IoT applications are now significantly more prevalent worldwide. IoT is driving the real world to become more intelligent in several industries, including smart grids for electricity, intelligent traffic, and smart homes and buildings. As a result, predictions and research point to over 50 billion connected devices by 2020. It will be required to safeguard this growing volume of data during exchange because the amount of data being transmitted will be quite enormous. Data security is represented by cryptography, an essential tool (algorithms) in security, which is why many researchers are developing cryptographic algorithms to improve the Security of IoT. This survey paper introduced an overview of IoT technology, architecture, and applications and a detailed analysis comparing all cryptographic algorithms and their use in day-to-day life activities. This paper discusses lightweight block ciphers, stream ciphers, and hybrid ciphers. The report evaluates security algorithms, comparing performance and robustness with the computational complexity of these techniques. Finally, the survey presents IoT security challenges, threats, and attacks with their mitigation techniques.}

The IoE paradigm encompasses solutions from generation units to loads, and one of its principal concerns is digitalized substations. The evolution of electrical energy systems through digitalized substations is mainly based on IEC 61850, allowing more efficient monitoring, control, automation, and protection systems. Despite the numerous benefits, this digitization brought cybersecurity challenges, mainly associated with the IEC 61850 GOOSE protocol. One of the most critical aspects of securing communication systems in digitalized substations is which mitigation method is more efficient for this specific and crucial scenario. Equally important, the security requirements, vulnerabilities, and solutions lack correlation. However, very few articles focus on this theme systematically, thoroughly, and unbiasedly; To our knowledge, none of these papers conducted a systematic review considering the security requirements for IEC 61850-based substations, presenting the vulnerabilities, attacks, and mitigation methods. This paper presents a systematic literature review from the first articles published in 2021 concerning cybersecurity methods and techniques. We summarize the pieces for this issue and provide a correlation between the security requirements, the attacks, mitigation methods, and security gaps to position new research activities appropriately.}

	abstract = {Management of network resources in advanced IoT applications is a challenging topic due to their distributed nature from the Edge to the Cloud, and the heavy demand of real-time data from many sources to take action in the deployment. FANETs (Flying Ad-hoc Networks) are a clear example of heterogeneous multi-modal use cases, which require strict quality in the network communications, as well as the coordination of the computing capabilities, in order to operate correctly the final service. In this paper, we present a Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) framework designed for the allocation of dataflow applications, composed of nano-services that produce or consume data, in a wireless infrastructure, such as an airborne network. To address the problem, an anypath-based heuristic algorithm that considers the quality demand of the communication between nano-services is proposed, coined as Quality-Revenue Paired Anypath Dataflow VNE (QRPAD-VNE). We also provide a simulation environment for the evaluation of its performance according to the virtual network (VN) request load in the system. Finally, we show the suitability of a multi-parameter framework in conjunction with anypath routing in order to have better performance results that guarantee minimum quality in the wireless communications.}

	abstract = {Nowadays coal gangue presorting is still mostly conducted manually, with high labor intensity, low sorting efficiency, and potential safety hazards. A coal gangue sorting robot that is an effective device to complete the coal gangue presorting instead of the worker, for which the coal gangue intelligent detection is one of its key technologies. The lightweight and real-time performance of the detection model has an important impact on the performance of coal gangue sorting robot. Lots of models for the coal gangue detection have been proposed based on machine learning, but there are still some problems such as slow detection speed, structural redundancy and large model size. This paper adopts the lightweight network of ResNet18 as the backbone feature extraction network of YOLOv3 and proposes a coal gangue detection algorithm of ResNet18-YOLO, studied the feature scale reduction and unstructured pruning of the model to further improve its lightweight and real-time performance, prepared the coal gangue data set referring to the actual gangue sorting situation and discussed the performance of the model. The results show that the improved ResNet18-YOLO algorithm can detect the coal gangue at a speed of 45.5 ms/piece and the model size is only approximately 65.34 MB when the mAP of the coal gangue detection is 96.27%. It has better real-time performance and smaller model size with the condition of equivalent mAP performance to the other algorithms, and has good gangue detection performance, which is conducive to reducing the technical requirements for the gangue sorting robot.}

	abstract = {IoT is an emerging technology that provides innovative solutions to our day-to-day life challenges. With billions of diverse smart objects, IoT produces gigantic amount of heterogeneous data that mostly need to be processed in real time and shared across systems and applications. For IoT data to be truly accessable and interpretable, the data heterogeneity problem needs to be resolved first. Semantic technologies is one of the most used solutions for data integration across systems. Data represented as knowledge graphs enables easier querying and matching. To address this, we propose an SDN based IoT architectural framework utilizing semantics for data integration and sharing using Kafka and Spark Streaming for real-time data handling. One main contribution of this work is that any consistent IoT ontology, defined using Web Ontology Language(OWL) which explicitly specify its classes, objects and data properties, can be used to convert the stream data into RDF format automatically using Natural Language Processing endeavor. SDN helps in dynamically locating the data producing devices such as sensors for providing flexible data routing. We have presented a testbed experimentation framework and evaluated the results with simulated virtual sensors. The homogeneous results from diverse datasets was generated in acceptable minimal time. A use-case for Air Quality Monitoring is given and SPARQL queries executed have shown satisfactory response time with over thousands of triples.}

	abstract = {In todayâs computing environment, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data processing are moving toward the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge computing paradigms, benchmarking resource-constrained devices is a critical task to evaluate their suitability and performance. Between the employed devices, Single-Board Computers arise as multi-purpose and affordable systems. The literature has explored Single-Board Computers performance when running high-level benchmarks specialized in particular application scenarios, such as AI or medical applications. However, lower-level benchmarking applications and datasets are needed to enable new Edge-based AI solutions for network, system and service management based on device and component performance, such as individual device identification. Thus, this paper presents LwHBench, a low-level hardware benchmarking application for Single-Board Computers that measures the performance of CPU, GPU, Memory and Storage taking into account the component constraints in these types of devices. LwHBench has been implemented for Raspberry Pi devices and run for 100 days on a set of 45 devices to generate an extensive dataset that allows the usage of AI techniques in scenarios where performance data can help in the device management process. Besides, to demonstrate the inter-scenario capability of the dataset, a series of AI-enabled use cases about device identification and context impact on performance are presented as exploration of the published data. Finally, the benchmark application has been adapted and applied to an agriculture-focused scenario where three RockPro64 devices are present.}

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the main data collection tools used by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The WSN-based IoT is a collection of several small, geographically dispersed, battery-powered sensors that are devoted to carrying out a certain activity in a collaborative manner. In a dense WSN-based IoT network, numerous sensors that are near to one another simultaneously collect the same data about the occurrence. Even though WSN-based IoT has opened up previously unimaginable possibilities in a variety of application areas, they are still susceptible to resource limitations. The energy of nodes, which is needed to run well for extended periods of time in many activities, is the most crucial resource in a given WSN-based IoT. Increasing the lifetime of the network is a major focus of research in the field of WSN-based IoT because it is impossible to replace or recharge batteries in remote, harsh or dangerous environments. In this article, an energy-efficient fuzzy-based unequal clustering with a sleep scheduling (EFUCSS) protocol for IoT that uses WSN is proposed. This protocol makes the network last longer and uses less energy. It does this by using clustering, scheduling, and data transmission. Unequal clusters based on Fuzzy C-Means are formed using this protocol to balance the energy used via reducing the distance that data travels. The selection of the cluster head is carried out using fuzzy logic system. The gatewayâs (GW) distance, remaining energy, and centrality are input variables. The output fuzzy variable is chance. Fuzzy inference is performed using the Mamdani technique. The sleep scheduling strategy is used between the coupled nodes to reduce the number of transmitted nodes. Extensive Python-based simulation experiments are run in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed EFUCSS protocol. While taking into account different WSN-based IoT scenarios and several criteria, such as network stability, network lifetime, and energy efficiency, a comparison is made between the proposed EFUCSS protocol and other well-known conventional protocols. The results show that the proposed EFUCSS improves remaining energy by 26.92%â213.4% and network lifespan by 39.58%â408.13%. The suggested EFUCSS also results in a greater improvement in network lifespan compared to other comparable algorithms.}

	abstract = {Industrial automation technologies are envisioned as multi-device systems that are constantly interacting with one another and with enterprise systems. In these industrial systems, the industrial internet of things (IIoT) significantly improves system efficiency, scalability, ease of control, and monitoring. These benefits have been achieved at the cost of greater security risks, thus making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. Historically, industrial networks and systems lacked security features like authentication and encryption due to intended isolation over the Internet. Lately, remote access to these IIoT systems has made an attempt of holistic security alarmingly critical. In this research paper, a threat modeling framework for smart cyberâphysical system (CPS) is proposed to get insight of the potential security risks. To carry out this research, the smart firefighting use case based on the MITRE ATT&CK matrix was investigated. The matrix analysis provided structure for attacks detection and mitigation, while system requirement collection (SRC) was applied to gather generic assetsâ information related to hardware, software and network. With the help of SRC and MITRE ATT&CK, a threat list for the smart firefighting system was generated. Conclusively, the generated threat list was mapped on the national institute of standards and technology (NIST) security and privacy controls. The results show that these mapped controls can be well-utilized for protection and mitigation of threats in smart firefighting system. In future, critical cyberâphysical systems can be modeled upon use case specific threats and can be secured by utilizing the presented framework.}

	abstract = {Air quality monitoring has traditionally been performed using robust specialized systems based on an air filter. These systems provide high quality data, but entail a high investment, thus limiting the scale of the deployment. An alternative way of measuring air pollution is the use of optical sensors, which are mounted on an embedded system, leading to a lower cost, as compared to the traditional solution. While these systems allow for a wider deployment at a lower cost, there is a concern on the quality of the data provided by them. In this context, the analysis of Data Quality (DQ) takes special relevance, in order to meet the requirements established by environmental agencies. In order to tackle this issue, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional model that estimates a unified DQ index, based on the integration of the relevant DQ dimensions and the subjective preferences of experts in the field. We present the development of DQ-MAN, a tool that allows the end-user to assess and visualize the DQ metrics over different time frames, and to compute the corresponding DQ index. Our tool allows the user to publish the summarized results in a web report. We validate DQ-MAN using a synthetic dataset to assess the correctness of our tool, as well as a real dataset of a low-cost monitoring system deployed in MedellÃ­n, Colombia. Based on the evaluation, we conclude that DQ-MAN is aware of changes in DQ, and how each dimension affects the overall DQ assessment.}

	abstract = {Energy Harvesting plays a crucial role in improving the network lifetime of an IoT application. Radio Frequency (RF) energy is one of the most prominent ambient energy sources available that can be used for harvesting energy. Moreover, a number of dedicated RF-energy transmitters is required for sufficient energy transfer to the power deficit IoT nodes. However, the appropriate positioning of these RF-energy transmitters in the network is a challenging issue. In this context, a network-aware RF-energy transmitter positioning scheme is proposed in this work. This RF-energy transmitter deployment scheme considers different network performance parameters such as energy-hole information, node-connectivity information, and data routing information for RF-energy transmitter placement. Apart from that, the amount of RF-energy harvested is constrained to the RF-energy carried by the propagating RF-waves. Moreover, the wireless medium uncertainties result in severe attenuation of the propagating RF-waves. In this regard, a robust hybrid RF-wave propagation model is also proposed. The proposed model amalgamates different wave propagation mechanisms for signal strength prediction in the propagating RF-waves. This helps in improving the modelling accuracy of the RF-waves. The proposed model also predicts the amount of residual RF-energy available in the propagating RF-wave for harvesting. This model is also validated against the practical datasets generated from experiments. The proposed transmitter positioning scheme, along with the hybrid RF-wave propagation model, overcome the energy hole issue in the IoT networks and improves energy efficiency. Extensive simulations are conducted under various network scenarios to evaluate the energy harvesting performance of the proposed methods. It is observed that the proposed network-aware RF-energy harvesting scheme improves the network performance in terms of energy harvesting, network coverage, and the lifetime of IoT network.}

	abstract = {The ability of classifying road anomalies plays a crucial role in monitoring road conditions and the maintenance process. Modern techniques utilize the acceleration signal resulting from the interaction between the passing vehicles and the road anomalies to classify their type. Most of the previous methods depended on calculating handcrafted features from only the\nz\nacceleration signal to classify road anomalies. However, this does not guarantee that the calculated set of features is sufficient to distinguish between the different anomalies. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient crowdsensing system, called Convolutional-based Mixer Neural Network Road Anomalies Detector and Classifier (CMNN- RADC), for detecting and classifying the road anomalies. CMNN-RADC is based on mixing the low and high frequency automatically extracted features from the three acceleration signals (i.e.\nx\n,\ny\n, and\nz\n) for detecting and classifying road anomalies. A simple two-stages Convolutional-based Mixer Neural Network (CMNN) is designed in the proposed system. The first stage identifies the presence of anomalies, while the second stage distinguishes the identifying anomaly into one of three types (pothole, asphalt bump, or metal bump). This saves the consumption power and computational time of the system. Different experiments were carried out to optimize the classifier parameters and test its performance. The results show the superiority of the CMNN-RADC over the previous methods because it has the ability to detect 99.3% of the anomalies. Moreover, it classifies anomalies with an F1 score of 98.42, 97.68, and 99.05% for metal bump, pothole, and asphalt bump, respectively.}

	abstract = {Since access to clean and safe water is one of life's most basic needs, the exponential growth of the world's population makes it vital to guarantee a workable framework. Manually collecting samples and sending them to a research center for discovery and analysis is the typical approach for gathering information on water qualities. However, this approach is illogical in the long run because it requires a lot of time and labor. This paper aimed to construct, test, and evaluate the usefulness of machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) at water storage stations. First, we developed a system prototype and assessed its performance using classifier and reliability matrices. This study considers water's physical and chemical parameters to evaluate the level of water pollutants present in drinking water. The parameters measured include temperature, pH, turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP), and electrical conductivity. After analyzing the sensor data, we used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms to forecast the impurity level of the water measured. The performance showed that the ANN models used have the highest accuracy and are the most suitable to predict water source and status. We also introduced a water treatment method to provide an automated corrective measure based on a specific amount of water contamination. Based on the system's results, we concluded that AI and IoT are more efficient in remotely monitoring safe and harmful water conditions.}

	abstract = {In modern society, hyperspectral images have widely been used in many applications. In the earth observation system, hyperspectral images are acquired by hyperspectral sensors and transmitted to the cloud computing center for analysis, which are the part of satellite Internet of Things(IoT) to build a large scale land-cover surveillance system. Thus, during recent years, researchers throughout academia and industry have been advancing the classification of hyperspectral images. Luckily for swamped remote sensing researchers, new technology is allowing brands to extract useful knowledge using artificial intelligence to enhance supervised hyperspectral image classification technology. However, conventional methods that label and process hyperspectral images manually are labor and time-consuming. Hence, in this paper, we proposed an unsupervised hyperspectral image classification framework. The paper differs from the existing methods by three aspects: (1) We adopt multi-scale spatial features to enhance the discriminability of data. (2) We propose deep autoencoder with maxâmin distance embedding to extract features and reduce dimensions of data, which is more suitable for large-scale data clustering. (3) We apply k-means clustering method to get original classification, then optimize the results by the guided filter. Experimental results on two widely used hyperspectral data, Salinas and Pavia University, show the competitive performance obtained by the proposed framework compared with other approaches.}

	abstract = {Extended battery lifetime is always desirable for wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs). The recent integration of LoRaWAN-grade massive machine-type communications (MTC) technology and WUSNs, namely LoRaWAN-based WUSNs, provides a promisingly energy-efficient solution for underground monitoring. However, due to the limited battery energy, massive data collisions and dynamic underground environment, the energy efficiency of LoRaWAN-based WUSNs still possesses a significant challenge. To propose a liable solution, we advocate reinforcement learning (RL) for managing the transmission configuration of underground sensors. In this paper, we firstly develop the multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm to improve the network energy efficiency, which considers the link quality, energy consumption and packet collisions between packets. Secondly, a reward mechanism is proposed, which is used to define independent state and action for every node to improve the adaptability of the proposed algorithm to dynamic underground environment. Furthermore, through the simulations in different underground environment and at different network scales, our results highlight that the proposed MARL algorithm can quickly optimize the network energy efficiency and far exceed the traditional adaptive data rate (ADR) mechanism. Finally, our proposed algorithm is successfully demonstrated to be able to efficiently adapt to the dynamically changing underground environment. This work provides insights into the energy efficiency optimization, and will lay the foundation for future realistic deployments of LoRaWAN-based WUSNs.}

	abstract = {After some years in which information management has been centralized in cloud platforms, the need to implement architectures that perform more efficient and intelligent management of such information has become essential. In addition, the growth of Smart City solutions, which involve the deployment of large-scale network infrastructures, has revealed the benefits of processing data as close as possible to the source, a key principle of Edge Computing. However, the benefits of service orchestration in real-world applications have not been demonstrated to date given the novelty and difficulties related to large-scale deployments. To overcome this barrier, this work presents the design, deployment, and validation of a cloudâedge microservice-based architecture for service orchestration on top of a real-world network consisting of 175 nodes. These nodes were deployed as part of a regional network of touristic terminals to raise tourismâs potential in the region of Badajoz, Spain. The integration of the openBalena open-source cloud platform into the architecture enables remote and centralized management. The experiments carried out revealed an orchestration latency time to deploy new applications from scratch throughout the entire region between 22 s and 292 s depending on the size of the application image. In addition, CPU load and memory usage have been monitored and the lack of suitability of virtualized environments for interactive applications has been overcome, and a step-by-step guide from a successful deployment is provided. As a result, this integral solution contributes valuable insights into how to bring the benefits of orchestration to reality.}

	abstract = {One of the essential requirements of wireless industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems is to have an extremely high packet delivery rate, generally over 99.9% and comply with realtime deadline constraints. In industrial IoT networks, packets arriving after the deadline become part of packet loss and lose meaning when they arrive late. However, currently available industrial IoT proposals aim to minimize End-to-End delay without taking into account simultaneous realtime and reliability constraints. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, called BDPC (Bounded Delay Packet Control) to tackle this challenge. BDPC combines the knowledge of a nodeâs traffic delay to the destination (root) with the time budget of a data packet traversing the industrial IoT network, to allocate network resources to comply the system maximum delay requirements using an adaptive and distributed algorithm. Unlike the general aim to minimze end-to-end delay, we propose that data packets must arrive before the deadline, but not faster. Our results show, for example, that by using BDPC, the number of packets arriving before the deadline can be improved more than 2.6 times compared to the case when using the default Minimal Scheduling Function from the standard. As a further advantage, BDPC involves minor modifications to the 6TiSCH protocol stack, which makes it compatible with current implementations.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, data is becoming the new fuel for economic wealth and creation of novel and profitable business models. Multitude of technologies are contributing to an abundance of information sources which are already the baseline for multi-millionaire services and applications. Internet of Things (IoT), is probably the most representative one. However, for an economy of data to actually flourish there are still several critical challenges that have to be overcome. Among them, data quality can become an issue when data come from heterogeneous sources or have different formats, standards and scale. Improving data quality is of utmost importance for any domain since data are the basis for any decision-making system and decisions will not be accurate if they are based on inadequate low-quality data. In this paper we are presenting a solution for assessing several quality dimensions of IoT data streams as they are generated. Additionally, the solution described in the paper actually improves the quality of data streams by curating them through the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques. The approach followed in our work has been to append data quality information as metadata linked to each individual piece of curated data. We have leveraged linked-data principles and integrated the developed AI-based IoT data curation mechanisms within a Data Enrichment Toolchain (DET) that employs the NGSI-LD standard to harmonize and enrich heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, we have evaluated our design under experimental research conditions, achieving a robust compromise between functionality and overhead. Besides, it demonstrates a stable and scalable performance.}

This trend, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has applications in smart homes, smart cities, industrial automation, health monitoring systems, and has become an essential component of the communication and networking industry. However, different communication and protocol standards, weak security defaults and the difficulty of distributing updates have exacerbated cybersecurity threats to critical applications that employ IoT. To mitigate the threats and counter these attacks, a promising approach is to develop a robust intrusion detection framework specifically aimed at securing IoT. This paper presents our efforts to catalogue and compare attacks, datasets and machine learning algorithms and architectures for intrusion detection systems for IoT devices. We classify attacks aimed at IoT devices at different layers and protocols. This work also highlights potential features that can be used by machine learning-based intrusion detection systems to detect different types of attacks. We provide a comparative study of IoT datasets used for model training and identify key properties which helps in assessing their suitability in particular scenarios. Finally, we discuss our observations and propose the research directions for building a robust IoT intrusion detection system.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper, we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced security.}

	abstract = {Proper access control and communication security are the key requirements for real-time data-transfer in Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT). Besides, the system reliability and robustness may be affected, as the traffic volume is increasing gradually, and there may be heterogeneous IoT-devices in the network. Hence, a global control over the entire network becomes crucial to ensure Quality-of-Service (QoS). As the IoT-devices operate from a remote location with no (or minimum) human intervention, they may be compromised easily. Hence, it becomes essential to guarantee the system security even if one or more IoT-devices are compromised unexpectedly. Recently, some Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based approaches have been proposed to ensure communication security and global control over heterogeneous IoT-devices. However, they may suffer from single-point-of-failure due to the use of a centralized SDN controller. In this article, we put forward a secure and efficient authentication protocol for IIoT based applications using distributed control plane, named DC-IIoT. DC-IIoT can achieve the required security and design properties, and overcome single-point-of-failure by incorporating physically distributed and logically centralized SDN controllers. DC-IIoT also introduces a\n(\nt\n,\nn\n)\n-threshold-based authentication approach for cloning attack detection. The performance of DC-IIoT has been analyzed in terms of various security, privacy and performance factors, and compared with other similar protocols. The empirical results are quite encouraging.}

	abstract = {Emerging technologies and applications including the Internet of Things (IoT), social networking, and crowd-sourcing generate large amounts of data at the network edge. Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy concerns, it is often impractical to send all the data to a centralized location. Recently, the emerging Federated Learning (FL) systems mitigates some of those concerns, by keeping data private to cater the confidentiality issues. Although FL has drawn the attention of researchers and developers, the involvement of an aggregator server for global model updates, makes the system prone to privacy and security breaches. To resolve this issue Swarm Learning (SL) securely onboards edge clients and dynamically elects the swarm leader, to perform collaborative model training in an extremely decentralized, private and secured manner. However, the conventional blockchain-enabled dynamic selection of leader at every communication round is resource intensive and degrades SLâs effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a lightweight communication and computation efficient cooperative swarm learning framework for cyclic edge intelligent computing. The proposed cooperative swarm learning provides cyclic learning based on Deep Neural Networks procedure for training a global model in a sequential ring topology in one iteration which reduces the computational and communication overhead. The global model update method trains a shared global thermal comfort prediction model. Since there is model updating being performed in each participant of the cyclic edge intelligent computing network, bandwidth and computing power demand are reduced. An empirical investigation on Non-IID thermal comfort dataset demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Massive data collection in modern systems has paved the way for data-driven machine learning, a promising technique for creating reliable and robust statistical models. By combining the data into centralized storage to develop a reliable learning model, there are concerns with privacy, ownership, and strict rules. It is self-evident that the samples in the typical machine learning centralized server paradigm have vastly different probability distributions of data supplied by each user. As a result, the typical model needs to be personalized for critical medical applications, and the deployment needs an efficient mechanism that can adapt to varying user inputs. Due to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of critical medical IoT applications in such Edge/Fog scenarios, the privacy of patients become a crucial problem. Federated Learning, the model trained on diversity helps in addressing these concerns when used. This paper proposes the integration of Federated Learning for distributed EdgeâFogâCloud architecture in the IoT smart healthcare sector. This paper presents FedSDM, the Federated Learning-based Smart Decision Making framework for the ECG data in microservice-based IoT medical applications. This proposal makes use of the advantages of Edge/Fog computing for real-time critical applications. It deploys the Federated Learning model at the Edge, Fog, and Cloud layers for performance comparison. The parameters considered for performance evaluation are energy consumption, network usage, cost, execution time, and latency. The proposed method shows that Edge-based deployment outperforms Fog and Cloud in terms of energy consumption, network usage, cost, execution time, and latency (i.e.) 0.3%, 2%, 15%, 11%, and 3% when compared with Fog and 1.6%, 31%, 41%, 24 % and 85% against Cloud respectively.}

As the technology is new, there is a lack of knowledge and experience in selecting suitable platforms for SC networks. Choosing the right platform is a difficult and complex task involving multiple and conflicting criteria. This study presents a novel practical approach for evaluating and selecting a BT-IoT platform in SC networks using multi-criteria decision-making. First, an extensive literature review is conducted to determine the most suitable criteria for BT-IoT platform selection. Then, using the interval Weighted Influence Non-linear Gauge System (WINGS) method, the weights of the criteria are calculated, and finally an interval VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique is used to assess the suitability of the platforms. The proposed approach uses the expertsâ preferences, considers the interdependencies among criteria in the weighting process, and enables implementation in a hierarchical and interconnected network. We present a case study in the food industry to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. Additional sensitivity analysis is conducted to exhibit the efficacy of the proposed model in selecting a suitable and robust platform in SC networks.}

	abstract = {LoRa is widely used in various applications, which has gained increasing popularity in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). However, in legacy LoRa protocols, bidirectional communications and low power consumption cannot be achieved simultaneously, hindering the further development of LoRa. In this study, a long preamble wake-up communication (LPWC) protocol is proposed to alleviate the aforementioned issue. This scheme is performed at both sides of communication: (1) LoRa nodes are designed to sleep periodically to save more power; (2) LoRa gateway must send packets with long preamble to maintain the reliability of downlink communication. In addition, an energy model is built to prove that an optimal cycle period exists for LoRa nodes to save more energy. Then we implement simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in various cases. Results show that LPWC outperforms LoRaWAN Class B mode in terms of power conservation and packet latency.}

	abstract = {In the era of connected things, it is necessary that agents do not work in isolation instead of collaboration with others, particularly humans in the workplace. However, the success of such cooperation depends on the specific context in which humans and robots interact. To address this challenge, a novel design of the context-aware system that enables effective collaboration between humans and robots is introduced. The architecture of this system consists of multiple controllers which handle the uni-axial motion. Then, the hardware components and their connections are described in detail so that each controller can be associated with the others. Later, the software design included a mutual interface, data flow, computational algorithms, and state machine. The practical platform has been developed that realizes several motion profiles, delivering smooth performance and advanced results. Different laboratory tests have been completed for the validations of our approach. In each context, the motion performance of the proposed method is achieved and analyzed. These results show that our approach is practical, feasible, and proper for various contexts in human-robot collaboration for Industry 4.0.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the optimum secrecy probability has been calculated using a reduction function that optimizes the transfer rate of the user's signal for a given average broadcast power while minimizing the transfer rate of the eavesdropper's signal to ensure safe transmission. In this work, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the eavesdropper signal and the received signal are accurately estimated using matrix theory. These approximated SNRs have been studied in relation to the outage probability. By making three distinct assumptions about channel correlation, it has been possible to determine the precise secrecy outage probability. In correlated multi-antenna transmit and receive channels, this research investigates the secrecy performance of three popular diversity combining strategiesâmaximum ratio combining (MRC), selection combining (SC), and equal gain combining (EGC). In this research, we consider a Rayleigh fading channel with overhead communication between the transmitter and recipient. In this research, we also propose a limiting bounds condition to improve the limits on the outage probability for the Rayleigh fading environment using the three diversity combining methods. Our restricting distribution is threshold-based in order to generate precise limits on the probability of secrecy outage. An application case has been presented which discusses the impact of the proposed model for device to device communication application scenario. Our findings demonstrate that channel correlation substantially influences the probability of a secrecy outage.}

	abstract = {Routing data between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) involves identifying node locations, analyzing residual energy levels, evaluating temporal throughput and packet delivery performance, and identifying other network and node parameters. It assists in forming quality of service (QoS) aware routes. Existing routing models require large data samples to find the optimized path or are highly complex, increasing their computational requirements. Low-complexity models showcase low-performance routing QoS when deployed on large-scale networks. To solve these limitations, a hybrid bioinspired model is proposed for fault-aware UAV routing that uses destination awareness with a fan-shaped clustering process (BMUDF). The model initially collects data from different UAV nodes and their node-level and network-level constraints. These parameters are processed through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) model, which enforces fan-shaped clustering (FSC) for effective routing operations. Our scheme uses the PSO model to identify the initial routing paths cascaded with a genetic algorithm (GA) based destination-aware routing model. These routing paths are evaluated through the QoS matrices like maximum temporal throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR), delay, and energy consumption. A grey wolf optimization (GWO) model further scrutinizes this routing performance, integrating fault tolerance and route optimization during continuous operations. The GWO model evaluates a trust-based fitness function, which helps to identify faulty nodes, and reconfigures the network with non-faulty nodes to improve its QoS performance under node failures and faults. Integrating the bioinspired models into the proposed system maximizes performance under different network scenarios. This performance compares and validated with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with various state-of-the-art models. It is observed that the proposed model showcased an 8.3% lower routing delay, 5.9% lower energy consumption, 1.5% higher packet delivery ratio, and 9.1% higher throughput, which makes it useful for a wide variety of real-time UAV routing scenarios.}

It has become one of the most famous IoT solutions for its smart home devices and appliances. Like every other technology, Zigbee is susceptible to different security vulnerabilities, regardless of all its inherent security considerations. In this survey, we comprehensively study the security of Zigbee with a focus on vulnerabilities, attacks and countermeasures throughout its evolution. We analyze the recent surveys that deal with Zigbee security and compare them based on different criteria. We also review papers that develop security assessment with regard to vulnerabilities, attacks and countermeasures in Zigbee networks. More importantly, we propose a classification scheme for these attacks and conduct a procedural review on the attacks to see how different vulnerabilities will lead to various attacks and how they can be counteracted. More importantly, we propose an attack chain study scheme to see how different vulnerabilities will lead to various attack that open new possibilities for other severe attacks. Finally, we conduct an evaluation study to see how the reader can use the reviewed papers for further future research in terms of vulnerability assessment, attack implementation and development, and countermeasure evaluation in Zigbee networks.}

	abstract = {Smart homes, leveraging IoT technology to interconnect various devices and appliances to the internet, enable remote monitoring, automation, and control. However, collecting sensitive personal and business data assets renders smart homes a target for cyberattacks. Anomaly detection is a promising approach for identifying malicious behavior in smart homes. Yet, the current literature primarily discusses IoT-related cyberattacks and gives limited attention to detecting anomalies specific to the smart home context. Furthermore, there is a lack of datasets that accurately represent the complexity inherent in a smart home environment in terms of users with varying levels of expertise and diverse, evolving types of devices. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that focuses on using anomaly detection to identify cyberattacks in smart home environments. The SLR includes an adapted taxonomy that classifies existing anomaly detection methods and a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and future research challenges. Our findings show a growing interest in detecting cyberattacks with anomaly-based models in smart homes using centralized and network-based features. Ensemble and deep learning techniques are popular methods for detecting these anomalies. However, the limited diversity of cyberattacks in existing datasets and the absence of comprehensive datasets representing the complexity of smart home environments call for further research to improve the generalizability of detection models.}

	abstract = {The advancement in person re-identification using attribute recognition is constrained by the increasingly strict data privacy standards since it necessitates the centralization of vast amounts of data containing sensitive personal data in the cloud. Cloud-based person re-identification requires the transfer of original video information to the servers, causing increased communication costs because of the need for significant bandwidth, resulting in unpredictable timing. This work presents an all-in-edge architecture for attribute-based person re-identification, which deploys training data in edge nodes that support distributed inference. Edge nodes independently learn but collaborate with specific neighboring nodes by sharing information to minimize communication and computational costs through the utilization of federated learning and transfer learning methods. Furthermore, this paper proposes a federated aggregation strategy-FedTransferLoss to obtain optimal global accuracy by using transfer learning to re-train the low-quality local models. Extensive experiments on two prominent pedestrian datasets-PETA and RAP show that FedTransferLoss achieves higher accuracy, recall and precision values compared to the traditional FedAvg algorithm.}

This advice was intended for individuals in the community, public health and infection prevention and control (IPC) professionals, healthcare managers, healthcare workers (HCWs), and community health workers. As the two primary routes of transmission of the COVID-19 virus are respiratory droplets and contact, face masks have become potential safety tools in public places. Subsequent contact with the face, eyes, nose, and mouth following contamination is detrimental. However, during this pandemic, physicians and nurses have suffered the consequences of wearing face masks for several hours. Therefore. a full-face mark, which ensures filtered breathing during the day, is critical. The proposed smart mask model protects the respiration of mask wearers and monitors their body temperature, sneezing attacks, and social distancing. Moreover, it registers their geographical location after ensuring ID registration. The proposed mask can be used both indoors and outdoors. Moreover, data can be processed locally for alarms related to temperature and social distancing. The remaining data are sent to a cloud for post-processing to record the histories of mask wearers in all parameters, including their geographical dynamic location, to track the possible spread of contamination. The prototype and measurement results demonstrate the practicality and potential utility of mass numbers.}

In this paper, a novel data acquisition and monitoring system for PEM hydrogen generators is presented. The main magnitudes of the PEM electrolyzer (PEMEL) such as current, voltage, pressure, hydrogen flow, etc., are sensed and acquired by an industrial controller. A middleware layer gathers the measurements through a communication network and stores them in a database. The user accesses online to this information in real time through a web-based interface. All components and functions are orchestrated according to an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) architecture, integrating industrial equipment, IoT software and sensing devices, which constitutes a novelty in literature. Experimental data of a PEMEL under real operating conditions are reported to prove the feasibility and successful performance of the developed system.}

However, this technology forms personal area networks, which will not directly communicate with internet end users. The IoT-enabled Zigbee devices cannot handle the IPv6 packets, which have a maximum packet size of 1280 bytes, and the transmission of IPv6 packets over ZigBee-based IEEE 802.15.4 networks, which will be performed using a gateway. via the ZigBee coordinator. The gateways and the ZigBee coordinator must complete the neighbor discovery process, which increases the coordinatorâs complexity. Additional ZigBee devices suffer from header size problems, routing structures, and data forwarding issues. This paper presents an efficient end-to-end communication protocol for IoT-enabled ZigBee devices and with an Internet host using the 6LoWPAN protocol. This 6LoWPAN connects IP-based infrastructures with a collection of Zigbee devices that provide end-to-end communication to route the IPv6 packets into ZigBee-enabled IoT networks. Next, we proposed the RPL-AODV routing protocol, which refers to the capacity to forward or route the data packets from one Zigbee device to the 6LoWPAN Boarder Router (6BR) via several hops. This proposed routing protocol combines the advantages of RPL and AODV routing protocols in ZigBee devices of IoT networks that establish the path from the origin node to the target node on an on-demand basis. Finally, we evaluated the performance of this protocol with various metrics and found improved results compared to existing protocols.}

Unauthorized access to such information may invite adversaries to disturb patients financially and mentally; furthermore, leaks in its confidentiality will lead to dangerous health concerns for patients. While ensuring authentication and confidentiality, We must focus on the constraints of IoMT, such as low energy consumption, deficient memory, and the dynamic nature of devices. Numerous protocols have been proposed for authentication in healthcare systems such as IoMT and telemedicine. However, many of these protocols were neither computationally efficient nor provided confidentiality, anonymity, and resistance against several attacks. In the proposed protocol, we have considered the most common scenario of IoMT and tried to overcome the limitations of existing works. Describing the system module and security analysis proves it is a panacea for COVID-19 and future pandemics.}

However, these systems often rely on protocols, such as iBeacon, that lack sufficient privacy protection. In addition, they depend on centralized entities for the authentication and verification processes. To address the limitations of existing protocols, this paper presents a groundbreaking contribution to the field of wearable-based CIPSs. We propose a decentralized Attribute-based Authentication (ABA) protocol that offers superior levels of privacy protection, untraceability, and unlinkability of user actions. Unlike existing protocols that rely on centralized entities, our approach leverages decentralized mechanisms for authentication and verification, ensuring the privacy of user location data exchange. Through extensive experimentation across multiple platforms, our results demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the proposed protocol for real-world deployment. Overall, this work opens up new avenues for secure and privacy-preserving wearable-based CIPSs, with potential implications for the rapidly growing field of Internet of Things (IoT) applications.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of millions of devices generating large amounts of heterogeneous data from multiple sources. These devices can be from multiple manufacturers which makes their use in terms of data acquisition, processing, analysis and actions on these data challenging. Additionally, all these data must be analyzed and correlated in real time for the early detection of situations of interest (complex events) and subsequent decision making. These complex events must be able to automatically trigger decisions and be stored in a secure, immutable and accessible way. In this context, Event-Driven Applications (EDAs) are a solution to meet these needs, however, developing such applications requires vast knowledge in certain technologies. To address these challenges, an EDA is proposed in this paper to integrate Complex Event Processing (CEP) and blockchain through the low-code paradigm. This proposal allows for the development of EDAs in a user-friendly way. These applications make it possible to integrate IoT devices from multiple manufacturers and with different data formats together with CEP technology for complex event detection and blockchain for secure, immutable and accessible event storage. To demonstrate the feasibility, the architecture was applied and evaluated in a case study related to measuring and acting on air quality using IoT devices that measure different pollutants and factors such as temperature, humidity and wind. The results show that the graphically designed EDAs facilitate the real-time analysis of the collected IoT data via a CEP engine, whose outcome is transparently and automatically registered in a blockchain network.}

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been growing interest in using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to address indoor fire hazards in smart buildings. This study conducted a systematic review of 54 articles from interdisciplinary databases using selected keywords over the past decade, with the aim of investigating the potential role of IoT sensors in indoor fire hazard contingency. Through thematic analysis, five main themes and 24 sub-themes were identified, including vision-based sensing, smart automation, evacuation and indoor navigation, early fire detection, intervention and prevention, and BIM-related. The results of this review indicate that there are numerous aspects of indoor fire hazards that could benefit from the use of IoT sensors, and that the recurrence of technical terminologies in the analysed articles underscores the importance of these technologies in establishing an IoT sensor network in smart building environments, particularly in addressing indoor fire incidents. The outcome and findings spurred a concept for potential future research ideas. As a result of the findings, a conceptual framework for IoT sensors in the context of smart buildings is proposed.}

	abstract = {A variety of wireless (and wired) technologies are being used to enable Internet of Things (IoT) device connectivity. Two examples of popular technologies in some crucial IoT domains (e.g., smart home, smart factories and smart cities, among others) are IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11. However, IoT devices supporting different wireless technologies are not interoperable without a gateway. One solution to this problem is exploiting bidirectional Cross-Technology Communication with Wake-up Radio (WuR-CTC). Nevertheless, existing WuR-CTC approaches do not support IPv6, and therefore cannot offer full Internet protocol stack interoperability. For the first time to our knowledge, in this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of an adaptation layer to provide IPv6 support over WuR-CTC, by leveraging the IETF Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework. Among others, experimental results show that our solution allows transferring a 127-byte IPv6 packet from an IEEE 802.15.4 device to an IEEE 802.11 device, without a gateway, in 69 ms (in average). Therefore, the designed solution supports latency-stringent applications in smart environments, where a human in the loop expects real-time interaction between devices.}

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 is characterized by digitalized production facilities, where a large volume of sensors collect a vast amount of data that is used to increase the sustainability of the production by e.g. optimizing process parameters, reducing machine downtime and material waste, and the like. However, making intelligent data-driven decisions under timeliness constraints requires the integration of time-sensitive networks with reliable data ingestion and processing infrastructure with plug-in support of Machine Learning (ML) pipelines. However, such integration is difficult due to the lack of frameworks that flexibly integrate and program the networking and computing infrastructures, while allowing ML pipelines to ingest the collected data and make trustworthy decisions in real time. In this paper, we present AIDA - a novel holistic AI-driven network and processing framework for reliable data-driven real-time industrial IoT applications. AIDA manages and configures Time-Sensitive networks (TSN) to enable real-time data ingestion into an observable AI-powered edge/cloud continuum. Pluggable and trustworthy ML components that make timely decisions for various industrial IoT applications and the infrastructure itself are an intrinsic part of AIDA. We introduce the AIDA architecture, demonstrate the building blocks of our framework and illustrate it with two use cases.}

	abstract = {LoRaWAN is one of the most popular LPWAN technology due to the facility to implement applications that require a low cost, low energy consumption, low data rate, and large coverage area. LoRaWAN is a single-hop star-of-stars topology composed of end-devices that transmit data to be collected by gateways in the coverage area. Multihop networks are receiving the attention of the LoRaWAN community since it allows to extend the coverage area and improve energy efficiency, thus prolonging the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for multihop LoRaWAN networks. The objective of the analytical model is to provide a general and theoretical definition of a multihop LoRaWAN network, considering different device characteristics and network topologies. The analytical model gives new insights into the performance of multihop LoRaWAN networks. We investigate the energy consumption, throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio of single-hop and multihop relay networks. The results showed that the relay network increases the network performance compared to the regular LoRaWAN network, although there are some limitations on the number of hops and relay characteristics. The development and deployment of multihop LoRaWAN networks are creating new opportunities, and the analytical model presented could be used before real deployments for a better knowledge of limitations and network needs.}

	abstract = {Recent surveys expose that the use of Open Source Software (OSS) is increasingly becoming a need for organizations in their development projects. However, deciding a proper OSS to be adopted or to contribute to its development is a complex and error-prone task. Analyzing the OSS ecosystem (OSSECO) health may help providing information about: (1) the OSS itself (number of commits, days after the last release, etc.); and (2) their main actors (number of contributors, partners, etc.). There exist proposals that go further and provide aggregated high-level indicators (e.g. visibility as an aggregation of number of community events, number of partners, and other metrics). Nevertheless, there is a lack of useful OSSECO analysis tools to ease the decision making on which OSSECO has the health required by a potential OSS adopter or contributor. In this work, we provide OSS-CARE (OSSeCo heAlthy monitoR and analysEr), an OSS-independent, fully automatic, and real-time framework to assess OSSECOâs health. OSS-CARE supports defining the ecosystem health objectives of potential OSS adopters, OSS contributors, and even OSS managers to inspect their provided health. These objectives are defined based on a well-established model characterizing health metrics that can be potentially aggregated by using a Bayesian network technique. Moreover, the integrated monitoring and analysis components perform an automated assessment of OSSECOâs health by checking the fulfillment of the required health objectives. Furthermore, the result is shown in an appealing dashboard that may ease the complex decision making of which OSS to choose.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, connected vehicles have a major role in enhancing the driving experience. Connected vehicles in the network share their knowledge with the help of the network known as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, connection through the network comes with risks ranging from privacy concerns to security vulnerabilities in the network. Inside vehicles, many sensors and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are connected via specific network protocols, known as Intra-Vehicle communications, to assist the driver in tasks such as autonomous driving. Communicating through different protocols results in security openness for attackers to disturb the normal functioning of sensors and ECUs, which sometimes has detrimental effects. Moreover, in IoV, there is active communication between vehicles and other vehicles or road infrastructures alongside the network, known as Inter-Vehicle communications. Inter-Vehicle communications can also be an open vulnerability to intruders. Motivated by the mentioned security problems, many research initiatives have elaborated on building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect malicious behavior threatening the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of IoV. In this survey, we first provide a structured classification of IoV environment, its components, and the vulnerabilities of inter/intra-vehicle networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive literature review regarding numerous proposed IDS for IoV networks. Further, we discuss IDS criteria with a focus on essential areas that should be taken into account while assessing IoV network security, which can be related to IDS implementation constraints or further privacy requirements.}

	abstract = {Action identification for smart home ecosystem has experienced a rising interest among relevant fields. Nevertheless, thoroughly understanding context and movement in video, which is the key component for an effective action identification system and a visual-based smart home ecosystem, remains a challenge. Recently, 3DCNN architectures including SlowFast, have proved to be the proper solution for this issue due to ability to filter spatiotemporal features in video. Additionally, the growth in Natural Language Processing, particularly BERT, has shown the potential of utilizing the Attention Mechanism for extracting temporal relationship of movement throughout a video. We introduce a novel fusing approach aiming to fully exploit the temporal relationship within spatiotemporal features produced by 3DCNN and enhance the efficiency of action identification system for smart home surveillance. The proposed method consists of two models: SlowFast with two distinct ResNet-50 backbones for spatiotemporal features extraction and BERT for aggregating temporal relationship. These models are sequentially stacked using two varieties of fusing techniques: early-ensemble and late-ensemble, constructing a robust unified system with the capability to compete against state-of-the-art modalities. This paper also contribute a new Kinetics51 dataset for our experiment on these mentioned models. The proposed method provides positively high top-1 accuracy for the following datasets: specifically, HMDB-51 dataset, which contains 51 variety of actions, achieves 78.05% using 10-crop testing; Kinetics51, our derived dataset from Kinetics400, achieves 82.53% using 10-crop testing. The performance on challenging action identification datasets HMDB51 and our Kinetics51 has shown the robustness of the mentioned fusing technique applied on two proposed models.}

As one of the most attractive machine learning algorithms, random forest is widely used in many fields. However, the random forest algorithm is computational and resource intensive, especially for large datasets. Therefore, it is not widely used for IoT applications. This paper proposes a flexible and efficient FPGA-based architecture for random forest targeting edge computing platforms where resources and computing power are limited. The architecture allows the number of decision trees in the random forest to be reconfigured for a particular platform. To improve the systemâs performance based on this architecture, we design a pipeline decision tree processor to compute decision trees that are the main components of the random forest algorithm. Although we target and build our experiments with FPGA-based edge computing platforms, the Kria KV260 and PYNQ-Z2, our system achieves throughput speed-ups by up to 28.37\nÃ\nand 13.11\nÃ\nwhen compared to an Intel core i7 processor, respectively. Furthermore, our system in the two edge computing platforms is energy-efficiency also when it consumes 3.721\nÎ¼\nJPS (\nÎ¼\n-joule per sample) and 3.328\nÎ¼\nJPS for the PYNQ-Z2 and Kria KV260 platforms, respectively.}

Compared to traditional networks, SDN separates the control and data planes for efficient domain-wide traffic routing and management. The controllers in the control plane are responsible for programming data plane forwarding devices, while the top layer, the application plane, enforces policies and programs the network. The different levels of the SDN use interfaces for communication. However, SDN faces challenges with traffic distribution, such as load imbalance, which can negatively affect the network performance. Consequently, developers have developed various SDN load-balancing solutions to enhance SDN effectiveness. In addition, researchers are considering the potential of implementing some artificial intelligence (AI) approaches into SDN to improve network resource usage and overall performance due to the fast growth of the AI field. This survey focuses on the following: Firstly, analyzing the SDN architecture and investigating the problem of load balancing in SDN. Secondly, categorizing AI-based load balancing methods and thoroughly assessing these mechanisms from various perspectives, such as the algorithm/technique employed, the tackled problem, and their strengths and weaknesses. Thirdly, summarizing the metrics utilized to measure the effectiveness of these techniques. Finally, identifying the trends and challenges of AI-based load balancing for future research.}

Since machine learning and Internet-of-Things have been in the spotlight, many deep learning-based approaches have been proposed, achieving very good performance using inertial data. In this study, we explore different joint timeâfrequency representations of the sensor data, in conjunction with a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to implement activity classification. We also consider the concurrent use of two different data representations in a cooperative bi-stream ConvNet configuration. Scaling of joint timeâfrequency representation is explored to reduce the ConvNet model size, and hence the computational complexity of the proposed approach. The classification performance and energy efficiency of the proposed method are evaluated on a real-world public HAR dataset. The performance of pairwise combinations and also, the single-stream of the two prominent representations in the joint timeâfrequency domain are compared to that of the state-of-the-art. The proposed method is implemented on Googleâs Edge TPU platform to investigate the trade-off between the energy footprint and classification performance, which is critical in IoT applications where machine learning inference needs to be performed on resource-constrained edge devices. The highest overall classification accuracy and F1 score achieved by our method was 98.39% and 96.86%, respectively, which represents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), a huge amount of data is being produced which requires processing. Usually, Cloud computing provides the resources for processing such requests. However, cloud has limitations in terms of latency and security. To overcome, Fog computing came into existence to complement cloud wherein the consolidation of Fog and Cloud computing substantially improves the Quality of Service (QoS). Due to inherent heterogeneity in the Cloud and Fog nodes, selecting an appropriate node becomes a complex task which requires utmost attention. Fog nodes have minimal and limited resources with a thin processing capacity. To utilize the fog nodes optimally, a secure two-step service placement framework has been proposed in this work. The framework consists of the classification of services to decide on the appropriate tier (Cloud/Fog) followed by the scheduling of the services at the Fog tier. For classification, a machine learning based improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference model (ANFIS) is implemented, which predicts the suitable computing tier. Further, a novel metaheuristic-based hybrid algorithm that integrates a chaotic-based grasshopper (CGOA) with genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for scheduling at the Fog tier. Basic GOA suffers from several shortcomings, such as falling into local minima, slow convergence, high time complexity, etc. The concept of chaos theory and opposition-based learning is incorporated into GOA to overcome this. The performance of the proposed model has been analysed on the Google trace data set, and its effectiveness has been studied on makespan, computational cost, and energy dissipation of the network where it yields respectively 9.2%, 4.25% and 2.75% average better results than state of art.}

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a high volume of sophisticated cyber-attacks leading to financial instability and privacy breaches. This reveals the need for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that is more robust, effective, and capable of learning complex relations of network flows. Existing machine learning approaches are barely effective for picking new attacks in IoT traffic, primarily due to treating flows independently. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity due to their ability to model underlying topology in the form of nodes and edges. We propose a GNN-based NIDS that maximizes the possibility of involving structural characteristics of normal and malicious network traffic. We construct a multi-edged graph structure that captures full communication between any pair of IoT nodes at the edge level. This novel GNN model combines the benefits of spectral and spatial GNNs tailored to process and learn from complex multigraph-structured information. The proposed GNN model is adjusted to work on multi-edges and multi-dimensional edge features. Extensive experimental analysis using evaluation metrics is carried out on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the competence of our proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art GNN models. Our proposed model shows about 2% to 5% improvement in accuracy, precision, F1 and recall offering less training time and model size in the considered datasets. The proposed model has achieved high accuracy ranging from 98.91% to 99.96%, with precision ranging from 98.86 to 99.96, recall ranging from 98.91% to 99.96%, and F1-score ranging from 98.74% to 99.95% in the four benchmark datasets.}

	abstract = {With the rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the need for robust security measures to detect and report potential threats is becoming more urgent. In this paper, we propose a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), as a security measure, for large-scale IoT NetFlow-based networks. The proposed NIDS employs Machine Learning (ML) boosted by a modified version of the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) to determine the most suitable set of features. The selected seven features are used to train several ML models, including Random Forest and Extra Trees. Our research utilized four large datasets, released in 2021, containing IoT traffic data represented in a standard set of 43 NetFlow-based features. Reducing the number of features from 43 to 7 enhanced the prediction time and, consequently, the performance in the real world. Interestingly, the proposed NIDS exhibited a very accurate and robust detection model for IoT NetFlow data, which can be generalized for other Intrusion Detection datasets. Our proposed NIDS achieved up to 99% and 98% accuracy for binary and multi-classification, respectively. These scores were similar to those achieved by the state-of-the-art systems despite decreasing the number of utilized features by up to 84%.}

	abstract = {This paper discusses the design and development of cyberâphysical, social systems using a set of guidelines that capture the conceptual and technical characteristics of such systems. These guidelines are packaged into a framework that resorts to the concept of artifact. Because of these characteristics, the frameworkâs artifacts are specialized into 3 types referred to as data, thing, and social, all connected together through a set of situational relations referred to as work-with-me, work-for-me, back-me, and avoid-me. To mitigate conflicts blue that could arise because of artifactsâ respective time availabilities when they jointly participate in situational relations, policies are put in place defining who does what, when, where, and why. To demonstrate the technical doability of the multi-type artifact framework, a system capturing cyber, physical, and social interactions in a healthcare case-study is developed, deployed, and evaluated.}

	abstract = {The concept of cryptocurrencies is prevalently used in the financial world. Some of the currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown promising outputs. The scalability problem of these cryptocurrencies is an ongoing challenge, solved through many facets. Bitcoin Lightning Network, a Layer-2 solution to Bitcoin Network, is an off-chain crypto transaction platform working on payment channels to transact bi-directionally between two parties. When the maximum payments flow is unidirectional, the individual balances of the parties in the direction of payment get exhausted. It results in the transaction failing for future payments in that direction and lowers the feasibility of network usage. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-based distributed solution by preserving the privacy and anonymity of the parties involved in the rebalancing procedure and improving the fund transfer capability of the channels. The rebalancing mechanism has a global solution that can rebalance to the maximum extent and a local solution using a significantly lower fee. Again the indirect and direct rebalancing schemes balance the imbalanced channel and prevent further transaction failure and closure of channels due to insufficient balance. The resultant method also has an updation in the HTLC message exchange protocol to avoid the Flood and Loot attack that may arise to maintain the safe state of every honest participant in the network.}

	abstract = {IoT infrastructures have been growing in recent years across a variety of industrial applications in sustainable smart cities and communities, including smart manufacturing and smart industries. Infrastructure geared towards Internet of Things also includes Cyber-Physical System (CPS). With a distributed environment, CPS has experienced significant success in industrial applications and critical infrastructure. However, there are numerous difficulties in such an environment, including those related to scalability, centralization, communication latency, and security and privacy. Deep residual squeeze and excitation network (DRSEN) with Single Candidate Optimizer-based IoT-oriented infrastructure is used in this manuscript to address these challenges. Blockchain creates a distributed environment for CPS's communication phase, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) establishes protocols for data forwarding in network. At the application layer of suggested infrastructure, a deep learning-based cloud is used to address communication latency, centralization, and scalability issues. It makes high-performance, affordable computing resources available for smart city applications like smart industrial and smart transportation. The proposed method is implemented in ns-3 tool and the effectiveness is assessed using F-measure, reliability, scalability, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The proposed method provides 35.39%, 23.87% and 20.67% higher reliability, 42.39%, 11.39%, 34.16% and 25.78% higher accuracy, 15.02%, 26.64% and 37.55% higher F-measure compared with existing techniques like Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain Secure Device Authentication Solution (IIoT-BC-BASA), Industrial Internet of things based on Blockchain- InterPlanetary File System (IIoT-BC-IPFS), Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain- Shamir Threshold Cryptography (IIoT-BC-SHC), Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain- software Define Networking (IIoT-BC-SDN) methods, respectively.}

	abstract = {Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in cognitive functions and behavioral problems. Due to its importance, in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT), where physical objects are connected to the internet, a myriad of systems have been proposed to support people with dementia, their caregivers, and medical experts. However, the vast and increasing number of research efforts has led to a complex state of the art, which is in need of a methodological analysis and a characterization of its key aspects. Based on the PRISMA guidelines, this article presents a systematic review aimed at investigating the state of the art of the IoT in dementia regardless of the dementia category and/or its cause. Articles published within the period of January 2017 to November 2022 were searched in well-known scientific databases. The searches retrieved a total of 2733 records, which were narrowed down to 104 relevant studies by applying inclusion, exclusion, and quality criteria. A set of 13 research questions at the intersection of IoT and dementia were posed, which guided the analysis of the selected studies. The systematic review contributes (i) an in-depth methodological analysis of recent and relevant IoT systems in the domain of dementia; (ii) a taxonomy that identifies, characterizes, and categorizes key aspects of IoT research focused on dementia; and (iii) a series of future work directions to advance the field of IoT in the dementia domain.}

	abstract = {With the rapid integration of Intelligent Computing and Internet of Things technology (IoT), Iot sensor network devices are expected not only gather signal but also handle data computing. However, the intrinsic shortcomings of IoT devices on limited computing capacity and battery energy are the bottlenecks. Recently, Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) integrated with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides an effective method for energy and computing resource allocation of IoT devices. However,the offloading ratio strategy and computing and energy resources allocation problems are challenging because the coupling of WPT and MEC, especially when the cost of feedback cannot be ignored. In this paper, we consider simultaneous power transfer and wireless information (SWIPT) strategy for an MEC powered IoT network, which allows the hybrid access point (HAP) to transfer energy by the feedback signal so that IoT devices can capture energy and receive feedback data simultaneously Firstly,the WP-MEC network model, local computation model and computation offloading model of the edge wireless devices (WDs) were built. Secondly, the causal relationship among computational rate ,network channel gain, energy transmission time and transmission power of HAP, CPU computing cycle frequency of WDs and offloading ratio allocation of local computing tasks were analyzed. Then,the above resource allocation problem was modeled as a non-convex problem and was decomposed into two convex sub-problems of offloading ratio strategy and computing and energy allocation. Finally, an alternative optimization methods were proposed to solve these two sub-problems in a sequential and the optimal solution was derived. The proposed algorithm and strategy were effective with the simulation results.}
