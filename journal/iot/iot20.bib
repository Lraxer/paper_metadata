	abstract = {The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely studied in smart home networks, smart city networks, smart grid systems, autonomous driving systems, and smart healthcare systems. In IoT, the IEEE 802.11n wireless local-area network (WLAN) is used as a common communication technology due to its flexibility and low cost. Then, the high performance WLAN is required to enhance quality of service (QoS) of large-scale IoT applications connecting a number of devices or sensors allocated in wide areas. WLAN can use the limited number of partially overlapping channels (POCs) at 2.4 GHz band. The WLAN performance can be degraded by interfered signals from other WLANs. Then, to optimize the POC assignment by reducing interferences, we have proposed the throughput drop estimation model for concurrently communicating multiple links under interferences. Unfortunately, the 40 MHz channel bonding (CB) and the 20 MHz non-CB are considered separately, while the transmission power is always fixed to the maximum. In this paper, we study the throughput drop estimation model under coexistence of CB and non-CB while the transmission power is changed. Then, we present its application to the joint optimization of assigning the transmission power, the frequency channel, and the channel bonding to enhance the throughput performance of IEEE 802.11n WLAN. For evaluations, we compare estimated throughputs by the model with measured ones in various network topologies to verify the model accuracy. Then, we apply the model to the joint assignment optimization in them, and confirm the effectiveness through simulations and experiments using the testbed system.}

	abstract = {The development of smart cities through digital communications has improved citizens' quality of life and well-being. In these cities, IoT technology generates vast amounts of data at any given time, which is analyzed to provide services to citizens. In the proper implementation of these cities, a critical challenge is the violation of citizens' privacy and security, which leads to a lack of trust and pessimism toward the services of the smart city. To ensure citizens' participation, smart city developers should adequately protect their security and privacy from gaining their trust. If citizens don't want to participate, the main benefits of a smart city will be lost. This article presents a comprehensive review of smart city security issues and privacy. It provides a basis for categorizing current and future developments in this area and developing a thematic classification to highlight the requirements and security strategies for designing a smart and safe city. The paper identifies current security and privacy solutions and describes open research challenges and issues. An output of this study is a systematic map of literature on the subject that identifies critical concepts, evidence, challenges, solutions, and gaps. It summarizes the findings into a body of evidence that has previously been heterogeneous and complex.}

	abstract = {Cognitive radio (CR) is a rising technology that unlocks the doors for radio spectrum scarcity problem, which is of great concern nowadays among the researchers at various levels. CR enables to unlicensed users or secondary users (SUs) to access the primary channels when licenced users or primary users (PUs) are not using these channels. Two fundamental access methods namely overlay and underlay are very popular in utilizing the free available channels or the white spaces. Various hybrid access methods have been proposed and recommended by many researchers to further enhance the radio spectrum utilization. Of course hybrid access methods are the better ways to deal this spectrum scarcity problem, but a comprehensive and directed effort is required to optimize the modality of these methods. This work proposes a Markov chain based hybrid access method named as Hybrid Spectrum Utilization Technique (HSUT), which tries to maximize the radio spectrum utilization by enhancing the PU’s detection probability. This work also analyzes the performance of the HSUT and results obtained through OMNeT++ simulator are very encouraging. At last, this work also compares the performance of the HSUT with the overlay, underlay, Hybrid-P1 (Dhurandher et al., 2021), and the Hybrid-P2 (Dhurandher et al., 2021) access methods.}

	abstract = {Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users’ daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.}

	abstract = {Opportunistic IoT (OppIoT) networks are a branch of IoT where the human and machines collaborate to form a network for sharing data. The broad spectrum of devices and ad-hoc nature of connections, further alleviate the problem of network and data security. Traditional approaches like trust based approaches or cryptographic approaches fail to preemptively secure these networks. Machine learning (ML) approaches, mainly deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods can prove to be very effective in ensuring the security of the network as they are profoundly capable of solving complex and dynamic problems. Deep Q-learning (DQL) incorporates deep neural network in the Q learning process for dealing with high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a routing approach for OppIoT, DQNSec, based on DQL for securing the network against attacks viz. sinkhole, hello flood and distributed denial of service attack. The actor–critic approach of DQL is utilized and OppIoT is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Extensive simulations prove the efficiency of DQNSec in comparison to other ML based routing protocols, viz. RFCSec, RLProph, CAML and MLProph.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the use of neural network pruning for transfer learning applications for more resource-efficient inference. The goal is to focus and optimize a neural network on a smaller specialized target task. With the advent of IoT, we have seen an immense increase in AI-based applications on mobile and embedded devices, such as wearables and other smart appliances. However, with the ever-increasing complexity and capabilities of machine learning algorithms, this push to the edge has led to new challenges due to the constraints imposed by the limited availability of resources on these devices. Some form of compression is needed to allow for state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to run on edge devices. In this work, we adapt existing neural network pruning methods to allow them to specialize networks to only focus on a subset of what they were originally trained for. This is a transfer learning use-case where we optimize large pre-trained networks. This differs from standard optimization techniques by allowing the network to forget certain concepts and allow the network’s footprint to be even smaller. We compare different pruning criteria, including one from the field of Explainable AI (XAI), to determine which technique allows for the smallest possible network while maintaining high performance on the target task. Our results show the benefits of using network specialization when executing neural networks on embedded devices both with and without GPU acceleration.}

	abstract = {Message dropping by intermediate nodes as well as RF jamming attack have been studied widely in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate a new type of attack in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) defined as Beacon Non-Transmission (BNT) attack in which attacker is not an intermediate vehicle, but rather a source vehicle. In BNT attack, a vehicle suppresses the transmissions of its own periodic beacon packets to get rid of the automated driving misbehavior detection protocols running in ITS, or to mount a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack to cripple the traffic management functionality of ITS. Considering BNT attack as a critical security threat to ITS, we propose two novel and lightweight techniques to detect it. Our first technique bases its detection by assuming a certain distribution of the number of beacons lost from a vehicle while accounting for loss due to channel-error. However, it fails to classify shortish BNT attacks wherein amount of denial and channel-error loss are comparable. Our second technique, suitable for identifying both shortish and longish BNT attacks, considers beacon loss pattern of a vehicle as a time-series data and employs autocorrelation function (ACF) to determine the existence of an attack. In order to trade-off detection accuracy for equitable use of limited computational resources, we propose a random inspection model in which the detection algorithm is executed at random time instances and for randomly selected set of vehicles. We have performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of proposed detection algorithms under random inspection and a practical attacker model. The results obtained corroborate the lightweight nature of both techniques, and the efficacy of ACF based technique over simple threshold based technique in terms of higher detection accuracy as well as smaller reaction delay.}

For example, it can be due to abnormal events, IoT sensor faults, or malicious manipulation of data generated from IoT devices. There has been wide-scale research done on anomaly detection problems in general, i.e., finding the samples in data that differ significantly from the expected values. However, there has been limited work done to figure out the inherent cause of the anomalies in IoT sensor data. Accordingly, once an abnormal data sample has been observed, the challenge of detecting whether the anomaly is due to an abnormal event or IoT sensor data manipulation by an attacker has not been explored in detail.}

	abstract = {Due to the customers’ growing interest in using various intelligent and connected devices, we are surrounded by the Internet of Things (IoT). It is estimated that the number of IoT devices will exceed 60 billion by 2025. One of the primary reasons for such rapid growth is the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved into an emerging concept in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that integrates VANETs and the IoT to enhance their capabilities. With the emergence of IoV and the interest shown by customers, Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) are likely to be widely deployed in the near future. However, for this to happen, wide participation of vehicle owners in VANET is needed. The primary concerns of vehicle owners to participate in VANET are privacy and security. In this paper, we present a Certificateless and REused-pseudonym based Authentication Scheme for Enabling security and privacy (CREASE) in VANETs. One of the ways to preserve the privacy of vehicles/drivers is to allow vehicles/drivers to use pseudo identities (pseudonyms) instead of their real identities (such as VIN number or driving license number) in all communications. The pseudonym used by a vehicle needs to be changed frequently to prevent the vehicle from being tracked. Our scheme uses Merkle Hash Tree and Modified Merkle Patricia Trie to efficiently store and manage the pseudonyms assigned to a vehicle. This enables a vehicle to pick and use a random pseudonym from a given set of pseudonyms assigned to it as well as change its pseudonym frequently and securely to ensure privacy. Unlike many of the existing schemes, our scheme does not use certificates and certificate revocation lists for authentication. Moreover, it allows vehicles to get a set of pseudonyms only once from the trusted authority. We present a formal proof of correctness of our scheme and also compare our scheme with some of the other contemporary schemes to show the effectiveness of our scheme.}

This paper proposes a prototype PPE access monitoring system which combines smart PPE and an indoor/outdoor personnel location monitoring system. The paper also proposes a generic framework to be used for smart gateway services within a manufacturing site to augment and enable smart PPE, separating areas of high and low risk. The prototype automated PPE detection gate presents a practical use of the framework and demonstrates a suitable method for assessing workforce/visitor PPE compliance. Its secondary function is to act as a location waypoint system to support other location tracking methods, identified in the literature and throughout the testing protocol. The system could be further adapted to support augmented personnel within the Operator 4.0 paradigm to improve site safety, monitoring and control.}

	abstract = {Fog computing has been proposed as a mechanism to address certain issues in cloud computing such as latency, storage, network bandwidth, etc. Fog computing brings the processing, storage, and networking to the edge of the network near the edge devices, which we called fog consumers. This decreases latency, network bandwidth, and response time. Discovering the most relevant fog node, the nearest one to the fog consumers, is a critical challenge that is yet to be addressed by the research. In this study, we present the Intelligent and Distributed Fog node Discovery mechanism (IDFD) which is an intelligent approach to enable fog consumers to discover appropriate fog nodes in a context-aware manner. The proposed approach is based on the distributed fog registries between fog consumers and fog nodes that can facilitate the discovery process of fog nodes. In this study, the KNN, K-d tree, and brute force algorithms are used to discover fog nodes based on the context-aware criteria of fog nodes and fog consumers. The proposed framework is simulated using OMNET++, and the performance of the proposed algorithms is compared based on performance metrics and execution time. The accuracy and execution time are the major points of consideration in the selection of an optimal fog search algorithm. The experiment results show that the KNN and K-d tree algorithms achieve the same accuracy results of 95%. However, the K-d tree method takes less time to find the nearest fog nodes than KNN and brute force. Thus, the K-d tree is selected as the fog search algorithm in the IDFD to discover the nearest fog nodes very efficiently and quickly.}

We compare and analyze these performance parameters with the previous workstation equipped with NVIDIA Titan X Pascal and an embedded system based on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board to evaluate the inference efficiency of different DNN models using different inference frameworks. The methods of ANOVA are adopted to quantify the differences between the models. A combination method of cluster analysis and regression analysis is proposed to find the similar inference time variation processes across models, which can be used to predict the inference results of unknown models.

	abstract = {The dynamic nature of wireless links and the mobility of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) over fifth-generation (5G) networks (IoT-5G), on the one hand, empowers pervasive healthcare applications. On the other hand, it allows eavesdroppers and other illegitimate actors to access secret information. Due to the poor time efficiency and high computational complexity of conventional cryptographic methods and the heterogeneous technologies used, it is easy to compromise the authentication of lightweight wearable and healthcare devices. Therefore, intelligent authentication, which relies on artificial intelligence (AI), and sufficient network resources are extremely important for securing healthcare devices connected to IoT-5G. This survey considers intelligent authentication and includes a comprehensive overview of intelligent authentication mechanisms for securing IoT-5G devices deployed in the healthcare domain. First, it presents a detailed, thoughtful, and state-of-the-art review of IoT-5G, healthcare technologies, tools, applications, research trends, challenges, opportunities, and solutions. We selected 20 technical articles from those surveyed based on their strong overlaps with IoT, 5G, healthcare, device authentication, and AI. Second, IoT-5G device authentication, radio-frequency fingerprinting, and mutual authentication are reviewed, characterized, clustered, and classified. Third, the review envisions that AI can be used to integrate the attributes of the physical layer and 5G networks to empower intelligent healthcare devices. Moreover, methods for developing intelligent authentication models using AI are presented. Finally, the future outlook and recommendations are introduced for IoT-5G healthcare applications, and recommendations for further research are presented as well. The remarkable contributions and relevance of this survey may assist the research community in understanding the research gaps and the research opportunities relating to the intelligent authentication of IoT-5G healthcare devices.}

	abstract = {As the communication and aviation technology expand, High altitude platform stations (HAPS) are increasingly gaining a wider usage area in modern Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. One of the areas in which HAPS can be effectively utilized is the wide area deployment of sensors that require a costly data acquisition effort in terms of transportation and communication access. Aerial communication using a low-energy technology such as LoRa can provide significant advantages in such scenarios. Our work models and simulates LoRAWAN communication in utilizing HAPS in data acquisition over a large distribution span of IoT devices/sensors. We conduct experiments on various different scenarios including changing number of devices, span area, HAPS speed and LoRa duty cycle to draw conclusions about how each of these parameters affect communication quality. Results of the simulation are used in regression analysis of equation factors to calculate the expected transmission performance under different experimental setups. Our results (and simulation code) can be used to reason about certain properties of IoT deployment (such as sensor count, sensor distribution area, HAPS speed, etc.) before the real deployment is done in LoRaWAN enabled IoT-HAPS communication.}

	abstract = {Undoubtedly, during the last few years, climate change has alerted the research community of the natural environment sector. Furthermore, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has enhanced the research activity in the environmental field by offering low-cost sensors. Moreover, artificial intelligence and more specifically, statistical and machine learning methodologies have proved their predictive power in many disciplines and various real-world problems. As a result of the aforementioned, many scientists in the environmental research field have performed prediction models exploiting the strength of IoT data. Hence, insightful information could be extracted from the review of these research works and for this reason, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is introduced in the present manuscript in order to summarize the recent studies in the field under specific rules and constraints. From the SLR, 54 primary studies have been extracted during 2017–2021. The analysis showed that many IoT-based prediction models have been applied in the previous years to 10 different environmental issues, with promising results in the majority of the primary studies.}

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by frequent cessation of breathing during sleep, which cannot be easily diagnosed at the early stage due to the complexity and labor intensity of the polysomnography (PSG). Using a ECG device for OSA detection provides a convenient solution in the current Internet of Things scenario. However, previous intelligent analysis algorithms mainly rely on single scale network, therefore the discriminative ECG representations cannot be identified, which affects the accuracy of OSA detection. We report a multiscale neural network URNet for OSA detection by optimizing the deep learning networks and integrating Unet with ResNet. The URNet automatically extracts delicate features from the RR interval of single-lead ECG and processes convolution blocks with different scales by skip connections, so that the network can fuse features collected from both shallow and deep levels. For each OSA segment identification, URNet achieves an accuracy of 90.4%, a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 94.8% and an F1 of 89.6% on the Apnea-ECG dataset. The result indicates that our approach provides major improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The URNet model proposed in this study for unobstructive OSA detection has good potential application in daily sleep health.}

Depending on this situation, the density and complexity of cyber threats and attacks are also expanding. The ever-increasing network density makes it difficult for cyber-security professionals to monitor every movement on the network. More frequent and complex cyber-attacks make the detection and identification of anomalies in network events more complex. Machine learning offers various tools and techniques for automating the detection of cyber attacks and for rapid prediction and analysis of attack types. This study discusses the approaches to machine learning methods used to detect attacks. We examined the detection, classification, clustering, and analysis of anomalies in network traffic. We gave the cyber-security focus, machine learning methods, and data sets used in each study we examined. We investigated which feature selection or dimension reduction method was applied to the data sets used in the studies. We presented in detail the types of classification carried out in these studies, which methods were compared with other methods, the performance metrics used, and the results obtained in tables. We examined the data sets of network attacks presented as open access. We suggested a basic taxonomy for cyber attacks. Finally, we discussed the difficulties encountered in machine learning applications used in network attacks and their solutions.}

	abstract = {On the Semantic web, ontologies are thought to be the remedy to data heterogeneity, and correlating ontologies is a highly effective technique. Although the use of representation learning approaches to a variety of applications has showed significant promise, they have had little effect on the issue of ontology matching and classification. In order to establish alignments between two ontologies, this research presents the Multi-Ontology Mapping Generative Adversarial Network in Internet of Things (MOMGANI). For the instance of ontology mapping, we suggest using a two-system representation learning network consisting of a Generator and Discriminator. The Generator applies a probabilistic softmax classifier to the different Name, Label, Comments, Properties, Instance descriptions, concept characteristics, and the neighbourhood concepts for each of the ontology's properties. In order to support the assertions that the Generator has generated, the Discriminator network employs a novel Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM network) with an Ontology Attention mechanism enhanced by the concept's descriptions. As a result, both systems are in a feedback mechanism where they can learn from one another. The system will produce a set of triples that list all the associated concepts from various ontologies as its final product. Domain experts will review these triples outside of the band to ensure that only true concepts and triples are chosen for the alignment. In comparison to using the ontologies separately, the aligned ontology enables extended querying and inference across related ontologies and domains. Considering metrics like recall, precision, and F-measure, the experimental evaluation was performed utilizing the datasets for classes alignment, property alignment, and instances alignment. The proposed architecture provides a recall, precision, and F-measure of 0.92, 0.99, and 0.83 respectively which reveals that this model outperforms the traditional methods.}

Several complex data-driven applications, such as smart cities applications, home automation, health monitoring, etc., have been realized through the existence of these ubiquitous networks of smart objects. The ability to remotely update the devices forming an IoT network is of paramount importance, as it enables adding new functionality in their firmware, either for resolving software bugs and security vulnerabilities or for application re-purposing, without the need to physically access them. In this work, we present a flexible Compilation-as-a-Service and Remote-Programming-as-a-Service platform that jointly offers cloud-based compilation and Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) update functionalities for deployed IoT devices, in a reliable and secure manner. Our system is capable of easily supporting various embedded operating systems and heterogeneous hardware platforms. We describe the system architecture and elaborate on the implementation details of all system components. In addition, we perform an extensive performance evaluation of a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) deployment of our system and discuss results in terms of system response, scalability and resource utilization.}

	abstract = {The rapid deployment of advanced nanogrids which has enabled utility customers to become energy suppliers, the so-called prosumers with power generation capabilities based on distributed energy resources, has raised issues concerning cybersecurity. The use of the internet of things (IoT) as an enabling technology, along with the bidirectional power flow which demands a bidirectional flow of information between the prosumers and the utility, have paved the way to smarter and more efficient nanogrids, hence the name “advanced nanogrid”. Despite the many advantages of this approach, it makes nanogrids subject to cyber-attacks, providing cybercriminals with the possibility of exploiting nanogrid vulnerabilities as never before. This clearly has an economic and physical impact on the nanogrid operation. In this context, this paper aims to develop a framework to identify assets, assess threats, quantify risks and implement protection mechanisms in future nanogrid developments. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a cybersecurity analysis of an experimental testbed of an advanced nanogrid based on a photovoltaic (PV) system and controllable loads. The nanogrid includes a blockchain-based energy purchase/sale system, as well as a weather station that sends climatic measurements through a particular communication protocol. This data is used to provide forecasts for making generation/consumption offers. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out in which a systematic assessment of the protection mechanisms is proposed, so that a trade-off between the costs of implementing security mechanisms and the losses resulting from unwanted intrusions, can be achieved.}

This paper investigates how a cloud-based IoT remote aquatic environmental monitoring platform can be adapted using a fog architectural approach to provide embedded condition assessment and forecasting functionality. An equivalent IoT hydroponic garden water quality monitoring test platform is developed which is capable of accommodating embedded fog models using a node-level microcontroller (i.e., ESP8266). The test platform is deployed in a hydroponics setting to gather environmental data and evaluate the feasibility of fog intelligence functionality on an embedded system. The first model involves a node-level Fuzzy Logic water quality condition assessment using the current sensor readings. The second model is a Support Vector Machine that makes short-term predictions of water quality parameters based on a history of locally stored sensor readings. The third model contrasts Long Short-Term Memory for water quality parameter prediction. The fog test platform and embedded models are evaluated according to performance, functionality and ease-of-implementation on a microcontroller. Finally, we propose a framework detailing the future modifications for the remote aquatic environmental monitoring platform to achieve embedded fog capabilities based on the experience with the hydroponics test platform.}

In this article, we examine how energy consumption by IoT networks may be optimized by solving the network clustering problem using a quantum-inspired metaheuristic based on the firefly algorithm and particle swarm optimization. In this approach, the cluster head selection vector is modeled as an n-Qbit and the algorithm motions are used to explore the space of feasible solutions by rotating the Qbit angles of inadequate solutions to yield new and more advantageous solutions. Simulations performed on networks consisting of 10 –100 nodes show that the proposed method is efficient and offers energy savings reaching 15.48% within acceptable time.}

However, the role and development of XR in the IoT-empowered supply chain scenarios are not revealed. Therefore, this article attempts to introduce readers to the latest XR technologies and summarise significant research opportunities/challenges raised by the current literature to facilitate further interest in this topic. The systematic literature review process analysed 71 research articles from 1,207 relevant publications using text mining models, including the bag of words (BoW) and LexRank algorithms. Consequently, the article synthesises emerging XR solutions for human-cyber-physical interaction to guide the next-generation XR research for logistics and supply chain management. At the same time, human-centricity can be emphasised in future research agendas for Industry 5.0.}

	abstract = {The development of IoT solutions requires the expertise from professionals from several areas. This multidisciplinary aspect can be better served with an integrated process to structure the development of these solutions. There are several software development methodologies, such as Ignite and ELDAMeth, that have been adapted for this end. However, most lack some fundamental functionalities. The Three-Phase Methodology for Project Development (TpM-Pro) was originally developed as an IoT teaching methodology that proved ideal for solution development. It is a generic, agile, interactive, technology-independent and incremental methodology that splits the development of solutions into three distinct phases: Business, Requirements, and Implementation. This segmentation has proved invaluable and can become a standard for IoT solution development. In this paper, we present the TpM-Pro, gauge it against five other methodologies proposed for IoT solution development and detail its application on a corporate IoT project.}

	abstract = {IoT-based crowd-sensing network, which aims to achieve data collection and task allocation to mobile users, become more and more popular in recent years. This data collected by IoT devices may be private and directly transmission of these data maybe incur privacy leakage. With the help of homomorphic encryption (HE), which supports the additive and/or multiplicative operations over the encrypted data, privacy preserving crowd-sensing network is now possible. Until now several such secure data aggregation schemes based on HE have been proposed. In many cases, ciphertext comparison is an important step for further secure data processing. However efficient ciphertext comparison is not supported by most such schemes. In this paper, aiming at enabling ciphertext comparison among multiple users in crowd-sensing network, with Lagrange’s interpolation technique we propose comparable homomorphic encryption (CompHE) schemes. We also prove our schemes’ security, and the performance analysis show our schemes are practical. We also discuss the applications of our IoT based crowd-sensing network with comparable homomorphic encryption for combatting COVID19, including the first example of privacy preserving close contact determination based on the spatial distance, and the second example of privacy preserving social distance controlling based on the spatial difference of lockdown zones, controlled zones and precautionary zones. From the analysis we see our IoT based crowd-sensing network can be used for contact tracing without worrying about the privacy leakage. Compared with the existing CompHE schemes, our proposals can be collusion resistance or secure in the semi-honest model while the previous schemes cannot achieve this easily. Our schemes only need 4 or 5 modular exponentiation when implementing the most important comparison algorithm, which are better than the existing closely related scheme with advantage of 50% or 37.5%.}

	abstract = {Compliance with security requirements in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is known as an important phenomenon in conserving energy consumption due to its dynamic topology. Energy consumption management in WSN can be achieved through secure routing protocols. Authentication, firewall and intrusion detection, and trust management are common ways to provide security on the WSNs. Meanwhile, trust management provides better performance due to ensuring distributed security through collaboration. In this paper, a Trust-Aware Dynamic Routing algorithm based on Extended AODV protocol for secure communications in the WSN (TADR-EAODV) is proposed. TADR-EAODV considers factors such as direct trust, recommended trust, connectivity strength, energy rate and worthiness score to measure the distributed safety level of nodes in routing. We use the AODV protocol for routing work, which is extended through a multi-route routing approach. In addition, a centralized ensemble clustering for node grouping is included in TADR-EAODV, which enables clustering-based routing to enhance WSN performance. Extensive experiments have been performed in the presence of denial-of-service attacks to verify our claims. The experimental results prove that high-performance TADR-EAODV has been able to identify attackers by detecting their anomalous behavior. Besides, TADR-EAODV has improved the average packet transfer rate by 6% to 17% compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms such as LEACH-TM, TAAO-SDTIM and TAOSC-MHR.}

	abstract = {Indoor air pollution is crucial for the building environment as it has a direct impact on human health, prosperity, comfort, and productivity levels. Repeated exposure to toxic materials and harmful chemicals leaves a considerable impact on occupant well-being. The degraded air quality in the indoor environment is closely connected to the rising cases of respiratory health issues, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and a wide spectrum of symptoms. Therefore, it is required to design a reliable system to assess indoor air quality (IAQ) in residential and commercial spaces to improve the health outcomes and productivity levels of the building occupants. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a rigorous design and development approach for the IAQ monitoring system using the Internet of Things-based sensor network. Furthermore, a forecasting model was designed using Adaptive Dynamic Fuzzy Inference System Tree to predict PM2.5 conditions in the target building environment. The performance of the proposed system is tested over multiple datasets obtained from different rural and urban locations; moreover, the findings are further validated against benchmark datasets. The updates about real-time IAQ conditions in the target building environment were made accessible to occupants via an online web portal, and the entire system was named “Vayuveda” – an approach for enhanced air quality in the living spaces. The authors tested multiple methods at every step of the development process and compared performance at each stage to come out with the best model for real-time IAQ assessment.}

The remoteness of IoT end devices from cloud platforms may lead to significant issues for real-time applications such as disaster handling, healthcare application, etc. In order to address these issues, fog computing is a new platform with specialized features that perform essential IoT data management and real-time application management tasks. Data management in IoT via fog computing is critical for decreasing latency in real-time IoT applications and is needed to produce more professional knowledge and smart decisions. Reduction in the size of data sent to the cloud layer is a fundamental topic in data management on the fog computing platform. In this paper, to select and survey studies about data size reduction in fog computing, we applied the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process to comprehend and classify the different topics and related approaches in this field. In addition, the studies presented in the edge computing field, which were close to our goal, were also investigated. The primary purpose of this study is to classify and analyze the fog data reduction (FDR) studies published between 2016 and 2022. The topics and related approaches of selected papers are presented in an approach-based taxonomy. The topics of provided taxonomy include data filtering, data compression, data aggregation, data prediction, data pattern recognition, and general facets and related approaches. Finally, open issues for FDR and relevant main challenges are presented in upcoming research.}

Analytical models for computing Average Symbol Error Probability (ASEP) based on an Optimal Power Splitting Scheme (OPSS) for Scenario-1 and Joint Optimal Power Splitting Scheme (JOPSS) for Scenario-2 are presented by considering the effects of relay location. Moreover, an Adaptive Power Splitting Scheme (APSS) is suggested based on instantaneous Symbol Error Probability (SEP) under instantaneous channel conditions. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results show that APSS performs better as compared to OPSS under given conditions.}

	abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) networks are vulnerable to security attacks targeting data integrity and service availability. To successfully operate in emerging automated highway systems (AHS), securing communications among the AVs and with the transportation infrastructure is paramount. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the foremost defense artifact against malicious AV activities. However, individual IDS on board of the AV may not be sufficient enough against diverse and increasingly emerging new threats. In addition, not all security vendors synchronize their update of new IDS security features. Therefore, the collaboration among individual IDSs of AVs enables the vehicles to benefit from the collective knowledge and information of their neighbors and achieve more accurate intrusion detection. This paper presents a hierarchical framework for a Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network (CIDN) that allows the AV platoons to share detection knowledge based on trust and increase the accuracy of their individual IDS. The proposed CIDN involves intra-platoon and inter-platoon collaborations to improve scalability. The experimental results show that collaborative IDSs yield higher accuracy than individual IDSs in detecting misbehaviors in AV networks while achieving scalability.}

	abstract = {Modernization and technological advancement have made smart and convenient living environments, including smart houses and smart cities, possible, by combining the Internet of Things (IoT), data, and internet-based services over various communication protocols. IoT is the next generation of the Internet. However, commonly resource-constraint IoT devices that are designed to perform a specific purpose, impose new security challenges, including node forgery, unauthorized access of data, and denial of services. They are more susceptible to being compromised by adversaries as opposed to general-purpose computing devices, and are exposed to different kinds of attacks, including spoofing and botnet attacks. Device identification is one of the promising approaches for improving network security. Devices can be identified either using explicit identifiers (internet protocol/media access control addresses) or implicit identifiers (network traffic and radio signal features), with implicit identifiers being more reliable, robust, and secure for device fingerprinting (DFP). In this paper, DFP methods have been studied in detail, with features generated from their communication traffic characteristics, including network traffic traces, IEEE 802.11 MAC frames, and radio signals, discussed. Additionally, key limitations and research challenges have been studied in the context of the IoT paradigm. Research challenges within the context of DFP and the future of IoT technologies are also discussed to shape future directions of work in the area. The key contribution of this study is the identification of different DFP research scopes in the domain of the IoT paradigm, which can be designed and implemented toward the development of IoT network security.}

	abstract = {With the popularization of surveillance cameras, public-safety related applications requiring the functionality of video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) thrive. Re-ID aims at accurately identifying a person-of-interest across video sequences from multiple cameras. Existing methods usually focus on either spatially salient regions, or temporal features among frames of fixed intervals (i.e., either short- or long-term temporal features), resulting in the under-utilization of neglected features and hence moderate identification accuracy. To achieve high Re-ID accuracy, we propose a novel framework termed Multi-granular Spatial–Temporal Network (MSTN), that facilitates full utilization of spatial–temporal features for video-based person Re-ID. Within MSTN, a Temporal Kernel Attention (TKA) module is proposed to adaptively capture both short- and long-term temporal relationships; a Feature Disentanglement Spatial Attention (FDSA) module is further proposed to mine spatially salient and subtle features. Extensive experiments on the MARS dataset demonstrate that MSTN can achieve high identification accuracy, exhibiting 86.1% in terms of mAP and 91.0% in terms of Rank-1, notably higher than state-of-the-art comparison schemes.}

The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge/cloud computing, 5G networks, big data analytics, and other emerging technologies in IoT systems is leading to the emergence of Smart Systems that support devices to make autonomous decisions in order to improve and facilitate people’s lives. These smart IoT devices produce a huge amount of sensitive data. Thus, establishing Trust between these devices is vital to ensure the security of the sensed data and for the normal functionality of smart systems. To address these challenges, several Trust establishment protocols have been proposed, but they have some limitations such as centralization, the need for human intervention, and the lack of adaptability to smart devices with computation and storage constraints. In this paper, a decentralized trust establishment protocol is proposed for smart IoT devices and is applicable for different scenarios. The protocol provides decentralized identity management, mutual authentication, access control, and secure communication by combining Blockchain technology with PV-SAS-MCA message cross-authentication protocol based on Short Authenticated Strings (SAS). To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to propose a new approach that uses Blockchain as an extra distributed and authenticated channel to exchange Short Authenticated Strings without physical interaction. This helps to allow entities in the Smart IoT environment not only to identify each other but also to exchange their public keys in a secure manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure communications with significantly smaller key sizes and lower computation overhead. Experimental results reveal that the time required to complete the authentication process is less than 90 ms which is a superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art decentralized authentication mechanisms.}

Due to their self-learning skills, smart homes can learn homeowners' schedules and adapt accordingly to make adjustments. Since convenience and cost savings is necessary in such an environment, and there are multiple devices involved, there is a need to analyze power consumption in smart homes. Moreover, increased energy consumption leads to an increase in carbon footprint, elevates the risk of climate, and leads to increased demand in supply. Hence, monitoring energy consumption is crucial. In this paper, we perform an overall analysis of energy consumption in smart homes by deploying machine learning models. We rely on machine learning techniques, like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for predicting the power consumption of multiple datasets. We also propose a DT-RF-XGBoost-based Ensemble Model for analyzing the consumption and comparing it with the baseline algorithms. The evaluation parameters used in the study are Mean Square Error (MSE), R-squared (R2,), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), respectively. The study has been performed on multiple datasets and our study shows that the proposed DT-RF-XG-based Ensemble Model outperforms all the other baseline algorithms for multiple datasets with R2 around 0.99.}

	abstract = {Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) using wirelessly-connected buried sensors enable smart agriculture through real-time soil sensing, timely decision-making, and precise remote operation. Energy harvesting technology is adopted in WUSNs, implying wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), to prolong the network lifetime. In addition, the backscatter communication (BSC) technology seems promising for improving the utilization of resources and network throughput according to preliminary studies in terrestrial wireless-powered communication networks. However, this technique has not yet been investigated in WPUSNs, where channel impairments are incredibly severe. In this work, we aim to assess BSC’s performance in WPUSNs and evaluate its feasibility for sustainable smart agriculture. For this, we first conceptualize a multi-user backscatter-assisted WPUSN (BS-WPUSN), where a set of energy-constrained underground sensors (USs) backscatter and/or harvest the radio frequency energy emitted by an above-ground power source before the sensed data are transmitted to a nearby above-ground access point. Then, we formulate the optimal time allocation to maximize the network throughput while assuring real-world users’ quality of service (QoS). Our analysis considers the non-linearities of practical energy harvesting circuits and severe signal attenuation in underground channels. By simulating a realistic farming scenario, we show that our proposed solution outperforms two baseline schemes, i.e., underground harvest-then-transmit and underground BSC, by an average of 12% and 358% increase in network throughput (when USs are buried at 0.35 m), respectively. Additionally, several trade-offs between the network throughput, time allocation, network configurations, and underground parameters are identified to facilitate the practical implementation of BS-WPUSNs.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has become a key choice for distributed machine learning. Initially focused on centralized aggregation, recent works in FL have emphasized greater decentralization to adapt to the highly heterogeneous network edge. Among these, Hierarchical, Device-to-Device and Gossip Federated Learning (HFL, D2DFL & GFL respectively) can be considered as foundational FL algorithms employing fundamental aggregation strategies. A number of FL algorithms were subsequently proposed employing multiple fundamental aggregation schemes jointly. Existing research, however, subjects the FL algorithms to varied conditions and gauges the performance of these algorithms mainly against Federated Averaging (FedAvg) only. This work consolidates the FL landscape and offers an objective analysis of the major FL algorithms through a comprehensive cross-evaluation for a wide range of operating conditions. In addition to the three foundational FL algorithms, this work also analyzes six derived algorithms. To enable a uniform assessment, a multi-FL framework named FLAGS: Federated Learning AlGorithms Simulation has been developed for rapid configuration of multiple FL algorithms. Our experiments indicate that fully decentralized FL algorithms achieve comparable accuracy under multiple operating conditions, including asynchronous aggregation and the presence of stragglers. Furthermore, decentralized FL can also operate in noisy environments and with a comparably higher local update rate. However, the impact of extremely skewed data distributions on decentralized FL is much more adverse than on centralized variants. The results indicate that it may not be necessary to restrict the devices to a single FL algorithm; rather, multi-FL nodes may operate with greater efficiency.}

	abstract = {Structure health monitoring is a general term used to describe the process of assessing the civil structure status and detecting and/or identifying any damage that occurs in the structure under monitoring. This work presents the design and operation of a synchronized structural health monitoring system that utilizes the internet of things technology. The proposed system consists of leaf nodes, a central node, and a monitoring server. The system utilizes two different wireless technologies to efficiently transfer the data and eliminate the need of fixed network infrastructure. The leaf nodes collect the acceleration signals from specific points on the structure using synchronized accelerometer sensors and send these signals to the central node using short range wireless communication protocol. The sampling process of different sensors is synchronized using an accurate timing signal from the global positioning system and an accurate external clock. The central node gathers the signals and relays them to a remote server using long range cellular internet connectivity. At the server, different damage detection and identification techniques are applied on the received data to assess the status of the structure. We provide details about the proposed system design and operation including the hardware and software parts. The different damage detection and identification techniques are considered and compared for predicting structural damage. Moreover, practical experiments are carried out, in which a five-story building model and real plane truss bridge are used to test the system. The results show the feasibility of the proposed synchronized system in automating the change in stiffness and mass by monitoring the dynamic behavior.}
