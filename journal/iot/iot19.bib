	abstract = {Requiring low dissemination delays and thorough vehicles coverage in the vicinity of an emergency event, Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) were considered as the most adapted communication network to support alert messages dissemination. With the advent of Cooperative ITS services, emerging vehicular networks are expected to increasingly rely on Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication links, which are expected to be nominally available, with some transient and time-limited connectivity losses. The presence of V2I links paves the way to centralized network control, which can leverage vehicle-related and contextual information provided by the cloud to make more informed decisions. This paper proposes an effective alert message dissemination procedure called LAMD (Location-based Alert Messages Dissemination) for emerging vehicular networks that combines V2I broadcasts with selected V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) rebroadcasts. The originality of our scheme lies in the selection process of V2V rebroadcasts, which is based on vehicles’ location regarding predefined rebroadcast points selected by a centralized controller. This leads to very limited collisions, low delivery delays, and high information coverage with insignificant signaling and network overhead compared to legacy VANET based dissemination techniques.}

	abstract = {Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technique to increase both the channel capacity and the number of users that can be served simultaneously. One of the main challenges related to the deployment of such systems is the complexity of the transceiver processing. Although the conventional optimization algorithms are able to provide excellent performance, they generally require considerable computational complexity, which gets in the way of their practical application in real-time systems. In contrast to existing work, we study a DL-based transceiver design scheme for a downlink MIMO broadcasting channel (MIMO BC) system, which consists of a base station (BS) serving multi-users. The objective of this work is to maximize the sum-rate of all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter and receivers under the total power constraint, while suppressing interference as much as possible. Due to the inter-user interference in such system, the considered problem is nonconvex and NP-hard. Different from traditional optimization algorithms, we rely on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to optimize the transceivers in an adaptive way. In the proposed scheme, we develop an unsupervised learning strategy, where a loss function is constructed innovatively for reducing the inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the inter-user interference is reduced effectively by our proposed CNN-based transceiver optimization method.}

	abstract = {Autonomic computing investigates how systems can achieve (user) specified “control” outcomes on their own, without the intervention of a human operator. Autonomic computing fundamentals have been substantially influenced by those of control theory for closed and open-loop systems. In practice, complex systems may exhibit a number of concurrent and inter-dependent control loops. Despite research into autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g., multiple resources within a data centre), research into integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve resource autonomy and performance at scale continues to be a fundamental challenge. The integration of AI/ML to achieve such autonomic and self-management of systems can be achieved at different levels of granularity, from full to human-in-the-loop automation. In this article, leading academics, researchers, practitioners, engineers, and scientists in the fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, and quantum computing join to discuss current research and potential future directions for these fields. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging AI and ML in next generation computing for emerging computing paradigms, including cloud, fog, edge, serverless and quantum computing environments.}

This factor is responsible for the substantial increase in the current volume of data generated by IoT devices. The large volume of data generated by IoT sensors can lead to unusual demands on cloud storage and data transmission bandwidths. A suitable approach to address these issues is through data compression approaches. This article presents a systematic review of the literature on lossy data compression algorithms that allows the systems to reduce the data detected by IoT devices. Lossy algorithms have a good compression ratio, preserving data quality and minimizing compression errors. A taxonomy was proposed from the review results, and the main works were classified, analyzed, and discussed.}

However, most solutions use proprietary software, which is costly and do not provide online monitoring, hampering data access and hindering preventive actions. This article presents LimnoStation, a low-cost integrated hardware and software solution that employs IoT concepts with LoRaWan, whose main objective is to monitor environmental and oceanographic data from surface and submerged sensors, which can be accessed online and has low-power consumption. Long-distance transmission tests were performed analyzing battery consumption and readings taken by the LimnoStation sensors. The results show that the average error of sensor readings was 0.51%, with a battery life of more than 2900 days and costing about 100 times less compared to commercial sensors. The evaluation of the LimnoStation showed that it is viable not only for academic use, but also as a replacement for presenting lower cost, high reliability, greater integration, and more functionality than most solutions found on the market.}

Previously, we proposed a method for detecting malicious PE files using printable characters using two language models for feature extraction and machine-learning. In this study, we evaluated the method using the latest FFRI dataset consisting of 400,000 benign and 400,000 malicious samples between 2019 and 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider the time series of both malicious and benign samples. According to the results, specific tokens in the printable characters were effective in detecting the latest malicious PE files. The most practical combination was of the Doc2vec and multilayer perceptron, which achieved an F1 score of 0.981. Each run time showed an almost linear increase with increasing dataset size.}

To address the ultra-high reliability and ultra-low power communication requirements of IIoT networks, Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) behavioral mode has been introduced in IEEE 802.15.4e standard. Scheduling the packet transmissions in IIoT networks is a difficult task owing to the limited resources and dynamic topology. In IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH, the design of the schedule is open to implementation. In this paper, we propose a phasic policy gradient (PPG) based TSCH schedule learning algorithm. We construct the utility function that accounts for the throughput, and energy efficiency of the TSCH network. The proposed PPG based scheduling algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of totally distributed and totally centralized deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling algorithms by employing the actor–critic policy gradient method that learns the scheduling algorithm in two phases, namely policy phase and auxiliary phase. In this method, we show that the schedule converges quickly compared to any other actor–critic method and also improves the system throughput performance by 58% compared to the minimal scheduling function, a default TSCH schedule.}

Given the openness of the wireless environment, the security and confidentiality of uRLLC are of utmost important. Since traditional cryptography methods often feature significant complex designs and processing delays, physical layer security (PLS) technologies exploiting the inherent properties of the wireless medium have become a promising solution to secure wireless communications. However, most existing PLS methods assume a finite block-length regime, which cannot cater to uRLLC with short block-lengths. In this paper, the PLS technologies for uRLLC were comprehensively investigated. First, we reviewed the typical characteristics of the next-generation mobile networks and analyzed the threats faced by the physical layer. Then, we introduced the traditional solutions and performance metrics of PLS with a finite block-length regime. Furthermore, we discussed several physical layer technologies and observed their influence on PLS. Additionally, this study also analyzed the impact of the unique characteristics of 5G networks on communication securit, such as the mobility.}

Data science is typically the scientific study and analysis of actual happenings with historical data using a variety of scientific methodologies, machine learning techniques, processes, and systems. In this paper, we concentrate on and explore “Smart City Data Science”, where city data collected from various sources such as sensors, Internet-connected devices, or other external sources, is being mined for insights and hidden correlations to enhance decision-making processes and deliver better and more intelligent services to citizens. To achieve this goal, artificial intelligence, particularly, machine learning analytical modeling can be employed to provide deeper knowledge about city data, which makes the computing process more actionable and intelligent in various real-world city services. Finally, we identify and highlight ten open research issues for future development and research in the context of data-driven smart cities. Overall, we aim to provide an insight into smart city data science conceptualization on a broad scale, which can be used as a reference guide for the researchers, industry professionals, as well as policy-makers of a country, particularly, from the technological point of view.}

The information from the swallowed microchip is processed based on the observed animal action that is used for the forecast. Considering the information to be rectilinear, the distractions and distribution patterns (data) are augmented in identifying and forecasting its behavior. The proposed scheme identifies the patterns using a deep recurrent learning paradigm recurrently. This pattern is distinguished for idle and non-idle observations for improving the prediction accuracy. Distinguished data patterns are mapped for the consecutive time and observation data in classifying abnormalities. The proposed scheme's performance is validated using the metrics accuracy, precision, computing time, and mean error.}

	abstract = {This study proposes a smart long-range (LoRa) sensing node to timely collect the air quality information and update it on the cloud. The developed long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN)-based Internet of Things (IoT) air quality monitoring system (AQMS), hereafter called LoRaWAN-IoT-AQMS, was deployed in an outdoor environment to validate its reliability and effectiveness. The system is composed of multiple sensors (NO2, SO2, CO2, CO, PM2.5, temperature, and humidity), Arduino microcontroller, LoRa shield, LoRaWAN gateway, and The Thing Network (TTN) IoT platform. The LoRaWAN-IoT-AQMS is a standalone system powered continuously by a rechargeable battery with a photovoltaic solar panel via a solar charger shield for sustainable operation. Our system simultaneously gathers the considered air quality information by using the smart sensing unit. Then, the system transmits the information through the gateway to the TTN platform, which is integrated with the ThingSpeak IoT server. This action updates the collected data and displays these data on a developed Web-based dashboard and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that uses the Virtuino mobile application. Thus, the displayed information can be easily accessed by users via their smartphones. The results obtained by the developed LoRaWAN-IoT-AQMS are validated by comparing them with experimental results based on the high-technology Aeroqual air quality monitoring devices. Our system can reliably monitor various air quality indicators and efficiently transmit the information in real time over the Internet.}

	abstract = {Gait assessments are commonly used for clinical evaluations of neurocognitive disease progression and general wellness. However, gait measurements in clinical settings do not accurately reflect gait in daily life. We present a non-wearable and unobtrusive method of detecting gait parameters in the home through the vibrations in the floor created by footfalls. Gait characteristics and gait asymmetry are estimated despite a low sensor density of 6.7 m2/sensor. Features from each footfall vibration signal is extracted and used to estimate gait parameters with gradient boosting regression and probabilistic models. Temporal gait asymmetry, locations of the footfalls, and peak tibial acceleration asymmetry can be predicted with a root mean square error of 0.013 s, 0.42 m, and 0.34 g respectively. This system allows for continuous at-home monitoring of gait which aids in early detection of gait anomalies.}

	abstract = {The IoT (Internet of Things) is now one of the most significant infrastructure and has to be secure against malicious accesses. Especially, it is critical to make devices secure in the IoT. In the CBAC (Capability-Based Access Control) model adopted to the IoT, device owners issue subjects capability tokens, i.e. a set of access rights on objects in devices. Objects in devices are data resource manipulated by subjects. Data are exchanged among subjects and objects through manipulating objects. Here, if subjects attempt to manipulate objects in accordance with the capability tokens issued, the subjects can get data which the subjects are not authorized to get, i.e. illegal information flow and late information flow occur. In our previous studies, protocols are implemented to prevent both illegal and late types of information flows from occurring. Here, operations implying such information flows are interrupted. However, the request processing time gets longer as the number of capability tokens used increases. In this paper, an MRCTSD (Minimum Required Capability Token Selection for Devices) algorithm is newly proposed to reduce the number of capability tokens used. In the evaluation, it is shown that the request processing times and the numbers of capability tokens used in the lightweight protocols realized with the MRCTSD algorithm are shorter and smaller than the conventional protocols, respectively.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly present in people’s daily lives, collecting different types of data about the environment, user behavior, medical data, and others. Due to limited processing power, such devices share the collected data with cloud/fog environments, which raises concerns about users’ privacy. To ensure privacy and confidentiality guarantees, many cloud/fog-enhanced IoT applications use Trusted Execution Environments, such as ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX, which are the basis for Confidential Computing. Confidential Computing aims at protecting data during processing, besides transit and rest. This paper presents a review regarding TEEs’ adoption to protect data in cloud/fog-based IoT applications, focusing on the two aforementioned technologies. We highlight the challenges in adopting these technologies and discuss the vulnerabilities present in both Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone.}

	abstract = {Recently, the number of cyber attacks against IoT domains has increased tremendously. This resulted into both human and financial losses at all IoT levels especially individual and organization levels. Recently, cyber-criminals have kept on leveraging new skills and capabilities by conducting anti-forensics activities and employing techniques and tools to cover their tracks to evade any possible detection of the attack’s events, which has targeted either the IoT system or/and its component(s). Consequently, IoT cyber-attacks are becoming more efficient and more sophisticated with higher risks and threat levels based on their more frequent likelihood to occur and their impact. However, traditional security and forensics solutions are no longer enough to prevent nor investigate such cyber attacks, especially in terms of acquiring evidence for attack investigation. Hence, the need for well-defined, sophisticated, and advanced forensics investigation techniques is highly required to prevent anti-forensics techniques and track down cyber criminals. This paper reviews the different forensics and anti-forensics methods that can be applied in the IoT domain including tools, techniques, types, and challenges, while also discussing the rise of the anti-anti-forensics as a new forensics protection mechanism against anti-forensics activities. This would help forensics investigators to better understand the different anti-forensics tools, methods and techniques that cyber criminals employ while launching their attacks. Moreover, the limitations of the current forensics techniques are discussed, especially in terms of issues and challenges. Finally, this paper presents a holistic view from a literature point of view over the forensics domain in general and for IoT in particular.}

Aiming at the problem, a WSN coverage optimization method based on the Yin–Yang pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm (Yin–YangPIO) is proposed. Firstly, the good point set is introduced into initialization phase which makes pigeon population more evenly distributed in the solution space; then, Yin–Yang-pair optimization algorithm (YYPO) and pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm (PIO) are combined, and different strategies are used in the map and compass operator and the landmark operator to improve the optimization ability; later on, the opposition-based learning is added to PIO to expand the search range; finally, several functions are selected to prove the optimization ability of the Yin–YangPIO. Through three sets of WSN coverage optimization experiments with different parameters, the effectiveness of the proposed method in WSN coverage optimization is demonstrated.}

In this work, we propose an innovative design for an IoT-based interoperable healthcare system to wirelessly monitor and classify patient status. To support our research, we identify gaps, and discuss standards, protocols and technologies based on works that use relevant IoT applications in healthcare. The proposed architecture is centered on several low-energy unobtrusive sensors attached to the patients’ bodies, as well as their beds, which encompass data acquisition nodes linked to a smart gateway that aggregates data. The smart gateway is integrated with an existing hospital information system through the exchange of Electronic Health Records (EHR), making relevant patient data easily available to health professionals on systems which are familiar to them. A use case scenario is presented in order to fulfill functional and non-functional requirements and provide a better understanding of connection and communication between the distinct entities of the proposed architecture, which is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology at the data acquisition level, the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol at the internal level, and on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard at the higher level.}

As Fog Colonies are extended, Fog Colony Control mechanisms have gained significant interest. Although, there are numerous solutions efficiently supporting a Context Aware coordinating entity, exploring approaches for decentralized control remains a challenge. Towards this direction, there are efforts promoting the concept of autonomous Fog Nodes, making their own decisions with internalized control without the existence of a coordinating entity. In this paper we propose and implement a Context Aware Self-Control management middleware for Fog Nodes, enabling their Self-Management utilizing contextual information shared between Fog colony members. To that end, we employ Policy Rulebooks to define Context Aware Policies that each Fog Node can enforce. Finally, we evaluated the proposed middleware against a non Context Aware one, under exactly the same conditions, using a real-world smart building use case, focusing on performance issues related to the end-user.}

This, in turn, involves several challenges including the development of inexpensive quality/contamination sensors to be deployed in a fine grain manner in the food boxes, technologies for sensor level communications, online data management and analytics, and logistics driven by such analytics. In this paper, we study the issues related to the communication among sensing modules deployed in the fresh food boxes and thereby an automated localization of the boxes that may have quality/contamination issues. In this context we study the near-field magnetic induction (NFMI) based communication and localization, as the ubiquitous RF communications suffer high attenuation through the water/mineral rich tissue media. An accurate localization of the sensors inside boxes within the food pallets is very challenging in this environment. In this paper we propose a novel magnetic induction based localization scheme, and show that with a small number of anchor nodes, the localization can be done without any errors for boxes as small as 0.5 meter on the side, and with small errors even for boxes half as big.}

A dependency on smart applications implies that any misbehavior may impact our society with varying criticality levels, from simple inconveniences to life-threatening dangers. One critical challenge in this area is to overcome the side effects caused by data loss due to failures in software, hardware, and communication systems, which may also affect data logging systems. Event traceability and auditing may be impaired when an application makes automated decisions and the operating log is incomplete. In an environment where many events happen automatically, an audit system must understand, validate, and find the root causes of eventual failures. This paper presents a probabilistic approach to track sequences of events even in the face of logging data loss using Bayesian networks. The results of the performance analysis with three smart application scenarios show that this approach is valid to track events in the face of incomplete data. Also, scenarios modeled with Bayesian subnets highlight a decreasing complexity due to this divide and conquer strategy that reduces the number of elements involved. Consequently, the results improve and also reveal the potential for further advancement.}

However, the open deployment environment and the limited resources of IoT devices make them vulnerable to cyber threats. In this paper, we investigate intrusion detection techniques to mitigate attacks that exploit IoT security vulnerabilities. We propose a machine learning-based two-layer hierarchical intrusion detection mechanism that can effectively detect intrusions in IoT networks while satisfying the IoT resource constraints. Specifically, the proposed model effectively utilizes the resources in the fog layer of the IoT network by efficiently deploying multi-layered feedforward neural networks in the fog-cloud infrastructure for detecting network attacks. With a fog layer into the picture, analysis is dynamically distributed across the fog and cloud layer thus enabling real-time analytics of traffic data closer to IoT devices and end-users. We have performed extensive experiments using two publicly available datasets to test the proposed approach. Test results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, experiments also justified the proposed model in terms of improved service time, lower delay, and optimal energy utilization.}

Results revealed that social support, facilitated conditions, innovativeness, and effort expectancy of UTAUT2 constructs had the strongest effect on IoET applications’ acceptance and usage respectively. Whereas performance expectancy, and perceived usefulness had the weakest effect on IoET adoption respectively. On the other hand, the relationship between perceived ease of use and IoET behavioral intention were not supported because of insignificant relationships. The results demonstrated in this study potentially assist the universities to understand the main determinists of using IoET applications acceptance and usage from students’ perspectives to integrate the IoT concept in teaching and learning.}

	abstract = {In an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), many applications, such as collision avoidance and lane change warning, require real-time information from vehicles on the road. This typically includes detailed status information such as location, speed, heading and a vehicle identifier, which can be used to infer precise movement patterns leading to long-term driver profiling and vehicle tracking. The use of pseudonyms, instead of actual vehicle IDs, allows vehicles to protect their privacy while sharing relevant information. A pseudonym changing scheme (PCS) determines when and how a vehicle should change its pseudonyms to maintain an appropriate privacy level. In this paper, we propose a new comprehensive PCS that utilizes vehicle context and current traffic patterns to leverage the optimum situation for changing pseudonyms. Simulation results indicate that the proposed PCS outperforms existing approaches both in terms of user-centric and adversary-centric performance metrics.}

	abstract = {Analyzing the patterns of earthquakes and creating a system to detect them, can help to minimize loss of lives. Existing sensor based detection works failed to distinguish between earthquakes and other external vibrational noises that may be caused due to construction or other external sources. In the proposed work, to overcome this drawback, first in-depth structural analysis of shear walls is done to find a structurally suitable location to install the sensor in a building. Further, MPU6050 sensor is used to reduce the complexity and make the circuit less bulky. This sensor consists of an accelerometer which measures the change in acceleration and a gyroscope which records the shaking pattern of the ground. Since this shaking pattern is exhibited exclusively by an earthquake occurrence, the proposed model distinguishes between earthquake and other non-hazardous vibrations efficiently. With the considered model for machine learning algorithms, we were able to achieve 99.82% of accuracy, which is an important factor for earthquake detection.}

	abstract = {Event processing is the cornerstone of the dynamic and responsive Internet of Things (IoT). Recent approaches in this area are based on representational state transfer (REST) principles, which allow event processing tasks to be placed at any device that follows the same principles. However, the tasks should be properly distributed among edge devices to ensure fair resources utilization and guarantee seamless execution. This article investigates the use of deep learning to fairly distribute the tasks. An attention-based neural network model is proposed to generate efficient load balancing solutions under different scenarios. The proposed model is based on the Transformer and Pointer Network architectures, and is trained by an advantage actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm. The model is designed to scale to the number of event processing tasks and the number of edge devices, with no need for hyperparameters re-tuning or even retraining. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms conventional heuristics in many key performance indicators. The generic design and the obtained results show that the proposed model can potentially be applied to several other load balancing problem variations, which makes the proposal an attractive option to be used in real-world scenarios due to its scalability and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the “internet of insecure things.” A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device.  The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.}

Based on bibliometric techniques, 1,802 articles were retrieved from the Scopus database and analyzed to identify the temporal nature of IoT research, the most relevant journals, authors, countries, keywords, and studies. The software tool VOSviewer was used to build the keyword co-occurrence network and to cluster the pertinent literature. Results show the significant growth of IoT research in recent years. The most productive authors, journals, and countries were also identified. The main findings from the keyword co-occurrence clustering and an in-depth qualitative analysis indicate that the IoT is used alongside other technologies including cloud computing, big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and wireless telecommunication networks. The major applications of the IoT for smart cities include smart buildings, transportation, healthcare, smart parking, and smart grids. This review is one of the first attempts to map global IoT research in a smart city context and uses a comprehensive set of articles and bibliometric techniques to provide scholars and practitioners with an overview of what has been studied so far and to identify research gaps at the intersection of the IoT and the smart city.}

Recent advancements in the field have increased the necessity to study the many IoT anomaly detection applications. This paper begins with a summary of the detection methods and applications, accompanied by a discussion of the categorization of IoT anomaly detection algorithms. We then discuss the current publications to identify distinct application domains, examining papers chosen based on our search criteria. The survey considers 64 papers among recent publications published between January 2019 and July 2021. In recent publications, we observed a shortage of IoT anomaly detection methodologies, for example, when dealing with the integration of systems with various sensors, data and concept drifts, and data augmentation where there is a shortage of Ground Truth data. Finally, we discuss the present such challenges and offer new perspectives where further research is required.}

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most significant global economic activities responsible for feeding the world population of 7.75 billion. However, weather conditions and diseases impact production efficiency, reducing economic activity and the food sovereignty of economies worldwide. Thus, computational methods can support disease classification based on an image. This classification requires training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models on high-performance computing resources, usually far from the user domain. State of the art has proposed the concept of Edge Computing (EC), which aims to bring computational resources closer to the domain problem to decrease application latency and improve computational power closer to the client. In addition, EC has become an enabling technology for Smart Farms, and the literature has appropriated EC to support these applications. However, predominantly state-of-the-art architectures are dependent on Internet connectivity and do not allow diverse real-time classification of diseases based on crop leaf on mobile devices. This paper sheds light on a new architecture, AgroLens, built with low-cost and green-friendly devices to support a mobile Smart Farm application, operational even in areas lacking Internet connectivity. Among our main contributions, we highlight the functional evaluation of AgroLens for AI-based real-time classification of diseases based on leaf images, achieving high classification performance using a smartphone. Our results indicate that AgroLens supports the connectivity of thousands of sensors from a smart farm without imposing computational overhead on edge-compute. The AgroLens architecture opens up opportunities and research avenues for deployment and evaluation for large-scale Smart Farm applications with low-cost devices.}

To this end, we first present a comprehensive examination of challenging issues in Fog Computing (FC). Then, we outline possible FogAI based solutions to these challenges from different perspectives. To illustrate the feasibility of our FogAI concept, we design a use case scenario for task offloading problem in FC. Then, we propose a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithm that autonomously performs task offloading in delay-sensitive and computationally-intensive IoT applications and test it on FogAI. The results show that the proposed FogAI-assisted DQL algorithm is superior to existing offloading policies.}

This study explains the underlying principles, methodology, and research that went into developing the concept, as well as the need for and scopes of a restroom cyberinfrastructure system, that we call as iRestroom to assess the frailty of elderly people for them to live a comfortable, independent, and secure life at home. The proposed restroom idea is based on the required situations, which are determined by user study, socio-cultural and technological trends, and user requirements. The iRestroom is designed as a multi-sensory place with interconnected devices where carriers of older persons can access interactive material and services throughout their everyday activities. The prototype is then tested at Texas A&M University-Kingsville. A Nave Bayes classifier is utilized to anticipate the locations of the sensors, which serves to provide a constantly updated reference for the data originating from numerous sensors and devices installed in different locations throughout the restroom. A small sample of pilot data was obtained, as well as pertinent web data. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) has approved all the methods.}

Therefore, several lightweight consensus mechanisms that are suitable for IoT devices have been proposed in recent studies. However, these lightweight consensus mechanisms do not verify the originality of the data generated by the IoT devices, so false and anomalous data may pass through and be stored in the ledger for further analysis. In this work to address the data originality verification problem, we propose an autoencoder (AE)-integrated Chaincode (CC)-based consensus mechanism in which the AE differentiates normal data from anomalous data. The AE is invoked through the CC once a transaction is initiated; the result returned from the AE to the CC is stored in the ledger. We have conducted a case study to train and test the AE model on the IoTID20 dataset. Also, Minifabric (MF) is used to implement the CC and illustrate the CC operation that stores only original IoT data. Moreover, the performance has been shown for the CC in terms of latency and throughput.}

	abstract = {Turbidity is an important characteristic of water quality that can indicate the presence of undesirable suspended particulate matter. Having access to an inexpensive and effective turbidity sensor unlocks numerous Internet of Things (IoT) possibilities for remote environmental monitoring. Optical light attenuation turbidity sensors operate on the premise of detecting signal degradation from a light source due to scattering from particles in a solution. This approach is technologically unpretentious and only requires a handful of inexpensive electronic components to construct. However, while this method is touted as “simple”, a significant challenge lies in sensor calibration. That is, converting an analogue signal into a meaningful and accurate digital reading in a known turbidity measurement standard (e.g., Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU)). This paper presents an IoT light attenuation turbidity sensor design and explores the calibration process to determine the sensor's range and accuracy. Sensor calibration is undertaken using Formazin turbidity standards and is cross-checked against a commercial turbidimeter. We provide a step-by-step procedure for determining the correct signal strength to use and a functional form for the sensor response to the Formazin standard. Finally, we specify an estimate of the accuracy of the sensor and suggest the next steps in the proposed turbidity sensor's development. Results indicate that the sensor achieves within 2%-10% of accuracy at higher ranges (100–4000 NTU), but its performance becomes significantly less reliable in low NTU ranges (< 100 NTU) where the error rate increases to 26%. The turbidity sensor is used as part of an IoT remote aquatic environmental monitoring platform.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally reshaped the agricultural sector. In recent years, academic research on the IoT has grown at an unprecedented pace. However, the broad picture of how this technology can benefit the agricultural sector is still missing. To close this research gap, we conduct a bibliometric study to investigate the current state of the IoT and agriculture in academic literature. Using a resource-based view (RBV), we also identify those agricultural resources that are mostly impacted by the introduction of the IoT (i.e., seeds, soil, water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, livestock, human resources, technology infrastructure, business relations) and propose numerous themes for future research.}

	abstract = {In order to improve the development of modern agriculture, this paper uses the Internet of Things technology to conduct research on farmland monitoring and livestock management, and build an intelligent system. Moreover, this paper combines farmland monitoring and livestock management, and designs a sensor network based on microkernel operating system. Based on the idea of modular design, the functional modules and control modules are organically combined, and an API interface is provided to manage and control nodes and networks, so as to realize the monitoring and collection of farmland information and livestock management. The experimental evaluation shows that the farmland monitoring and livestock management system based on the Internet of Things proposed in this paper meets the needs of intelligent agricultural production.}
