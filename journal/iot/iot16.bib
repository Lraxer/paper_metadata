	abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly growing, and many security issues relate to its wireless technology. These security issues are challenging because IoT protocols are heterogeneous, suit different needs, and are used in different application domains. From this assessment, we identify the need to provide a homogeneous formalism applying to every IoT protocols. In this survey, we describe a generic approach with twofold challenges. The first challenge we tackle is the identification of common principles to define a generic approach to compare IoT protocol stack. We base the comparison on five different criteria: the range, the openness of the protocol, the interoperability, the topology and the security practices of these IoT protocols. The second challenge we consider is to find a generic way to describe fundamental IoT attacks regardless of the protocol used. This approach exposes similar attacks amongst different IoT protocols and is divided into three parts: attacks focusing on packets (passive and active cryptographic attacks), attacks focusing on the protocol (MITM, Flooding, Sybil, Spoofing, Wormhole attacks) and attacks focusing on the whole system (Sinkhole, Selective forwarding attacks). It also highlights which mechanisms are different between two protocols to make both of them vulnerable to an attack. Finally, we draw some lessons and perspectives from this transversal study.}

	abstract = {With the augmentation of traffic exponentially, we observe that traffic congestion does not guarantee road safety or enhance the driving experience. In the recent past, Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV), a social network paradigm permits social relationships among every vehicle in the network or with any road infrastructure to render a radically useful environment. SIoV is beneficial for the drivers, in improving road safety, avoiding mishaps, and providing a friendly-driving experience. In this paper, we propose a traffic scheduling algorithm to gain the maximum throughput for the flow of vehicles at a road intersection with the formation of social relationships among the vehicles and with the Road Side Units (RSUs). The algorithm estimates the flow rate of vehicles for lanes at the intersections exploiting the volume of traffic moving through the given road. A condition matrix is designed for the consistent movement of traffic considering different routes on the road segments. Social relationships are devised on various aspects of travel needs for a safe, agile, and better driving experience. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme with high traffic throughput, service rate and reduce the total travelling time, delay time, and average waiting time in comparison with Dynamic Throughput Maximization Framework and Adaptive Traffic Control Algorithm.}

	abstract = {The ability to provide near real-time data (e.g., < every 15 minutes) on aquatic environmental conditions via remotely deployed sensors is a highly sought-after capability. However, cost and complexity are often significant factors that limit the spatial and temporal coverage of such monitoring systems. Most existing proposals are expensive, complex and/or are un-malleable for adaptation to other environmental sensing applications. This paper presents a simple and flexible open-source IoT (Internet of Things) electronics design for viable near real-time environmental measurements – specifically tailored to the rigors of aquatic settings. The system provides the minimal required functionality for reliable remote sensor readings with a focus on low energy consumption, renewal energy supply, plug and play deployments, and stability over time. The system development is driven by actual deployment logistics and constraints. We compare three revisions of the system/circuit and show how we aspired towards the aforementioned goals, whilst outlining the evolution of the design based on practical experience. A performance evaluation of the system is given in terms of functionality, stability, cost and energy consumption. The IoT platform is at the core of an affordable near real-time aquatic monitoring system that has been used in multiple water quality studies. The system has been adapted for use in other applications including water height monitoring and air dust sensing.}

CCDNs offer faster content access to users by deploying or caching popular content at servers close to the appropriate users. However, content placement with QoS requirements and system constraints is proven to be NP-complete. It means that there is no polynomial-time solution for content placement both in CCDNs. We propose a novel approach for content placement based on Cuckoo search, a bio-inspired metaheuristic. We also implement it and evaluate it regarding the content hit ratio and storage and communication cost in the presence of failures. Our simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the content hit ratio without a significant impact on storage and communication cost.}

	abstract = {For a given specific machine learning task, very often several machine learning algorithms and their right configurations are tested in a trial-and-error approach, until an adequate solution is found. This wastes human resources for constructing multiple models, requires a data analytics expert and is time-consuming. Meta learning addresses these problems and supports non-expert users by recommending a promising learning algorithm based on meta features computed from a given dataset. In the present paper, a new concept for enhancing the predictive performance of meta learning classification models by generating new meta examples is introduced. Our concept is realized and evaluated in a microservice-based meta learning framework. This framework makes use of a powerful Big Data software stack, container visualization, modern web technologies and a microservice architecture. In this demonstration and for evaluation purpose, time series model selection is taken as a use case for applying meta learning. It is shown that the proposed microservice-based meta learning framework introduces an excellent performance in assigning the adequate forecasting model for the chosen time series datasets. Moreover, our new concept for generating new meta examples enhances the predictive performance of the meta learner up to 16.77% and 27.07% in the case of using the original and encoded representation forms of meta features respectively. The recommendation of the most appropriate forecasting model results in a well acceptable low framework overhead demonstrating that the framework can provide an efficient approach to solve the problem of model selection in the context of Big Data.}

	abstract = {Parallelizing population-based metaheuristics – such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) – on a cluster computing environment is a viable approach for enhancing the computational performance of metaheuristics. Generally, there are three basic models to parallelize EAs, namely the Global, the Coarse-Grained and the Fine-Grained models whereby each one has advantages and disadvantages. Combining two or more of them in a hierarchical form reduces the disadvantages of each approach and allows users to fully utilize the advantages. In this article, a generic, scalable and flexible software architecture which supports users in combining the basic parallelization models of EAs with minimum adaptation effort is presented. This architecture based on microservices, container virtualization and the publish/subscribe messaging paradigm decouples the basic building blocks of the algorithms by encapsulating them in separate services. This allows users to easily combine the building blocks to form combinations of the parallelization models of EAs. An extensive evaluation exploring the scalability and applicability of the software architecture is performed by combining the Coarse-Grained Model with the Global Model for solving the unit commitment optimization problem. Four communication topologies among the islands with homogeneous/heterogeneous EA configurations and synchronous/asynchronous migration policies are applied and compared. For evaluation, the EA GLEAM (General Learning Evolutionary Algorithm and Method) is used. This article discusses the architectural concepts of our approach and presents main results of the evaluation. The evaluation results show that the new software architecture has high potential for scaling up the optimization speed of complex optimization problems when metaheuristics are used.}

A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize prior research on drones and cumulatively identify current knowledge gaps which require further investigation. In order to identify the relevant literature on the topic, a rigorous research protocol was applied for the retrieval and selection processes. In total, 142 publications fulfilled the selection criteria and were thoroughly analyzed. The findings of this review paper summarize the capabilities, barriers and performance outcomes of humanitarian drones applied to logistics operations, management, and governance in a comprehensive framework. More specifically, three important capabilities (i.e., transportation and delivery; surveying and monitoring; communication and integration), three performance outcomes (i.e., flexibility and responsiveness; cost reduction; sustainability) and adoption barriers in three areas (i.e., technology; organization; environment) were identified. Based on these findings, future research directions are derived for the capabilities of humanitarian drones, their performance outcomes, and their respective barriers. This study analyzes potential applications of drones in the humanitarian field and presents a comprehensive agenda that structures and guides further research on the topic.}

AIS broadcasts information including type of ship, identity number, state, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), location, speed, direction, and cargo. In this paper, we focus on extracting a variety of trajectory patterns for maritime vessels. The first group of analysis we focus on is arrival port, arrival time, and next position prediction on AIS messages, which are useful to aid maritime operators. We propose three different approaches for the prediction of marine vessel movement. As the second type of analysis, anomaly detection on marine vessel trajectory is studied. For vessel movement prediction, the experiments show that the proposed solutions brought improvement against conventional supervised learning approaches. The proposed anomaly detection technique is demonstrated on a case study.}

These devices are used to develop truly distributed IoT-based mechanisms where machine learning (ML) models are utilized. However, integrating ML models to edge devices requires an understanding of various software tools such as programming languages and domain-specific knowledge. Anomaly detection is one of the domains where a high level of expertise is required to achieve promising results. In this work, we present AnoML which is an end-to-end data science pipeline that allows the integration of multiple wireless communication protocols, anomaly detection algorithms, deployment to the edge, fog, and cloud platforms with minimal user interaction. We facilitate the development of IoT anomaly detection mechanisms by reducing the barriers that are formed due to the heterogeneity of an IoT environment. The proposed pipeline supports four main phases: (i) data ingestion, (ii) model training, (iii) model deployment, (iv) inference and maintaining. We evaluate the pipeline with two anomaly detection datasets while comparing the efficiency of several machine learning algorithms within different nodes.

Video game industry involves a great number of different professionals who work together to create products expected to reach people in many countries. A substantial part of these people are teenagers, strongly attracted and influenced by video games. For these reasons, various systems of labels have been created. These systems are based on different criteria, but they have in common the presence of descriptors, or labels, whose indicate the type of contents in the game. These labels give an age range indicator to inform the buyers and users to the more suitable age for the product. One of these systems is called PEGI, and we will primarily take it in consideration for the purposes of our study. The rating procedure includes a large process of manual control of each submitted game. In order to help this large and demanding process, we propose a system of video games rating based on automatic classification of the products performed over the “transcript” or script, files that display the full transcription of dialogues in a video game. The proposed automatic classification algorithm is based on specialized dictionaries enriched with a vector semantics algorithm, and is able to provide an age rating and a genre classification of video games. It works in a more efficient way in games with a consistent amount of dialogues. The experimentation of the proposed algorithm is returning encouraging results.}

In this article, we present the design and prototype implementation of a Big Data workflow approach based on the use of software container technologies, message-oriented middleware (MOM), and a domain-specific language (DSL) to enable highly scalable workflow execution and abstract workflow definition. We demonstrate our system in a use case and a set of experiments that show the practical applicability of the proposed approach for the specification and scalable execution of Big Data workflows. Furthermore, we compare our proposed approach’s scalability with that of Argo Workflows – one of the most prominent tools in the area of Big Data workflows – and provide a qualitative evaluation of the proposed DSL and overall approach with respect to the existing literature.}

	abstract = {The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is an intelligent network of industrial components that can communicate with each other to enhance the performance of manufacturing and industrial processes. For the many advantages, such as less no contracts, free to develop and high interoperability, in this work we propose using open-source technologies to develop IIoT platforms for information integration and data analysis. To realize the development and deployment of open source IIoTs, we present our framework OPIIoT (Open Communication Protocol Platform for Industrial Internet of Things) with the system construction cycle to solve various integration problems of operational technology and information technology. Moreover, we describe the underlying design principles and the implementation details of the proposed framework are given to make it more understandable and applicable to the IIoT platform developers. To verify the proposed framework, we have conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. We have compared the important features of our OPIIoT and several commercial platforms for industry, performed trials on data communication and analytics for information supports, and demonstrated the web interface for system implementation. The results prove the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {The 6LoWPAN standard has been widely applied in different Internet of Things (IoT) application domains. However, since the nodes in the IoT are mostly resource constrained, 6LoWPAN is vulnerable to a variety of security attacks. Among others, replication attack is one of the severe security threads to IoT networks. This paper therefore proposes a trust-based detection strategy against replication attacks in IoT, where a number of replica nodes are intentionally inserted into the network to test the reliability and response of witness nodes. We further assess the feasibility of the proposed detection strategy and compare with two other strategies such as brute-force and first visited strategy via a thorough simulation. The evaluation takes into account the detection probability for compromised attacks, the execution time of transactions and rate of communication failure. The simulation results show that while maintaining detection runtime on average 60 s for up to 1000 nodes, the proposed trust-based strategy can significantly increase the detection probability to 90% on average against replication attacks and in turn significantly reduce the communication failure.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of cloud computing and remote workforces, organizations are increasingly aware of the risk of data leaks and data exfiltration. Handling such risk has become more challenging because organizations today usually deal with big data. In particular, organizations must deal with massive amounts of unstructured data. As a result, modern data leak prevention (DLP) solutions must support automated methods to detect and identify confidential and sensitive information in both structured and unstructured data. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of using deep learning to identify unstructured context-dependent sensitive information, in contrast to traditional machine learning methods and rule-based methods.}

	abstract = {Smart connected environments as well as digital contents are more and more present in our daily life. The former monitors various data produced by sensors, while the latter contains valuable additional information (e.g., technical data sheets, maintenance reports, employee register). When an event occurs, users generally want to figure out why this event happened. Unfortunately, most information systems in connected environments do not combine sensor network data with document corpora. Consequently, users have to look for an event explanation by querying both complementary sources with different systems, which is indeed very tedious, time consuming and requires a huge compilation effort. In this article, we apply the 5W1H model (”What? Who? Where? When? Why? How?”), commonly used in question-answering, to bridge the gap between sensor networks and document corpora. Our framework entitled ISEE (Information System for Event Explainability) offers an original approach that (i) defines events along four dimensions, (ii) interconnects semantic information coming from sensor networks and documents with 5W1H connections, and (iii) provides to the user a set of preliminary event explanation according to 5W1H answers. A real motivating use-case based on a smart-building is presented and experimental results are discussed.}

However, the adaptation process still requires data and time to adjust the model to the new domain. In this work, we propose a data selection mechanism to minimize the data required from the new domain when adapting a pre-trained ML model. Our target is to achieve short retraining time, minimize new domain data usage, and maximize transferred knowledge, lowering the overall cost of adapting pre-trained models. The result of our experiment indicates achieving a fast accuracy improvement in adapting the pre-trained model using our approach, comparing the regular one with minimum data usage.}

	abstract = {In the recent times, the IoT (Internet of Things) enabled devices and applications have seen a rapid growth in various sectors including healthcare. The ability of low-cost connected sensors to cover large areas makes it a potential tool in the fight against pandemics, like COVID-19. The COVID-19 has posed a formidable challenge for the developing countries, like India, which need to cater to large population base with limited health infrastructure. In this paper, we proposed a  Cloud-fog-dew based mOnitoriNg Framework foR cOvid-19 maNagemenT, called CONFRONT. This cloud-fog-dew based healthcare model may help in preliminary diagnosis and also in monitoring patients while they are in quarantine facilities or home based treatments. The fog architecture ensures that the model is suited for real-time scenarios while keeping the bandwidth requirements low. To analyse large scale COVID-19 statistics data for extracting aggregate information of the disease spread, the cloud servers are leveraged due to its scalable computational and storage capabilities. The dew architecture ensures that the application is available at a limited scale even when cloud connectivity is lost, leading to a faster uptime for the application. A low cost wearable device consisting of heterogeneous sensors has also been designed and fabricated to realize the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), is playing a major role in provisioning contextualized, smart services to end-users and organizations. To sustain this role, many challenges must be tackled with focus in this paper on the design and development of thing composition. The complex nature of today’s needs requires groups of things, and not separate things, to work together to satisfy these needs. By analogy with other ICTs like Web services, thing composition is specified with a model that uses dependencies to decide upon things that will do what, where, when, and why. Two types of dependencies are adopted, regular that schedule the execution chronology of things and special that coordinate the operations of things when they run into obstacles like unavailability of resources to use. Both resource use and resource availability are specified in compliance with Allen’s time intervals upon which reasoning takes place. This reasoning is technically demonstrated through a system extending EdgeCloudSim and backed with a set of experiments.}

TinyML framework in IoT is aimed to provide low latency, effective bandwidth utilization, strengthen data safety, enhance privacy, and reduce cost. Its ability to empower the IoT device to reliably function without consistent access to the cloud services while delivering accurate ML services makes it a promising option for IoT applications seeking cost-effective solutions. Especially in settings where inadequate connectivity is common, TinyML aims to provide on-premise analytics which will add substantial benefit to IoT services. In this article, we introduce the definition of TinyML and provide background information on diverse related technologies stating their strengths and weaknesses. We then show how TinyML-as-a-service is implemented through efficient hardware-software co-design. This article also introduces the role of 5G in TinyML-IoT scenario. Furthermore, it touches on the recent progress in TinyML research in both academia and industry along with future challenges and opportunities. We believe that this review will serve as an information cornerstone for the IoT research community and pave the way for further research in this direction.}

	abstract = {Intrusions in computer networks have increased significantly in the last decade, due in part to a profitable underground cyber-crime economy and the availability of sophisticated tools for launching such intrusions. Researchers in industry and academia have been proposing methods and building systems for detecting and preventing such security breaches for more than four decades. Solutions proposed for dealing with network intrusions can be broadly classified as signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based intrusion detection systems look for patterns that match known attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems develop a model for distinguishing legitimate users’ behavior from that of malicious users’ and hence are capable of detecting unknown attacks. One of the approaches used to classify legitimate and anomalous behavior is to use Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Several intrusion detection systems based on ML techniques have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a comprehensive critical survey of ML-based intrusion detection approaches presented in the literature in the last ten years. This survey would serve as a supplement to other general surveys on intrusion detection as well as a reference to recent work done in the area for researchers working in ML-based intrusion detection systems. We also discuss some open issues that need to be addressed.}
