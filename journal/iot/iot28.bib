	abstract = {Recent trends in emerging applications have motivated researchers to design advanced wireless systems to meet their evolving requirements. These emerging applications include digital healthcare, intelligent transportation systems, Industry 5.0, and more. To address the evolving requirements, leveraging a metaverse to empower 6G wireless systems is a viable solution. A metaverse-empowered 6G wireless system can offer numerous benefits, but it may also be vulnerable to a wide variety of security attacks. In this survey, we discuss potential security attacks in metaverse-empowered 6G wireless systems. We introduce an architecture designed to enhance security within metaverse-empowered 6G wireless systems. This architecture comprises two key spaces: the meta space and the physical space. We present physical space attacks and outline effective solutions to secure metaverse-empowered 6G wireless systems. We provide invaluable insights and discussions on meta space attacks, along with promising solutions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and provide future recommendations.}

	abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing in smart cities is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of the high bandwidth and low latency capabilities of 5G. However, current 5G deployments still have low population coverage, and are unlikely to reach global coverage of above 80% before 2028. This means that new smart city applications are likely to experience a combination of 4G and 5G, limiting their data-intensive capabilities. Thus, it is necessary to assess the ability of current 5G deployments to support emerging smart city applications, and how they perform in 5G environments. Existing performance evaluations focus either on the 5G core or use instantaneous speed tests, which do not effectively assess the suitability of 5G deployments for smart city applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of real-world 5G network performance observed through the outcomes of a pilot smart city application, an innovative mobile 5G Internet of Things (IoT) solution to automatically identify and report road assets requiring maintenance. The pilot smart city application was deployed on 11 waste collection service trucks over a 6 month period (June 2022–Dec 2022). We undertook both application-specific and application independent network performance evaluation to assess the ability of the 5G deployment to support uninterrupted smart city services. Our analysis shows that while 5G is capable of supporting mobile video streaming applications, there are significant variations in network performance, which may make it unsuitable for applications that require higher data intensive or near real-time responsiveness.}

	abstract = {Sharing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organisations to work together to defend against cyberattacks. However, current methods often fail to adequately protect sensitive information, leading to security risks, especially in Intelligent Additive Manufacturing (IAM) systems. In these systems, the security and privacy of incident data collected by IoT devices are essential, as revealing threat information, such as types, impacts, and organisational interests, could be harmful. To address these challenges, we propose the Severity Pattern Matching for a Secure Computable Threat Information Sharing System (SPM-SeCTIS). This system is designed to maintain privacy by allowing intermediaries to pass along threat information without accessing sensitive details, such as the type or severity of the threats. SPM-SeCTIS ensures that attackers cannot determine which incidents organisations are interested in or what specific threats they monitor. The system employs Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to conduct threat pattern matching on encrypted data, keeping sensitive information confidential even during analysis. Our performance tests indicate that SPM-SeCTIS operates efficiently, requiring minimal time for encryption and decryption processes. Additionally, the system scales effectively, handling a large number of subscribers and incidents with ease. Compared to existing methods, SPM-SeCTIS provides improved security measures and better overall performance, making it a robust solution for protecting sensitive threat information.}

	abstract = {The healthcare industry has witnessed a transformative impact due to recent advancements in sensing technology, coupled with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs)-based healthcare systems. Remote monitoring and informed decision-making have become possible by leveraging an integrated platform for efficient data analysis and processing, thereby optimizing data management in healthcare. However, this data is collected, processed, and transmitted across an interconnected network of devices, which introduces notable security risks and escalates the potential for vulnerabilities throughout the entire data processing pipeline. Traditional security approaches rely on computational complexity and face challenges in adequately securing sensitive healthcare data against evolving threats, thus necessitating robust solutions that ensure trust, enhance security, and maintain data confidentiality and integrity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a two-phase framework that integrates blockchain technology with IoMT to enhance trust computation, resulting in a secure cluster that supports the quality-of-service (QoS) for sensitive data. The first phase utilizes the decentralized interplanetary file system and hashing functions to create a smart contract for device registration, establishing a resilient storage platform that encrypts data, improves fault tolerance, and facilitates data access. In the second phase, communication overhead is optimized by considering power levels, communication ranges, and computing capabilities alongside the smart contract. The smart contract evaluates the trust index and QoS of each node to facilitate device clustering based on processing capabilities. We implemented the proposed framework using OMNeT++ simulator and C++ programming language and evaluated against the cutting-edge IoMT security approaches in terms of attack detection, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and latency. The qualitative results demonstrated that the proposed framework enhanced attack detection by 6.00%, 18.00%, 20.00%, and 27.00%, reduced energy consumption by 6.91%, 8.19%, 12.07%, and 17.94%, improved packet delivery ratio by 3.00%, 6.00%, 9.00%, and 10.00%, increased throughput by 7.00%, 8.00%, 11.00%, and 13.00%, and decreased latency by 4.90%, 8.81%, 11.54%, and 20.63%, against state-of-the-art methods and was supported by statistical analysis.}

These attacks have become a primary concern for IoT networks. Intelligent decision-making techniques are required for DDoS attacks, which pose serious threats. The range of devices connected to the IoT ecosystem is growing, and the data traffic they generate is continually changing; the need for models more resistant to new attack types and existing attacks is of research interest. Motivated by this gap, this paper provides an effective IDS powered by deep learning models for IoT networks based on the recently published CICIoT2023 dataset. In this work, we improved the detection and mitigation of potential security threats in IoT networks. To increase performance, we performed preprocessing operations on the dataset, such as random subset selection, feature elimination, duplication removal, and normalization. A two-level IDS using deep-learning models containing binary and multiclass classifiers has been designed to identify DDoS attacks in IoT networks. The effectiveness of several deep-learning models in real-time and detection performance has been evaluated. We trained fully connected, convolutional, and LSTM-based deep learning models for detecting DDoS attacks and sub-classes. According to the results on a partially balanced sub-dataset, two staged models performed better than baseline models such as DNN (Deep Neural Networks), CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).}

	abstract = {We propose a new data pre-processing method, sub-district-based map matching (SDBMM), which involves projecting a trajectory onto sub-city districts (SCDs), geographical areas on the map with irregular boundaries. Thus, this method differs significantly from traditional map-matching processes, which match trajectory data points to the nearest or most probable road segments. With SDBMM, a moving object is represented through gradual transitions through a set of SCDs instead of ‘blinking’ at the road segments rapidly. This change in information granularity yields more presentation efficiency. As SCDs are meaningful partitions of a city based on urban planning or travel behaviours, SDBMM also underlies a new ground for post hoc analytics. In the first application, we perform SDBMM for a large taxi-trajectory dataset in a large city. This case verifies SDBMM with sufficient massive data and brings valuable knowledge to several parties (i.e. taxi drivers, service operators, and the government) in managing the taxi transport mode in the city and policy-making. We apply SDBMM in a second application of anti-drug investigation and find that SCDs with pathway entrances/exits across the mountain ranges are usually the hot traces of drug transactions. These practical applications may foster greater confidence in future utilisations of SDBMM.}

Blockchain technology provides transparency for institutions to securely store and manage IoT data, while cross-chain transaction mechanisms facilitate the flow of IoT data. However, fairness issues may arise when it comes to cross-chain transactions of IoT data. This paper proposes a mechanism for multi-attribute data transactions to support cross-chain. The solution utilizes Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction, Paillier, Intel SGX, and other technologies to design a secure and equitable data seller selection scheme. The scheme ensures that the selection process for data sellers is both informed and private. Additionally, we generate a key pair for each attribute in the dataset to produce the corresponding attribute data signature. The dataset’s legitimacy is verified through batch verification to ensure that the data seller’s purchased attributes align with their requirements. The exchange of crypto assets and private keys between data sellers and buyers is designed to achieve fair payment. Our research suggests that the scheme meets the necessary security standards, and simulation results confirm its feasibility and effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Networked health systems are often the victims of cyberattacks with serious consequences for patients and healthcare costs, with the Internet of Things (IoT) being an additional prime target. In future systems we can imagine that the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will also be used for conveying patients for diagnosis and treatment in an integrated manner. Thus the medical field poses very significant and specific challenges since even for a single patient, several providers may carry out tests or offer healthcare services, and may have distinct interconnected sub-contractors for services such as ambulances and connected cars, connected devices or temporary staff providers, that have distinct confidentiality requirements on top of possible commercial competition. On the other hand, these distinct entities can be subject to similar or coordinated attacks, and could benefit from each others’ cybersecurity experience to better detect and mitigate cyberattacks. Thus the present work proposes a novel Distributed Self-Supervised Federated Intrusion Detection Algorithm (DISFIDA), with Online Self-Supervised Federated Learning, that uses Dense Random Neural Networks (DRNN). In DISFIDA learning data is private, and neuronal weights are shared among Federated partners. Each partner in DISFIDA combines its synaptic weights with those it receives other partners, with a preference for those weights that have closer numerical values to its own weights which it has learned on its own. DISFIDA is tested with three open-access datasets against five benchmark methods, for two relevant IoT healthcare applications: networks of devices (e.g., body sensors), and Connected Smart Vehicles (e.g., ambulances that transport patients). These tests show that the DISFIDA approach offers 100% True Positive Rate for attacks (one percentage point better than comparable state of the art methods which attain 99%) so that it does better at detecting attacks, with 99% True Negative Rate similar to state-of-the-art Federated Learning, for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.}

Different aerial computing platforms offer different computation support to process the tasks of IoT devices, which affects the offloading decision. However, effective task offloading (TO) decision-making in this context remains a critical challenge because it impacts the quality of service, energy consumption, resource allocation, and latency requirements. Most current research uses reinforcement learning (RL)-based offloading decisions in AEC owing to the uncertainty of the environment and the heterogeneity of computation platforms. Therefore, this survey explores the prevailing use of RL-based algorithms for TO in AEC, addressing the inherent uncertainty of the environment and the heterogeneity of computation platforms. This study systematically reviews and compares RL-based techniques employed for efficient offloading decisions in heterogeneous aerial computing platforms. It delves into recent research findings, highlighting the various approaches and methodologies applied. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the performance metrics widely used to evaluate the efficacy of RL-based offloading decision techniques. In conclusion, this survey identifies research gaps and outlines future directions, aiming to guide scholars and practitioners in advancing the field of RL-based TO in AEC.}

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have always been an important research topic in the field of information security. Regarding specialized infrastructures such as electric vehicle charging stations, detecting and preventing such attacks becomes even more critical. In the existing literature, most studies on DDoS attack detection focus on traditional methods that analyze network metrics such as network traffic, packet rates, and number of connections. These approaches attempt to detect attacks by identifying anomalies and irregularities in the network, but can have high error rates and fail to identify advanced attacks. Conversely though, detection methods based on system metrics use deeper and more insightful parameters such as processor utilization, memory usage, disk I/O operations, and system behavior. Such metrics provide a more detailed perspective than network-based approaches, allowing for more accurate detection of attacks. However, work in this area is not yet widespread enough further research and improvement are needed. The adoption of advanced system metrics-based methods can significantly improve the effectiveness of DDoS defense strategies, especially in next-generation and specialized infrastructures. This paper evaluates the applicability and effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in detecting DDoS attacks against electric vehicle charging stations through system metrics using CICEV2023 dataset. Experimental results show that the LSTM based model offers advantages in terms of speed and processing capacity, while the FFN is superior in terms of the accuracy.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of connected electric vehicles, the openness and sharing of charging data between stakeholders allows a more accurate estimation of charging behavior, which is valuable for optimizing energy systems and facilitating travel convenience. However, to enable such an effective mechanism, the challenge of data security and privacy should be addressed. Federated learning in the vehicular network is appealing for utilizing individual vehicle data while preserving data privacy. We propose an improved local differential privacy-based federated learning approach for modeling charging session prediction problems while preserving user privacy against the threat from a honest-but-curious server. In this approach, all vehicles, within the coordination of a cloud server, collaboratively establish a global regression network through parameter exchange. Meanwhile, the servers may belong to third-party model owners and can be semi-honest when inferring private information on the collected model parameters. Hence, local differential privacy is adopted to perturb the parameters. Additionally, a combination of local and global models via elastic synchronization is proposed to improve the accuracy of the learned noisy global model. Through the test on a real data set, the results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over traditional noisy federated learning methods. Furthermore, the practical value of the proposed method is validated with a real-world charging case. Such an accurate charging session prediction service for electric vehicle drivers facilitates charging and travel convenience in the green transportation world.}

	abstract = {Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proven as an efficient and low-cost solution for monitoring various kind of applications. However, the massive amount of data collected and transmitted by the sensor nodes, which are mostly redundant, will quickly consume their limited battery power, which is sometimes difficult to replace or recharge. Although the huge efforts made by researchers to solve such problem, most of the proposed techniques suffer from their accuracy and their complexity, which is not suitable for limited-resources sensors. Therefore, designing new data reduction techniques to reduce the raw data collected in such networks is becoming essential to increase their lifetime. In this paper, we propose a CLuster-based node correlation for sAmpling Rate adaptation and fAult tolerance, abbreviated CLARA, mechanism dedicated to periodic sensor network applications. Mainly, CLARA works on two stages: node correlation and fault tolerance. The first stage introduces a data clustering method that aims to search the correlation among neighboring nodes. Then, it accordingly adapts their sensing frequencies in a way to reduce the amount of data collected in such networks while preserving the information integrity at the sink. In the second stage, a fault tolerance model is proposed that allows the sink to regenerate the raw sensor data based on two methods: moving average (MA) and exponential smoothing (ES). We demonstrated the efficiency of our technique through both simulations and experiments. The best obtained results show that the first stage can reduce the sensor sampling rate, and accordingly the sensor energy, up to 64% while the second stage can accurately regenerate the raw data with an error loss less than 0.15.}

	abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, the demand for efficient parking surveillance solutions has increased. However, existing solutions often face challenges related to energy consumption, scalability, and reliability. This paper introduces a smart hybrid parking surveillance system integrating wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with vision based solution at the edge for resource constrained IoT devices to address these challenges. The solution leverages WSNs for periodic readings of parking space occupancy and introduces a low power sleep mode in the network for energy efficiency, along with optical verification strategies using computer vision models like R-CNN and Faster R-CNN FPN on ResNet50 and MobileNetv2 backbones for distinguishing between true and false positives in the WSN data for a greater accuracy in parking space occupancy. The system utilizes edge for computing on edge servers resulting in increased responsiveness of the system, reduced data transmission and real time processing of data. The proposed solution is formulated in such a way that it automatically switches between WSN and vision based sensing resulting in less energy consumption and longer lifespan of the system without compromising on accuracy. Through experimental results it is observed that models trained on the MobileNetv2 backbone demonstrated at least twice faster for both processing the images and training compared to those models trained on the ResNet backbone. On the other hand, both Faster R-CNN FPN (input resolution: 1440) and R-CNN (input resolution: 128) models trained on the MobileNetv2 backbone have slightly lower accuracies than the same models trained on the ResNet50 backbone.}

The paper discusses the implementation of using iBeacons and Long Range (LoRa) technology to locating the student position and ensure his safety in the school campus. It uses Internet of Things (IoT) approach in real time to monitor and locate the student presence in the school compound. This paper unveils an innovative design for a campus security system that harnesses the LoRa technology. In the system, the students are equipped with devices containing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to capture and transmit real-time location data. The system response time to locating student in abnormal locations such as cornered and concealed areas is about one second. By extending this system to cover all individuals on campus, a closely monitored environment and areas is enabled that significantly bolstering the security measures. This not only furnishes a dynamic protective layer for educational institutions but also serves as a proactive deterrent against potential security breaches. Ultimately, this research underscores the transformative potential of merging IoT with campus security to ushering in a new era of student safety. LoRa technology offers advantages in battery life, cost-effectiveness, deployment flexibility, and network coverage etc. Therefore, this paper ultimately provides a method of how to utilize the LoRa technology to develop a campus security system. Unlike artificial intelligence (AI)-based image recognition, which raises concerns about privacy and human rights; the features of LoRa’s long-range communication and low power consumption make it a more suitable choice.}

They are deployed from sensors to the cloud over a geographical and computing continuum, which is challenging for service orchestration and DevOps strategies. The distributed infrastructure to implement the end-to-end data path may vary, even for similar applications, concerning the services deployed over the mist, fog, edge, and cloud stages. This paper proposes and evaluates IoTDeploy, a solution for streamlining and scaling static and dynamic IoT service deployment over the continuum. IoTDeploy implements a CI/CD tool plugin for deploying applications running on the continuum and supports dynamic service migration. We evaluated the service migration from cloud to fog and fog to cloud with a case study on smart irrigation in agriculture. The experiments reveal that deployment in IoT-distributed environments is reliable and resilient, enabling migration without interrupting the application and losing data.}

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) play a vital role in the Internet of Things (IoT) and show great potential in monitoring applications. However, due to harsh environmental conditions and unreliable communication links, WSN often encounter partial data loss during data collection, which inevitably affects the quality of service. To address this challenge, researchers have employed matrix completion techniques to recover missing data by exploiting the low-rank features in the data, but its accuracy is not satisfactory. This paper argues that the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data underlie its low-rank nature, enabling a more accurate capture of the intrinsic patterns within the data. Drawing on this insight, we propose a missing data recovery algorithm based on Temporal Smoothness and Time-Varying Similarity (TSTVS). Unlike traditional low-rank methods, the TSTVS algorithm directly utilizes the structural features of data in the spatiotemporal domain to establish a missing data completion model. Subsequently, the model is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem using the penalty function method, and the gradient descent method is applied to solve it, reconstructing the complete data matrix. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted on three real-world monitoring datasets, comparing the TSTVS with three low-rank methods, Efficient Data Collection Approach (EDCA), Matrix factorization with Smoothness constraints (MFS) and Data Recovery Based on Low Rank and Short-Term Stability(DRLRSS). The experimental results indicate that the proposed TSTVS algorithm consistently outperforms the three low-rank based algorithms in terms of recovery accuracy across different datasets and missing rate scenarios.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly integrated into daily life, particularly in healthcare, through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT devices support services like continuous health monitoring but raise significant cybersecurity concerns due to their vulnerability to various attacks. The complexity and data volume of IoMT network traffic requires advanced methods to enhance security and reliability. Machine Learning (ML) offers techniques to detect, prevent, and mitigate cyberattacks. However, existing benchmark datasets lack essential features for robust IoMT security solutions, such as a reduced number of real devices, a limited variety of attacks, and a lack of extensive profiling. We propose a realistic benchmark dataset for IoMT security solutions development and evaluation to address these gaps. We executed 18 attacks on an IoMT testbed with 40 devices (25 real and 15 simulated), using protocols like Wi-Fi, MQTT, and Bluetooth. Supporting technologies, including dedicated network traffic collectors and a Faraday Cage, ensured data quality. The attacks fall into five categories: DDoS, DoS, Recon, MQTT, and spoofing. We aim to establish a baseline that complements existing datasets, aiding researchers in creating secure healthcare systems using ML. Beyond simulating attacks, we capture the lifecycle of IoMT devices from network entry to exit through profiling, allowing classifiers to identify device anomalies. The resulting CICIoMT2024 dataset, published on the CIC dataset page, demonstrates that various methods can classify IoMT cyberattacks. This effort supports new IoMT security solutions and contributes to the broader field of cybersecurity in healthcare, ensuring more reliable IoMT device deployment.}

Initially, it introduces a data sensing framework for the agricultural Internet of Things, which integrates cloud and edge computing. Subsequently, it reviews the sensors commonly deployed in agricultural scenarios. Then, common methods for collaborative sensing of agricultural data were discussed from three aspects: intra-node, multiple nodes, and cross-domain. At the same time, the issues of data security and privacy in data collaborative sensing were discussed. Next, we integrate multi-dimensional technology to construct an application case for data sensing in the agricultural IoT.

In conventional farming, crops may be affected by various diseases due to inadequate irrigation scheduling. Recent proposals have suggested using Edge-IoT, AI, and distributed computing to accelerate the inference procedure utilized in smart irrigation applications. The use of resource-constrained edge servers and edge devices used to deliver smart agriculture applications can cause latency-sensitive workloads to interfere with one another. To address this issue, we design a long-range (LoRa) edge IoT computing-based sustainable and customized smart irrigation framework to capture the real-time data of tomato plants. This helps in automatic underground drip irrigation scheduling. This also predicts total water demand and usage, and measure plant growth status. The edge-IoT cloud data transmission control and optimization has been enforced using Smart irrigation data optimization and robust transmission (SIDORT) Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) system. We develop a hybrid algorithm named Linked least traversal (LLT) for machine-to-machine communication (M2M). Also, a Reinforcement learning (RL) based Optimal Soil Wetness Closeness Policy (OSWCP) for irrigation scheduling has been proposed. The performance of the proposed smart irrigation models has been validated through extensive experiments using real-time data in which OSWCP performance has been measured at a 97.88 % accuracy rate.

The data collected by the IoT devices are transmitted over a network, for processing and analyzing that data, so that appropriate actions can be initiated. Security of IoT systems is a major concern, as IoT devices collect and transmit crucial information. But images captured in low-light environments pose a challenge for IoT security by limiting the ability to accurately identify objects and people, increasing the risk of spoofing, and hindering forensic analysis. This paper unfolds a novel framework for IoT security using Steganography in Low-light Environment (IoTSLE) by image enhancement and data concealment. In proposed IoTSLE, initially, the low-light images, captured by the IoT devices in a low-light environment, are enhanced by band learning with recursion and band recomposition. After that, the secret information is concealed within the enhanced image. This concealment is supervised by using a specially designed finite automata for genome sequence encoding and 2-2-2 embedding. The proposed steganography technique is capable of hiding secret information within a 512 × 512 RGB image with the payload of 2 097 152 bits. The experiments like, PSNR, SSIM, Q-Index, BER, NCC, and NAE etc. are conducted to analyze the imperceptibility and security of IoTSLE. The proposed IoTSLE is useful for various IoT systems in different private and government fields like, defense agencies, digital forensics, agriculture, healthcare industry, cybersecurity firms, smart home, smart city etc.}

	abstract = {Video streaming has become increasingly dominant in internet traffic and daily applications, significantly influenced by emerging technologies such as autonomous cars, augmented reality, and immersive videos. The computing community has extensively discussed aspects like latency, device power consumption, 5G, and computing. The advent of 6G technology, an emerging communication paradigm beyond existing technologies, promises to revolutionize these areas with enhanced bandwidth, reduced latency, and advanced connectivity features. Fog and Edge Computing environments intensify data generation, control, and analysis at the network edge. Consequently, adopting metrics such as QoE (Quality of Experience) and QoS (Quality of Service) is crucial for developing adaptive streaming services that dynamically adjust video quality based on network conditions. This work systematically maps the literature on video streaming approaches in Fog and Edge Computing that utilize QoS and QoE metrics to evaluate performance in managing Live Streaming and Streaming on Demand. The results highlight the most used metrics and discuss resource management strategies, providing valuable insights for developing new approaches and enhancing existing communication protocols like DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) and HLS (HTTP Live Streaming).}

	abstract = {The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Metaverse is revolutionizing the digital world by providing immersive, interactive environments as well as new data transmission opportunities. However, this rapid integration raises complex security issues, including an increased risk of unlawful access and data breaches. Strong cybersecurity measures are required to identify and prevent these attacks, preserving the security and confidentiality of users. Finding significant features for recognizing malicious attacks and enhancing the accuracy of network intrusion detection in general, and particularly in the virtual environment, are some of the significant research needs. This paper introduces an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) based on rough set-based electric eel foraging optimization (RSEEFO) in conjunction with the AdaBoost-based classification algorithm. The main objective of this system is to detect and recognize different types of attacks on the interaction and connectivity between the IoT and the metaverse. The proposed IIDS-RSEEFO consists of three phases, which are data pre-processing, multi-IoT attack classification, and evaluation. The main problems associated with the adopted dataset are handled in data pre-processing. Then, in the second phase, a one-versus-all approach is employed along with RSEEFO and AdaBoost to handle the multi-class classification problem. Finally, several evaluation metrics are employed to assess the reliability and robustness of the proposed IIDS-RSEEFO. The proposed IIDS was tested on CIC-IoT-2023 and validated on UNSWNB-15. It achieved high accuracy across all attack types of CIC-IoT-2023, with accuracies of 99.7 %, 100 %, 100 %, 99.8 %, 100 %, 100 %, 99.8 %, and 100 % for benign traffic, DDoS, brute force, spoofing, DoS, Mirai, recon, and web-Based respectively, accompanied by robust sensitivity, F1-Score, Specificity, G-Mean, and crossover-error rate metrics demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting each attack type. Additionally, it obtained high accuracy for all attack types of UNSWNB-15, with accuracies of 96.48 %, 99.12 %, 99.24 %, 93.78 %, 92.55 %, 92.55 %, 92.55 %, 94.73 %, 94.73 %, 98.09 %, 98.39 %, 99.50 %, and 99.95 % for analysis, backdoor, DoS, exploits, fuzzers, generic, normal, reconnaissance, shellcode, and worms, respectively. In addition, the results evaluated that the proposed model is superior compared to the existing intrusion detection systems.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the healthcare system by connecting medical sensors to the internet, while also posing challenges to the security of medical sensor networks (MSN). Given the extreme sensitivity of medical data, any vulnerability may result in data breaches and misuse, impacting patient safety and privacy. Therefore, safeguarding MSN security is critical. As medical sensor devices rely on smart healthcare software systems for data management and communication, precisely detecting system code vulnerabilities is essential to ensuring network security. Effective software vulnerability detection targets two key objectives: (i) achieving high accuracy and (ii) directly identifying vulnerable code lines for developers to fix. To address these challenges, we introduce Vulcoder, a novel vulnerability-oriented, encoder-driven model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture. We propose a one-to-one mapping function to capture code semantics through abstract syntax trees (AST). Combined with multi-head attention, Vulcoder achieves precise function- and line-level detection of software vulnerabilities in MSN. This accelerates the vulnerability remediation process, thereby strengthening network security. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that Vulcoder outperforms previous models in identifying vulnerabilities within MSN. Specifically, it achieves a 1%–419% improvement in function-level prediction F1 scores and a 12.5%–380% increase in line-level localization precision. Therefore, Vulcoder helps enhance security defenses and safeguard patient privacy in MSN, facilitating the development of smart healthcare.}

The IEEE 802.15.6 standard governs these networks but falls short in practical MBAN scenarios. This paper introduces ASAP, a Lightweight Authenticated Secure Association Protocol integrated with IEEE 802.15.6. ASAP prioritizes patient privacy with randomized node ID generation and temporary shared keys, preventing node tracking and privacy violations. It optimizes network performance by consolidating Master Keys (MK), Pairwise Temporal Keys (PTK), and Group Temporal Keys (GTK) creation into a unified process, ensuring the efficiency of the standard four-message association protocol. ASAP enhances security by eliminating the need for pre-shared keys, reducing the attack surface, and improving forward secrecy. The protocol achieves mutual authentication without pre-shared keys or passwords and supports advanced cryptographic algorithms on nodes with limited processing capabilities. Additionally, it imposes connection initiation restrictions, requiring valid certificates for nodes, thereby addressing gaps in IEEE 802.15.6. Formal verification using Verifpal confirms ASAP's resilience against various attacks. Implementation results show ASAP's superiority over standard IEEE 802.15.6 protocols, establishing it as a robust solution for securing MBAN communications in medical environments.}

	abstract = {Training a deep learning model generally requires a huge amount of memory and processing power. Once trained, the learned model can make predictions very fast with very little resource consumption. The learned weights can be fitted into a microcontroller to build affordable embedded intelligence systems which is also known as TinyML. Although few attempts have been made, the limits of the state-of-the-art training of a deep learning model within a microcontroller can be pushed further. Generally deep learning models are trained with gradient optimizers which predict with high accuracy but require a very high amount of resources. On the other hand, nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimizers can be used to build a fast approximation of the model’s optimal solution with low resources. After a rigorous test, we have found that Grey Wolf Optimizer can be modified for enhanced uses of main memory, paging and swap space among\nα\n,\nβ\n,\nδ\nand\nω\nwolves. This modification saved up to 71% memory requirements compared to gradient optimizers. We have used this modification to train the TinyML model within a microcontroller of 256KB RAM. The performances of the proposed framework have been meticulously benchmarked on 13 open-sourced datasets.}

However, a new wave of IoT applications exhibit stricter requirements in terms of bandwidth and latency. Broadband technologies like Wi-Fi could meet such requirements. Nevertheless, these technologies come with limitations: high energy consumption and limited coverage range. In order to address these two shortcomings, and based on the recent IEEE 802.11ba amendment, we propose a Wi-Fi-based mesh architecture where devices are outfitted with a supplementary Wake-up Radio (WuR) interface. According to our analytical and simulation studies, this design maintains latency figures comparable to conventional single-interface networks while significantly reducing energy consumption (by up to almost two orders of magnitude). Additionally, we verify via real device measurements that battery lifetime can be increased by as much as 500% with our approach.}

The study emphasizes the importance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for continuous threat monitoring. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of feature selection (FS) methods using various machine learning (ML) techniques for classifying traffic flows within datasets containing intrusions in IoT environments. An extensive benchmark analysis of ML techniques and FS methods was performed, assessing feature selection under different approaches including Filter Feature Ranking (FFR), Filter-Feature Subset Selection (FSS), and Wrapper-based Feature Selection (WFS). FS becomes pivotal in handling vast IoT data by reducing irrelevant attributes, addressing the curse of dimensionality, enhancing model interpretability, and optimizing resources in devices with limited capacity. Key findings indicate the outperformance for traffic flows classification of certain tree-based algorithms, such as J48 or PART, against other machine learning techniques (naive Bayes, multi-layer perceptron, logistic, adaptive boosting or k-Nearest Neighbors), showcasing a good balance between performance and execution time. FS methods' advantages and drawbacks are discussed, highlighting the main differences in results obtained among different FS approaches. Filter-feature Subset Selection (FSS) approaches such as CFS could be more suitable than Filter Feature Ranking (FFR), which may select correlated attributes, or than Wrapper-based Feature Selection (WFS) methods, which may tailor attribute subsets for specific ML techniques and have lengthy execution times. In any case, reducing attributes via FS has allowed optimization of classification without compromising accuracy. In this study, F1 score classification results above 0.99, along with a reduction of over 60% in the number of attributes, have been achieved in most experiments conducted across four datasets, both in binary and multiclass modes. This work emphasizes the importance of a balanced attribute selection process, taking into account threat detection capabilities and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Kubernetes has revolutionized traditional monolithic Internet of Things (IoT) applications into lightweight, decentralized, and independent microservices, thus becoming the de facto standard in the realm of container orchestration. Intelligent and efficient container placement in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is challenging subjected to user mobility, and surplus but heterogeneous computing resources. One solution to constantly altering user location is to relocate containers closer to the user; however, this leads to additional underutilized active nodes and increases migration’s computational overhead. On the contrary, few to no migrations are attributed to higher latency, thus degrading the Quality of Service (QoS). To tackle these challenges, we created a framework named EdgeBus1, which enables the co-simulation of container resource management in heterogeneous MEC environments based on Kubernetes. It enables the assessment of the impact of container migrations on resource management, energy, and latency. Further, we propose a mobility and migration cost-aware (MANGO) lightweight scheduler for efficient container management by incorporating migration cost, CPU cores, and memory usage for container scheduling. For user mobility, the Cabspotting dataset is employed, which contains real-world traces of taxi mobility in San Francisco. In the EdgeBus framework, we have created a simulated environment aided with a real-world testbed using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to measure the performance of the MANGO scheduler in comparison to baseline schedulers such as IMPALA-based MobileKube, Latency Greedy, and Binpacking. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the MANGO in terms of latency and number of migrations.}

	abstract = {According to previous studies, one of the major causes of 20 % to 25 % of neonatal deaths is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Early identification, progressive monitoring, and treatment and/or management of neonatal RDS can substantially increase the rate of survival in neonates. However, global research indicates frequent shortages and burnout among nursing staff, especially in postpartum units, contributing to the difficulty in early identification of RDS in neonates. Clinicians currently use breathing sounds and frequency as key criteria in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) for identifying and treating RDS. In practice, the monitoring of respiratory signal abnormalities relies on sensor patches, which frequently detach from the neonates’ slippery skin, leading to potential skin injuries and unstable signal reception. This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-based contactless neonatal respiratory monitoring system that integrates computer vision (CV), beamforming microphone array (BFMA), and millimeter Wave (mmWave) radar, all connected to a cloud platform. Clinical trials revealed that CV-based neonatal feature identification achieved over 96 % accuracy within 40 cm to 120 cm. The neonatal breathing sound strengthening, utilized CV and BFMA, achieved an average sound-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5.07 dB, and CV with mmWave radar reduced chest displacement signal error from 0.66 to 0.26 BPM. Additionally, survey results showed that doctors and clinical personnel were satisfied with the system's functionality and usability. This demonstrates the system's ability to assist in monitoring respiratory signals of swaddled neonates and in the early identification of neonatal RDS, with further applications in neonatal care at postpartum centers.}

	abstract = {The relentless advancements in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have paved the way for various practical applications across networking, public safety, smart transportation, and industrial sectors. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates these technologies into complex, interconnected environments where vast amounts of data are transmitted between devices and systems. However, the inherent openness of communication channels in IIoT systems introduces distinctive security and privacy vulnerabilities, where malevolent entities can effortlessly intercept, forge, or delete communication messages. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the critical nature of industrial applications, where breaches can lead to significant operational disruptions or safety hazards To address these challenges, several authentication protocols have been proposed. Nevertheless, many of these protocols remain susceptible to various security attacks. To ensure privacy and security in IIoT environments, we introduce a robust and efficient authentication protocol for a WSN-based IIoT environment. This protocol preserves the privacy of information transmitted among all entities and provides an effective solution for securing this sensitive information. Additionally, we present a detailed security analysis of the proposed protocol to formally and informally demonstrate its security strength. The performance analysis is carried out to compare the proposed protocol against existing related protocols, with results unequivocally demonstrating that our protocol offers enhanced privacy and security with reduced costs.}

	abstract = {Acoustic noise pollution is one of many problems people face as cities grow. Long-term noise exposure can result in a series of physical and mental health diseases that are highly harmful to foetuses and newborns. Hence, many IoT-based wireless sensor network systems have been proposed for automated monitoring for long-term operation. However, these systems suffer from weaknesses in functionality, power consumption, costs, and scalability, which hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a distributed hierarchical wireless acoustic sensor network for environmental noise monitoring to do sound classification and A-weighted sound-pressure-level measurement to address the shortcomings of existing systems. A series of tests and comparisons are performed in diagnosing the performance with respect to recording continuity, packet loss, recording quality, accuracy on A-weighted sound pressure level calculations, and costs. Results show that this proposed network structure is feasible as a part of hardware implementation in a large-scale, low-cost, and high-scalable environmental noise monitoring system to classify sound.}

	abstract = {The paper presents a novel approach for biometric continuous driver authentication (CDA) for secure and safe transportation using wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and deep learning. Conventional one-time authentication (OTA) methods, while effective for initial identity verification, fail to continuously verify the driver’s identity during vehicle operation, potentially leading to safety, security, and accountability issues. To address this, we propose a system that employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict subsequent PPG values from wrist-worn devices and continuously compare them with real-time sensor data for authentication. Our system calculates a confidence level representing the probability that the current user is the authorized driver, ensuring robust availability to genuine users while detecting impersonation attacks. The raw PPG data is directly fed into the LSTM model without pre-processing, ensuring lightweight processing. We validated our system with PPG data from 15 volunteers driving for 15 min in varied conditions. The system achieves an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4.8%. Our results demonstrate that the system is a viable solution for CDA in dynamic environments, ensuring transparency, efficiency, accuracy, robust availability, and lightweight processing. Thus, our approach addresses the main challenges of classical driver authentication systems and effectively safeguards passengers and goods with robust driver authentication.}

We present a systematic literature review (SLR) examining the relationship between the two by thoroughly reviewing the available articles in these two specific areas. Our main novel contribution is to discover a complementary relationship between resource scheduling and distributed learning. We find that the resource scheduling techniques are utilized for distributed machine learning (DML) in edge networks, while distributed reinforcement learning (RL) is used as an optimization technique for resource scheduling in edge networks. Other key contributions of the SLR include: (1) presenting a detailed taxonomy on resource scheduling and distributed learning in edge computing, (2) reviewing articles on resource scheduling for DML and distributed RL for resource scheduling, mapping them to the taxonomy, and classifying them into broad categories, and (3) discussing the future research directions as well as the challenges arising from the integration of new technologies with resource scheduling and distributed learning in edge networks.}

However, the heterogeneous nature of smart grid load forecasting introduces significant challenges that current methods struggle to address, particularly for resource-constrained devices due to high computational and communication demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Adaptive Single Layer Aggregation (ASLA) framework tailored for resource-constrained smart grid networks. The ASLA framework mitigates data heterogeneity issues by focusing on local learning and incorporating partial updates from local devices for model aggregation in adaptive manner. It is optimized for resource-constrained environments through the implementation of a stopping criterion during model training and weight quantization. Our evaluation on two distinct datasets demonstrates that quantization results in a minimal loss function degradation of 0.01% for Data 1 and 1.25% for Data 2. Furthermore, local model layer optimization for aggregation achieves substantial communication cost reductions of 829.2-fold for Data 1 and 5522-fold for Data 2. The use of an 8-bit fixed-point representation for neural network weights leads to a 75% reduction in storage/memory requirements and decreases computational costs by replacing complex floating-point units with simpler fixed-point units. By addressing data heterogeneity and reducing storage, computation, and communication overheads, the ASLA framework is well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained smart grid networks.}

	abstract = {Ensuring strong security measures against intrusions is of utmost importance in the ever-changing field of information management systems. Conventional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) frequently have difficulties in dealing with the ever-changing and intricate characteristics of contemporary cyber threats, particularly in the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). The current body of research emphasizes the difficulties in attaining both high precision and real-time speed while still preserving the anonymity of data. This work tackles these concerns by presenting a scalable multi-model Machine Learning (ML) technique developed to improve real-time intrusion detection and ensure safe cryptographic key distribution. The suggested solution takes use of the widespread use of IoT devices, which increases the likelihood of advanced cyberattacks. Our approach involves implementing a ML-based automated IDS specifically designed for various IoT environments. These IDS enhance adaptability and accuracy. We also utilize Maximum–Minimum (Max–Min) normalization on the UNSW-NB15 and CICIoT2023 datasets to improve the accuracy of detecting intrusions. Furthermore, we classify a wide range of contemporary threats and typical internet traffic into nine distinct attack categories. To streamline data processing and improve system efficiency, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Additionally, we deploy six advanced ML models to optimize detection capabilities and accurately identify threats. Finally, we develop a secure key distribution mechanism using synchronized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The process of mutual learning guarantees the secure distribution of keys among IoT networks, thus reducing the risks to secrecy. This novel methodology not only reinforces the ability to identify intrusions in real-time, but also improves the overall security stance of information management systems. This work significantly contributes to the field of digital security in information management by addressing the limits of current IDS solutions and presenting a complete, multi-faceted security strategy.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is proliferating in technology and automation. Some popular IoT applications include environmental monitoring, home automation, agriculture, aquaculture, healthcare, transportation, and logistics. The construction of the IoT system is determined by where it will be used. The design can be tailor-made for short-range or long-range communication, rural or urban areas, indoor or outdoor applications, real-time or delay-tolerant communication, and much more. Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are frequently used for long-distance, energy-efficient, cost-effective communication. In LPWAN technology, Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is one of the most popular choices because of its remarkable features and openness, making it highly suitable for IoT applications. However, despite its exceptional features, there are still ways to optimize the system to become more efficient and address several challenges during runtime. One possible way to address issues and challenges in LoRaWAN is through cross-layer optimization. This optimization technique violates the restrictions set by the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model and gives freedom to its protocol layers to communicate depending on the intended purpose. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art cross-layer approaches that optimize LoRaWAN for IoT applications. The cross-layer approaches were categorized according to the layer combinations and architecture. In addition, this paper provided observations on the effects of cross-layer optimization in LoRaWAN. Lastly, possible issues and solutions, challenges, and future directives from cross-layer optimization approaches were included.}

However, the literature in this field remains scattered among heterogeneous applications ranging from the digital twinning of a heart to that of a city’s population health. Although recent reviews may have provided better structure for literature understanding, a typology of healthcare DTs as well as evaluation and implementation guidelines are still missing. Therefore, this article provides a structured review of literature as well as a three-tiered taxonomy and evaluation system to better assess the current state of research on DTs in healthcare and facilitate comparisons among models sharing similar core characteristics. First, we provide a comprehensive review of case studies and use case frameworks in literature and industry based on their hierarchical level of reality, application purpose, and maturity or sophistication of models. Second, we provide an analysis of the maturity and sophistication of models by application type to highlight particular characteristics and facilitate discussion of future opportunities and improvement paths. The proposed classification of reviewed articles provides a better overview of the most studied types of models in research and facilitates the understanding of their potential use in healthcare settings, but is also extendable to other fields as well, as it aims to regroup models in a way that is coherent with existing models in industry.}

	abstract = {Efficient content caching in video streaming services is important for improving user experience as well as reducing network bandwidth consumption. Fog caching combined with scalable video coding (SVC) has the potential to significantly improve caching efficiency. However, challenges such as the limited storage capacity of fog nodes and determining the optimal number of SVC layers must be overcome for their effective adoption. This becomes more complicated with multiple content providers requiring shared cache resources. To the best of our knowledge, no existing research has simultaneously tackled all these aspects. In this paper, we present Cluster-based Cooperative Fog Caching (CCo-Fog), a holistic caching strategy that enables multiple content providers to share the scarce storage of fog nodes in a multi-tier fog network to judiciously cache SVC videos in a cooperative manner. In particular, CCo-Fog consists of a cluster-based storage partitioning method and tier-wise cooperative content placement policies. The partitioning method distributes the storage of each fog node to multiple content providers for users clustered based on their population density and their proximity to fog nodes. The content placement policies determine the optimal number of SVC layers of each video for different tiers of the fog network by solving a latency-aware content placement optimization problem. Our evaluations on a real-world dataset and various configurations demonstrate the efficacy of CCo-Fog, showing a reduction in latency by about 60% and an increase in fog hit ratio by about 20% on average, compared to state-of-the-art caching strategies.}

Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the study identifies three primary findings: (1) IoT applications directly enhance power source management in the environmental domain, improving Business Strategy and Long-term Growth (BSLG) and Measurement and Reporting (M&R) capabilities. This is achieved through real-time monitoring, smart building management, and predictive maintenance. In the social sphere, IoT strengthens supply chain transparency, bolstering Stakeholder Management (SM) through real-time tracking and blockchain-integrated systems for product authenticity verification. IoT comprehensively empowers performing risk management in the governance realm, improving Organizational Culture (OC) through early warning systems and predictive analytics for risk mitigation. (2) IoT integration facilitates Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM), Real-Time Responsiveness (RTR), and Business Risk Management (BRM), key components of IoT-DMC. Furthermore, it supports the development of Effective Stakeholder Management (ESM), Resource Efficiency (RE), and Sustainable Competitive Outcomes (SCO) within IoT-CSL. (3) While highlighting the potential of IoT in advancing CSL, the research also acknowledges challenges such as initial investment costs, data privacy concerns, technological complexity, energy consumption of IoT devices, and electronic waste management.

However, semantic communication systems under varying channel condition have not been well studied, especially for tasks that require reliability guarantee. This paper focus on the reliability-guarantee image reconstruction tasks, and study the computation and transmission adaptive semantic communication. First, a computation and transmission adaptive semantic communication (CTASC) system is proposed. It is able to adjust the computation load and transmission load of an image reconstruction task adaptively while guaranteeing the reconstruction reliability. Specifically, a semantic encoder with multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) slices with different network depths is designed to adjust the transmission load and computation load. Second, a joint computation and transmission resource allocation problem aimed at minimizing the maximum delay within system is formulated. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two nested sub-problems and propose a Simulated Annealing with Re-perturbation Mechanism (SA-RPM) algorithm and an Alternating Optimization (AO) algorithm to solve these sub-problems, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to variable code length enabled DeepJSCC (DeepJSCC-V), our system can achieve higher compression ratio(CR) with similar LPIPS performance. Simulation results also show that our resource allocation scheme can obtain an approaching value to the optimal maximum delay, with an average difference not exceeding 0.2%.}

Guaranteeing the quality of image data transmission while saving the amount of transmitted data by edge-end devices has become one of the key issues in modern IIOT. As an efficient new communication method, semantic communication technology can significantly improve the transmission efficiency by focusing on the intrinsic meaning of the transmitted data. In this paper, a semantic communication model is proposed for the modern intelligent warehouse environment, using the ray tracing method to obtain its channel characteristic parameters, according to the obtained channel characteristic parameters to establish an end-to-end semantic communication scheme applicable to the warehouse environment, to achieve the optimization of the communication process transmission. Simulation analysis shows that compared with the traditional communication scheme, the proposed scheme can still achieve a structural similarity index higher than 0.8 when the transmission signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is less than 6 dB, which effectively improves the image reconstruction quality compared with the traditional compression scheme.}

	abstract = {The continuous development of mobile networks poses new challenges for end devices with limited computing power. Mobile or multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been proposed for providing the computing resources close to the end devices that need them. However, in real network environments, MEC servers also have limited computing resources that need to be shared among many devices and efficient resource allocation is critical to ensure that the limited resources are optimally used. In view of this, we propose the Balanced Offload for Multi-type Tasks (BOMT) algorithm. The tasks to be offloaded are first prioritized according to their type, size and maximum tolerable delay; then different offloading algorithms are executed for different priority tasks according to the level of the priority and the current load on the MEC server. Following which, the optimal offloading policy is determined iteratively. Simulation results show that BOMT can effectively reduce system delay, increase user coverage and offload task completion rates.}

	abstract = {Activity recognition refers to the process of automatically identifying or interpreting activities of objects based on the data captured from different sensing devices. While previous research on indoor activity recognition predominantly relies on visual data like images or video recordings, we present a novel approach based on spatiotemporal trajectory data recorded by IoT based sensors. The proposed approach is tailored for indoor manufacturing applications leveraging trajectory partitioning, hierarchical clustering, and convolutional neural networks. Moreover, a vast majority of activity recognition models that have been used in different industrial settings are supervised methods requiring large manually labelled datasets to be collected. This manual annotation process is unwieldly and labour-intensive, and hence, often infeasible to deploy for practical applications. In contrast, our proposed activity recognition approach is semi-supervised meaning it can be trained with far less labelled data; significantly reducing the effort and costs associated with the manual annotation process. The proposed approach is evaluated using two indoor trajectory datasets related to different manufacturing assembly processes. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness for activity recognition: the classification accuracy (measured using F-score) varies between 0.81 to 0.95 and 0.88 to 0.92 across indoor trajectory datasets. A comparison with a baseline model indicates that it achieves up to a 18% improvement in classification accuracy. Furthermore, the classification results enable insights into factory floor states, aiding in decision-making for operational efficiency and resource allocation.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the sensor selection problem for source localization within cyber–physical systems (CPSs). While recent machine learning and reinforcement learning approaches aim to optimize sensor selection and placement within the Area of Interest (AoI), their need for intensive data collection and training precludes online operation. Furthermore, these methods often require prior knowledge of the unknown source’s characteristics and lack adaptability to the dynamic nature of CPSs, leading to inefficiencies in unseen environments. This paper addresses these shortcomings using Gaussian process Optimization coupled with an active sensor selection mechanism to locate the unknown source within the AoI. The proposed approach first builds a probabilistic model of the environment, which is discretized into a grid, without prior training using a Gaussian Process surrogate model. Next, the model iteratively and systematically learns the underlying spatial phenomenon using Gaussian Process optimization. Concurrently, the approach selects a subset of sensors by optimizing a fitness function that advocates selecting informative and energy-efficient sensors. Next, the probabilistic model, having accurately learned the environment, directs the algorithm to the unknown source by identifying the cell with the highest likelihood of containing it. Finally, a peak refinement step is performed, which computes the exact location of the source within the designated cell. The proposed method’s efficacy is validated through experiments in radioactive source localization, validation studies, and adaptability assessments across various environments. In terms of quality of localization (QoL), it outperforms recent localization benchmarks, such as a reinforcement learning-based approach and DANS, by around 18% and 100%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are widely used to authenticate electronic devices because they take advantage of random variations in the manufacturing process that are unique to each device and cannot be cloned. Therefore, each device can be uniquely identified and counterfeit devices can be detected. Weak PUFs, which support a relatively small number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs), are simple and easy to construct. Device authentication with weak PUFs typically uses helper data to obfuscate and recover a cryptographic key that is then required by a cryptographic authentication scheme. However, these schemes are vulnerable to helper-data attacks and many of them do not protect conveniently the PUF responses, which are sensitive data, as well as are not resistant to attacks performed by quantum computers. This paper proposes an authentication scheme that avoids the aforementioned weaknesses by not using helper data, protecting the PUF response with a quantum-safe homomorphic encryption, and by using a two-server setup. Specifically, the CRYSTALS-Kyber public key cryptographic algorithm is used for its quantum resistance and suitability for resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The practicality of the proposal was tested on an ESP32 microcontroller using its internal SRAM as a SRAM PUF. For PUF responses of 512 bits, the encryption execution time ranges from 16.41 ms to 41.08 ms, depending on the desired level of security. In terms of memory, the device only needs to store between 800 and 1,568 bytes. This makes the solution post-quantum secure, lightweight and affordable for IoT devices with limited computing, memory, and power resources.}

These safety messages convey vital information about traffic conditions, enabling drivers to take necessary measures to prevent accidents. The timely and reliable delivery of these messages is essential, necessitating efficient channel access. Vehicular Deterministic Access (VDA) is employed as a channel access scheme with distinct priorities and stringent timing guidelines, particularly for urgent safety warnings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines VDA and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols, along with a message prioritization algorithm, to ensure efficient and reliable communication of safety messages in vehicular networks. Our approach leverages the strengths of both VDA and CSMA/CA to avoid message collisions; VDA is more efficient under high traffic loads, while CSMA/CA is better suited for low traffic loads. Additionally, the incorporation of the message prioritization algorithm ensures strict deadline guarantees for high-priority messages, such as Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENMs). We evaluate our proposed solution using the Artery simulation framework. Our results show over a 93% delivery rate for DENM exchanges while maintaining low collision probability across various traffic loads. This research provides practical guidance for the development of efficient and reliable communication systems for CAVs. It also offers a detailed analysis of the trade-offs among different access protocols and message prioritization strategies in vehicular networks.}

PQ-IoTCrypt builds upon the binary ring learning with errors problem, incorporating optimizations for efficient implementation on 8-bit microcontrollers commonly found in IoT environments. We introduce a symmetric discrete uniform distribution and streamlined polynomial arithmetic to reduce computational overhead while maintaining a high-security level. Additionally, we present a comprehensive power side-channel analysis framework for lattice-based post-quantum cryptography, demonstrating PQ-IoTCrypt's resilience against various side-channel attacks, including advanced ciphertext selection criteria, IoT-optimized template creation, and a hierarchical chosen-ciphertext attack methodology tailored for IoT deployments. Experimental results show that PQ-IoTCrypt achieves a 9.9% reduction in total encryption time compared to the next best baseline at the 256-bit security level while requiring significantly fewer ciphertexts for successful attacks. PQ-IoTCrypt demonstrates superior performance in key generation, encryption, and decryption processes, with times reduced by 12.7 %, 9.1 %, and 9.2 %, respectively, compared to the closest competitor.

	abstract = {As vehicular applications continue to evolve, the computational capabilities of individual vehicles alone are no longer sufficient to meet the increasing demands. This has led to the integration of edge computing in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) as an essential solution. Due to the limited resources within vehicles, there is often a need to offload tasks to edge nodes. However, task offloading in IoV environments presents several challenges, including high mobility, dynamic network topology, and varying node density. Traditional offloading methods fail to effectively address these challenges. Moreover, tasks differ in importance, necessitating a mechanism for edge nodes to prioritize tasks based on their urgency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) fuzzy-based task offloading scheme. In this scheme, fuzzy logic plays a critical role by enabling dynamic prioritization of tasks based on their urgency and the available computational resources at edge nodes, ensuring intelligent, context-aware decision-making. The user vehicle selects an appropriate edge node using an edge selection mechanism, which guarantees prolonged connection time and sufficient computational resources. Tasks at the edge are then organized based on their latency requirements and evaluated using a fuzzy rule-based inference system. Our simulation results demonstrate improved task execution rates, reduced overall system delay, and minimized queuing delays.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the global marine economy and flourishing maritime activities, the marine Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining unprecedented momentum. However, current marine equipment is deficient in data transmission efficiency and semantic comprehension. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel End-to-End (E2E) coding scheme, namely the Turbo-based Deep Semantic Autoencoder (Turbo-DSA). The Turbo-DSA achieves joint source-channel coding at the semantic level through the E2E design of transmitter and receiver, while learning to adapt to environment changes. The semantic encoder and decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts messages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during neural network training according to channel characteristics and background knowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors. Specifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic vectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder employs Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic vectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is ensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the entire training process. Compared with traditional Turbo coding techniques, the Turbo-DSA shows a faster convergence speed, thanks to its efficient processing of semantic vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the Turbo-DSA surpasses existing benchmarks in key performance indicators, such as bilingual evaluation understudy scores and sentence similarity. This is particularly evident under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where it shows superior text semantic transmission efficiency and adaptability to variable marine channel environments.}

Having diverse and extensive networking and resource-constrained devices creates vulnerabilities to various cyber-attacks. The IoT with the supervision of Software Defined Network (SDN) enhances the network performance through its flexibility and adaptability. Different methods have been employed for detecting security attacks; however, they are often computationally efficient and unsuitable for such resource-constraint environments. Consequently, there is a significant requirement to develop efficient security measures against a range of attacks. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) models have paved the way for designing effective attack detection methods. In this study, we leverage Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a correlation coefficient as a fitness function for feature selection. Additionally, mutual information (MI) is applied for feature ranking to measure their dependency on the target variable. The selected optimal features were used to train a hybrid DNN model to uncover attacks in IoT networks. The hybrid DNN integrates Convolutional Neural Network, Bi-Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRU), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) for training the input data. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated against several other baseline DL models, and an ablation study is provided. Three key datasets InSDN, UNSW-NB15, and CICIoT 2023 datasets, containing various types of attacks, were used to assess the performance of the model.

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have garnered escalating significance in response to the evolving landscape of cyberattacks, driven by the adaptability and versatility of Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based networks in enhancing security orchestration. Although Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed for IDS, they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high performance. However, acquiring labels for attacks is a time-consuming process and can cause problems in deploying the existing ML models in new systems or lower performance due to a shortage of labeled data on pre-trained datasets. Additionally, such ML-based IDS models lack the self-learning function to automatically adapt to new cyberattacks during network operations. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes Fed-Evolver, an automated evolving approach for federated IDS that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Auto Encoder (AE) and a semi-supervised adversarial Autoencoder (SSAAE) for spotting intrusion actions. Our Fed-Evolver leverages supervised and unsupervised learning strategies to build efficient IDS models in the context of labeled data scarcity with the help of Federated Learning (FL). It allows data owners to collaborate for training intrusion detection models to provide the self-evolving capability in SDN-enabled networks. Our proposed framework is evaluated on 6 cyberattack datasets, including CICIDS2018, CIC-ToN-IoT, NF-UNSW-NB15, InSDN, InSecLab-IDS2021, DNP3 Intrusion Detection, and it outperforms other ML methods even when trained with only 1% proportion of labeled data, achieving consistently high performance across all metrics on the datasets.}

	abstract = {With the advent of advanced technological developments such as IoT, edge, and fog computing, cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated. IoT networks facilitate collaborative and intelligent tasks across various domains, including Industry 4.0, digital healthcare, and home automation. However, the proliferation of IoT devices has raised concerns about severe attacks, particularly those targeting resource constraints such as energy and memory. In response to these challenges, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has emerged as a new research area, focusing on machine learning techniques tailored for embedded and IoT systems. This study proposes an ML detection mechanism designed to categorize and detect resource-constrained attacks in IoT devices. We consider IoT devices to be integral components within the continuum of edge and cloud computing, leveraging EdgeML and CloudML for detection purposes. Our paper conducts a comparative analysis of ML models, with a specific focus on energy consumption and memory usage in IoT applications. We compare various ML methodologies, including cloud-based, edge-based, and device-based strategies for both training and detection. The evaluation encompasses the application of these ML techniques to petite IoT devices, utilizing TinyML, as well as cloud and edge devices. Our findings reveal that the Decision Tree algorithm deployed on smart devices surpasses other approaches in terms of training efficiency, resource utilization, and the ability to detect resource-constrained attacks on IoT devices. We demonstrate a high level of accuracy, exceeding 96.9%, across all presented ML models in detecting resource constraint attacks within IoT systems. In summary, this research serves as a guide for implementing effective security measures in the dynamic landscape of IoT and associated technologies.}

	abstract = {The society is witnessing an accelerated large-scale adoption of technology with transformative effects on daily transport operations, with cities now depending on data driven mobility services. Disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and decentralized technologies for example Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are being deployed in smart cities. However, AI is faced with data security and privacy issues due to its centralized mode of deployment. Conversely, DLT which employs a decentralized architecture can be converged with AI to provide a secure data sharing across various IoT thereby overcoming the existing setbacks faced in deploying AI in smart cities. Evidently, the convergence of AI and IoT as AIoT and DLT have great potential to create novel business models for improved data driven services such as intelligent mobility in smart cities. Although research on the convergence of AI, IoT and DLT exists, our understanding of its integration in achieving intelligent mobility services in smart cities remains fragmented as current research in this area remains scarce. This study bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing researchers and practitioners with insights on the potential benefits of converging AIoT and DLT. Grounded on the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) framework this study presents the technological, organizational, and environmental factors that impacts the convergence of AIoT and DLT in smart cities. Additionally, findings from this study present use cases on the applicability of AIoT and DLT to support intelligent mobility services in smart cities.}

	abstract = {Due to decentralization and effective prevention of privacy leakage, Differential Private Federated Learning(DP-FL) has emerged as an efficient technique in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the essence of key industrial is big data. When applying the DP-FL model to the IoV, these large-scale nonlightweight data such as Non-IID and high-dimensional will decrease the security and accuracy of the model. Therefore, for the security and accuracy of the IoV, we proposed a lightweight DP-FL framework called DPF-IVN, considering the impact of heterogeneous and privacy leak in the context of IoV. It adopts the idea of “lowering dimension first and then optimization” to process non-light quantified data in the IoV. Specifically, we novelly design a Federated Randomized Principal Component Analysis (FRPCA) algorithm, allowing users to map local data to low-dimensional data. Then, we propose the Functional Mechanism(FM) to disturb the gradient parameters to solve the problem of low training accuracy caused by gradient cutting. Besides, to reduce model differences, we used the Bregman dispersal as a regularized item update loss function to improve the accuracy of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DPF-IVN in the heterogeneous environment compared to other methods.}

This paper investigates model compression techniques with the aim of determining their compatibility when combined, and identifying an effective approach to improve inference speed and energy efficiency within IoT edge devices. The study is carried out on the application scenario of Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which involves complex signal processing and needs real-time processing and energy efficiency. Therefore, a customized 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) HGR classification model has been designed. An approach based on strategically combining model compression techniques was then implemented resulting in a model customized for faster inference and improved energy efficiency for IoT embedded devices. The model size became compact at 10.42 kB, resulting in a substantial size reduction of 98.8%, and an inference gain of 94.73% on a personal computer with approximately 8.56% decrease in accuracy. The approach of combinative model compression techniques was applied to a wide range of edge-computing IoT devices with limited processing power, resulting in a significant improvement in model execution speed and energy efficiency for these devices. Specifically, there was an average power consumption gain of 52% for Arduino Nano BLE and 34.05% for Raspberry Pi 4. Inference time was halved for Arduino Nano BLE Sense, Nicla Sense, and Raspberry Pi 4, with a remarkable gain of 94% for ESP32.}

This research offers a novel IoT device authentication technique to mitigate these challenges by integrating three cutting-edge technologies namely blockchain technology, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By utilizing the distinctive qualities of PUFs for device identification and the unrivaled security of QKD for key exchange, the proposed approach seeks to address the significant security issues present in IoT environments. Adopting blockchain technology ensures transparency and verifiability of the authentication process across distributed IoT networks by adding an unchangeable, decentralized layer of trust. An examination of the computing and communication costs reveals that the proposed protocol is effective, necessitating low computational resources that are critical for IoT devices with limited resources. The protocol’s resistance against a variety of attacks is demonstrated by formal proofs based on the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and security evaluations using the Scyther tool, ensuring the integrity and secrecy of communications. Various threats are analyzed, and the protocol is proven to be secure and efficient from all forms of attacks.}

	abstract = {Collaborative learning-based beamforming schemes have been exploited to improve spectral efficiency (SE) with low privacy risks in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) systems. However, a single-task-driven federated learning (FL) scheme needs to run a large model on local devices with limited computing capacity due to its imbalanced computing resources. Although a single-task-driven split learning (SL) can split a large model into multiple smaller portions, it concerns the training time overhead due to its relay-based training. Meanwhile, annotation for well-labeled channel state information (CSI) still affects beamforming performance with high labeling costs. In this paper, we first propose a collaborative learning framework, named multi-task and split federated learning (M-SFL), for joint channel semantic reconstruction and beamforming for RIS-aided CF systems. The proposed M-SFL framework simultaneously tackles channel semantic reconstruction and beamforming with shared knowledge to distinguish the inherent information of user equipments (UEs). The proposed M-SFL splits large model into multiple lightweight parts friendly with the limited computing local devices and trains local and global models parallelly with the Federated server. Then, we expand the proposed M-SFL framework into a self-enhanced multi-task and split federated learning (SM-SFL) framework by integrating the contrastive learning technique. The SM-SFL framework pre-trains by predicting and distinguishing the target CSI and others without annotation, and then we fine-tune the local and global models with limited labeled CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can jointly achieve better channel semantic reconstruction and higher SE with balanced computing resources, faster beamforming, and low labeling costs.}

The combination of Internet of Things (IoT) and drone technology provides an emerging solution to this issue. This paper designs a drone-assisted collection system for infection samples (DASS) that provides safe, intelligent, and efficient sample collection services. In this system, flexible collector drones gather infection samples from remote users and return to designated transit points to unload. Meanwhile, deliverer drones shuttle between the testing center and transit points, transporting all packaged infection samples to the testing center. However, the moment when users post collection requests is unknown. This dynamism and uncertainty present new challenges for the routing and scheduling of heterogeneous drones. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic sample collection (RLDSC) scheme. Considering the differences in infection samples, minimizing age of samples (AoS) is introduced as an objective. Simulation results indicate that the RLDSC scheme outperforms existing solutions in both effectiveness and efficiency.}

This underscores the strategic importance of blending competition with collaboration to refine production processes and align with consumer expectations. Additionally, the research presents a remarkable 69.1 % boost in operational consistency and reports substantial progress in manufacturing flexibility and the value-to-weight ratio, witnessing increases of 125.8 % and 33.2 %, respectively. These improvements are pivotal in optimizing production resources, which in turn, have led to a 29.3 % decrease in customer complaints and a 15.6 % rise in on-time delivery rates. Conversely, a slight decline in the consistency of the value-to-weight ratio was observed, pointing to potential areas for future research. The findings decisively show that CNPs offer concrete advantages by enhancing customer satisfaction determinants and operational efficiency in SMEs. The paper advocates for future studies to directly measure customer satisfaction and to formulate actionable guidelines for the effective implementation of coopetition strategies.

This study evaluates the adaptability of a fake news detection model across diverse fields, employing three distinct datasets. Furthermore, the study leverages the multi-head attention feature of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to scrutinize the feature extraction process in the model. In our analysis, we focused on words that are commonly emphasized by machine learning in fake news detection. The dataset comprised 27,442 instances of genuine news and 28,359 instances of fabricated news, each distinctly labeled. To examine the focal words, we utilized multi-head attention, a component of BERT. This mechanism assigns greater weight to words that receive more attention. Our investigation aimed to identify which words were assigned higher weights in each article. The findings indicate that while representing a minor percentage, a common characteristic of fake news is the heightened attention to words that influence the credibility of the article. To assess the versatility of the model, we applied the model trained on one dataset to classify other datasets. The results demonstrate a notable decline in accuracy, attributable to the distinctive characteristics of the training data. These observations suggest that common features among fake news, which could be extracted using the fine-tuned BERT model, are limited.}

The network structure for IoT is heterogeneous and can create a complex architecture depending on the application and geographical structure. To efficiently process the information within this diverse and complex relationship, a robust data structure is needed for network operations. Graph neural network (GNN) technology is emerging as a capable tool for predicting complex data structures, such as graphs. Graphs can be employed to mimic the structure of IoT network and process information from IoT nodes using GNN techniques. In this paper, our goal is to explore the effectiveness of GNN in performing the node classification task for a given IoT network. We have generated three different IoT networks with varying network sizes, number of nodes, and feature sizes. We then test 12 different GNN algorithms to evaluate their performance in IoT node classification. Each method is examined in detail to observe its training behavior, testing behavior, and resilience against noise. In addition, time complexity and generalization ability of each model have also been studied. The experimental results show that some methods exhibit high resilience against noisy data for IoT node classification accuracy.}

	abstract = {Chronic tinnitus often affects elderly or hearing-impaired individuals, which can disturb their daily lives by disrupting concentration and limiting communication. Clinically, sound masking using external sounds like white noise (WN) aims to mask tinnitus and relieve secondary symptoms. Even when symptoms are relieved, tinnitus often requires long-term management, and for patients to visit healthcare professionals regularly. Generally, it could make maintaining symptom management challenging due to the time and effort required for consistent follow-ups. EEG is considered as one of the objective marker for assessing tinnitus symptoms. In this study, we designed IoT-enabled EEG sensing (IEES) headphones, an innovative IoT device that provided customized music (CM) and EEG measurement. The headphones employed a pitch-matching (PM) method to create CM tailored to each patient at specific frequencies for tinnitus patients. To collect EEG measurements, the device incorporated OpenBCI electrodes and a sensing chip to monitor brain waves and evaluate the outcomes.. After 30 days of experiment, participants showed significant reductions in both tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) scores and visual analog scale for annoyance (VAS-A) scores. In comparison, tinnitus frequency showed a slight reduction. EEG measurements demonstrated an increase in alpha band activity. In questionnaires, patients reported high satisfaction with their experiences. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed method for chronic tinnitus assessment and symptom management.}

	abstract = {The edge–cloud continuum provides a heterogeneous, multi-scale, and dynamic infrastructure supporting complex deployment profiles and trade-offs for application scenarios like those found in the Internet of Things and large-scale cyber–physical systems domains. To exploit the continuum, applications should be designed in a way that promotes flexibility and reconfigurability, and proper management (sub-)systems should take care of reconfiguring them in response to changes in the environment or non-functional requirements. Approaches may leverage optimisation-based or heuristic-based policies, and decision making may be centralised or distributed: this work investigates decentralised heuristic-based approaches. In particular, we focus on the pulverisation approach, whereby a distributed software system is automatically partitioned (“pulverised”) into different deployment units. In this context, we address two main research problems: how to support the runtime reconfiguration of pulverised systems, and how to specify decentralised reconfiguring policies by a global perspective. To address the first problem, we design and implement a middleware for pulverised systems separating infrastructural and application concerns. To address the second problem, we leverage aggregate computing and exploit self-organisation patterns to devise self-stabilising reconfiguration strategies. By simulating deployments on different kinds of complex infrastructures, we assess the flexibility of the pulverisation middleware design as well as the effectiveness and resilience of the aggregate computing-based reconfiguration policies.}

	abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are critical to operating various Critical infrastructures (CIs). However, ICS communication channels connecting sensors, actuators, and local and supervisory controllers are vulnerable to network attacks compromising the system’s availability and integrity. This study proposes and compares Standalone and Hybrid Software Defined Networking (SDN) solutions to mitigate (Detect and Respond) network channel attacks in ICS environments. The methodology utilised applies a testbed designed in GNS3 following the IEC 62264 Industrial Automation Pyramid. It incorporates ICS components such as PLCs and SCADA and a Simulink-based digital twin system for a wastewater treatment plant. This research establishes a proof of concept involving detection and response to network channel attacks evaluated through packet thresholds, packet analysis, and cryptographic hashing techniques in SDN. The Mitre attack framework is implemented to provide insight into the system’s vulnerabilities through adversary emulation. The research findings reveal that both SDN solutions effectively enhance ICS network security; the Standalone SDN solution is more suitable for time-sensitive networks, while the Hybrid SDN solution better serves non-time-sensitive industrial environments. While the Standalone SDN solution offers a 75% efficiency improvement, its’ status as a nascent technology introduces unresolved vulnerabilities and limited testing favouring the Hybrid SDN solution, which provides robust security and reliability due to the integration with the Snort IDS. Thus, selecting the appropriate solution requires carefully considering the trade-offs between enhanced performance and established security. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of SDN solutions in strengthening ICS security and suggests areas for future research.}

	abstract = {With the shift towards smart objects and automated services in many industries, the health and beauty industries are also becoming increasingly involved in AI-driven smart systems. There is a rising market demand for personalised services and a need for unified platforms in many sectors, specifically the cosmetics and healthcare industries. Alongside this rising demand, there are two major gaps when considering the integration of autonomous systems within these sectors. Firstly, the existing smart systems in the cosmetics industry are limited to single-purpose products and the employed technologies are not widespread enough to support the growing consumer demand for personalisation. Secondly, despite the rise of smart devices in healthcare, the current state-of-the-art services do not fulfil the accessibility demands and holistic nature of healthcare. To bridge these gaps, we propose integrating autonomous systems with health and beauty services through a unified visual platform coined as the Internet-of-Mirrors (IoM), an interconnected system of smart mirrors with sensing and communication capabilities where the smart mirror functions as an immersive visual dashboard to provide personalised services for health and beauty consultations and routines. We aim to present an overview of current state-of-the-art technologies that will enable the development of the IoM as well as provide a practical vision of this system with innovative scenarios to give a forward-looking vision for assistive technologies. We also discuss the missing capabilities and challenges the development of the IoM would face and outline future research directions that will support the realisation of our proposed framework.}

Traditional security models are not well-adopted to protecting these diverse and resource-constrained devices against evolving threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). We introduce ZFort, a zero-trust framework that prioritizes the security of critical nodes in IoT networks. ZFort dynamically evaluates the risk status of nodes based on node’s criticality and vulnerability scores derived from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data ZFort dynamically assesses node risk based on criticality and vulnerability scores derived from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data, and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). ZFort uses a stochastic differential equation model for dynamic and continuous trust evaluation between nodes. Based on this evaluation, it dynamically adjusts security measures and routing decisions in real-time. Additionally, ZFort quickly isolates nodes that are likely compromised and prevents routing across them. ZFort uses Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and efficient heuristics, guaranteeing scalability and resource efficiency even in large networks and enhances the resilience and trustworthiness of key IoT infrastructure.}

Addressing these risks requires robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While existing studies target this topic, a systematic literature review focused on the current state and advancements in Behavior-based Intrusion Detection Systems for IoMT environments is necessary. This systematic literature review analyzes 81 studies from the past five years, answering three key research questions: (1) What are the Behavior-based IDS currently used in healthcare? (2) How do the detected attacks impact patient safety? (3) Do these IDS include prevention measures? The findings indicate that nearly 84% of the reviewed studies utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for threat detection. However, significant challenges persist, such as the scarcity of IoMT-specific datasets, limited focus on patient safety, and the absence of comprehensive prevention and mitigation strategies. This review highlights the need for more robust, patient-centric security solutions. In particular, developing IoMT-specific datasets and enhancing defensive mechanisms are essential to meet the unique security requirements of IoMT environments.}

Unfortunately, this exponential growth is accompanied by a proportional increase in cyber threats, jeopardizing the security and integrity of computer systems. In this context, intrusion detection becomes a necessity to protect networks and systems against potential attacks, ensuring their proper functioning and reliability. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model for attack detection. This model utilizes a convolutional neural network to train the datasets, which are first cleaned and preprocessed. The model inputs are selected using an optimization method called adaptive large neighborhood search. The results obtained for the four datasets used – CICIDS2017, Edge-IIoTset, ToN-IoT windows7, and ToN-IoT windows10 – demonstrate the model’s effectiveness for both multi-class and binary classification cases. In the binary case, the accuracy reaches 99.85%, 100%, 99.97%, and 100%, respectively, and in the multi-class case, it stands at 99.81%, 94.98%, 99.92%, and 99.84%, respectively.}

These results confirm the bidirectional relationship between artificial intelligence and cybersecurity across different subsamples, which coincides with greater geopolitical tension. The results align with the diffusion of the innovation model, which states that geopolitics can influence the adoption and impact of AI innovations in cybersecurity.

On Spain’s Mediterranean coast, organic citrus farms face increasing challenges from invasive species like Araujia sericifera and Cortaderia selloana, which further complicate cover crop management. This study introduces a swarm system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with neural networks based on YOLOv10 for the detection and geo-location of these invasive weeds. The system achieves F1-scores of 0.78 for Araujia sericifera and 0.80 for Cortaderia selloana. Using GPS and RTK, the UAVs generate KML files to guide diffuser drones for precise, localized treatments with organic products. By automating the detection, treatment, and elimination of invasive species, the system enhances both productivity and sustainability in organic farming. Additionally, the proposed solution addresses the high labor costs associated with manual weeding by reducing the need for human intervention. A comprehensive economic analysis indicates potential savings ranging from 1810 to 2650 € per hectare, depending on farm size. This innovative approach not only improves weed control efficiency but also promotes environmental sustainability, offering a scalable solution for organic and conventional agriculture alike.}

The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) observes the underwater environment, assists in exploration, mitigates disasters, and monitors some factors including temperature, pressure, and pollution. The IoUT relies on a network of intelligent underwater sensors that send data to surface base stations and IoT devices for storage and analysis. Nevertheless, these systems face security risks as they operate in unattended environments. Many authentication methods depend on a centralized third party, leading to higher computation costs and energy usage. To mitigate security risks, autonomous underwater devices need secure connections and authentication. This paper suggests a decentralized authentication mechanism for UAN to safeguard against unauthorized access and ensure secure data storage in the cloud. The proposed mechanism prioritizes robustness, transparency, and energy efficiency. The suggested solution incorporates an architecture based on edge and cloud layers, utilizing customized blockchain technology for secure storage and processing of data. The security of the proposed solution has been thoroughly examined through formal analysis utilizing the Real or Random (ROR) Oracle model and Scyther tool. Informal analysis further confirms the solution’s resilience against various malicious attacks. Additionally, performance and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed solution surpasses existing schemes.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Vehicles (IOV) is a distributed network that provides several services based on vehicle information (e.g., location, speed), such as Electronic Toll Collection (ETC). ETC has been introduced to replace traditional toll booths, where vehicles need to line up to pay, especially during peak travel times. The main advantage of ETC is improved traffic efficiency. However, existing ETC systems often fail to secure the privacy of vehicle information and are vulnerable to fund theft. This makes automatic payments inefficient and susceptible to attacks like the Reentrancy attack.}

	abstract = {The transition from industry 4.0 to industry 5.0 represents a profound paradigm shift in the manufacturing domain, emphasizing the convergence of advanced digital technologies with human-centric collaboration, sustainability, and operational resilience. This paper rigorously investigates the transformative potential of softwarization and servitization within sophisticated cloud architectures, which are pivotal enablers for the realization of Factories-of-the-Future (FoF) in the industry 5.0 context. We explore the technical intricacies of softwarization, harnessing technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS), and cloud-native architectures to achieve unprecedented levels of flexibility, scalability, and operational efficiency in manufacturing ecosystems. Concurrently, servitization facilitates a shift from traditional product-centric models to dynamic, service-oriented frameworks, enabling highly customizable, on-demand manufacturing processes and significantly enhancing customer engagement. By meticulously examining the symbiotic relationship between these technologies, this paper presents a comprehensive roadmap that addresses critical technical challenges, including scalability, interoperability with legacy systems, and robust cybersecurity in distributed environments. Furthermore, we identify emergent opportunities such as AI-driven predictive maintenance, large-scale hyper-personalization, and the dynamic orchestration of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) paradigms. Our contributions offer valuable insights for researchers, industry experts, and stakeholders, aiming to fully leverage the potential of Industry 5.0 to drive innovation and transform global manufacturing practices.}

	abstract = {This research introduces LBTMA, a novel framework for effective traffic management in Internet of Things (IoT) networks employing software-defined networking (SDN). LBTMA comprises three modules: P4-enabled Stateful Traffic Monitoring (P4-STM), P4-enabled Distributed Load Balancing (P4-DLBS), and P4-enabled Distributed Packet Aggregation and Disaggregation (P4-DPADS). Operating entirely within the data plane, the three modules collaboratively address the challenges of managing high communication traffic from IoT devices. P4-STM utilizes state tables for flow monitoring and anonymization, while introducing a novel multi-controller communication scheme (MCCS) that separates routine data from critical alerts through two dedicated channels. MCCS demonstrated a 25% improvement in throughput and a 51% decrease in latency compared to single controller architecture. P4-DLBS features Enhanced Weighted Round Robin (P4-EWRR) load balancing algorithm, which leverages P4′s distributed decision-making capabilities and inter-switch coordination for enhanced scalability and reduced controller burden. P4-EWRR continuously adjusts server weights based on real-time factors (e.g., queue length, server resource pool, CPU utilization) to ensure efficient resource allocation. In testing, P4-EWRR achieved an average response time of 15 ms and an average packet drop rate of 2%. P4-DPADS employs a hierarchical data plane to efficiently handle high volumes of small IoT packets. It demonstrated an average disaggregation accuracy of 98%, communication overhead reduction rate of 70%, and an impressive average aggregation ratio of 95%. Additionally, P4-DPADS contributes to a 25% reduction in latency and a 40% increase in throughput. The LBTMA framework's modularity and P4 programmability provide flexible, scalable, and efficient traffic management in IoT networks.}

	abstract = {A novel adaptive Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm is designed for the dynamic management of the Random Access Channel (RACH) in LTE networks, facilitating the coexistence of Human-to-Human (H2H) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. This algorithm employs the integration of user priority and block rate-based dynamic adjustment policies within the DQN framework, significantly enhancing service quality across cellular communications. By categorizing devices into three priority tiers based on their Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, the scheme enables dynamic allocation of RACH resources, thus effectively reducing collisions and enhancing network efficiency. Additionally, the implementation of a dual-criteria convergence check within the model ensures the algorithm’s robustness and reliability, offering a significant advancement in managing the intricate dynamics of M2M and H2H communications. This approach not only exhibits effectiveness in access success rates, reductions in access delay, and increased preamble utilization but also underscores the potential for further refinements in learning efficiency and overall performance through dynamic parameter adjustments. This innovative study offers valuable insights into optimizing RACH resources and sets a solid foundation for advancing intelligent network management in increasingly complex communication landscapes.}
