	abstract = {Significant number of people with dementia are at risk of wandering and getting lost. These individuals may get hurt, cause distress to families and caregivers, and require costly search parties. This study explores the possibility of using machine learning methods applied to data from GPS trackers to create individualized models that describe patterns of movement. These patterns can be used to predict typical locations of individuals with dementia, and to detect movements that do not follow these patterns and may correspond to wandering. Data from a sample of 337 GPS trackers were used. After pre-processing the data are used for iterative clustering, followed by classification learning. The number of clusters ranged between one (devices that always stayed “home”) and nine for devices with maximum mobility. The average number of clusters was 2.62. Models for predicting location achieved varying accuracy, depending on regularity of wearer's schedule. The achieved average Area under ROC (AUC) is 0.778, with accuracy 0.631, precision 0.662, and recall 0.604. Unusual locations that potentially correspond to wandering incidents were identified by applying a secondary classification learning after filtering out data corresponding to normal movement.}

The proposed paper aims at integrating artificial intelligence technology, such as the neural networks and fuzzy system in a secure healthcare monitoring system in order to enable the system to work as a smart healthcare model that decides the priority by itself depending on the collected health parameters from the senor nodes. The proposed model consists of a trust environment that is responsible for collecting authenticated physiological data from patient's body which is then sent through GSM module to Azure IoT Hub where raw data is converted into linguistic representation, with the help of logic-based algorithm, which is trained in fuzzy-based inference system (FBIS) to get the status of the patient. The proposed system, then, provides reliable, accurate, secure and real-time patient monitoring. The following sections describe how the FBIS can be integrated with a secure healthcare monitoring system to get the states of the patient and send it to the medical advisory for the preliminary precautions.}

FPMIPv6-S provides network-based mobility support for 6LoWPAN WSN when a sensor node moves between two Personal Area Networks (PANs). It is an improved version of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] protocol proposed for mobility management in IPv6 networks. The major difference between PMIPv6 and FPMIPv6-S is that FPMIPv6-S introduces a new agent called coordinator to handle mobility on behalf mobile nodes thus reduce significantly communication overhead as well as energy consumption.}

This work deals with the detection of Freezing of Gait in patients having Parkinson’s disease with the help of wearable acceleration sensors placed on their legs and hips which consequently results in their real-time remote monitoring. This work proposes a FoG detection method based on Grey Relational Analysis which uses the readings from the sensors to predict the presence or absence of freezing in a patient. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach that uses Grey Relational Analysis as the base classification model has also been illustrated for FoG detection. The proposed approaches have been applied on benchmark Daphnet Freezing of Gait data set to verify their feasibility. The simulation results show that the proposed approaches have better accuracy when compared to other existing machine learning techniques.}

	abstract = {The Social Internet of Things has been introduced as a social oriented approach to deal with IoT challenges. A service discovery process is also transformed by this paradigm. Since the Social Internet of Things includes millions of services across the network, the question arises that to what extent can we trust service providers? The appropriate selection of trustworthy service provider plays a key role in successful deployment of the SIoT. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a trustworthy group-based service management model (TGSM). The proposed discovery and selection process of an appropriate service provider relies on both trustworthiness measurement and performance assessment. In the trustworthiness measurement case, a punishment mechanism is adopted in trustworthiness evaluation to deal with objects’ selfish behavior. Likewise, we employed the HITS algorithm to propose a global dynamic reputation evaluation approach. We propose a service-based grouping approach as a novel architecture for SIoT network. We also consider the dynamic evolving of social relationships among the SIoT devices. Our SIoT paradigm, due to its intrinsically multilayered nature, is modeled upon a multiplex network. In the performance measurement case, some metrics are used to asses objects’ performance. To evaluate the proposed trust model, we extend the CRAWDAD dataset, and the objects in the dataset are categorized into five types. The simulation results show that the proportions of four selfish types of objects are dominated by completely trustworthy objects, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed TGSM model. Moreover, the results demonstrate HITS centrality measurement’s effectiveness, which leads the proportion of trustworthy service providers to nearly double in comparison with degree and eigenvector centrality in this context.}

The turbine flowmeter generates electric power from the rotation of the rotor. The IoT control unit, consisting of a microcomputer and a low power wide area (LPWA) communication module, uses the power generated by the rotor rotation to detect the rotational speed of the rotor (the water flowrate) and to communicate wirelessly with a server on the Internet. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the sensor node. The power generated by the rotor rotation was sufficient to operate the wireless sensor node as a self-powered unit. The full-scale accuracy and indication accuracy of the measured flowrate were 1.2\n%\nand 2.8\n%\n,\nrespectively. The wireless sensor node could stably upload the measured flowrate to a server on the Internet.}

Combining Serious Games with the interconnected hardware and middleware driven ecosystem of IoT develops data-driven games that source data from the local or extended physical environment to progress in the virtual environment of gaming, better-informing players through the game experience. The following paper presents the evaluation of a software framework defined for combining Serious Games and IoT, achieved using a semester-long experiment with a randomised control trial. The study aimed to produce an effective method of measuring student engagement using sensor-based information and a game environment but not improve the level of student engagement with their related academic programme. The results of the empirical experiment provide perceived evidences in the measure of engagement when compared to academic performance. The experiment results are not statistically significant due to the small sample size and the empirical nature of the work. The findings of this paper validate the effectiveness of a software framework for combining Serious Games and IoT and encourages new real-world applications of Smart Serious Games that include healthcare, education, simulation and others.}

Many IoT deployments require proxies to support asynchronous communication between edge devices and the back-end. This allows (non-trusted) proxies to access sensitive parts of CoAP messages. Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) is a recent standard protocol that provides end-to-end security for CoAP messages at the application layer. Unlike the commonly used standard Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), OSCORE efficiently provides selective integrity protection and encryption on different parts of CoAP messages. Thus, OSCORE enables end-to-end security through intermediary (non-trusted) proxies, while still allowing them to perform their expected services, with considerable security and privacy improvements.}

In a close future, we foresee that companies and service providers will have developed reliable solutions to address indoor positioning, as basis for useful location based services. These solutions will be different from each other and they will adopt different hardware and processing techniques. This paper describes the proposal of a unified approach for Indoor Localization Systems that enables the cooperation between heterogeneous solutions and their functional modules. To this end, we designed an integrated architecture that, abstracting its main components, allows a seamless interaction among them. Finally, we present a working prototype of such architecture, which is based on the popular Telegram application for Android, as an integration demonstrator. The integration of the three main phases –namely the discovery phase, the User Agent self-configuration, and the indoor map retrieval/rendering– demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed integrated architecture.}

However, the increasing availability of computational resources close to the edge has prompted the idea of using these for distributed computing and storage. Edge computing may help to improve IoT systems regarding important quality attributes like latency, energy consumption, privacy, and bandwidth utilization. However, deciding where to deploy the various application components is not a straightforward task. This is largely due to the trade-offs between the quality attributes relevant for the application. We have performed a systematic mapping study of 98 articles to investigate which quality attributes have been used in the literature for assessing IoT systems using edge computing. The analysis shows that time behavior and resource utilization are the most frequently used quality attributes; further, response time, turnaround time, and energy consumption are the most used metrics for quantifying these quality attributes. Moreover, simulation is the main tool used for the assessments, and the studied trade-offs are mainly between only two qualities. Finally, we identified a number of research gaps that need further study.}

In this paper, we propose RL-PMAgg for robustly computing PM2.5 pollution rates in existence of faulty sensors. Our method consists of three modules. The outlier detector gives quality assessments to the measurements. We use an RL-based trust management system to create a profile for each sensor and track its behavior in the long run. Then, an aggregated PM2.5 rate is computed by using a set of honest sensors along with their trust levels and measurements. We evaluate RL-PMAgg on both simulated and real-world datasets. We compare the proposed method with relevant works. Experimental results show that RL-PMAgg resists the majority of attacks as compared with other works.}

	abstract = {With significant advances in the development of autonomous cars and Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) have become a promising technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as well. However, the wireless nature of VANET communication makes it vulnerable to a plethora of attack vectors to otherwise secure vehicles. Authenticated message dissemination plays a key role to avert such security vulnerabilities. Many of the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based schemes use Certificates for authentication. In such schemes, for authenticating an entity which presents its certificate, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is used to check if the entity’s certificate has been revoked. But, as the size of the CRL grows, using CRL for authentication can incur computation and storage overhead in VANETs. To overcome this limitation of CRL-based approach for authentication, in this paper, we propose a distributed, scalable, low-overhead, privacy-preserving authentication scheme for VANETs. The proposed scheme uses a Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) for authenticating Road Side Units (RSUs) and Modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MMPT) for authenticating vehicles. We also present an informal analysis as well as formal correctness proof of the proposed scheme.}

There are different challenges of 5G networks such as: improved spectrum efficiency, reduced latency, low consumption, high data rate, capacity and throughput improvement. To deal with these challenges, we propose an Integrated Fuzzy-based Admission Control System (IFACS) for 5G Wireless Networks. We consider 4 input parameters: Quality of Service (QoS), Slice Priority (SP), User Request Delay Time (URDT) and Slice Overloading Cost (SOC). From simulation results, we conclude that the considered parameters have different effects on the acceptance decision. When QoS, SP, URDT parameters are increased, the AD value is increased. But, when the SOC parameter is increased, the AD value is decreased. When the QoS increases 20%, the AD is increased 20% when SP value is 0.5, SOC value is 0.3 and the URDT value is 0.5. But, when the SOC value changes 40%, the AD is decreased by 20% when the URDT value is 0.5.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) represent a significant area of network research due to the many opportunities derived from the problematics and applications. The most recurring problematics are the mobility, the availability and also the limited resources. A well-known interest in networks and therefore in IoT is to monitor properties of the network and nodes [1, 2]. The problematics can have a significant impact on the monitoring efforts. Mobility and availability can create incomplete results for the monitoring. It can also represent a challenge to monitor distributed properties. The literature states that accuracy is not always reliable and difficult to achieve due to dynamic properties of the IoT in particular with M2M communications and mobile devices. Therefore we propose a distributed monitoring architecture that relies on multiple points of observation. It provides a consensus mechanism that allows it to aggregate and provides a more meaningful and accurate result. We support our proposal with numerous mathematical definitions that model local results for a single node and global results for the network. Finally, we evaluate our architecture with an emulator that relies on AWS, NS3, and Docker with varying number of nodes, network size, network density, speed, mobility algorithms and timeouts. We obtain very promising results, especially regarding accuracy.}

The efficient hardware and high throughput networks have made it possible to connect billions of devices, collecting and transmitting useable information. The benefit of IoT devices is that they enable automation however, a significant amount of energy is required for billions of connected devices communicating with each other. This requirement of energy, unless managed, can be one of the barriers in the complete implementation of IoT systems. This paper presents the energy management system for IoT devices. Both hardware and software aspects are considered. Energy transparency has been achieved by modelling energy consumed during sensing, processing, and communication. A multi-agent system has been introduced to model the IoT devices and their energy consumptions. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the multi-agent system. Finally, simulation tools such as MATLAB Simulink and OpenModelica are used to test the system. The optimization results have revealed substantial energy consumption with the implementation of decentralized intelligence of the multi-agent system.}

These methods focus on achieving a light-weight filtering model that can quickly and precisely filter out malicious data for dynamic analysis. A method constructs a language model using Natural Language Processing techniques to represent the data in vector form from the source code for machine learning. This method has high score with the balanced dataset, however the experiment with an imbalanced dataset has not been done. Previous studies mainly focus on a balanced dataset, however the dataset is not representative of real-world data, and it rises questions in practical uses of the model. A good model that can have a high recall score with imbalanced dataset is needed for a good filter. To construct an efficient language model, and to deal with the data imbalance problem, we focus on oversampling techniques. In our research, our method is the first to use oversampling and machine learning to detect malicious JavaScript. The experimental result shows that our method can detect new malicious JavaScript more accurately and efficiently. Our model can quickly filter out malicious data for dynamic analysis. The best recall score achieves 0.72 with the Doc2Vec model. Our proposed method is shown to outperform the baseline method by 210% in terms of recal score with the same training time and test time per sample.}

Ensuring food quality and safety is a complex process. All food processing stages should be considered, from cultivating, harvesting and storage to preparation and consumption. Grading is one of the essential processes to control food quality. This paper proposed a mobile visual-based system to evaluate food grading. Specifically, the proposed system acquires images of bananas when they are on moving conveyors. A two-layer image processing system based on machine learning is used to grade bananas, and these two layers are allocated on edge devices and cloud servers, respectively. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the first layer to classify bananas based on an extracted feature vector composed of color and texture features. Then, a You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 model follows for further locating the peel’s defected area and determining if the inputs belong to the mid-ripened or well-ripened class. According to experimental results, the first layer’s performance achieved an accuracy of 98.5% while the accuracy of the second layer is 85.7%, and the overall accuracy is 96.4%.}

SAR applications need long distance connectivity, thus can be benefited by Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). One LPWAN technology is called LoRa (Long Range). In this context, the WeSAR project has been created that provides a system for locating and rescuing people, especially those who belong to population groups with a very high probability of getting lost. The energy consumption of the wearable devices is important factor in the SAR operations, as the battery should last more than 50 hours. Therefore, the proposed system is based on LoRa technology, the user localization is based on LoRa using trilateration and Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) instead of Geolocation Positioning System (GPS), as GPS increases the energy consumption, and we created an energy-efficient mechanism to tackle the problem of energy consumption. In this paper, an energy efficient mechanism for LoRa networks is presented, that is based on the user's state and the battery level of the wearable device. Realistic simulations have been conducted to evaluate the system for both one wearable device, and multiple wearable devices, using different mobility models. The results from the simulations have shown a decrease in the energy consumption in various node mobility models that were tested, without compromising the delivery ratio of the network, something important as the LoRa packets are used for the localization of the lost person.}

The emergence and proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) - the use of interconnected devices, sensors, and technologies to orchestrate, monitor, and optimize supply chain processes - holds innovative potentials for the halal food supply chain (HFSC). Despite the growing popularity in supply chain management and logistics, the potentials and challenges of IoT in the HFSC remain – unexplored and further research is required . Therefore, the goal of this paper is to address this knowledge gap and review IoT research within the context of HFSCs. To begin, over seventy-three (73) papers were analyzed using both bibliometric techniques and in-depth content analysis. The results reveal that IoT offers five major benefits for the HFSC; namely, traceability of products, enhancement of supply chain efficiencies, facilitation of livestock management, authentication of foods’ halal status, and monitoring of halal certifications. Several challenges were identified, including the technical limitations of IoT devices, technological immaturity, lack of user acceptance, and cost and regulatory barriers. The study's findings provide deeper insight into the current state of IoT research in the halal food literature, its development, challenges and future research avenues for scholars, policy makers and the HFSC community.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a battery-powered Internet of Things assisting Cognitive Radio (CR-IoT) network is considered. In CR-IoT network, a set of IoT End Nodes (ENs) are assumed to cooperatively sense the channel. Each EN performs a Spectrum Sensing (SS) and reports its decision to a Fusion Center in order to reach the decision on the PU status. Such monitoring of PU comes at the cost of additional energy resources consumed by the EN to perform SS and reporting, and raises the need to set a suitable protocol to manage the data exchange. The extra operations may exhaust the energy of the EN battery, especially when Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technology is used. In our manuscript, an Eligibility Score-based (ESco) Strategy is defined to reflect the eligibility of an EN to make a reliable SS taking into consideration its battery level. Our strategy is adapted to LoRaWAN Class-B protocol in order to handle real world scenarios. Necessary modifications are introduced to the existing protocol in order to support the synchronization between the ENs and the Application Server, (at which the SS need is identified), and the on-demand nature of the SS requests. To evaluate our strategy, LoRa sensors’ parameters are considered in our simulations. The numerical results highlight the efficiency of the proposed strategy by showing the extension of the ENs’ lifetime compared to classical strategies.}

	abstract = {With the new era of Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is well on its way from just a concept to a reality over the next few years. IoV promises to enable a myriad of vehicular applications and is committed to providing road safety above all things. However, to take full advantage of IoV, an adequate coordination between IoV, the emerging technologies and the existing ones must be achieved. In this paper, we show how these technologies help existing and future driving-support systems and propose an integrated fuzzy-based driving-support system for real-time risk management that considers many parameters, including the vehicle technical condition (VTC). The proposed system considers the current condition of parameters that could impact the driver and the vehicle performance to assess the risk level. The parameters include the vehicle speed, weather and road condition, and factors that affect the driver’s ability to drive, such as his/her current health condition and the inside environment in which he/she is driving, in addition to the VTC. The data for input parameters can come from different sources, such as on-board and on-road sensors and cameras, and from communications between vehicles and infrastructure based on the penetration of IoV. We show through simulations the effect of the considered parameters on the evaluation of the driving risk and demonstrate a few actions that can be performed accordingly. When the risk remains less than 0.2 the driving situation is marked as safe, otherwise an alarm is generated and the appropriate actions are taken. A VTC less or equal than 0.5 causes an alarm even if all the other parameters are in good conditions.}
