	abstract = {In the digital era, real-time object recognition and inspection, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), have become vitally important in a wide range of applications. With the evolution of Industry 4.0, the integration of digital informatics and decisions is crucial for smart manufacturing, Logistics 4.0, and supply chain digitization. However, much of digital content lacks interconnection. As such, the Digital Twin (DT) was proposed to promote the integration of physical machines and devices with the digital space. Augmented reality (AR) usually works in conjunction with the DT network to collect and provide real-time data. In fact, most of the AR devices are not fully connected in DT as the decision support from AI is disconnected. On the other hand, human-machines and object interactions are still complicated in AR, thus limiting applications. In order to achieve digital twinning for object recognition and human-machine interaction, we proposed a DT architecture for integrating the latest Mixed Reality (MR) device for real-time data streaming. Object recognition is empowered by the AI algorithm in the backend cloud computing and database. The entire system integrates the informatics between physical machines and devices and the digital content using an AI algorithm. Our proposed method achieved real-time informatics integration of MR and AI, while the warehouse is used as a case scenario with simulations. Industrial informatics integration can be applied for smart manufacturing, smart warehouse, and many Industry 4.0 applications.}

	abstract = {Due to dynamic climate change and ecosystem disruption caused by human developmental activities, access to instant drinkable water is a major global crisis. Through real-time, intuitive, and innovative monitoring of water quality by leveraging the sophistication of disruptive technologies, this menace can be curtailed drastically. This study proposed a novel approach that blends artificial intelligence and edge computing capabilities to provide instant monitoring and prediction of a given sample of water based on given parameter thresholds as stipulated by the World Health Organization. The proposed design comprises the front-end and back-end, which form the software and hardware architectures. The hardware consists of actuators, sensors, and controllers that were connected over wireless networks remotely. The software consists of applications that are connected with artificial intelligence (AI) models for intelligent predictions. Eight ensemble learning models are considered for the front-end edge devices to meet the requirement of tiny machine learning (ML), while the back end has a self-supervised learning (SSL) model. The dataset comprises various features of the five parameters for determining water quality; conductivity, turbidity, oxygen, pH, and temperature, which are among the sensors included in the sensor module. Databases are used to store the data that the sensors have collected. A mobile AI-powered interactive app is developed to evaluate the water quality instantaneously based on sensor measurements. The simulation results assert the DT model as the most suitable model for resource-efficient, cost-effective, reliable, and connected intelligence-based underlying prediction models in edge devices for real-time water quality monitoring and prediction with a precision of 99.36%, a sensitivity of 99.54%, an accuracy of 99.46%, rationality of 99.45% 0.0214 prediction error, and 0.0989 intra-reliability.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) comprises of connected devices that collaborate to perform numerous tasks individually and collectively to facilitate services to the users. Distributed denial of service attacks aim to exhaust the resources of the target by sending enormous inessential traffic from numerous sources. IoT systems, generally being a resource-constrained network, are highly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. We aim to achieve the detection of DDoS attacks by rule-based detection method using information theory metrics. Variation in entropy of traffic features beyond a threshold is an indicator of change in density of traffic to a network. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of different parameters associated with entropy variation-based detection of DDoS attacks. Three feature sets were used for studying the impact of entropy variation in detection. Further, we have analysed the three kinds of entropies used for the detection namely, Shannon entropy, generalized entropy, and\nϕ\n-entropy. Along with that, threshold determination for entropy values have been done in two ways, i.e.\n[\na\nv\ne\nr\na\ng\ne\n−\ns\nt\na\nn\nd\na\nr\nd\nd\ne\nv\ni\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\na\nv\ne\nr\na\ng\ne\n+\ns\nt\na\nn\nd\na\nr\nd\nd\ne\nv\ni\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n]\nand [lower quartile, upper quartile]. We found that quartile-based threshold has generally given better recall and accuracy and more consistent results with respect to the window sizes. It is also found that\nϕ\n-entropy has given overall better results as compared to the Shannon entropy and Generalized entropy. Therefore, a combination of\nϕ\n-entropy and quartile-based threshold is found to be the best parameters to identify the DDoS attacks.}

	abstract = {Offering a medication to Elderly and Visually Impaired People (EVIP) in rural areas without staff assistance is a difficult task in the field of health care. The current pill dispenser has limitations when it comes to administering medication before and after food, doesn't take into account over- and under-dosing situations, and doesn't send notifications to the relevant medical entities when the weight of the pills falls below the threshold. Despite the availability of numerous techniques and methods for automating the delivery of pills, there is no assistive method for the timely and secure delivery of medication. The suggested architecture provides EVIP with five crucial capabilities that aren't present in any of the current pill dispensers in an integrated way. In this paper, we present a biometric sensor-based secure access method for medication kits. The right person is only allowed access to the kit based on the finger print scanner. Second, the suggested architecture provides a self-managed and patient-centric service through assisted and automatic medication delivery. The third feature of this paper is the design method for the efficient delivery of pills before and after meals. A method of alerting the medical entities whenever a medication is over or under dosed is a fourth feature of the system. As a fifth feature, the implementation also automatically notifies the pharmacist and doctor when the weight of the pill strips in the chamber falls below the threshold value. Through the use of an integrated Timely Assistance Messaging (TAM) algorithm, all five features are implemented in the suggested architecture. A finger print recognition system is included with VGG-16 deep neural network with image enhancement. The EVIP can use this proposed system in residences, medical facilities, and retirement communities.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices significantly threaten tech-dependant businesses and communities. With the rapid integration of IoT devices into local networks, a system to identify and prevent malicious activity on these devices is essential. These devices' inherent mobility, nature, and intelligence highlight the importance of establishing secure boundaries to safeguard against potential threats. Along with expanding the Internet's ability to handle traffic, the number of IoT devices linked to the Internet has also grown. Due to this modification, conventional methodologies and outdated data processing methods are no longer adequate for attack detection. Due to the growth in network traffic, it is more challenging to identify IoT attacks and malicious data in their early phases. This paper proposes a paradigm for identifying malicious network traffic. The framework uses two well-known classification-based techniques for detecting malicious network traffic, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep neural network model, i.e., a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) embedded with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is tuned using a Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) for improved accuracy of 98.45% and 94.84%. The proposed technique is used to analyse the KDD dataset, and the results are assessed in terms of specificity, prediction time, training, and accuracy. The experimental findings suggest that our proposed model can detect DDoS attacks in less time than current solutions.}

	abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a powerful cryptographic approach for providing fine-grained access control and confidentiality security services. ABE is well suited for cloud-based applications where one-to-many encryption is a must. Revocation in ABE, the ability to revoke or cancel the access privileges of attribute possessors, has been a critical problem for the practical usage of ABE-based security schemes. This work presents a systematic literature review of ABE schemes that provide revocation mechanisms published until December 2022. As a distinctive, we focus on the fog-enabled internet of things (IoT) application domain, which is more commonly found in cloud-based scenarios (honest-but-curious) such as health and industrial domains. Although revocation has already been addressed in cloud-based IoT, it has yet to be widely studied in fog-enabled IoT, where systems exhibit constraints and features that impose specific revocation requirements. We survey, discuss, and provide a taxonomy of existing revocation approaches in the abovementioned context, including attribute and user revocation. Furthermore, we explore how the fog is exploited in the reviewed schemes, provide a qualitative comparison of the surveyed works, and present a quantitative comparison of the associated costs of different revocation approaches. Finally, we present some areas of opportunity for improving revocable ABE schemes for fog-enabled IoT and discuss some of the challenges currently faced by these systems.}

	abstract = {Medical cyber–physical systems (MCPS) firmly integrate a network of medical objects. These systems are highly efficacious and have been progressively used in the Healthcare 4.0 to achieve continuous high-quality services. Healthcare 4.0 encompasses numerous emerging technologies and their applications have been realized in the monitoring of a variety of virus outbreaks. As a growing healthcare trend, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can be cured and its spread can be prevented using MCPS. This virus spreads from human to human and can have devastating consequences. Moreover, with the alarmingly rising death rate and new cases across the world, there is an urgent need for continuous identification and screening of infected patients to mitigate their spread. Motivated by the facts, we propose a framework for early detection, prevention, and control of the COVID-19 outbreak by using novel Industry 5.0 technologies. The proposed framework uses a dimensionality reduction technique in the fog layer, allowing high-quality data to be used for classification purposes. The fog layer also uses the ensemble learning-based data classification technique for the detection of COVID-19 patients based on the symptomatic dataset. In addition, in the cloud layer, social network analysis (SNA) has been performed to control the spread of COVID-19. The experimental results reveal that compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed framework achieves better results in terms of accuracy (82.28 %), specificity (91.42 %), sensitivity (90 %) and stability with effective response time. Furthermore, the utilization of CVI-based alert generation at the fog layer improves the novelty aspects of the proposed system.}

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 involves the digital transformation of industrial sectors. Given the current climate change scenario and the scarcity of water in semi-arid regions, this digital transformation has to take into account the sustainable use of water. In agriculture, one of the most water-intensive sectors, to optimise the use of water, precision irrigation techniques are being applied. As a result of the digital transformation of agriculture, a key aspect for the application of these precision irrigation techniques, the crop water stress, can be predicted from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) of leaf-turgor pressure sensors. However, these sensors often fail, introducing errors in the data, which could lead to inaccurate application of precision irrigation techniques compromising crops and yields. So, sensor fault identification is a must. Nevertheless, sensor fault identification is a tedious and costly task that requires an expert to manually review all sensors and each of their measurements over the last 24 h. In this work, with the aim of digitally transforming this task, an IoT-based expert system is proposed. By means of a novel learning model, this system is capable of identifying sensor faults with 84.2% f1-score and 0.94 AUC ROC. Note that to train this learning model, only real-world data gathered from an experimental plot has been used. In addition, the real-world application of the IoT-based expert system in this plot is shown and discussed. Furthermore, a novel methodology that summarises the main findings and techniques applied in this study is also illustrated.}

In order to meet the surge in food demand due to the worldwide growing population, reduce farmers' efforts, and benefit from these technologies in agriculture, an intelligent platform based on IoT (Internet of Things) is proposed in this paper for monitoring and controlling greenhouse climate and irrigation. The system used a low-cost wireless sensors network (WSN) based on radio frequency (RF) communication for collecting and sending the greenhouse data (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) to a processing unit based on Raspberry Pi. A fusion system based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC) was used to combine the collected data and to supply smart and optimal decisions to manage the internal climate and irrigation. The user can remotely monitor the greenhouse using a Human Machine Interface (HMI) developed under Node-RED server of IBM. In addition, the system allowed storing the environment data in a MySQL database to be exploited for control, monitoring, or history storage. The test results showed the effectiveness and success of the proposed platform.}

	abstract = {Data sanitization in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) privacy refers to the process of permanently and irreversibly hiding all sensitive information from vast amounts of streaming data. Taking into account the dynamic and real-time characteristics of streaming IoT data, we propose a parallel evolutionary Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM), called High-performance Evolutionary Data Sanitization for IoT (HEDS4IoT), and implement two mechanisms on a Graphics Processing Units (GPU)-aided parallelized platform to achieve real-time streaming protected data transmission. The first mechanism, the Parallel Indexing Engine (PIE), generates retrieval index lists from the dataset using GPU blocks. These lists are used in place of the dataset during the PPDM process. The second mechanism, called Parallel Fitness Function Engine (PF2E), parallelizes the index lists on the GPU threads to speed up the computation of the quality of solutions generated by the evolutionary algorithm, in which deferential evolution is adopted as the evolutionary algorithm. In addition to the ability for Big data, the HEDS4IoT can be adaptively adjusted for dynamic nature of IoT where new streaming data is considered for data sanitization. Our experimental results with extensive benchmarks show that, at the kernel level, the PIE and PF2E mechanisms are averagely 33.5x and 53.7x faster than their CPU-implemented version, respectively. At the application level, our findings demonstrate that the HEDS4IoT can perform the PPDM process 47.7x faster than some of the state-of-art methods.}

	abstract = {Offloading Internet of Things (IoT) tasks to the cloud for further processing might not always lead to an optimal execution time, particularly in situations such as resource contention, under-provisioning, over-provisioning, and fragmentation. In addition, dynamically optimizing the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) for resource scheduling in order to meet application requirements remains a major research challenge. Further, existing resource scheduling algorithms focus primarily on minimizing operational costs while maximizing resource sharing and utilization. Considering energy utilization as part of the resource allocation and scheduling process as an optimization objective for maintaining load balancing has often been neglected. To address these challenges and more, we propose a cooperative energy-aware resource allocation and scheduling strategy based on a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria decision-making method. We used the Grid Workloads Archive dataset to evaluate our proposed TOPSIS-based Resource Allocation (TOPREAL) approach. Experimental results with respect to the allocation of VM resources when considering processing a large segment of tasks indicate that TOPREAL outperforms existing algorithms in terms of energy savings, with an average improvement of 40.25%, while maintaining an average improvement of 16.21% when it comes to execution time. Results also demonstrate that our method can save an average of 78.06 processing hours and 63,215 kJ of energy when compared to existing scheduling algorithms. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and the viability of using multi-criteria decision-making techniques such as TOPSIS to solve the resource allocation and scheduling problem in edge environments.}

	abstract = {Socialization has changed the behavior of physical objects in IoT (Internet of Things) by introducing the SIoT (Social Internet of Things) paradigm to emulate the social behavior of humans in a connected cyber–physical world. To create reliable social networking in IoT, trust management has been used to build social relationships autonomously and facilitate trustworthy information sharing among physical objects. Although trust management is being highlighted as a promising security mechanism, the understanding of its potential across various SIoT application domains is so far limited. Thus, in this paper, we examine the social aspects of trust management in the Internet of Things and their role in supporting the evolution of IoT towards SIoT. To this end, we examine existing work in various SIoT application domains in distinct environments to understand how trust management socializes smart objects among each domain, with the Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks, and Flying Ad-hoc Networks being identified as the most popular domains, together with the Internet of Medical Things as a specific SIoT domain with raising interest by the scientific community and need of trustworthy interactions between patients and things. Finally, we highlight the future research directions that can be considered to improve the applicability of trust management in SIoT and reinforce the socialization of smart IoT objects in the digital ecosystems of the future.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming pervasive and with each new installation of IoT platforms new and legacy brokers have to be exploited. New internal brokers are those under the control of the platform, while legacy external brokers are those in place managed by third parties. The solution proposed addressed problems of (a) interoperability to reduce set up time to cope with unknown data structures (devices, entities) distributed via brokers; (b) performance by dimensioning both front-end and back-end processes to reach high rates in a broker-based platform, while preserving full capability features of the data warehouse. Interoperability aspects have been addressed by introducing our concepts and a reasoner into an IoT Directory tool to manage Internal and External brokers, automate device discovery and registration from both standard and customized data models. Despite the managed complexity, a broker-based solution turned out to provide high performance. To this end, a specific assessment and architecture tuning have been performed and reported in the paper to give evidence and validation. The proposed integrated IoT Directory has been developed in the context of the Herit-Data Project, and it is currently used in the whole Snap4City network of 18 tenants and billions of data. Snap4City is an open-source IoT platform for Smart Cities and Industry 4.0, which is an official FIWARE platform and solution, EOSC service and libs of Node-RED.}

Existing short-range wireless radio technology such as Bluetooth/BLE and NFC, although mature and robust, is prone to eavesdropping, jamming and/or interference, and is not very useful as a covert communication side-channel. This paper designs and implements SkinSense, a vibration-based communication protocol which uses human body/skin as a communication medium to create a low-bandwidth and covert communication channel between user-held mobile and wearable devices. SkinSense employs a novel frequency modulation technique for encoding bits as vibration pulses and a spectrogram-based approach to decode the sensed motion data (corresponding to the encoded vibration pulses) to reconstruct the transmitted bits. SkinSense is comprehensively evaluated for a variety of operational parameters, hardware setups and communication settings by means of data collected from human subject participants. Results from these empirical evaluations demonstrate that SkinSense is able to achieve a stable bandwidth of up to 6.6 bps, with bit error rates below 0.1 in our custom hardware setup, and can be employed as a practical communication side-channel.}

	abstract = {The sharing of medical data is crucial for advancing medical research, but the risk of sharing medical data with malicious users poses a significant problem for smooth sharing among medical institutions. To address this issue, we propose a certificate-based proxy re-encryption plus (CBPRE\n+\n) scheme based on certificate-based proxy re-encryption (CBPRE) and message-level fine-grained controllable and non-transferable proxy re-encryption plus (PRE\n+\n). This scheme allows medical organizations to securely distribute their encrypted data to recipients through public cloud storage. The proposed scheme maintains the benefits of CBPRE, while additionally enabling fine-grained message-level sharing and non-transferability. This ensures that user data is only available to authorized health services, thereby preventing malicious disclosure. We validate and analyze the correctness, safety, and performance of our scheme, and our results show that the scheme has chosen-ciphertext security for the original ciphertext and chosen-plaintext security for the re-encrypted ciphertext. Our proposed scheme offers more advantages than the existing CBPRE scheme.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are pivotal for realizing smart cities’ vision due to their rich services in road traffic safety, surveillance, traffic control, and traffic monitoring. However, vehicle links are subject to frequent disconnections due to high mobility, sparse connectivity, road-side obstacles, and a shortage of roadside units. For this purpose, various routing protocols have been proposed in the literature leveraging the network’s topology, the vehicles’ positions, and the message dissemination mechanism, i.e., unicast, multicast, broadcast, etc. This paper comprehensively surveys the VANETs routing protocols and analyzes their working principles, architecture, and application areas. Additionally, it presents a taxonomy and a systematic classification of these protocols based on various performance metrics. Furthermore, it presents a critical comparison of these routing protocols according to different criteria, identifies critical shortcomings in each protocol type, and outlines new directions and recent trends in the design of routing protocols.}

	abstract = {In Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments, various IoT resources are utilized to provide the services necessary to accomplish users’ tasks. Therefore, IoT resources must be effectively and efficiently allocated so that service providers can successfully generate their service capabilities utilizing IoT resources. Additionally, conflicting resource allocation must be avoided for services supporting multiple user tasks. Furthermore, resource allocation and conflict resolution must be performed dynamically because users perform their tasks spontaneously. To address these issues, we propose an agent-based service-binding approach for efficient resource allocation and conflict resolution through negotiations among resources, service providers, and task agents. Negotiation occurs when a task agent attempts to use a service that is currently occupied by another task agent. The task agent that uses the service is determined in the negotiation process by considering the transfer fee based on the usage price of the service and the availability of a substitute service. Negotiations can occur at the task-service or service-resource levels to support flexible service binding. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we compared its success rate with that of traditional resource allocation methods in terms of allocating resources successfully for multiple services. We also analyze the execution time to measure the overhead incurred by multilevel negotiation, which is an essential component of our approach. The proposed approach showed an average success rate of 79% which is 1.17%p lower than multi-objective optimization algorithms (MOOA), but the running time of the proposed approach was 98.3 s which was 56% of the running time of MOOA.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel networking communication field in which the nodes act as physical objects. These nodes might be stationary or mobile. The majority of networking communication problems occur due to nodes’ mobility. Due to the mobility of IoT networks, excessive control overhead messages are generated. These messages are generated due to the frequent exchange of some control information, such as device identity, location information, device mobility, device direction, and others. In general, network clustering helps to alleviate the problem of generating high control overhead messages. Therefore, many proposed or enhanced Cluster-Based Routing (CBR) protocols address the shortcoming of traditional CBR protocols. In CBR protocols, each cluster selects only one node based on some parameters, and this node is called a LEaDeR (LEDR). The LEDR acts as a coordinator for its associated cluster. Furthermore, the rest of the nodes located in the cluster are called Smart DEVices (SDEV). A problem occurs when the SDEVs and the LEDR exchange their control overhead messages with each other. The exchanging of these messages utilizes the available network resources. This article proposes a Clustered IoT (CIoT) routing protocol, the CIoT routing protocol applies in a grid clustered topology. The proposed CIoT protocol aims to efficiently propagate messages between any pair of devices. The CIoT protocol selects only one route among a set of candidate routes, and the selected route is verified and evaluated based on some constraints. Also, this article proposes a Predictive Generated Hello Messages Algorithm (PGHMA). The PGHMA aims to minimize the generated control overhead messages produced by SDEVs and LEDRs. In comparison to other CBR protocols, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIoT algorithms by increasing network throughput by 78% and decreasing end-to-end latency by 12.5%. Also, the PGHMA algorithm significantly outperforms other algorithms in terms of reducing the number of generated HELLO messages by 5.9%. Finally, we implement and evaluate our proposed algorithms by comparing them to other related algorithms published in the literature.}

The number of IoT devices has increased day by day, so the number of devices that are connected to the Internet has also increased.

Device management is crucial, as the compromise of IoT devices might cause serious consequences and already there are examples of such a compromise caused widespread DDoS attacks. This paper aims to propose a mechanism that ensures the security of IoT devices and presents a management model and lightweight authentication mechanism simultaneously. The proposed mechanism is novel, computationally lightweight, financially low-cost, remotely usable, and requires no special hardware. This mechanism includes a key management phase to generate ephemeral keys for every session and a trivial and cost-efficient data transfer phase. The proposed mechanism provides an IoT device management model to achieve a scalable IoT environment. Data is transferred cost-effectively via XORs and hash functions. The security of the authentication mechanism is formally verified using AVISPA model checker.}

The types and characteristics of these devices vary depending on the industry 4.0 and have rapidly increased recently, especially in smart homes. These gadgets can expose users to serious cyber dangers because of a variety of computing constraints and vulnerabilities in the security-by-design concept. The smart home network testbed setup presented in this study is used to evaluate and validate the protection of the smart cyber-physical system. The context-aware threat intelligence and response model identifies the states of the aligned smart devices to distinguish between real-world typical and attack scenarios. It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance. Finally, the model's logic is used to gain rules to be included in Suricata signatures and the firewall rulesets for the response system. Significant values of the measuring parameters were found in the results. The presented model can be used for the real-time security of smart home cyber-physical systems and develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based multi-factor authentication (BMFA) combines multi-factor authentication with blockchain technology to provide a reliable and secure authentication mechanism. In other words, it adds a layer of protection and creates a comprehensive system that protects sensitive credentials in a decentralized ledger. This makes it challenging for unauthorized users to access or modify authentication credentials. However, BMFA is still in its infancy, and its effectiveness in preventing potential security breaches and unauthorized access has yet to be explored sufficiently. Thus, its development can be further advanced by reducing complexity, improving flexibility, decreasing costs, and enhancing authenticity. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure robust security measures and authentication mechanisms are in place as distributed systems, such as IoT, Fog, and WSN, become more sophisticated and integrated into our daily lives. Thus, such systems must have effective authentication mechanisms to function efficiently and effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of using blockchain technology with multi-factor authentication techniques in different subject areas. Also, the paper proposes a blockchain-based multi-factor authentication-as-a- service (BMFAaaS) approach and identifies the key requirements for its effective implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted between 2019–2023 to review existing studies and analyze the results against those key requirements. The review was concluded by discussing research challenges and future works in BMFAaaS for distributed systems.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently proliferated in both size and complexity. Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing efficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications. To address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data locally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to collect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated learning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep learning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the data analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with minimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient architectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would be advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a microservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be structured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable entities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated learning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible, and extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations to the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the privacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an IoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly available dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the proposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images, comprising 25 malware classes and one benign class. The results showed that our proposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection and classification performance, with a 99.24%}

	abstract = {The majority of communication protocols used in IoT networks for caching and congestion control techniques were rule-based which implies that these protocols are dependent on explicitly stated static models. To solve this issue, techniques are becoming more adaptive to changes in the network environment by incorporating a learning-based approach using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Recent surveys and review papers have covered topics on the use of ML and DL in either caching or congestion control techniques used in various types of networks. However, there is not an article in the literature dedicated to surveying the design of caching and congestion control mechanisms in IoT networks from the perspective of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) problem. Hence, this work aimed to survey the state-of-the-art DRL-based caching and congestion control techniques in IoT networks from 2019 to 2023. It also presented general frameworks for DRL-based caching and congestion control techniques based on surveyed works as a baseline for designing future protocols in IoT networks. Moreover, this paper classified the parameter choices of surveyed DRL-based techniques and identified the issues and challenges behind these techniques. Finally, a discussion of the possible future directions of this research domain was presented.}

	abstract = {In industrial environments, the IETF 6TiSCH stack is a protocol stack consisting of standardized layers (IEEE 802.15.4, TSCH, 6LoWPAN, RPL, CoAP) that enable reliable wireless communications. To efficiently manage the network, gathering insights is critical. This allows for detecting traffic bottlenecks, predicting energy consumption, checking duty cycle limits, adjusting network topology, and identifying interference. As such, detailed knowledge of the traffic quantity can be used to create a digital twin of the network to help prevent node or network failures by re-configuring network parameters. To that end, this paper presents an analytical model to calculate the transmitted and received bytes for every node in a 6TiSCH network, considering the complete 6TiSCH network stack. Real-time in-band network telemetry is used to limit monitoring overhead by piggybacking information onto transmitted data packets. Simulations demonstrate that our model provides accurate predictions with a median of 95 to 99% under various circumstances, such as topology changes and packet loss. The model can enhance network robustness and can be extended to predict the energy consumption of 6TiSCH devices easily.}

IoT data are prone to anomalies due to various factors such as malfunctioning of sensors, low-cost devices, etc. Following the AIoT paradigm, this work explores anomaly detection in IoT urban noise sensor networks using a Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder. Two autoencoder models are trained using normal data from two different sensors in the sensor network and tested for the detection of two different types of anomalies, i.e. point anomalies and collective anomalies. The results in terms of accuracy of the two models are 99.99% and 99.34%. The trained model is quantised, converted to TensorFlow Lite format and deployed on the ESP32 microcontroller (MCU). The inference time on the microcontroller is 4 ms for both models, and the power consumption of the MCU is 0.2693 W ± 0.039 and 0.3268 W ± 0.015.

	abstract = {IoT devices are widely used in smart hospitals, digital health, and automated pathology laboratories to generate a large amount of heterogeneous data. These devices, coupled with medical sensors, enable healthcare professionals to monitor patients’ health and medical device performance in real-time. The collected health data is transmitted to centralized cloud servers for analysis and diagnosis. However, the wireless communication channels used by these devices are vulnerable to security threats such as unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Existing solutions rely on a single trusted authority for computing and storage, which can lead to issues such as higher latency, centralization, and a single point of failure. To address these concerns, we propose a new protocol called Blockchain-based IoMT Authenticated Key Exchange (BIoMTAKE) that establishes a private/consortium blockchain-based distributed environment using Hyperledger Fabric. This protocol eliminates the need for a single trusted authority and ensures secure access to data generated by IoMT devices. Before sharing or accessing any data from the distributed healthcare system, the BIoMTAKE scheme establishes a secured shared session for authenticated devices to prevent unauthorized access. The proposed methodology has been subjected to formal security analysis using the Scyther tool and informal security analysis, which demonstrates its strong security. Additionally, our performance analysis using Hyperledger Fabric and cryptography libraries shows that the proposed scheme is computationally and communicatively efficient.}

	abstract = {During both Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications, authentication process is necessary to protect Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) from cyberattacks. In this paper, an efficient Conditional Privacy Preserving Authentication (CPPA) scheme is proposed which does not require a certificate and overcomes the escrow problem during the authentication process. The proposed scheme uses Elliptic Curve cryptography and avoids Map-to-Hash function and bilinear pairing. In this regard, we call our scheme Schnorr-CPPA since it allows to implement Schnorr algorithm and aggregate signatures into a short signature during the authentication process in VANET. When a roadside unit receives the same message from multiple vehicles, it can verify and aggregate the signatures into one aggregate signature using a multisignature feature and transmit the aggregate signature to a traffic control center for networking management. In addition, a roadside unit can verify different messages coming from vehicles by using a batch verification feature and aggregate the signatures into one signature, and then can transmit the result to a traffic control center. During both the multisignature and batch verification process, our Schnorr-CPPA is resistant against the rogue attack since the roadside unit should check the possession of proof (POP) as a proof that each signer possesses the private key. Additionally, a security proof is given and shows that our scheme is secure in the random oracle. Plus, our simulation proves that Schnorr-CPPA has better performance when compared with several research works regarding time cost for one and multiple messages during the authentication process.}

Unfortunately, this also makes these devices more susceptible to cyber threats, especially DoS/DDoS attacks. While supervised learning models have been adopted to detect and mitigate these threats, they have limitations in detecting unknown attacks that can cause severe consequences. This research aims to address those limitations and provide better protection for IoT networks against DoS/DDoS attacks. We propose a new approach that combines a soft-ordering convolutional neural network (SOCNN) model with local outlier factor (LOF) and isolation-based anomaly detection using nearest-neighbor ensembles (iNNE) models that use both supervised and unsupervised learning methods. We evaluated our approach on three benchmark datasets with varying unknown attack scenarios, and our hybrid model achieved high accuracy in detecting unknown attacks with an average F1-score of 98.94%, 91.68%, and 96.07%, respectively, on BoT-IoT, CIC-IDS-2017, and CIC-IDS-2018 datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors. Our model also showed resilience against adversarial attacks such as the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and Carlini Wagner (CW) adversarial attacks, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance IoT network security against DoS/DDoS attacks in unknown attack scenarios.}

	abstract = {The edge computing method and Internet of Things (IoT), which offers significantly shorter inactivity intervals, is one of the promising network technologies in today's generation of systems. There is no need to process the data using a cloud platform whenever an edge computing technology is used; alternative ways employing offline IoT and incremental learning techniques can be used. Using IoT, the incremental learning process transfers all essential data within a specific device. Thus, edge computing, IoT and incremental learning techniques are combined in the proposed method to detect numerous objects with varying weights. An analytical model that minimizes the parametric values and has various objectives is used to carry out the object detection process. Additionally, by utilizing evaluation metrics from five different case studies that were simulated using the MATLAB computing toolkit, the proposed method was tested. The efficacy of the proposed method rises to 62% when the simulated results are compared with the current method. The suggested method can accurately identify several objects in real-time when operating in a multi-object mode.}

	abstract = {A shield machine (SM) is a complex mechanical device used for tunneling. Traditional methods of monitoring SM working conditions relied on artificial experience, which was prone to hidden mechanical failures, human operator errors, and sensor anomalies. Faced with this situation, many scholars have studied intelligent control and decision-making methods for SM. However, most of these methods do not consider the relationship between SM and the operating environment, which makes it difficult for the model to apply to the actual engineering. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dynamic cooperation and mutual feedback network based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The network integrates SM, geological information, and control terminals. Then, based on this network, for the two important tasks of the SM field, rate prediction and anomaly detection has established SM Geology Convolutional with Attention (SM-GCA) and SM Geology Variational Autoencoder with Long Short-Term Memory (SM-GVL) models respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed two models outperform baseline models in terms of performance.}

This type of large-scale connectivity and distribution comes with several functional and non-functional challenges. These challenges may be addressed by software architectures and techniques. Microservices is one of the latest software architecture paradigms that aims at addressing many of the challenges. In an effort to explore microservice architecture's capability to address IoT challenges, this paper presents a review of the current state-of-the-art on the microservices based architecture for IoT systems. In this paper, we analyze how the microservices based architecture is currently used to improve non-functional characteristics of IoT systems, specifically reliability and availability. This is the first state-of-the-art review on microservices based IoT systems, it highlights strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for the microservices based architecture for IoT systems. To conduct this study a set of research questions and a taxonomy for microservices based IoT systems have been defined. The answers to the research questions provide an overall picture of the state of the art while the mapping of the surveyed papers to the defined taxonomy provides a more detailed picture about what has been done so far. The analysis shows that microservices based architecture has strong potential for IoT systems, specifically for improving reliability and availability. However, several weaknesses in the current solutions call for more research for handling properly reliability and availability of IoT systems.}

Because of the heterogeneity of IoT devices and data, interoperability is a challenge, and efforts are underway to overcome this through research and standardization. While data collection and monitoring in IoT systems are becoming more prevalent, contextualizing the data and taking appropriate actions to address issues in the monitored environment is still an ongoing concern.

Considering that the fog computing nodes are distributed, heterogeneous and have limited resources, it is not possible to deploy all the services belonging to IoT applications on the fog environment. Therefore, an efficient and autonomous mechanism is needed to map IoT services on the fog environment. The problem becomes more complicated when the various requirements of services including response time and cost are considered. With this motivation, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming model to address the Fog Service Placement (FSP) problem in fog-cloud computing environments. This model is formulated as a multi-objective model with the aim of minimizing deadline violation, resource loss and service cost, and maximizing resource usage. Meanwhile, we propose an Elitism-based Genetic Algorithm to solve the FSP problem developed with a Shared Parallel Architecture (EGASPE). Our algorithm considers the efficient distribution of resources under certain Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and seeks a balance between exploration and exploitation. Also, EGASPE can save more resources for future requests by considering the deadline of IoT services over time. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of EGASPE on a synthetic fog environment. The obtained results show the effectiveness of EGASPE up to 6.5% on average compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid proliferation of intelligent smart resource-bounded devices and autonomous software technologies has significantly influenced human life and made human life much smarter, more efficient, flexible, comfortable, and secure but device dependent. These intelligent devices are equipped with the feature of context awareness that often run in a highly decentralized environment with minimal and/or without human intervention. As these systems are often distributed in nature, they exhibit complex adaptive behavior by exchanging contextualized information among different resource-bounded devices and/or systems. However, due to the limitation of resources (computational memory), there are still many challenges for a real-time deployment. In this paper, we present a resource-bounded multi-agent reasoning-based context-aware model that assists users intelligently to take the right action autonomously whenever and wherever needed. The core emphasis is given to the lightweight, efficient reasoning mechanism to manipulate rapidly triggering contextual information with the least utilization of computational resources. We develop algorithms along with the complexity factors to evaluate the system’s efficacy in computational time and memory utilization. To suitably formalize the specification and model the proposed formalism using UPPAAL model checker, we develop the case study of a context-aware intelligent assistant along with its rule-based reasoning strategies and priorities for the execution of prioritized tasks according to the customized needs of the user and verify the correctness properties.}

By augmenting IoT with AI, objects can sense, perceive, think, and make decisions independently with minimal initial knowledge. These cognitive objects form a society and work toward achieving their goals through cooperation. However, trust is a significant security challenge in such a society. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a soft security approach to model trust in CIoT using Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems (CMAS). Our model introduces an interactive, autonomous, and self-taught agent that can move toward a secure situation without needing a supervisor. We use a state machine to model an insecure ecosystem where agents can behave honestly, adversarially, neutrally, or hypocritically. We define inner trust as a combination of direct and indirect experiences and observations and global trust as the weighted average of inner trust and recommendations. Additionally, we employ the reinforcement learning algorithm to train agents. To evaluate our model, we developed a proprietary tool called ASSOCIATE and assessed our model using data from the Santander Smart City dataset and simulator-generated data. Our evaluations encompass three aspects: the success rate in achieving the goal, the recognition of agents’ behavior, and the quality of the diagnosis.}

	abstract = {Deterministic Synchronous Multichannel Extension (DSME) and Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) are two emerging MAC behaviors that are based on IEEE 802.15.4 and permit the deployment of wireless sensor devices in a variety of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. While TSCH focuses on multi-channel hopping and fixed-size TDMA timeslots, DSME primarily addresses the drawbacks of the legacy IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, including the best use of the Guaranteed Time Slots (GTSs) and the application of channel diversity techniques. However, the existing literature lack the robustness for an ideal IIoT setup. In this regard, our suggested i-DSME MAC offers the best Quality of Service (QoS), incorporating an effective sensor prioritization strategy and suitable channel assessment techniques. The associated QoS constraints of the sensor devices are also considered by i-DSME in its core methodology, which is not explored adequately in the existing literature. To demonstrate the compatibility of i-DSME’s adaptability with the body of existing literature, we run thorough simulations of it. The results demonstrate that, on average, the proposed MAC protocol is more efficient than the benchmarks in terms of goodput (\n>\n39.82%), reliability (\n>\n12.50%), packet drop rate (\n>\n19.69%), and delay (\n>\n54.37%).}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based drug supply management (DSM) requires powerful security and privacy procedures for high-level authentication, interoperability, and medical record sharing. Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and application domains has made IoT security an unavoidable challenge. Spoofing the address resolution protocol (ARP) can be exploited by botnets and other malicious programs to propagate and cause damage. Conventional ARP spoofing detection and prevention methods are, in most cases, inefficient for the IoT. This paper presents an ARP spoofing detection system using explainable deep learning, namely ARP-PROBE, for IoT networks. The proposed system relies on features extracted from network packets to detect ARP spoofing quickly and effectively using a feature selection and extraction module that identifies and selects the highly influential features. In a performance evaluation, the proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.98% and an\nF\n1\nscore of 0.999. ARP-PROBE had a false positive rate of 0.026% and a false negative rate of 0.001%. To ensure that the model generalizes beyond the training data, a second dataset was used to evaluate it, and the results obtained were consistent with those of the first dataset. To provide a better understanding of the impact of each feature on the performance of the proposed deep learning model, which is the core of ARP-PROBE, a model explanation using SHAP explainability was provided.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are majorly used for remote collection and delivery of data for the operation of systems such as precision agriculture, military, e-health, and weather forecast. On most occasions, these devices are sited in remote locations without existing or reliable telecommunication networks, which makes real-time data delivery impossible. To mitigate this, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted system has been integrated into IoT data harvesting. However, this requires an authentication and key-agreement scheme capable of securing the harvested data and performing dynamic accessibility-mapping of IoT devices to a specific UAV such that each UAV will be able to identify its devices during harvesting without compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the harvested data. In this paper, we propose an authentication and key-agreement scheme for UAVs assisted IoT data harvesting. To achieve this, we developed n-Divide Loyalty Pairing (n-DLP) and a linear time sequence-based cartesian tree structure to secure the harvested data, and Chinese remainder theorem for a dynamic accessibility-mapping of different IoT devices to different UAVs. The experimental results and security analysis showed that the scheme secured the harvested data at low communication and computation overheads. Also, the results showed that the scheme has an insignificant effect on the mean waiting times of the data harvesting system.}

	abstract = {Cyber–Physical systems (CPS), combining continuous physical behavior and discrete control behavior, have been widely utilized in recent years. However, the traditional modeling languages used to specify discrete systems are no longer applicable to CPS, since CPS subsume the combination of the cyber and the physical. To address this, a modeling language for CPS with shared-variable concurrency is proposed. In this paper, we introduce an extension to the classical configuration of transitions in Structural Operational Semantics (SOS), which adds an auxiliary variable “now” to the data state. Using this configuration, we present operational semantics for this language. Then, we propose a translation strategy from this language to hybrid automata to enable efficient verification for CPS. We give the detailed translation of basic commands and compound constructs formally, and the correctness of this translation is explored as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide an example of Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and carry out the corresponding verification using SpaceEx. Compared with the existing work that uses SpaceEx for formal modeling and verification, the translation strategy from programs to automata not only allows any CPS described in this language to be modeled and verified based on the proposed strategy, but also indicates the semantic foundation on which formal verification depends.}

In this paper, balloons, UAVs and users are deployed to efficiently enhance users’ coverage. This paper studies three deployment problems: (i) placement of balloons to aid UAVs for wireless assistance, (ii) placement of UAVs to provide coverage to users, and (iii) a joint problem for successful deployment of balloons, UAVs, and connectivity to users. Firstly, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the number and costs of balloons. Secondly, the goal is to minimize the number of UAVs, maximize the number of users’ connections, minimize the distance between users and UAVs, and minimize the UAVs’ deployment costs. Thirdly, a joint problem is also introduced to provide efficient wireless coverage. The problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). An optimal algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem, however, the computational complexity of an optimal algorithm is high. Thus, a low-complexity greedy algorithm is also proposed. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed optimal and greedy algorithms.}

The data generated by various geo-distributed IoT devices is growing continuously. The existing IoT–Cloud paradigm limits the number of various emergent IoT applications as per the requirement. To utilize various IoT applications effectively and efficiently resource decentralization mechanism is a time of need. Fog computing is a novel computing approach for various IoT applications, specifically time-sensitive. Though, the resource-constrained nature of Fog devices in the fog computing model certainly fails to cater to multiple services for these IoT applications. The heterogeneity and dynamicity of the application request from the IoT devices need a quick decision regarding the placement of the application in the fog layer. Hence, optimal allocation of resources is quite essential for providing uninterrupted services to the end-users. This article comprehensively analyzes the different types of possible IoT application models and strategies for allocating resources to these applications. Since the resource allocation problem has already been proven to be a computationally NP-hard problem, finding a non-deterministic algorithm for allocating resources is our target. In this article, we have taken the IoT application placement problem in fog computing (APFC) as a single and multiple objective optimization problems. We have conducted a survey based on single and multiple objectives to address other possible issues in APFC. Finally, the challenges and promising directions for further research are presented.}

	abstract = {Smart environmental monitoring has gained prominence, where target localization is of utmost importance. Employing UAVs for localization tasks is appealing owing to their low-cost, lightweight, and high maneuverability. However, UAVs lack the autonomy of decision-making if met with uncertain situations. Therefore, reinforcement learning (RL) can introduce intelligence to UAVs, where they learn to act based on the presented situation. Existing works focus on UAV trajectory optimization, navigation, and target tracking. These methods are application-specific and cannot be adapted to localization tasks since they require prior knowledge of the target. Moreover, the current RL-based autonomous target localization systems are lacking since- 1) they must keep track of all visited locations and their corresponding readings, 2) they require retraining when encountering new environments, and 3) they are not scalable since the agent's movement is limited to slow speeds and for specific environments. Therefore, this work proposes a data-driven UAV target localization system based on Q-learning, which employs tabular methods to learn the optimal policy. Deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to enhance the RL model and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The proposed models enable smart decision-making, where the sensory information gathered by the UAV is exploited to produce the best action. Moreover, the UAV movement is modeled based on motion physics, where the actions correspond to linear velocities and heading angles. The proposed approach is compared with different benchmarks, where the results indicate that a more efficient, scalable, and adaptable localization is achieved, irrespective of the environment or source characteristics, without retraining.}

	abstract = {In the field of the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge computing has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm that offers unprecedented benefits by serving the IoT at the network edge. One of the primary advantages of edge computing is that it reduces the job completion time by offloading tasks at the edge server from the IoT. Typically, a job is made up of dependent tasks in which the output of one task is required as the input to the other. This work proposes a directed cyclic graph model that represents the dependencies among these tasks focusing on jointly optimizing task dependencies with deadline constraints for tasks that are delay-sensitive. Thus, dependent tasks are scheduled while considering their deadlines using priority-aware scheduling. For tasks with no deadlines, the processing is done with First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling. The tasks with a priority are offloaded to the suitable edge server for processing by using a priority queue to enhance the task satisfaction rate under deadline constraints. To model the suitable edge server decision, we use the Markov decision process (MDP) that minimizes the total completion time. Additionally, we model the mobility of users while offloading tasks to the edge servers. The throughput results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms random offloading, the highest data rate offloading (HDR), the highest computing device (HCD), and delay-dependent priority-aware offloading (DPTO), by 66.67%, 43.75%, 27.78%, and 4.55%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed strategy surpasses random, HDR, and HCD offloading in terms of task satisfaction rate by 20.48%, 16.28%, and 12.36%, respectively.}

The response time is very critical as it can cause the situation to deteriorate, and lead to irreversible damage or even death. Therefore, minimizing the response time in emergency situations is crucial. We propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled add-on system to the governmental emergency response system (ERS) that could be used to achieve this goal with the help of the nearest medics to an emergency site. Our design consists of a mobile application, a delivery drone, and registered medical personnel. The mobile application is used by the public to report emergencies, and by the medics to receive help requests. The drone is dispatched to the emergency location, delivering medical supplies to the medic to perform professional first aid. The system is fully autonomous, as the server handles the communication between all system components. A real-time database is used to store the information of all users, along with the location of medics and drones. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software design and implementation of our prototype named “Istighatha”, which is an Arabic term translating to “seeking help” or “Mayday”. Our prototype illustrates the proposed use case in healthcare emergency response.}

	abstract = {By enabling 5G technology, IoT networks can improve the performance of connected IoT devices. However, handover, ping-pong effect and load balancing are critical issues because of massive and unplaned deployment of small cells. The handover operation in 5G wireless networks is complicated because there are many radio access techniques and technologies. Therefore, the mobility management is required to provide QoS for various applications. In this paper, we present a fuzzy-based system for handover decision in 5G wireless networks considering different network slicing parameters. We implement two Fuzzy-based Handover Decision Models (FHDM): FHDM1 and FHDM2. We evaluate the proposed models by simulations. For FHDM1, Slice Delay (SD), Slice Bandwidth (SB), and Slice Load (SL) are three input parameters and Handover Decision (HD) is the output parameter. For FHDM2, Slice Reliability (SR) is a new considered parameter, so it has four input parameters and the output parameter is HD the same as FHDM1. We found from simulation results that the considered parameters have different effects on HD. For both models, the HD value increases as SD and SL values increase while HD value is decreasing when SB and SR values increase. The results of the simulation indicate that although FHDM2 is more complex than FHDM1, it performs better HD since considers four input parameters. From the simulation results of FHDM2, when we changed SD value form 10% to 90%, we found that the HD value is increased by 50% when SR is 50% and SL is 90%. This indicates that when a user is connecting with the present slice that has bad QoS, it should handover to another slice with better QoS.}

	abstract = {Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol that protects distributed services on the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data. In a distributed scenario, entities must prove their identity to a trusted third party using shared secrets, such as secret keys. Traditional schemes typically use a trusted central organization, like a Key Distribution Center, for identity authentication. However, Kerberos has some downsides, such as a single point of failure, vulnerability to replay attacks, and potential credential exposure, which can compromise system security. To address these problems, researchers have been working on various solutions, but most have their own drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Kerberos Secure Service-Management Protocol (DKSM) based on blockchain technology and Ciphertext-policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) schema. Compared with existing protocols, DKSM fulfills decentralization, fine-grained access control with effective cost, and scalability simultaneously. DKSM uses AES and Fast Attribute-Based Encryption with Optimal Security (FABEO) as its cryptographic basis. We also discuss the security of DKSM and demonstrate how our protocol can defend against attacks. Finally, tests on the Ethereum testnet and FISCO consortium platform have shown that our designed protocol is efficient and cost-effective.}

	abstract = {As recommended by the World Health Organization, testing, isolation, and physical distancing are the keys to combat the pandemic due to COVID-19. However, physical distance monitoring and management is not straightforward, specifically in regions with high population density. Crowdsensing is one of the most feasible solutions where a large group of volunteers with mobile devices collectively share data and analysis on such data is carried out for extracting insights of common interest. This article proposes a novel mobile crowdsensing-based geospatial physical distance monitoring model capable of efficient pandemic monitoring and management. The work consists of two major contributions: analysis of human mobility information to find probable hot-spot regions and monitoring of the physical distance mandate. Another objective of this paper is to devise mobile crowdsourcing analytics model to find out the quality of the crowdsensing information and infer any implicit knowledge without affecting the quality of the output. Furthermore, we have also designed an Android application to implement the mobile crowdsensing system, named SocialSense, and provide effective pandemic management. The proposed model is supported by a theoretical analysis of latency calculation. We observe from the experimental results that the accuracy in hot-spot identification and physical distance monitoring are better in the case of the proposed model than the existing approaches. The trustworthiness of the crowdsourcing data is also improved in terms of accuracy than the existing approaches.}

	abstract = {An IoT-enabled vehicle recognition system is developed and tested in this work, besides the tag antenna design and prototype for the vehicle windshield. Firstly, a flexible, surface-tolerant, low-profile, and low-cost passive UHF-RFID windshield tag inlay is designed. The tag is prototyped as wet-inlay with silver conductive-ink inkjet printed antenna on Polyethylene-Terephthalate layer, bonded with Higgs-EC IC. The dimension of the antenna is 0.25\n×\n0.05\nλ\n0\n. The overall inlay structure is around 0.27\n×\n0.06\nλ\n0\n. The antenna is designed at ETSI band, with a return loss of −14 dB at 900 MHz and a read range of 13.3 m and 8 m over lower and upper bands, respectively. The antenna demonstrates an omnidirectional radiation pattern and a maximum gain of 1.92 dBi. The developed prototype is tested in both indoor and outdoor environments. Secondly, the data is sent over the IoT cloud where decision-making is made for authorization. The reader data is transmitted over MQTT broker, via the Scotland 5G network to the MongoDB database using Python module Pymongo. The algorithm for vehicle recognition is written and verified by testing the dummy registered tags for access authorization, with a 100% recognition accuracy. We achieved higher read ranges, surface tolerance, and low profile features, comparatively. The overall system shows optimally great results.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an efficient distributed machine learning paradigm for the collaborative training of neural network models by many clients with the assistance of a central server. Currently, the main challenging issue is that malicious clients can send poisoned model updates to the central server, making FL vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose a new system named DeMAC to improve the detection and defence against model poisoning attacks by malicious clients. The main idea behind the new system is based on an observation that, as malicious clients need to reduce the poisoning task learning loss, there will be obvious increases in the norm of gradients. We define a metric called GradScore to measure this norm of clients. It is shown through experiments that the GradScores of malicious and benign clients are distinguishable in all training stages. Therefore, DeMAC can detect malicious clients by measuring the GradScore of clients. Furthermore, a historical record of the contributed global model updates is utilized to enhance the DeMAC system, which can spontaneously detect malicious behaviours without requiring manual settings. Experiment results over two benchmark datasets show that DeMAC can reduce the attack success rate under various attack strategies. In addition, DeMAC can eliminate model poisoning attacks under heterogeneous environments.}

	abstract = {Embedded Subscriber Identity Module (eSIM) offers more flexibility compared to Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM). Unlike USIM, eSIM enables the operator to remotely provision security credentials in the devices. Therefore, in future deployments of IoT over cellular networks, eSIMs are more likely to be used in comparison to USIMs. In anticipation, the 3rd generation partnership project (3gpp) has recently published a mechanism for remote credential provisioning of eSIM-enabled IoT devices in 5G cellular networks (Technical Specification: TS 33.899, Release 14, Section 12.2). However, this technical specification does not include an authentication protocol, which is an indispensable part of any secure communication. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication protocol to complement the remote credential provisioning mechanism published in TS 33.899. While developing the protocol, due consideration to resource constraints of IoT devices is given by using lightweight cryptographic techniques like elliptic curve cryptography, one-way hash functions, XOR operations, etc. Security analysis of the proposed protocol using BAN logic and AVISPA shows the protocol to be secure. Performance analysis, involving the execution of the protocol in Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroller board and a workstation, shows the protocol to be efficient in comparison to other similar proposals.}

However, this investigation demonstrates the security weaknesses of a previous protocol, which may lead to their scheme lacking user privacy protection, violating session key security, and unable to withstand impersonation attacks, and develops an enhanced protocol by adopting dynamic identities and ensuring message freshness. The enhanced protocol is proved the security using formal proofs and secure against possible attacks. Compared with related protocols, the enhanced protocol solves the previous weaknesses, provides more security requirements, and increased the overall performance by about 28.4%.}

The integration of drones with the IoD has opened up new possibilities for efficient and intelligent aerial operations, facilitating advancements in sectors such as logistics, agriculture, surveillance, and emergency response This paper introduces a novel approach for drone identification and classification by extracting radio frequency (RF) fingerprints and utilizing Mel spectrograms as distinctive patterns. The proposed approach converts RF signals to audio signals and leverages Mel spectrograms as essential features to train neural networks. The YAMNet neural network is employed, utilizing transfer learning techniques, to train the dataset and classify multiple drone models. The initial classification layer achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.6% in distinguishing between drones and non-drones. In the subsequent layer, the model achieves 96.9% accuracy in identifying drone types from three classes, including AR Drone, Bebop Drone, and Phantom Drone. At the third classification layer, the accuracy ranges between 96% and 97% for identifying the specific mode of each drone type. This research showcases the efficacy of Mel spectrogram-based RF fingerprints and demonstrates the potential for accurate drone identification and classification using pre-trained YAMNet neural networks.}

	abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) claimed that wearing masks can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we devise novel YOLO-v5s detectors for improving the accuracy of recognizing face masks under heterogeneous IoT computing platforms. First, a module of coordinate attention is merged with the original YOLO-v5s backbone to enhance the model's attention to key information and filter out redundant information. Second, the original feature pyramid network (FPN) in the neck network is replaced with the bidirectional FPN for fast multiscale feature fusion. Third, the block of adaptive spatial feature fusion is embedded into the head layer to further solve the problem of feature inconsistency with different scales. Last, the SCYLLA-IoU metric serves as the new bounding box loss function to accelerate the model convergence. The training results show that applying the improved YOLO-v5s model to the AIZOO dataset yields an improvement in recognition accuracy of +2.2% and that the improved model has lower false detections and better detection of dense crowds. In addition, we propose a new evaluation standard of the scale limit factor to measure the detection performance of the model with different shooting distances. The proposed model is deployed on three heterogeneous IoT platforms, the Google Colab cloud, a personal computing terminal, and an Nvidia Jetson Nano edge computing device, to validate the inference feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness.}

IoT-based UAV network system is used for surveillance, monitoring, payload delivery, and much more which generate a plethora of sensitive information which can be obtained by adversaries in the middle. The communication between UAVs and GCS is vulnerable to security threats using jamming and eavesdropping attacks. The message between UAV and GCS is not enciphered which makes them error-prone. Attacks like GPS (Global Positioning System) spoofing can be possible by sending fake coordinates to trick UAV’s control. Although much effort has been made toward UAV security. However, there is a dearth of descriptive reviews on secure communication in IoT-based UAV networks. The purpose of this paper is to find and examine peer-reviewed literature that discusses previous six-year established papers with existing attacks such as physical, and logical attacks with suggested solutions such as trajectory planning, lightweight schemes, solutions based on blockchain, quantum cryptography, etc. This paper analyzes the secure communication network between UAVs by systematically answering research questions based on the research methodology for the relevant study.

	abstract = {It is not uncommon that cellular communication infrastructures will likely be in a failure state when disaster strikes, e.g., floods, earthquakes, and forest fires. Therefore, developing an effective disaster management system is paramount to facing these critical circumstances. As a solution, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as temporary aerial base stations to assist beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks during and after the disaster. UAVs are increasingly used to aid the search and rescue (SAR) teams in multiple disaster management operations to improve disaster response effectiveness. However, maintaining connectivity and improving energy efficiency are indispensable to ensure continuous communication between the UAVs and SAR and prolong the network’s lifetime. This paper proposes a multi-UAV and SAR device-to-device communication model to maintain connectivity and enhance energy efficiency in multiple disaster scenarios. A clustering approach for UAV placement is utilized to improve energy efficiency, network connectivity, and coverage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model in terms of the average capacity, energy efficiency, coverage probability and outage probability. The simulation results demonstrate an improved performance of multi-UAV and SAR collaborations and their appropriateness to support efficient and reliable disaster recovery in hard-to-reach and remote disaster areas.}

	abstract = {The world is becoming more digitised with the rise of modular robotic systems. Therefore, with the increasing demands and needs for robotics, the modular robotic domain was introduced as an essential key part of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Modular self-configurable robotic systems (E.g. swarms) are classed as “smart” autonomous machines with kinematic properties, defined by a set of interconnected links, modules and algorithms to achieve the required three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D) complex shape or hierarchical structure. Due to its “intelligent” concept, it beame suitable for its deployment in the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) domain. Thus, becoming a key part of it and establishing itself as the newly revolutionised Internet of Modular Robotic Things (IoMRT). This paper presents a survey that highlights and discusses this novel IoMRT concept that focuses on self-reconfigurable modular robots and robotic systems by discussing their criteria, characteristics, architecture, and design. The security, safety, and privacy aspects are also presented and discussed, making it among the first papers to focus on this topic and its future. Moreover, the main drawbacks and challenges are also highlighted, while the already available solutions are also presented and analysed. A brief analysis regarding each solution is also presented with an insight into their future work. Additionally, more work was presented regarding the security aspect(s) of modular robotic systems to protect them from possible cyber or/and physical attacks. Thus, covering all possible aspects of the IoMRT.}

Unfortunately, this also has resulted in a fertile field for attackers. As a result, traditional intrusion detection models and new detection schemes for IoMT applications have been applied. Along with it, there has been a rising trend of employing different types of artificial intelligence algorithms to improve the detection performance of attacks in medical systems communications. This paper provides a novel taxonomy of intrusion detection schemes for IoMT, which includes a comparative analysis of intrusion detection methods and an unique classification of current datasets for insights into detection performance. Additionally, we discuss the cybersecurity threats regarding the IoMT architecture and the security requirements of IoMT. Moreover, an examination of the tasks carried out in Cloud–Fog–Edge architectures, and a classification of recent literature based on the AI methods, are presented. We also discuss the legal and ethical security aspects of IoMT. Finally, we provide the challenges and novel perspectives requiring further investigation.}

The current study aims to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities in IoT, offering suitable countermeasures with a focus on describing the impact of emerging technologies on IoT devices and protocol layers. The main vulnerabilities across different layers of the IoT reference model are discussed and categorized, and suitable countermeasures (such as separating IT and IoT network traffic, enhancing physical security, implementing encryption and secure messaging protocols, etc.) are suggested. In addition, the hardware, communication, application, web, and cloud vulnerabilities are introduced, then the corresponding safeguards and protections are presented. Furthermore, Information Assurance (IA) has been deliberately defined and the adoption of the NIST framework and IA model is recommended as a metric to ensure security for IoT solutions considering the five pillars of availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. Finally, Blockchain technology, known for its use in securing cryptocurrencies, is suggested to facilitate secure data exchange, identification, authentication, and communication for IoT devices by various avenues including ensuring the integrity of sensor data, eliminating the need for intermediaries, reducing costs, and enabling direct addressability of IoT devices.}

	abstract = {Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems are able to maintain the availability and integrity of IoT systems, in the presence of failure of individual components, random data corruption or malicious attacks. Fault-tolerant systems in general are essential in assuring continuity of service for mission-critical applications. However, their implementation may be challenging and expensive. In this study, IoT Systems with BFT are considered. Analytical models and solutions are presented as well as a detailed analysis for the evaluation of the availability. BFT is particularly important for blockchain mechanisms, and in turn for IoT, since it can provide a secure, reliable and decentralized infrastructure for IoT devices to communicate and transact with each other. A continuous-time Markov chain is used to model the IoT systems with BFT where the breakdown and repair times follow exponential distributions, and the number of the Byzantine nodes in the network follows various distributions. The presented numerical findings demonstrate the relationship between the number of nodes in the system, the proportion of honest users, and the overall availability. Based on the model, it can be inferred that the correlation between the scale of the system (nodes) and network availability is non-linear. Additionally, results show that even for relatively small-size systems with 40 nodes, an average availability greater than 0.999 and an estimated downtime per year that is less than 9 h is possible.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training, but the distribution of data across devices presents significant challenges to global model convergence. Existing approaches risk losing the representativeness of local models after model aggregation, calling for a more efficient and robust solution. In this study, we address the model aggregation challenge within FL by focusing on elevating the performance of the global model amidst class imbalance and non-independent, non-identically distributed data. We aim to train a global model collaboratively that represents all participating nodes, promoting fairness and ensuring adequate representation of all classes in the model. We propose redistributing local model weights based on their precision-based contributions to each class to enhance the performance and communication efficiency of federated thermal comfort prediction. Our proposed method can assist in allocating more resources and attention to nodes with high precision for underrepresented classes, thereby improving the global model overall performance and fairness. Furthermore, our framework leverages the virtualization capability of digital-twin to enable the dynamic registration and participation of nodes in the federated learning process in real-time. The developed digital-twin framework allows for real-time monitoring and control of the decentralized training. Through our evaluation on a real dataset, we showcase noteworthy enhancements in accuracy and communication efficiency when compared to existing methods. Our evaluation shows that the proposed Class Precision-Weighted Aggregation technique (Fed-CPWA) outperforms Federated Averaging, with higher accuracy of 82.85% and lower communication costs by 25%. Our contribution represents a significant stride towards sustainable thermal comfort modeling, further advancing the development of equitable and resilient federated learning techniques.}

	abstract = {Today, the Internet of things (IoT) is widely used in various fields, including health control, smart cities, intelligent buildings, and so on. One of the severe concerns in IoT systems is the issue of energy consumption and its management. IoT systems have limited energy resources, and in this regard, these limited resources must be managed appropriately. To design and build IoT systems, various aspects such as usable chips, types of communication protocols, timing of sending and receiving data, and so on, directly affect the system's energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to model and evaluate the energy consumption of IoT systems before building and implementing the system. Using an appropriate model makes it possible to investigate and understand how much the system consumes energy and how it is in conformity with the system's demands. This paper presents a stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model for modeling and quantitative evaluation of system energy consumption. To solve and evaluate the model, the proposed model is converted into an SRN model based on a series of automatic transformations. The proposed model is used in a case study to show how the model works and the results are given in the paper.}

	abstract = {The Device-to-Device (D2D) communications involve a direct, peer-to-peer link between devices that operates independently of fixed network infrastructures. It can either complement existing network infrastructures or be used as a standalone network to provide services, such as distributing content, supporting emergency services during natural disasters, and enabling smartphone applications like AirDrop (iOS) and Nearby Share (Android). However, the behavior of D2D communication is not always predictable, and there are many challenges to implementing and deploying D2D communication systems in real-world situations. In particular, it is hard to know what throughput one can obtain, as nominal numbers provided by the documentation are seldom observed in practice. This paper focuses on Nearby Connections Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Google. This API offers distinct strategies in function of the network’s topology, and choosing the right one for an application is a challenging task as they perform differently. In this paper, we contribute to the research community in two ways. Firstly, we investigate the real-time performance of throughput of two strategies (STAR and POINT-TO-POINT, as they are the only ones to use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct to transfer data). Our study shows that the POINT-TO-POINT strategy generally achieves high throughput performance and is suitable for use cases involving high network traffic. In contrast, the STAR performs poorly in throughput, which can result in link instability and slow transfers in some cases. Secondly, we disclose a tool to help network designers evaluate their networks and fine-tune their protocols and algorithms according to their specificities.}

TDDM4IoTS consists of 11 stages, including activities ranging from system requirements gathering to system maintenance. To evaluate the effectiveness of TDDM4IoTS and TDDT4IoTS, in the last four academic years from 2019, System Engineering students have developed several IoT-based systems as part of their training, from the sixth semester (third academic year). Ñawi (phonetically, Gnawi), which is the case study presented herein, is one of them, and intends to assist visually impaired people to move through open environments. Ñawi consists of a device, a mobile application and a web application. The device interacts with the environment and issues alerts to the user whenever it recognizes obstacles in their path. The mobile application targets two user roles: assisted person and caregiver. Assisted people can use the device and log in into a server when they leave home, so that the mobile application identifies and notifies obstacles in their path. All the collected data is gathered into the server, so that caregivers receive notifications and can monitor the location of their assisted people at any place and time. The web application allows caregivers to query and view more extensive information (details of events, trajectories, etc.). TDDM4IoTS has been evaluated regarding both the roles of the project members and the development cycle stages. A survey was used to evaluate the methodology. Out of a total of 47 respondents, 30 had used TDDM4IoTS and 96.66% of them were very satisfied or satisfied, with nobody unsatisfied.}

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) revolutionizes industrial production using smart devices (SMDs) deployed in IIoT environments. These SMDs collect and transmit information from target fields for analysis and can be controlled remotely. In emergency situations, real-time access to specific SMD information is crucial for prompt actions. However, ensuring secure and reliable communication between users and SMDs in untrusted channels is a significant challenge. Privacy concerns and the limitations of existing authentication frameworks further exacerbate this challenge, necessitating a lightweight cryptography-based authentication framework. This framework is essential to enable secure and reliable communication in the diverse IIoT environment while addressing privacy leakage threats and the computational constraints of IoT devices. Recently, various lightweight cryptography-based authenticated encryption (AE) schemes have been proposed to enable encryption and decryption services for resource-constrained IIoT devices. ASCON, an efficient AE scheme, offers confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in a single encryption and decryption operation, reducing the number of cryptographic operations required for authentication framework design. This paper presents CMAF-IIoT, a chaotic map and resource-efficient AE scheme (ASCON)-based authentication framework for IIoT, addressing the aforementioned challenges. CMAF-IIoT ensures reliable communication between SMDs and users. The framework begins with user-performed local authentication on their smart devices, followed by the establishment of a session key with the SMD after mutual authentication with the gateway. Using the session key, users securely access real-time information from SMDs deployed in the IIoT environment. The security of CMAF-IIoT is validated through formal and informal security analyses. Additionally, the efficiency of CMAF-IIoT is evaluated in terms of communication, computational, and storage costs. The results indicate that CMAF-IIoT requires [6.67% to 53.33%] low storage cost, [45.13% to 65.87%] low computational cost, and [16.46% to 83.29%] low communication cost compared to contrasted authentication frameworks. These findings highlight the viability of CMAF-IIoT for the IIoT environment, as it provides resource efficiency and enhanced security features.}

	abstract = {Intelligent transport systems are increasingly being used in practice these days. Fog nodes and cloud servers collect real-time pedestrian and vehicle data and train them based on machine learning models. Existing pedestrian and vehicle detection systems need more security, less resource leakage, and faster processing. This paper proposes a homomorphic, secure, federated learning-enabled pedestrian detection system named HMFLS. The HMFLS consists of base stations (BS) and homogeneous (homo) federated learning servers with weights, surveillance, and traffic light components, and these nodes serve as data generation and processing sources. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic technique that allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. In other words, it enables computations on encrypted data while preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the information. The HMFLS exploits Generative Adversarial Networks to train pedestrian and vehicle images and extract features based on VGG19 from fog nodes and surveillance sensor images. We trained the different tasks and weights based on the model’s 28,000 pedestrian and vehicle images. The goal is to identify pedestrians and vehicles in the system. The interface is based on an Android-based application that can be easily integrated into different vehicles and mobile phones. Simulation results demonstrated that HMFL performed well as compared to existing schemes (e.g., PEL, TFL-CNN, FLAV) in terms of security accuracy by 98%, resource leakage by 50%, and processing time by 52% for vehicle and pedestrian detection in the system.}

	abstract = {History has demonstrated that healthcare and medical systems play a crucial role in enforcing the development of science and technology. Humans have been seeing an explosive growth of e-health applications, where cloud computing has dominated e-healthcare systems and all domains in the past decades. However, one primary barrier to cloud-based e-health systems is their high response time. In emergencies, data aggregation and handling and decision-making regarding treatment need to be performed in seconds and directly affect the life of patients. These issues relate to resource constraints, such as medical equipment, ambulances, medical staff, medical facilities, and other conditions. To address these problems, computing architectures have been introduced, such as edge, fog, and cloud computing methods. In this work, we propose an all-in-one computing framework based on combining different computing solutions in real-time smart healthcare domains. Then, considering the efficiency of the proposed solution by the queue network model tool, we give recommendations for the optimal network infrastructure deployment depending on the scale-patients of hospitals. We believe that the results of this work will play an important role in the network infrastructure optimization of medical facilities while ensuring the provision of real-time healthcare services.}

	abstract = {In recent times, the distributed cloud computing landscape has witnessed a remarkable surge in processing vast amounts of data and the crucial need to maintain service level agreements (SLAs) between providers and consumers. In this dynamic environment, cloud resources are inherently multidimensional, encompassing computing machines and communication connections susceptible to failures and energy-related considerations. However, given two-objective energy and reliability optimization, existing time allocation policies focus primarily on optimizing a single intent, which leads to system degradation in environments that generate problematic constraints from executable processing units. To handle the shortcomings of the application placement policies, we suggest a solution in the form of a three-phase bi-objective workflow scheduling issue called (Bi-OWSP). This three-phase approach aims to optimize workflow scheduling by simultaneously considering energy and reliability as two vital objectives. To achieve this, we employ two distinct algorithms. First is the stepwise dynamic voltage and frequency scale algorithm ensures energy efficiency by calculating optimal frequencies, reducing energy usage, and minimizing task mapping time. The second algorithm is the reliability-conscious heterogeneous fault tolerance approach, which emphasizes avoiding high-deficit servers and communication links to enhance system reliability. Furthermore, we introduce an energy-aware stepwise reliability maximization algorithm, which intelligently selects the best combination of task-server pairs to achieve energy minimization and reliability maximization. Through extensive simulation experiments on artificial and real-world workflow applications, we demonstrate the significance of Bi-OWSP in providing superior energy-reliability compensation solutions compared to competing algorithms.}
