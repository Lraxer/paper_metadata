	abstract = {In this article, we design finite-length irregular protograph-based quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with good waterfall performance and low error floor. To achieve a low error floor, we eliminate a targeted set of dominant elementary trapping sets (ETS) £ in the Tanner graph of the code. For a given rate and girth, the codes are designed to be free of the largest set of problematic ETSs for a given block length, or to have the shortest block length while a given set of ETSs is avoided. The design is based on a search algorithm that identifies whether any instance of any structure within £ exists in the Tanner graph of the constructed code or not. The search algorithm performs this task with minimal complexity, making it feasible to construct practical codes by running the search algorithm a large number of times. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of designed codes compared to similar state-of-the-art irregular QC-LDPC codes.}

	abstract = {In the fields of information theory and network coding, a complete characterization of the almost entropic region is a fundamental but inherently difficult open problem. This paper focuses on the characterization of this region via explicit inner bounds, optimization of functions over this region, and network code construction. One approach to study the entropic region is to put a constraint on the alphabets for involved random variables, enabling us to focus on a specific set of joint distributions. We present the notion of alphabet constrained entropic set and describe its properties, namely, its a closed and path-connected set. Motivated by the properties, a random local search algorithm is designed to find an entropic vector and associated distribution near to a given target vector and extended to optimize functions of joint entropies. We present significantly improved inner bound compared to known inner bounds for the almost entropic region involving four random variables using a refinement of our algorithm. Finally, another application of the algorithm is shown to construct network codes and index codes for a given rate vector in the capacity region. This approach to constructing network codes is novel and has an entirely different flavor than classical coding theoretic construction.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on an improved Gaussian approximation (GA) based construction of polar codes with successive cancellation (SC) decoding over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Arıkan proved that polar codes with low-complexity SC decoding can approach the channel capacity of an arbitrary symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channel, provided that the code length is chosen large enough. Nevertheless, how to construct such codes over an AWGN channel with low computational effort has been an open problem. Compared to density evolution, the GA is known as a low complexity yet powerful technique that traces the evolution of the mean log likelihood ratio (LLR) value by iterating a nonlinear function. Therefore, its high-precision numerical evaluation is critical as the code length increases. In this work, by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of this nonlinear function, we propose an improved GA approach that makes an accurate trace of mean LLR evolution feasible. With this improved GA, through numerical analysis and simulations with code lengths up to N=2^{18} , we explicitly demonstrate that various code-rate polar codes with long codeword and capacity approaching behavior can be easily designed.}

	abstract = {Recently, coding has been a useful technique to mitigate stragglers' effect in distributed computing. However, coding in this context has been mainly explored assuming homogeneous workers, although real-world clusters often consist of heterogeneous workers with different computing capabilities. The uniform load allocation without considering the heterogeneity possibly causes a significant loss in latency. In this article, we suggest the optimal load allocation for coded distributed computing with heterogeneous workers. Specifically, we focus on the scenario that there exist workers having the same computing capability, which can be regarded as a group for analysis. We rely on the lower bound on the expected latency and obtain the optimal load allocation by showing that our load allocation achieves the minimum of the lower bound for a sufficiently large number of workers. Given the proposed optimal load allocation, we derive the optimal code rate to achieve the minimum expected latency. From numerical simulations, when assuming the group heterogeneity, our load allocation reduces the expected latency by orders of magnitude over the existing scheme. Furthermore, from experiments on Amazon EC2 for scenarios with distinct straggler/heterogeneity patterns, we observe that our scheme outperforms the competing schemes reducing the total finishing time by up to 52%.}

	abstract = {Coded computing is a new framework to address fundamental issues in large scale distributed computing, by injecting structured randomness and redundancy. We first provide an overview of coded computing and summarize some recent advances. Then we focus on distributed matrix multiplication and consider a common scenario where each worker is assigned a fraction of the multiplication task. In particular, by partitioning two input matrices into m-by-p and p-by-n subblocks, a single multiplication task can be viewed as computing linear combinations of pmn submatrix products, which can be assigned to pmn workers. Such block-partitioning-based designs have been widely studied under the topics of secure, private, and batch computation, where the state of the arts all require computing at least “cubic” (pmn) number of submatrix multiplications. Entangled polynomial codes, first presented for straggler mitigation, provides a powerful method for breaking the cubic barrier. It achieves a subcubic recovery threshold, i.e., recovering the final product from any subset of multiplication results with a size order-wise smaller than pmn. We show that entangled polynomial codes can be further extended to also include these three important settings, providing unified frameworks that order-wise reduce the total computational costs by achieving subcubic recovery thresholds.}

To ensure the low latency, short packets are adopted for the control signal. As a result, the Shannon capacity theorem cannot be adopted here due to its assumption of infinite channel blocklength. We consider both free space (FS) and 3-Dimensional (3D) channel models by assuming that the locations of the UAV are randomly distributed within a restricted space. We first characterize the statistical characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both FS and 3D models. Then, the closed-form analytical expressions of APEP and ET are derived by using Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature. Also, the lower bounds are derived to obtain more insights. Finally, we obtain the optimal value of packet length with the objective of maximizing the ET by applying one-dimensional search. Our analytical results are verified by the Monte-Carlo simulations.}

In the prior art, maximum likelihood (ML) decision criteria have already been developed for noisy channels suffering from signal independent offset. In this paper, such ML criterion is considered for the case of binary signals suffering from Gaussian noise and signal dependent offset. The signal dependency of the offset signifies that it may differ for distinct signal levels, i.e., the offset experienced by the zeroes in a transmitted codeword is not necessarily the same as the offset for the ones. Besides the ML criterion itself, also an option to reduce the complexity is considered. Further, a brief performance analysis is provided, confirming the superiority of the newly developed ML decoder over classical decoders based on the Euclidean or Pearson distances.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient technique for decomposing non-orthogonally superposed k geometric sequences. The method, which is named as geometric sequence decomposition with k-simplexes transform (GSD-ST), is based on the concept of transforming an observed sequence to multiple k-simplexes in a virtual k-dimensional space and correlating the volumes of the transformed simplexes. Hence, GSD-ST turns the problem of decomposing k geometric sequences into one of solving a k-th order polynomial equation. Our technique has significance for wireless communications because sampled points of a radio wave comprise a geometric sequence. This implies that GSD-ST is capable of demodulating randomly combined radio waves, thereby eliminating the effect of interference. To exemplify the potential of GSD-ST, we propose a new radio access scheme, namely non-orthogonal interference-free radio access (No-INFRA). Herein, GSD-ST enables the collision-free reception of uncoordinated access requests. Numerical results show that No-INFRA effectively resolves the colliding access requests when the interference is dominant.}

	abstract = {Intra-body communication (IBC) plays a significant role in future health care systems. This article proposes a pulse-based ultrasonic index modulation (UsIM) to enable high data rate and low power IBCs. Two grouping-based UsIM strategies, namely ultrasonic grouped-chip indexed modulation (UsCIM) and ultrasonic chip-group indexed modulation (UsGIM), are proposed to implement multiple access for intra-body networks (IBNs). UsCIM uses the chip indices in a group to convey additional information bits for a biosensor node, while UsGIM uses the group indices and each node occupies one chip in a group. Three receivers, including the maximum likelihood (ML), the maximum ratio combination (MRC), and the energy detection (ED) receivers, are then proposed and studied. The theoretical bit-error rate (BER) upper bound for the ML receiver, and theoretical BER expressions for the MRC and ED receivers are derived. The system performance metrics in terms of complexity, throughput and energy efficiency are analyzed. The analytical and simulation results reveal that UsGIM achieves a lower BER than UsCIM under channel fading and multipath effect. Both UsCIM and UsGIM achieve higher throughput and energy efficiency than the existing IBC systems, and both strategies are important for energy-constrained implanted IBNs.}

	abstract = {Designing multidimensional constellations (MdCs) is an integral part of sparse code multiple access (SCMA). Since the optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver for SCMA is too complex in most applications, one highly popular technique is the near-optimal message passing algorithm (MPA), where its performance improves with increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of iterations. When the number of MPA iterations has to be limited (e.g., low-latency and/or low-complexity and/or energy-sensitive applications), the performance gap between MAP and MPA becomes significant, especially at low-to-medium SNRs. Inspired by the promising features of hypercubes when used along with bit-interleaved coded modulation, we construct novel MdCs which are based on a unitary rotation of a hypercube by a rotation angle that aims to achieve the minimum frame-error-rate (FER). By exploiting special properties of hypercubes, we fit a second-order rational polynomial to a few measured FER samples, and find a close-to-optimal rotation angle at each SNR and MPA iteration. Our proposed MdCs provide substantial performance gains (as much as 2 dB) in comparison to the best known SCMA MdCs in the literature, especially in low-to-medium SNR regions when the number of MPA iterations has to be low, and in the presence of 5G-compliant LDPC codes.}

	abstract = {We abstract the core logical functions from applications that require ultra-low-latency wireless communications to provide a novel definition for reliability. Real-time applications - such as intelligent transportation, remote surgery, and industrial automation - involve a significant element of control and decision making. Such systems involve three logical components: observers (e.g. sensors) measuring the state of an environment or dynamical system, a centralized executive (e.g. controller) deciding on the state, and agents (e.g. actuators) that implement the executive's decisions. The executive harvests the observers' measurements and decides on the short-term trajectory of the system by instructing its agents to take appropriate actions. All observation packets (typically uplink) and action packets (typically downlink) must be delivered by hard deadlines to ensure the proper functioning of the controlled system. In-full on-time delivery cannot be guaranteed in wireless systems due to inherent uncertainties in the channel such as fading and unpredictable interference; accordingly, the executive will have to drop some packets. We develop a novel framework to formulate the Observer Selection Problem (OSP) through which the executive schedules a sequence of observations that maximize its knowledge about the current state of the system. To solve this problem efficiently yet optimally, we devise a branch-and-bound algorithm that systematically prunes the search space. Our work is different from existing work on real-time communications in that communication reliability is not conveyed by packet loss or error rate, but rather by the extent of the executive's knowledge about the state of the system it controls.}

	abstract = {Effective interference management in the multiuser interference channel strongly hinges on the channel state information's availability at the transmitters (CSIT). In a broad range of emerging large-scale and distributed networks (e.g., the Internet of Things), acquiring the CSIT is prohibitive due to the extensive information exchange that it imposes. As a result, the interference management approaches that rely on the CSIT lose their effectiveness in such circumstances. This article focuses on the two-user interference channel and proposes a broadcast approach to interference management. Its hallmark is that the transmitters, unlike the receivers, are entirely oblivious to instantaneous channel states. Each transmitter splits its message into multiple superimposed encoded information layers, where each layer is adapted to a given possible state for the combined states of all channels. Depending on the relative gain between the direct and interfering channels, each receiver opportunistically decodes a subset of both transmitters' received layers. An average achievable rate region is delineated, serving as an inner bound on the Gaussian interference channel's average capacity region in the absence of CSIT. Finally, an upper bound on the gap between the achievable sum-rate and the sum-rate capacity is established.}

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a communication-efficient decentralized machine learning (ML) algorithm, coined quantized group ADMM (Q-GADMM). To reduce the number of communication links, every worker in Q-GADMM communicates only with two neighbors, while updating its model via the group alternating direction method of multipliers (GADMM). Moreover, each worker transmits the quantized difference between its current model and its previously quantized model, thereby decreasing the communication payload size. However, due to the lack of centralized entity in decentralized ML, the spatial sparsity and payload compression may incur error propagation, hindering model training convergence. To overcome this, we develop a novel stochastic quantization method to adaptively adjust model quantization levels and their probabilities, while proving the convergence of Q-GADMM for convex objective functions. Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibility of Q-GADMM for non-convex and stochastic problems, we propose quantized stochastic GADMM (Q-SGADMM) that incorporates deep neural network architectures and stochastic sampling. Simulation results corroborate that Q-GADMM significantly outperforms GADMM in terms of communication efficiency while achieving the same accuracy and convergence speed for a linear regression task. Similarly, for an image classification task using DNN, Q-SGADMM achieves significantly less total communication cost with identical accuracy and convergence speed compared to its counterpart without quantization, i.e., stochastic GADMM (SGADMM).}

By exploiting the sparsity of beamspace channels, the beamspace channel estimation can be formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem, which can be solved by the classical iterative algorithm named approximate message passing (AMP), and its corresponding version learned AMP (LAMP) realized by a deep neural network (DNN). However, these existing schemes cannot achieve satisfactory estimation accuracy. To improve the channel estimation performance, we propose a prior-aided Gaussian mixture LAMP (GM-LAMP) based beamspace channel estimation scheme in this paper. Specifically, based on the prior information that beamspace channel elements can be modeled by the Gaussian mixture distribution, we first derive a new shrinkage function to refine the AMP algorithm. Then, by replacing the original shrinkage function in the LAMP network with the derived Gaussian mixture shrinkage function, a prior-aided GM-LAMP network is developed to estimate the beamspace channel more accurately. Simulation results by using both the theoretical channel model and the ray-tracing based channel dataset show that, the proposed GM-LAMP network can achieve better channel estimation accuracy than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission of URLLC packets requiring very low latency and ultra-reliability. Because of the low latency constraint, the Base Station may not have enough time to acquire the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) of the corresponding device and has then to transmit urgent packets immediately in the absence of CSI. To enhance reliability, we explore frequency diversity where a packet can be simultaneously sent over multiple channels. Using a Markov Decision Process framework, we address the problem of dynamic channel allocation to the URLLC devices in absence of instantaneous CSI. More precisely, we define a multi-agent MDP wherein the state of each device is the packet loss rate experienced in the previous time slots and the decision variable is how to split the available orthogonal channels across the devices. We design a new low-complexity algorithm which avoids the exhaustive enumeration of all possible resource allocations and enables significant computational savings compared to the Value Iteration algorithm. We investigate the gap between our proposed low complexity algorithm and the Value Iteration policy. We provide numerical performance results and show that our algorithm can achieve more than 80% of the optimal reward with substantial computational complexity reduction.}

	abstract = {Although the use of coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can extend the coverage, its duplicated transmission reduces the spectrum efficiency (SE) of NOMA. To improve the SE, we propose a spectrum-efficient scheme for NOMA-based CDRT over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels. In this scheme, the base station (BS) connects with a cell-center user (CCU) directly while communicating with a cell-edge user (CEU) via a relay and the CCU. Then, the relay and the CCU use network coding to process and retransmit the signals sent by the BS first and the CEU later. Finally, the BS and the relay simultaneously broadcast downlink signals. We derive the closed-form expressions for the average SE, the user fairness index and the energy efficiency (EE) as well as the asymptotic average SE using both perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Simulations verify the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed scheme in SE and EE.}

Three cases are studied, which we refer to as Estimate & Quantize, Quantize & Estimate, and Decentralized, according to where channel estimation is performed and exploited. Maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers are considered.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relaying networks are designed, where a UAV is deployed to assist multiple pairs of users in their information exchange. There are two basic approaches for the user pairs' information exchange within a single time slot via the UAV relay. The first approach is based on full-duplex, where all participants operate in the full-duplex mode to transmit and receive signals simultaneously. However, all transceivers have to operate in the face of severe self-interference, which cannot be completely suppressed. The second approach is based on conventional half-duplex, where the users send their information to the UAV within a certain fraction of the time slot, and the UAV relays them within the remaining fraction to avoid the self-interference. In either approach, the joint bandwidth and power allocation maximizing the sum information exchange throughput under realistic resource and user throughput constraints poses a complex nonconvex problem. New inner approximations are proposed for developing path-following algorithms for their computation. Our numerical results show that the time-fraction-based half-duplex approach clearly outperforms the high-complexity full-duplex approach.}

	abstract = {Filter bank multiple access (FBMA) without subbands orthogonality has been proposed as a new candidate waveform to better meet the requirements of future wireless communication systems and scenarios. It has the ability to process directly the complex symbols without any fancy preprocessing. Along with the usage of cyclic prefix (CP) and wide-banded subband design, CP-FBMA can further improve the peak-to-average power ratio and bit error rate performance while reducing the length of filters. However, the potential gain of removing the orthogonality constraint on the subband filters in the system has not been fully exploited from the perspective of waveform design, which inspires us to optimize the subband filters for CP-FBMA system to maximizing the achievable rate. Besides, we propose a joint optimization algorithm to optimize both the waveform and the covariance matrices iteratively. Furthermore, the joint optimization algorithm can meet the requirements of filter design in practical applications in which the available spectrum consists of several isolated bandwidth parts. Both general framework and detailed derivation of the algorithms are presented. Simulation results show that the algorithms converge after only a few iterations and can improve the sum rate dramatically while reducing the transmission delay of information symbols.}

In code-domain NOMA, non-orthogonal spreading sequences are uniquely assigned to all devices, where active ones attempt a grant-free access to a system. In this paper, we study a set of user-specific, non-orthogonal, binary spreading sequences for uplink grant-free NOMA. Based on binary Golay complementary sequences, each spreading sequence provides the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of at most 3 dB for multicarrier transmission. Exploiting the theoretical connection to Reed-Muller codes, we conduct a probabilistic analysis to search for a permutation set for Golay sequences, which presents theoretically bounded low coherence for the spreading matrix. Simulation results confirm that the maximum PAPR of transmitted multicarrier signals via the spreading sequences is significantly lower than those for random bipolar, Gaussian, and pseudo-random sequences. Thanks to the low coherence, the performance of compressed sensing (CS) based joint channel estimation and multiuser detection using the spreading sequences turns out to be superior or similar to those for random bipolar, Gaussian, pseudo-random, and Zadoff-Chu sequences. The binary Golay spreading sequences have only two phases regardless of the sequence length, which can make them suitable for low cost MTC devices.}

We consider two distinct cases: first, when the number of served users is not larger than the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS), we mathematically derive the optimal precoding structure based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. By formulating the dual problem, the precoding problem is transformed into a pre-scaling operation using quadratic programming (QP) optimization. We further consider the case where the number of served users is larger than the number of transmit antennas at the BS. By employing the pseudo inverse, we show that the optimal solution of the pre-scaling vector is equivalent to a linear combination of the right singular vectors corresponding to zero singular values, and derive the equivalent QP formulation. We also present the condition under which multiplexing more streams than the number of transmit antennas is achievable. For both considered scenarios, we propose a modified iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal precoding matrix, as well as a sub-optimal closed-form precoder. Numerical results validate our derivations on the optimal precoding structures for multi-level modulations, and demonstrate the superiority of interference-exploitation precoding for both scenarios.}

Our framework considers three different transmission modes: (i) UAV-only mode, (ii) IRS-only mode, and (iii) integrated UAV-IRS mode to achieve spectral and energy-efficient relaying. For the proposed modes, we provide exact and approximate expressions for the end-to-end outage probability, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency (EE) in closed-form. We use the derived expressions to optimize key system parameters such as the UAV altitude and the number of elements on the IRS considering different modes. We formulate the problems in the form of fractional programming (e.g. single ratio, sum of multiple ratios or maximization-minimization of ratios) and devise optimal algorithms using quadratic transformations. Furthermore, we derive an analytic criterion to optimally select different transmission modes to maximize ergodic capacity and EE for a given number of IRS elements. Numerical results validate the derived expressions. The solutions obtained from the proposed optimization algorithms are compared with those obtained through exhaustive search. Insights are drawn related to the different communication modes, optimal number of IRS elements, and optimal UAV height.}

By combining stochastic geometry with queueing theory, two fundamental measures are analyzed, namely the transmission success probability and the meta distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Different from the conventional approaches that assume independent active states across the nodes and use homogeneous point processes to model the locations of interferers, our analysis accounts for the interdependency amongst active states of the transmitters in space and arrives at a non-homogeneous point process for the modeling of interferers’ positions, which leads to a more accurate characterization of the SINR. The accuracy of the theoretical results is verified by simulations, and the developed framework is then used to devise design guidelines for the deployment strategies of wireless networks.}

However, the BS cooperation regions formed by applying CoMP in the UDN are small and irregular, which causes frequent handover for mobile users. Different from most existing work that focus on the trigger time of handover, we explore how to choose the appropriate BS cooperation set to reduce handover rate. In this paper, we consider movement aware CoMP handover (MACH). By estimating cell dwell time, a user would be intelligently assigned to macro cell or small cell according to its movement trend. To enhance reliability, we further proposed improved MACH (iMACH) to achieve a trade-off between BSs with long dwell time and the current best performed BS for multipoint cooperation while user moving. Using stochastic geometry method, expressions of coverage probability, handover probability and throughput that characterize performance of the proposed schemes are derived. The numerical results indicate that the theoretical analyses fit the simulation results well and the proposed schemes surpass the existing schemes in terms of the aforementioned metrics, and more intelligent and suitable for ultra-dense scenarios.}

	abstract = {By moving computing resources close to where they are needed (i.e., the network edges), edge computing can significantly reduce burden on the centric cloud data centers. However, extreme scale of on-line big data may impose a significant burden on the network backbones. Information-centric edge networking can address this challenge by incorporating in-network caching into edge networks. This however, opens a door for many new security issues and requires various security defenses. One of those is efficient access control design specifically for information-centric edge networking. In this work, we aim to design an efficient and secure access control scheme for information-centric edge networking. In our design, we propose the confidentiality-enhanced network coding which can ensure that, without having access to the authorization key, the attacker will not be able to obtain the original content. And thanks to the properties of confidentiality-enhanced network coding, highly efficient access control can be realized by encrypting only part of the encoding matrix. In addition, our design can allow efficiently revoking users. Security analysis and experimental evaluation on NS3 demonstrate that our scheme can successfully enforce access control in information-centric edge networking with a small overhead.}

	abstract = {Age of Information (AoI) has proven to be a useful metric in networked systems where timely information updates are of importance. In the literature, minimizing “average age” has received considerable attention. However, various applications pose stricter age requirements on the updates which demand knowledge of the AoI distribution. Furthermore, the analysis of AoI distribution in a multi-hop setting, which is important for the study of Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCS), has not been addressed before. Toward this end, we study the distribution of AoI in a WNCS with two hops and devise a problem of minimizing the tail of the AoI distribution with respect to the frequency of generating information updates, i.e., the sampling rate of monitoring a process, under first-come-first-serve (FCFS) queuing discipline. We argue that computing an exact expression for the AoI distribution may not always be feasible; therefore, we opt for computing upper bounds on the tail of the AoI distribution. Using these upper bounds, we formulate Upper Bound Minimization Problems (UBMP), namely, Chernoff-UBMP and α-relaxed Upper Bound Minimization Problem (α-UBMP), where α > 1 is an approximation factor, and solve them to obtain “good” heuristic rate solutions for minimizing the tail. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by solving the proposed UBMPs for three service distributions: geometric, exponential, and Erlang. Simulation results show that the rate solutions obtained are near optimal for minimizing the tail of the AoI distribution for the considered distributions.}

In this article, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled fog-cloud structure in a novel density-aware fog-based radio access networks (F-RAN) to tackle different aspects of high and low-density regions, in order to meet the heterogeneous requirements of eMBB and URLLC traffic. A framework of two different problem formulations is considered to cater the high throughput and low-latency requirements in a high and low-density mode respectively. In the first problem, we study the joint caching placement and association strategy aiming at minimizing the average delay. To deal with the first problem, we apply McCormick envelopes and Lagrange partial relaxation method to transform it into three convex sub-problems, which is then solved by proposing a distributed algorithm. The second problem is to jointly optimize transmission mode selection, subchannel assignment and power allocation to maximize the sum data rate of all fog user equipments (F-UEs) while satisfying fronthaul capacity and fog-computing access point (F-AP) power constraints. Moreover, for given transmission mode selection and subchannel assignment, the optimal power allocation is derived in a closed-form expression. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed NOMA-enabled F-RAN framework and reveal that the ultra-low latency and high throughput can be achieved by properly utilizing the available resources.}

	abstract = {A connected dominating set (CDS) can act as a virtual backbone (VB) in a wireless sensor network (WSN). The overhead in a WSN is usually determined by the size of the corresponding VB. However, the construction of minimum CDSs (MCDSs) has been proven to be an NP-hard problem. Thus, most researchers use approximation algorithms to find smaller CDSs. In certain applications, the transmission radii of some nodes in the network are unstable due to certain environmental factors such as obstacles, signal interference and node movement. Thus, the robustness of VBs in WSNs should be considered. In this paper, we propose the concept of a d-robust CDS and corresponding algorithms to construct d-robust CDSs in WSNs with unstable transmission ranges. We propose algorithms for a d-robust CDS that is bounded by [40.68/(1 - d) 2 + 10.17] · opt + [31.32/(1 - d) 2 + 7.83], where opt is the size of the MCDS and d ∈ [0, 1). Through simulations, we show the relationship between the size of the d-robust CDS and the value of d and compare our algorithms with existing algorithms in terms of the robustness degree of the CDS. The results show that the CDSs produced by our algorithms exhibit better robustness.}

Acquisition subsystems are needed in order to search and locate the receiver terminal in an uncertainty/search region with very narrow laser beams. In this paper, we have proposed and analyzed two adaptive search schemes for acquisition systems that perform better-for the low probability of detection-than the spiral scanning approach. The first of these schemes, the adaptive spiral search, provides a better acquisition time performance by dividing the search region into a number of smaller subregions, and prioritizing search in regions of higher probability mass. The second technique-the shotgun approach-searches the region in a random manner by sampling the search region according to a Gaussian distribution. The adaptive spiral scheme outperforms the shotgun approach in terms of acquisition time, especially if the number of search subregions is large enough. However, a higher pointing accuracy is required by the adaptive spiral search in order to search the region precisely. On the other hand, the shotgun scanning approach does not require such stringent pointing accuracy.}

To be more realistic, we consider a generalized pointing error scenario, where the azimuth and elevation pointing error angles caused by stochastic jitters and vibrations in the legitimate receiver platform are independently distributed according to a non-identical normal distribution. Taking these assumptions into account, we derive approximate expressions of transmission probabilities by using the Gaussian quadrature method. To simplify the expressions and get some physical insights, some asymptotic analysis on the transmission probabilities is presented based on asymptotic expression for the generalized Marcum Q-function when the telescope gain at the legitimate receiver approaches to infinity. Moreover, from the asymptotic expression for the generalized Marcum Q-function, the asymptotic outage probability over Beckmann fading channels (a general channel model including Rayleigh, Rice, and Hoyt fading channels) can be also easily derived when the average signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large, which shows the diversity order and array gain.}

Besides cryptography, information-theoretic security gained increasing attention over the recent years. Among others, it deals with the problem of secure data transmission on the physical layer to a legitimate receiver (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). In this work, we investigate upper and lower bounds on the secrecy outage probability for slowly-fading wiretap channels with an arbitrary dependency structure between the fading channels to Bob and Eve. Both cases of absence of channel-state information at the transmitter (CSI-T) and availability of CSI-T of only the main channel to the legitimate receiver are considered. Furthermore, we derive explicit expressions for the upper and lower bounds for Rayleigh fading and compare them to the case of independent channels. The joint distribution of the legitimate and eavesdropper channels has a tremendous impact on the achievable secrecy outage probability. The bounds enable developing guaranteed secrecy schemes by only measuring the marginal channel distributions.}

We define four different attack scenarios and compare their impact on the massive MIMO system as well as on a conventional single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) system. More specifically, the jammers attack the base station (BS) during both the uplink training phase and data phase. The BS uses either least squares (LS) or linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimators for channel estimation and utilizes either maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) or zero-forcing (ZF) decoding vectors. We show that ZF gives higher SE than MRC but, interestingly, the performance is unaffected by the choice of the estimators. The simulation results show that the performance loss percentage of massive MIMO is less than that of the SIMO system. Moreover, we consider two types of power control algorithms: jamming-aware and jamming-ignorant. In both cases, we consider the max-min and proportional fairness criteria to increase the uplink SE of massive MIMO systems. We notice numerically that max-min fairness is not a good option because if one user is strongly affected by the jamming, it will degrade the other users' SE as well. On the other hand, proportional fairness improves the sum SE of the system compared with the full power transmission scenario.}

In this model, a discrete memoryless source (DMS) is encoded into n encoded messages. To measure the secrecy of the system, we introduce a security level for each subset of encoded messages. In the paper, we focus on the n-channel symmetric multilevel imperfect secret sharing (SMISS) problem, i.e., the security levels of all the subsets with the same cardinality are identical. First, we explicitly characterize the coding rate regions for 2-channel and 3-channel SMISS problems. However, it is difficult to characterize the explicit rate region for a general n, since the complexity of designing optimal coding schemes can grow with n exponentially. Nevertheless, we put forward an inner bound and an outer bound on the rate region of the general n-channel SMISS problem. Moreover, we consider two special cases, i.e., the Two-SMISS problem and the linear SMISS problem, and prove that the inner and outer bounds are tight for these two problems, respectively.}

Practical transmitter designs are exploited under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and hardware constraints, such as finite-resolution phase shifters (PSs) and per-antenna power budget. Tailored for the practical issues in realizing DM, a series of practical scenarios are investigated. Starting from the scenario where eavesdroppers (Eve)s' information is completely unknown, corresponding designs are proposed to optimize legitimate users (LU)s' receiving performance while randomizing the Eves' received signal. When the Eves' CSI is imperfectly known, in the second scenario, the Eves' receiving performance is further deteriorated by imposing destructive interference to the Eves. For each scenario, three algorithms are proposed under hardware constraints and imperfect CSI, i.e., one direct-mapping algorithm suitable for high/moderate number of bits in PSs, one heuristic algorithm with improved receiving performance at the cost of complexity, and one iterative-closed-form algorithm with enhanced practicality of symbol-level based DM. Simulation demonstrates that the algorithms achieve lower symbol error rate (SER) at the LUs while significantly deteriorating the Eves' SER, leading to an improved secrecy throughput over the benchmarks.}

Explicitly, in the proposed algorithm, each node interacts with only part of its neighboring nodes, the number of which is progressively determined according to a heuristic searching procedure, which takes into account both the predicted convergence rate and the communication and computation costs at each iteration, resulting in a trade-off between communication and computation. Then the node chooses its neighboring nodes according to an importance sampling distribution derived theoretically to minimize the variance with the latest information it locally stores. Finally, the node updates its local information with a new update rule which adapts to the number of communication nodes. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and provide an upper bound of the convergence variance brought by randomness. Extensive simulations validate the excellent performances of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence rate and variance, the overall communication and computation cost, the impact of network topology as well as the time for evaluation, in comparison with the traditional counterparts.}

Previous channel predictors are based on theoretical channel models, which would be deviated from realistic channels. In this paper, we develop and compare a vector Kalman filter (VKF)-based channel predictor and a machine learning (ML)-based channel predictor using the realistic channels from the spatial channel model (SCM), which has been adopted in the 3GPP standard for years. First, we propose a low-complexity mobility estimator based on the spatial average using a large number of antennas in massive MIMO. The mobility estimate can be used to determine the complexity order of developed predictors. The VKF-based channel predictor developed in this paper exploits the autoregressive (AR) parameters estimated from the SCM channels based on the Yule-Walker equations. Then, the ML-based channel predictor using the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based noise pre-processed data is developed. Numerical results reveal that both channel predictors have substantial gain over the outdated channel in terms of the channel prediction accuracy and data rate. The ML-based predictor has larger overall computational complexity than the VKF-based predictor, but once trained, the operational complexity of ML-based predictor becomes smaller than that of VKF-based predictor.}

Therefore, the requirement is to serve multiple users over a single beam. Considering a single-cell scenario with a fixed number of users, this paper addresses the problem of selection of optimal beamwidth depending on user density and distribution. First, by considering fixed beam service time in each sector, optimal beamwidth is estimated using exhaustive search for average long-run user rate and base station energy efficiency maximization. Based on the results of the average long-run user rate maximization using an exhaustive search, another method of reduced complexity is proposed to find sub-optimal beamwidth. Subsequently, optimum beamwidth is estimated with user density dependent variable time scheduling in a sector, that offers improved performances over fixed time scheduling. An efficient algorithm on variable time scheduling is also provided. Finally, the effect of localization error on optimal beamwidth estimation is investigated. The numerical results show that using the narrowest beam does not necessarily result in achieving a better average long-run user rate. Further, localization error does not affect the selection of optimal beamwidth, however, user Quality-of-Service degrades.}

Hovering inaccuracy of UAV comprises of two types of mismatches: Localization mismatch (LM) and Orientation mismatch (OM). Thus, a total of four combinations arise. Their impact on received power at ground deployed sensor node is characterized. For this purpose, a generalized radiation pattern of UAV-mounted transmitter antenna is considered. A closed-form expression of received power at the sensor node is obtained for each of these four cases. An optimization problem is formulated with the objective of optimizing the system parameters, such as transmit power, hovering altitude, and antenna exponent. This problem contains mixed nature of variables, i.e., continuous as well as discrete. To solve this problem, an algorithm, called Hovering Inaccuracy-aware Optimal Charging System Design (HI-OCSD), is proposed to find the optimal system parameters. Through system simulations it is demonstrated that, hovering inaccuracy has notable impact on the performance, as received power at the sensor node reduces significantly in presence of hovering inaccuracy compared to ideal scenario. The effect of LM is more severe than that of OM. Further, a scenario with different level of hovering inaccuracy accounting for different deployment scenarios is considered, and the optimal system parameters are also evaluated. This study reveals that, UAV needs to hover at a relatively higher altitude to overcome the severity of hovering inaccuracy.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely applied in internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios while the security for UAV communications remains a challenging problem due to the broadcast nature of the line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels. This article investigates the security problems for dual UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where one UAV is invoked to help the ground terminal devices (TDs) to compute the offloaded tasks and the other one acts as a jammer to suppress the vicious eavesdroppers. In our framework, minimum secure computing capacity maximization problems are proposed for both the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme by jointly optimizing the communication resources, computation resources, and UAVs' trajectories. The formulated problems are non-trivial and challenging to be solved due to the highly coupled variables. To tackle these problems, we first transform them into more tractable ones then a block coordinate descent based algorithm and a penalized block coordinate descent based algorithm are proposed to solve the problems for TDMA and NOMA schemes, respectively. Finally, numerical results show that the security computing capacity performance of the systems is enhanced by the proposed algorithms as compared with the benchmarks. Meanwhile, the NOMA scheme is superior to the TDMA scheme for security improvement.}

	abstract = {This article investigates the problem of resource allocation for multiuser communication networks with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless transmitter. In this network, the sum transmit power of the network is minimized by controlling the phase beamforming of the RIS and transmit power of the base station. This problem is posed as a joint optimization problem of transmit power and RIS control, whose goal is to minimize the sum transmit power under signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints of the users. To solve this problem, a dual method is proposed, where the dual problem is obtained as a semidefinite programming problem. After solving the dual problem, the phase beamforming of the RIS is obtained in the closed form, while the optimal transmit power is obtained by using the standard interference function. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce up to 94% and 27% sum transmit power compared to the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming techniques, respectively.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the non-coherent detection in ambient backscatter communication, which is highly appealing for systems where the trade-off between signaling overhead and the actual data transmission is very critical. Modeling the time-selective fading channel as a first-order autoregressive (AR) process, we propose a new receiver architecture based on the direct averaging of the received signal samples for detection, which departs significantly from the energy averaging-based receivers considered in the literature. For the proposed setup, we characterize the exact asymptotic bit error rate (BER) for both single-antenna (SA) and multi-antenna (MA) receivers, and demonstrate the robustness of the new architecture to timing errors. Our results demonstrate that while the direct-link (DL) interference from the ambient power source leads to a BER floor in the SA receiver, the MA receiver can remove this interference by estimating the angle of arrival (AoA) of the DL. The analysis further quantifies the effect of improved angular resolution on the BER as a function of the number of receive antennas. A key intermediate result of our analysis is the derivation of a new concentration result for a general sum sequence that is central to the derivation of the conditional distributions of the received signal.}

We propose time-switching (TS) and power-splitting (PS) schemes for the IRS, where the IRS can harvest energy from the HAP's signals by switching between energy harvesting and signal reflection in the TS scheme or adjusting its reflection amplitude in the PS scheme. For both the TS and PS schemes, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problems by jointly optimizing the IRS's phase shifts for both ET and IT and network resource allocation. To address each problem's non-convexity, we propose a two-step algorithm to obtain the near-optimal solution with high accuracy. To show the structure of resource allocation, we also investigate the optimal solutions for the schemes with random phase shifts. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed schemes can achieve significant system sum-rate gain compared to the baseline scheme without IRS.}

	abstract = {The multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) beamforming training (BFT) enables an access point (AP) and multiple stations (STAs) to determine appropriate directional antenna patterns; to this end, the AP transmits multiple action frames to the STAs during the MU-MIMO BFT. However, if the antenna weight vectors (AWVs) are determined to transmit the action frames inefficiently, this could lead to unnecessary transmissions, which could increase the BFT time. To mitigate the signaling overhead, the schemes used in our previous work employed AWVs, which use multiple beams simultaneously to transmit the action frames. Nevertheless, these existing schemes are still adversely affected by redundant transmissions because these schemes overlook the transmit diversity gain obtained from multi-beam concurrent transmission. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel transmit antenna configuration scheme that mitigates the signaling overhead by considering the transmit diversity of the inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel incurred when multiple beams are used simultaneously. Our proposed scheme determines each candidate antenna weight vector (AWV) using multiple beams and efficiently identifies the STAs within reach of the corresponding multi-beam concurrent transmission. The numerical and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme shortens the BFT time in comparison with existing schemes.}

In this paper, we propose a Markov Chain model to represent CBAPs, taking into account operation interruptions due to scheduled SPs and the deafness and hidden node problems that directional communication exacerbates. We also propose a mathematical analysis to evaluate the interference among stations and derive analytical expressions to assess the impact of various system parameters on some key performance metrics such as throughput, delay, and packet drop rate.

In the network, RISs assist the communication from the base station (BS) to all users by passive beamforming. Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming matrices at the BS and the reflection coefficient vector at the RISs. Because of the constraints on the RIS reflection amplitudes and phase shifts, the formulated quadratically constrained quadratic problem is highly non-convex. For the aforementioned problem, the conventional semidefinite programming (SDP) based algorithm has prohibitively high computational complexity and deteriorating performance. Here, we propose an effective second-order cone programming (SOCP)-alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm to obtain the locally optimal solution. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a low-complexity zero-forcing based suboptimal algorithm. It is shown through simulation results that our proposed SOCP-ADMM based algorithm achieves significant performance gain over the conventional SDP based algorithm. Furthermore, when the target transmission rates of central and cell-edge users are 0.5 bps/Hz, our proposed NOMA RIS-aided system with 32 RIS elements has about 2.5 dB performance gain over the conventional massive multiple-input-multiple-output system with 64 transmit antennas.}

Meanwhile, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), also known as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), has been recently proposed as a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency (EE) of wireless communication systems through intelligently reconfiguring the channel environment. To improve both SE and EE, in this paper, we introduce multiple IRSs to a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) CR system, in which a single SU coexists with a primary network with multiple PU receivers (PU-RXs). Our design objective is to maximize the achievable rate of SU subject to a total transmit power constraint on the SU transmitter (SU-TX) and interference temperature constraints on the PU-RXs, by jointly optimizing the beamforming at SU-TX and the reflecting coefficients at each IRS. Both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) cases are considered in the optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that IRS can significantly improve the achievable rate of SU under both perfect and imperfect CSI cases.}

Now FC actually has two versions, one is Fletcher's original paper version termed as FC and the other is RFC1146 version termed as FC-RFC. This paper shows that the FC is a cyclic code. This is done by introducing a cyclic code known as the cyclic Fletcher code (CFC) and then showing that the CFC is equivalent to the FC. The clear algebraic structure of cyclic codes is used to analyze the code block length and code distance, and then the single error correction, double error detection, and burst error detection of the CFC are analyzed. Also given is the mathematical relationship between the CFC and a modified FC. Finally, the issue of implementation is considered, and a new scheduling for the CFC is proposed to prevent data hazards. A simulation shows that the proposed scheduling offers improvements of at least 46% in throughput for the CFC and FC-RFC.}

For this cache-aided network, we propose the linear network coded (NC) wireless caching that consists of linear wireless network coding assisted cache placement phase and signal-space alignment (SSA) enabled content delivery phase. In the cache placement phase, we design a joint NC caching function at the BSs to store linear combinations of messages from the central unit, as a form of linear wireless network coding. In the content delivery phase, we design the SSA pattern based on the NC caching to guide the precoding designs at BSs. Then, each user can reliably decode its requested messages by receiver shaping and reverse NC operation. The primary contribution of this work is to achieve the coding gain induced by the integration of linear wireless network coding and SSA, which has been not exploited in the field of wireless coded caching. In particular, to deal with high temporal variability of user requests, we show that the proposed cache placement is invariant to different user requests in the worst-case caching, without any shared caching messages at different BSs. Furthermore, we verify that the proposed scheme is also compatible with the insufficient caching scenario at the BSs. In addition, we analyze the achievable sum degrees of freedom (DoF) for the proposed caching network. Both analytical and numerical results verify that the proposed caching scheme achieves a higher sum DoF than the existing related works.}

The proposed MLC scheme is based on a rate flexible inner soft-decision polar code and utilizes an outer hard-decision staircase code structure as in the 400ZR concatenated forward error-correcting code. The performance of the MLC scheme is investigated for a range of inner code lengths, inner decoder list sizes, and signaling with 16 and 64 quadrature amplitude modulation, respectively. The MLC is designed such that a portion of the staircase encoded bits can bypass the inner code. The number of required inner soft-decision decoders can thus be reduced, thereby saving computational complexity. The proposed MLC scheme simultaneously offers up to a 53.7% reduction in the number of inner decoders and up to 0.55 dB of performance improvement when compared with the similar BICM approach.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate optimal downlink power allocation in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks with distributed antenna arrays (DAAs) under correlated and uncorrelated channel fading. In DAA massive MIMO, a base station (BS) consists of multiple antenna sub-arrays. Notably, the antenna sub-arrays are deployed in arbitrary locations within a DAA massive MIMO cell. Consequently, the distance-dependent large-scale propagation coefficients are different from a user to these different antenna sub-arrays, which makes power control a challenging problem. We assume that the network operates in time-division duplex mode, where each BS obtains the channel estimates via uplink pilots. Based on the channel estimates, the BSs perform maximum-ratio transmission in the downlink. We then derive a closed-form signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression, where the channels are subject to correlated fading. Based on the SINR expression, we propose a network-wide max-min power control algorithm to ensure that each user in the network receives a uniform quality of service. Numerical results demonstrate the performance advantages offered by DAA massive MIMO. For some specific scenarios, DAA massive MIMO can improve the average per-user throughput up to 55%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that channel fading covariance is an important factor in determining the performance of DAA massive MIMO.}

	abstract = {A basic property of any diffusion-based molecular communication system is the geometry of the enclosing container. In particular, the geometry influences the system's behavior near the boundary and in all existing modulation schemes governs receiver design. However, it is not always straightforward to characterize the geometry of the system. This is particularly the case when the molecular communication system operates in scenarios where the geometry may be complex or dynamic. In this article, we propose a new scheme-called equilibrium signaling-which is robust to uncertainties in the geometry of the fluid boundary. In particular, receiver design only depends on the relative volumes of the transmitter or receiver, and the entire container. Our scheme relies on reversible reactions in the transmitter and the receiver, which ensure the existence of an equilibrium state into which information is encoded. In this case, we derive near optimal detection rules and develop a simple and effective estimation method to obtain the container volume. We also show that equilibrium signaling can outperform classical modulation schemes, such as concentration shift keying, under practical sampling constraints imposed by biological oscillators.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel multipath multi-hop adaptive and causal random linear network coding (AC-RLNC) algorithm with forward error correction. This algorithm generalizes our joint optimization coding solution for point-to-point communication with delayed feedback. AC-RLNC is adaptive to the estimated channel condition, and is causal, as the coding adjusts the retransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. In the multipath network, to achieve the desired throughput and delay, we propose to incorporate an adaptive packet allocation algorithm for retransmission, across the available resources of the paths. This approach is based on a discrete water filling algorithm, i.e., bit-filling, but, with two desired objectives, maximize throughput and minimize the delay. In the multipath multi-hop setting, we propose a new decentralized balancing optimization algorithm. This balancing algorithm minimizes the throughput degradation, caused by the variations in the channel quality of the paths at each hop. Furthermore, to increase the efficiency, in terms of the desired objectives, we propose a new selective recoding method at the intermediate nodes. We derive bounds on the throughput and the mean and maximum in-order delivery delay of AC-RLNC, both in the multipath and multipath multi-hop case. In the multipath case, we prove that in the non-asymptotic regime, the suggested code may achieve more than 90% of the channel capacity with zero error probability under mean and maximum in-order delay constraints, namely a mean delay smaller than three times the optimal genie-aided one and a maximum delay within eight times the optimum. In the multipath multi-hop case, the balancing procedure is proven to be optimal with regards to the achieved rate. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the performance of our adaptive and causal approach, compared to selective repeat (SR)-ARQ protocol, is capable of gains up to a factor two in throughput and a factor of more than three in mean delay and eight in maximum delay. The improvements on the throughput delay trade-off are also shown to be significant with regards to the previously developed singlepath AC-RLNC solution.}

	abstract = {In this study, we consider a space-time line code (STLC) system with N transmit antennas and two receive antennas. Although the STLC system is scalable to an arbitrary number of transmit antennas, a large number of them will increase the hardware cost and complicate the implementation of the system. To resolve this practical limitation, we propose a transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme for the N-by-2 STLC system. If S ≤ N antennas are used for the transmission, the STLC transmitter selects the S antennas such that the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is maximized. For a comprehensive performance analysis, the instantaneous SNR of the proposed TAS is characterized in terms of the statistical mean and moment-generating function (MGF). To investigate the performance of the proposed TAS approach, the approximated expression of error rate is derived based on the MGF method. Moreover, using asymptotic analysis, we show that the proposed TAS-STLC system achieves full spatial diversity of 2N, while the coding gain is affected by N, S, and the modulation order. As a special case, we also provide a mathematical analysis of the error rate of the conventional STLC system when N = S.}

	abstract = {In quorum sensing (QS), bacteria exchange molecular signals to work together. An analytically-tractable model is presented for characterizing QS signal propagation within a population of bacteria and the number of responsive cooperative bacteria (i.e., cooperators) in a two-dimensional (2D) environment. Unlike prior works with a deterministic topology and a simplified molecular propagation channel, this work considers continuous emission, diffusion, degradation, and reception among randomly-distributed bacteria. Using stochastic geometry, the 2D channel response and the corresponding probability of cooperation at a bacterium are derived. Based on this probability, new expressions are derived for the moment generating function and different orders of moments of the number of cooperators. The analytical results agree with the simulation results obtained by a particle-based method. In addition, the Poisson and Gaussian distributions are compared to approximate the distribution of the number of cooperators and the Poisson distribution provides the best overall approximation. The derived channel response can be generally applied to any molecular communication model where single or multiple transmitters continuously release molecules into a 2D environment. The derived statistics of the number of cooperators can be used to predict and control the QS process, e.g., predicting and decreasing the likelihood of biofilm formation.}

	abstract = {Life-critical warning message, abbreviated as warning message, is a special event-driven message that carries emergency information in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Three important characteristics that distinguish warning messages from ordinary vehicular messages are sporadicity, crowding, and ultra-time-criticality. Specifically, warning messages come only once in a while in a sporadic manner; however, when they come, they tend to come as a crowd and they need to be delivered in short order. This paper puts forth a medium-access control (MAC) protocol for warning messages. The overall MAC protocol operates by means of interrupt-and-access. To circumvent potential inefficiency arising from message sporadicity, we adopt an override network architecture whereby warning messages are delivered on the spectrum of the ordinary vehicular messages. A vehicle with a warning message first sends an interrupt signal to pre-empt the transmission of ordinary messages, so that the warning message can use the wireless spectrum originally allocated to ordinary messages. In this way, no exclusive spectrum resources need to be pre-allocated to the sporadic warning messages. Following the interrupt, for transmissions of ultra-time-critical crowd messages, we employ advanced channel access techniques to ensure reliable message delivery within an ultra-short time in the order of 10 ms.}

	abstract = {Piezoelectric nanogenerators recently emerged as a turning point in the design of energy-aware and energy harvesting transmission scheme at the nanoscale. This work considers their adoption in diffusion-based molecular communications, proposing a power control strategy based on feedback control theory. In particular, the transmission power of an electrochemical nanodevice fed by a piezoelectric nanogenerator is dynamically set proportionally to the available energy budget, by using a closed-loop control scheme. The resulting system is analytically modeled with a discrete-time nonlinear state equation. The range of acceptable values of the proportional gain is theoretically derived by studying technological constraints and global asymptotic stability. The impact of the proportional gain on both output variance and time constant of the linearized system around the equilibrium point is also investigated. Computer simulations validate the theoretical analysis under different parameter settings. The comparison against state of the art transmission scheme also demonstrates the unique ability of the conceived approach to ensure, at the equilibrium, the targeted performance level.}

	abstract = {We investigate design and performance of communications over the bandlimited Gaussian channel with one-bit output quantization. A transceiver structure is proposed, which generates the channel input using a finite set of time-limited and approximately bandlimited waveforms, and performs oversampling on the channel output by an integrate-and-dump filter preceding the one-bit quantizer. The waveform set is constructed based on a specific bandlimited random process with certain zero-crossing properties which can be utilized to convey information. In the presence of the additive white Gaussian noise, a discrete memoryless channel model of our transceiver is derived. Consequently, we determine a closed-form expression for the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) asymptotic information rate of the transceiver, which can be achieved by independent and identically distributed input symbols. By evaluating the fractional power containment bandwidth, we further show that at high SNR, the achievable spectral efficiency grows roughly logarithmically with the oversampling factor, coinciding with a notable result in the absence of noise (Shamai, 1994). Moreover, the error performance of our transceiver is evaluated by low density parity check coded modulation. Numerical results demonstrate that reliable communication at rates exceeding one bit per Nyquist interval can be achieved at moderate SNR.}

	abstract = {Caching is a technique to reduce the communication load in peak hours by prefetching contents during off-peak hours. An information theoretic framework for coded caching was introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen in a recent work, where it was shown that significant improvement can be obtained compared to uncoded caching. Considerable efforts have been devoted to identify the precise information theoretic fundamental limits of the coded caching systems, however the difficulty of this task has also become clear. One of the reasons for this difficulty is that the original coded caching setting allows all possible multiple demand types during delivery, which in fact introduces tension in the coding strategy. In this paper, we seek to develop a better understanding of the fundamental limits of coded caching by investigating systems with certain demand type restrictions. We first consider the canonical three-user three-file system, and show that, contrary to popular beliefs, the worst demand type is not the one in which all three files are requested. Motivated by these findings, we focus on coded caching systems where every file must be requested by at least one user. A novel coding scheme is proposed, which can provide new operating points that are not covered by any previously known schemes.}

This problem can be answered if all the information inequalities are known, but this is an extremely challenging problem. On the other hand, we can establish that a given vector is an entropy vector if we can show the existence of distribution such that the corresponding entropy vector is the same as the given vector. However, there is no known algorithm to solve this problem. Only for the simplest case of binary entropy vectors, an algorithm is known to solve this problem. In this paper, we present a recursive algorithm to determine whether a given vector is a quasi-uniform entropy vector and, if it is, to return a consistent quasi-uniform distribution. We also present two applications of the recursive procedure: (i) to generate all quasi-uniform distributions motivated by the problem of finding the smallest quasi-uniform distribution such that its entropy vector violates the well known Ingleton inequality and (ii) to obtain an entropy vector (not necessarily quasi-uniform) near to a target vector in the entropy space for random variables with given alphabet size.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel experienced deep reinforcement learning (deep-RL) framework is proposed to provide model-free resource allocation for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC-6G) in the downlink of a wireless network. The goal is to guarantee high end-to-end reliability and low end-to-end latency, under explicit data rate constraints, for each wireless user without any models of or assumptions on the users' traffic. In particular, in order to enable the deep-RL framework to account for extreme network conditions and operate in highly reliable systems, a new approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed. This GAN approach is used to pre-train the deep-RL framework using a mix of real and synthetic data, thus creating an experienced deep-RL framework that has been exposed to a broad range of network conditions. The proposed deep-RL framework is particularly applied to a multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) resource allocation system. Formally, this URLLC-6G resource allocation problem in OFDMA systems is posed as a power minimization problem under reliability, latency, and rate constraints. To solve this problem using experienced deep-RL, first, the rate of each user is determined. Then, these rates are mapped to the resource block and power allocation vectors of the studied wireless system. Finally, the end-to-end reliability and latency of each user are used as feedback to the deep-RL framework. It is then shown that at the fixed-point of the deep-RL algorithm, the reliability and latency of the users are near-optimal. Moreover, for the proposed GAN approach, a theoretical limit for the generator output is analytically derived. Simulation results show how the proposed approach can achieve near-optimal performance within the rate-reliability-latency region, depending on the network and service requirements. The results also show that the proposed experienced deep-RL framework is able to remove the transient training time that makes conventional deep-RL methods unsuitable for URLLC-6G. Moreover, during extreme conditions, it is shown that the proposed, experienced deep-RL agent can recover instantly while a conventional deep-RL agent takes several epochs to adapt to new extreme conditions.}

In the literature, it has been proved that nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can achieve the same performance as computationally complex dirty paper coding, where the quasi-degradation condition is satisfied, conditioned on the users’ channels fall in the quasi-degradation region. However, in a conventional communication scenario, it is difficult to guarantee the quasi-degradation, because the channels are determined by the propagation environments and cannot be reconfigured. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on an IRS-assisted MISO NOMA system, where the wireless channels can be effectively tuned. We optimize the beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shift matrix for minimizing transmission power. Furthermore, we propose an improved quasi-degradation condition by using IRS, which can ensure that NOMA achieves the capacity region with high possibility. For a comparison, we study zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) as well, where the beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shift matrix are also jointly optimized. Comparing NOMA with ZFBF, it is shown that, with the same IRS phase shift matrix and the improved quasi-degradation condition, NOMA always outperforms ZFBF. At the same time, we identify the condition under which ZFBF outperforms NOMA, which motivates the proposed hybrid NOMA transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed IRS-assisted MISO system outperforms the MISO case without IRS, and the hybrid NOMA transmission scheme always achieves better performance than orthogonal multiple access.}

Based on this time-fraction-wise signal transmission, a new user service scheduling scheme for multi-cell mMIMO, whose cell-edge users suffer not only poor channel conditions but also multi-cell interference, is proposed to support a large user-population.

The achievable ergodic user rates of the proposed scheme are analyzed for Rayleigh fading channels based on a finite-size random matrix theory framework, which is further exploited to develop a statistical power allocation algorithm. Simulation and numerical results show that the proposed UA-SD MIMO-NOMA scheme significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access and a benchmark precoder design performing SD via generalized singular value decomposition in terms of the achievable ergodic rate region for most user rates. The ergodic rate region is further enhanced by a hybrid scheme which performs time sharing between the proposed UA-SD MIMO-NOMA scheme and single-user MIMO.}

Unlike high-resolution ADC and DAC systems, non-negligible quantization noise that needs to be considered in CoMP design makes the problem more challenging. We first formulate total power minimization problems of both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) systems subject to signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. We then derive strong duality for the UL and DL problems under coarse quantization systems. Leveraging the duality, we propose a framework that is directed toward a twofold aim: to discover the optimal transmit powers in UL by developing iterative algorithm in a distributed manner and to obtain the optimal precoder in DL as a scaled instance of UL combiner. Under homogeneous transmit power and SINR constraints per cell, we further derive a deterministic solution for the UL CoMP problem by analyzing the lower bound of the SINR. Lastly, we extend the derived result to wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems to optimize transmit power and beamformer for all subcarriers.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the application of the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique into the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided relay networks. Specifically, we first incorporate the NOMA protocol with the decode-and-forward (DF) relay protocol to enhance the performance of the cell edge users in a macrocell network. Theoretical analysis indicates that the NOMA-DF-relay protocol outperforms the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based DF-relay protocol in terms of data rate. To fully exploit the advantages of the proposed protocol, we formulate a joint UAV height optimization, channel allocation, and power allocation problem with the objective to maximize the total data rate of the cell edge users under the coverage of the UAV. For solving the formulated problem effectively, we first analyze its property and employ the golden section method to propose a general framework to obtain the optimal height of the UAV. Then, we design a low-complexity iterative algorithm to solve the joint channel-and-power allocation problem based on the matching theory and the Lagrangian dual decomposition technique. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the NOMA-DF-relay protocol is superior to the OMA-DF-relay protocol even when the system parameters are not optimized, and the proposed algorithms can further significantly improve the network performance in comparison with the other schemes.}

	abstract = {This work focuses on the promising Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) and its beamforming design problem to achieve max-min fairness (MMF) among multiple co-channel multicast groups with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Contrary to the conventional linear precoding (NoRS) that relies on fully treating any residual interference as noise, we consider a novel multigroup multicast beamforming strategy based on RSMA. RSMA relies on linearly precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, and has recently been shown to enable a flexible framework for non-orthogonal transmission and robust interference management in multi-antenna wireless networks. In this work, we characterize the MMF Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) achieved by RS and NoRS in multigroup multicast with imperfect CSIT and demonstrate the benefits of RS strategies for both underloaded and overloaded scenarios. Motivated by the DoF analysis, we then formulate a generic transmit power constrained optimization problem to achieve MMF rate performance. The superiority of RS-based multigroup multicast beamforming compared with NoRS is demonstrated via simulations in both terrestrial and multibeam satellite systems. In particular, due to the characteristics and challenges of multibeam satellite communications, our proposed RS strategy is shown promising to manage its inter-beam interference.}

	abstract = {Ambient radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting is widely promoted as an enabler for wireless-power Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article jointly characterizes energy harvesting and packet transmissions in grant-free opportunistic uplink IoT networks energized via harvesting downlink energy. To do that, a joint queuing theory and stochastic geometry model is utilized to develop a spatio-temporal analytical model. Particularly, the harvested energy and packet transmission success probability are characterized using tools from stochastic geometry. Moreover, each device is modeled using a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Such two dimensions are utilized to jointly track the scavenged/depleted energy to/from the batteries along with the arrival/departure of packets to/from devices buffers over time. Consequently, the adopted queuing model represents the devices as spatially interacting queues. To that end, the network performance is assessed in light of the packet throughput, the average delay, and the average buffer size. The effect of base stations (BSs) densification is discussed and several design insights are provided. The results show that the parameters for uplink power control and opportunistic channel access should be jointly optimized to maximize average network packet throughput, and hence, minimize delay.}

	abstract = {One of the main challenges in wireless powered networks (WPNs) is the doubly near-far problem, i.e., the twofold degradation of the users' performance due to different path-loss values that affects both the energy harvesting and the information transmission efficiency. To this end, we propose and optimize the application of decentralized power transfer and radio access in WPNs, which is implemented by using multiple remote radio heads (RRHs) with the capability to both transfer energy and receive information. More specifically, the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) is investigated, while two novel schemes are proposed, hereinafter termed as partially and fully asynchronous transmission TDMA (AT-TDMA). According to the proposed schemes, the users harvest energy and transmit information to the RRHs in different portions of time. Furthermore, the sum and minimum throughput among users are jointly maximized by obtaining the Pareto optimal solutions for the scheduling of power transfer and information transmission. To evaluate the performance of the decentralized architecture compared to the centralized one, we solve the aforementioned optimization problem for both architectures, taking also into account the circuit power consumption. Simulations show that the use of multiple RRHs improves spectral efficiency compared to the centralized implementation, since it can tackle more efficiently the doubly near-far problem. In addition, the proposed AT-TDMA schemes increase the achievable data rate.}

To meet the rapid growth need of mobile data services, blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) has emerged as a decentralized, trustworthy radio access paradigm spurred by blockchain technologies. However, many characteristics of B-RAN remain unclear and hard to characterize. In this study, we develop an analytical framework to model B-RAN and provide some basic fundamental analysis. Starting from block generation, we establish a queuing model based on a time-homogeneous Markov chain. From the queuing model, we evaluate the performance of B-RAN with respect to latency and security considerations. We uncover a more comprehensive picture of the achievable performance of B-RAN by connecting latency and security. At last, we present experimental results via an innovative prototype and validate the proposed model.}

	abstract = {For future wireless networks, enormous numbers of interconnections are required, creating a multi-hop topology and leading to a great challenge on data aggregation. Instead of collecting data individually, a more efficient technique, computation over multi-access channels (CoMAC), has emerged to compute functions by exploiting the signal-superposition property of wireless channels. However, it is still an open problem on the implementation of CoMAC in multi-hop wireless networks considering fading channel and resource allocation. In this paper, we propose multi-layer CoMAC (ML-CoMAC) by combining CoMAC and orthogonal communication to compute functions in the multi-hop network. Firstly, to make the multi-hop network more tractable, we reorganize it into a hierarchical network with multiple layers that consists of subgroups and groups. Then, in the hierarchical network, the implementation of ML-CoMAC is given by computing and communicating subgroup and group functions over layers, where CoMAC is applied to compute each subgroup function and orthogonal communication is adopted for each group to obtain the group function. The general computation rate is derived and the performance is further improved through time allocation and power control. The closed-form solutions to optimization problems are obtained, which suggests that orthogonal communication and existing CoMAC schemes are generalized.}

In practice, the ground terminals may not be able to communicate with the BS directly due to constraints in transmit power and communication capability, and mobile agents are commonly employed to help collect and deliver the updates. In particular, the emerging mobile crowd sensing (MCS) provides an appealing cost-effective paradigm for such employment. However, in this case, the mobile agents are required to share their locations with the ground terminals and the BS, which incurs location privacy concerns and may deter them from participating in the information delivery process. With this consideration, a location privacy-aware payment mechanism, which can stimulate the mobile agents to report their locations with differential privacy levels desired by the BS, is proposed. Furthermore, considering that the BS usually has a limited budget, it is essential to properly select the set of mobile agents to perform the information collection tasks. Therefore, a cost-efficient mobile agent selection algorithm is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

However, the ultra-dense deployment of small base stations (SBSs) might introduce severe interference to users that connect to SBSs. This paper analyzes the performance of 5G communication networks where the SBSs with coordinated beamforming, operating at mmWave frequency band and macro base stations (MBSs) operating at sub-6 GHz coexist. First, by utilizing a stochastic geometry approach, we obtain the cell association probability expressions in terms of different cell association biases, base station density ratios and probabilities of line of sight (LoS) link. Furthermore, we propose a clustering method to choose some SBSs to eliminate intra-cell interference. Then, we put forward an average distance from the Kth SBS to a user to obtain signal-to-interference-ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability expressions. The simulation results validate the correctness of the expressions, and indicate that the optimal cardinality of coordinated SBSs increases with the density of SBSs. In addition, the relationship between the cluster size K and the average energy efficiency is obtained, which can be used to guide the coordination principle in 5G and beyond communication systems.}

	abstract = {5G New Radio (NR) is envisioned to efficiently support both enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Due to the severe constraint of URLLC traffic, the time resources used by eMBB are further divided into mini-slots. From the media access control (MAC) layer scheduling perspective, the resource allocation occurs on different timescales, and URLLC traffic is pre-emptively overlapped at the mini-slot timescale to obtain the strict requirements of URLLC (achieve 99.999% reliability within 1 ms latency). In this article, we analyze the multiplexing of eMBB and URLLC traffic in 5G downlink transmission, with the dual objectives of maximizing eMBB utility like proportional fairness for eMBB users while satisfying URLLC constraints. We formulate the resource allocation problem in each mini-slot as the integer programming (IP) problem with two solutions: 1) convex relaxation; 2) greedy algorithm. The simulation results show that our algorithms have a higher utility of eMBB users while satisfying the URLLC users' latency and reliability requirements than using basic round robin. The performance comparison between the two algorithms is extensively studied, and the choice of two algorithms in practice can be decided by the trade-off analysis investigated in this article.}

	abstract = {Many mission-critical and latency-sensitive applications require ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), which has been listed as a new service category of 5G New Radio (NR). To guarantee stringent latency and reliability constraints, URLLC services always exclusively occupy the spectrum and have priority over enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communications in the current coexistence scenario, which will greatly affect the performance of eMBB services and degrade the utilization efficiency of the spectrum resource. On the other hand, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications can fulfill the enormous throughput requirements of 5G cellular communications. In this paper, we introduce mmWave communications into URLLC systems to provide a more efficient coexistence for eMBB and URLLC. A novel mmWave URLLC system is first developed, where URLLC users are allowed to share the spectrum resources with eMBB users. Besides, multi-connectivity technology, which enables users to access multiple base stations simultaneously, is introduced to the mmWave URLLC system to enhance the reliability. Then, a resource management problem is formulated, which maximizes the throughput of eMBB users while guaranteeing the latency and reliability requirements of URLLC users. To obtain optimal solutions, we first divide it into three subproblems, i.e., power allocation, resource matching, and user paring, and then solve them respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the data rate improvement compared against the traditional coexistence scenario without reusing strategy. Moreover, the multi-connectivity functionality poses a great effect on guaranteeing the latency and reliability requirements for URLLC users.}

The methodology developed is blind, allowing topology sensing of a network whose key features (i.e., number of nodes, physical layer signals, and medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols) are unknown. Because of the wireless medium, over-the-air signals captured by the sensors are mixed; therefore, blind source separation (BSS) and measurement association are used to separate traffic patterns. Then, to infer the topology, we detect directed data flows among nodes by identifying causal relationships between the separated transmitted patterns. We propose causal inference methods such as Granger causality (GC), transfer entropy (TE), and conditional transfer entropy (CTE) that use the times series of traffic profiles, and a solution based on a neural network (NN) that exploits distilled time-based features. The framework is validated on an ad-hoc wireless network accounting for MAC protocol, packet collisions, nodes mobility, the spatial density of sensors, and channel impairments, such as path-loss, shadowing, and noise. Numerical results reveal that the proposed approach reaches a high probability of link detection and a moderate false alarm rate in mild shadowing regimes and low to moderate network nodes mobility.}

The packets of each source are generated according to the Poisson process and the packets are served according to an exponentially distributed service time. We derive the average age of information (AoI) of each source using the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) technique for each packet management policy. In Policy 1, the queue can contain at most two waiting packets at the same time (in addition to the packet under service), one packet of source 1 and one packet of source 2. When the server is busy at an arrival of a packet, the possible packet of the same source waiting in the queue (hence, source-aware) is replaced by the arrived fresh packet. In Policy 2, the system (i.e., the waiting queue and the server) can contain at most two packets, one from each source. When the server is busy at an arrival of a packet, the possible packet of the same source in the system is replaced by the fresh packet. Policy 3 is similar to Policy 2 but it does not permit preemption in service, i.e., while a packet is under service all new arrivals from the same source are blocked and cleared. Numerical results are provided to assess the fairness between sources and the sum average AoI of the proposed policies.}

However, it is challenging to configure slicing systems for bursty ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) service provision due to its stringent requirements on low packet blocking probability and low codeword decoding error probability. In this paper, we propose to orchestrate network resources for a slicing system to guarantee more reliable bursty URLLC transmission. We re-cut physical resource blocks and derive the minimum upper bound of bandwidth for URLLC transmission with a low packet blocking probability. We correlate coordinated multipoint beamforming with channel uses and derive the minimum upper bound of channel uses for URLLC transmission with a low codeword decoding error probability. Considering the agreement on converging diverse services onto shared infrastructures, we further investigate the network slicing for URLLC and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) service multiplexing. Particularly, we formulate the service multiplexing as an optimization problem, which is challenging to be mitigated due to requirements of future channel information and of tackling a two timescale issue. To address the challenges, we develop a resource optimization algorithm based on a sample average approximate technique and a distributed optimization method with provable performance guarantees.}

	abstract = {By offloading tasks from the mobile device (MD) to its nearby deployed access points (APs), each of which is connected to one server for task processing, computation offloading can strike a balance between MD's task execution delay and energy consumption in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Considering communication and computation dynamics in MEC systems, we aim to design online computation offloading mechanisms in this paper to minimize the time average expected task execution delay under the constraint of average energy consumption. Firstly, with known current channel gains between the MD and APs as well as available computing capability at MEC servers, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization framework to make an optimal one-slot decision on MD's transmit power allocation and MEC server selection. On this basis, we then consider a more realistic scenario, where it is difficult to capture current available computing capability at MEC servers, and combine the multi-armed bandit framework for an online learning based MEC server selection algorithm. Finally, through theoretical analyses and extensive simulations, we demonstrate the near-optimality and feasibility of our proposed algorithms, and present that our proposed algorithms fully explore the interplay between communication and computation with enriched user experience and reduced energy consumption.}

In particular, we focus on the performance of a single static user under the influence of random device orientation and link blockage. Simulations and mathematical analysis have been used to evaluate the UL system performance. The analytical expressions for the UL optical wireless channel and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) statistics under the effects of random device orientation and link blockage are derived. The results show that the effects of random orientation and link blockage may lead to a decrease in coverage probability by 10% - 40% with various SNR thresholds.}

	abstract = {The problem of maximizing secrecy rate of multiple-input multiple-output multiple-eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels with arbitrary numbers of antennas at each node is studied in this paper. First, the optimization problem corresponding to the secrecy capacity of the MIMOME channel is converted to an equivalent optimization based on Givens rotations and eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix. In this new formulation, precoder is a rotation matrix which results in a positive semi-definite (PSD) covariance matrix by construction. This removes the PSD matrix constraint and makes the problem easier to tackle. Next, a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)-based algorithm is developed to find the rotation and power allocation parameters. Further, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based precoding is used to initialize this algorithm. The proposed rotation-BFGS method provides an efficient approach to find a near-optimal transmit strategy for the MIMOME channel and outperforms various state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods. In particular, the rotation-BFGS precoding achieves higher secrecy rates than the celebrated GSVD precoding, with a reasonably higher computational complexity. Extensive numerical results elaborate on the effectiveness of the rotation-BFGS precoding. The new framework developed in this paper can be applied to a variety of similar problems in the context of multi-antenna channels with and without secrecy.}

	abstract = {Accurate location information is critical for many engineering applications (e.g., radar, sonar, autonomous robots, intelligent transportation systems). In traditional source localization algorithms, the perfect knowledge of noisy Time-of-Arrival (ToA) measurements are assumed to be obtained by the fusion center in a sensor network. This assumption is not practical for wireless sensor networks, especially for a resource-limited sensor network with stringent power and communication bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel channel-aware source localization method based on quantized asynchronous ToA measurements, where the quantization errors as well as the imperfect communication link between each sensor and the fusion center are considered. The maximum-likelihood (ML) source localization by jointly estimating the signal transmission instant and source location is formulated. An efficient relaxation is provided to transform the non-convex ML optimization problem into a convex problem. The Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the quantized ToA measurements with the uncertainty of data exchange are derived. Furthermore, a Fisher information based heuristic quantization scheme is proposed to design quantized thresholds for asynchronous ToA measurements. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can yield an efficient estimate under different scenarios.}

In particular, we aim to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) taking into account the impact of hardware impairments, where the source transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming are jointly designed under the proposed optimization framework. To circumvent the non-convexity of the formulated design problem, we first derive a closed-form optimal solution to the source transmit beamforming. Then, for the optimization of IRS reflect beamforming, we obtain an upper bound to the optimal objective value via solving a single convex problem. A low-complexity minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm was developed to approach the upper bound. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming design is more robust to the hardware impairments than that of the conventional SNR maximized scheme. Moreover, compared to the scenario without deploying an IRS, the performance gain brought by incorporating the hardware impairments is more evident for the IRS-aided communications.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), consisting of many low-cost elements that reflect the incident waves by an adjustable phase shift, have attracted sudden attention for their potential of reconfiguring the signal propagation environment and enhancing the performance of wireless networks. The passive nature of RISs is indeed beneficial, but the lack of radio frequency (RF) chains at the RIS has made channel estimation extremely challenging. We face this challenge by proposing a joint channel estimation and transmit precoding framework for RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, the effective cascaded channel of the reflected transmitter-RIS-receiver link is decomposed into multiple subchannels, each of which corresponds to a single RIS element. Then our joint RIS-transmitter precoding model is formulated for the individual subchannels of each reflecting element. Finally, we develop a two-stage precoding design for successively determining the required phase shifts of each reflecting element of the RIS and the digital baseband precoder of the transmitter, only relying on the channel state information (CSI) of the subchannels. The performance of the proposed subchannel estimation and joint precoding method is evaluated by extensive simulations. Our numerical results show that the proposed designs provide an attractive solution to RIS-aided MIMO systems.}

	abstract = {Frequency-hopping (FH) MIMO radar-based dual-function radar communication (FH-MIMO DFRC) enables communication symbol rate to exceed radar pulse repetition frequency, which requires accurate estimations of timing offset and channel parameters. The estimations, however, are challenging due to unknown, fast-changing hopping frequencies and the multiplicative coupling between timing offset and channel parameters. In this article, we develop accurate methods for a single-antenna communication receiver to estimate timing offset and channel for FH-MIMO DFRC. First, we design a novel FH-MIMO radar waveform, which enables a communication receiver to estimate the hopping frequency sequence (HFS) used by radar, instead of acquiring it from radar. Importantly, the novel waveform incurs no degradation to radar ranging performance. Then, via capturing distinct HFS features, we develop two estimators for timing offset and derive mean squared error lower bound of each estimator. Using the bounds, we design an HFS that renders both estimators applicable. Furthermore, we develop an accurate channel estimation method, reusing the single hop for timing offset estimation. Validated by simulations, the accurate channel estimates attained by the proposed methods enable the communication performance of DFRC to approach that achieved based on perfect timing and ideal knowledge of channel.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems employing practical non-linear energy harvester (EH) circuits. Since the voltage across the reactive elements of realistic EH circuits cannot drop or rise instantaneously, EHs have memory which we model with a Markov decision process (MDP). Moreover, since an analytical model that accurately models all non-linear effects and the unavoidable impedance mismatch of EHs is not tractable, we propose a learning based model for the EH circuit. We optimize the input signal distribution for maximization of the harvested power under a constraint on the minimum mutual information between transmitter (TX) and information receiver (IR). We distinguish the cases where the MDP state is known and not known at TX and IR. When the MDP state is known, the formulated optimization problem for the harvested power is convex. In contrast, if TX and IR do not know the MDP state, the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and solved via alternating optimization, which is shown to yield a limit point of the problem. Our simulation results reveal that the rate-power region of the considered SWIPT system depends on the symbol duration, the EH input power level, the EH impedance mismatch, and the type of EH circuit. In particular, a shorter symbol duration enables higher bit rates at the expense of a significant decrease in the average harvested power. Furthermore, whereas half-wave rectifiers outperform full-wave rectifiers in the low and medium input power regimes, full-wave rectifiers are preferable if the input power at the EH is high.}

Firstly, we propose a gradient-based resource allocation strategy (GBRA), which alternately optimizes the precoder and time allocation based on the two-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Secondly, to reduce the computational complexity and improve the feasibility of the strategy in practical applications, we further propose a codebook-based resource allocation strategy (CBRA), which can run more than three orders of magnitude faster than GBRA at the expense of a small sum-rate degradation. Then, the performance of the full-duplex (FD) and half-duplex (HD) system with or without backscatter assistance using GBRA are compared and analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the GBRA strategy has great robustness under various conditions but suffers a high computational complexity, and the CBRA strategy is effective and converges speedily.}

In this paper, the potential benefits of using RISs are investigated for indoor/outdoor setups and various frequency bands (from sub 6 GHz to millimeter-waves). First, a general system model with a single RIS is considered and the effect of the total number of reflecting elements on the probabilistic distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio and error performance is investigated under Rician fading. Also for this case, the path loss exponent is analyzed by considering empirical path loss models. Furthermore, transmission models with multiple RISs are developed and analyzed for indoor and outdoor non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The conventional RIS selection strategies are also integrated for systems equipped with multiple RISs for the first time. Through extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the RIS-assisted systems provide promising solutions for indoor/outdoor scenarios at various operating frequencies and exhibit significant results in error performance and achievable data rates even in the presence of system imperfections such as limited range phase adjustment and imperfect channel phase estimation at RISs.}

The HAP has a massive antenna array, while all CUs and UEs nodes are equipped with single antenna each. Time switching protocol is adopted, where channel estimation, wireless power transfer, and information transfer between UEs, CUs and full-duplex HAP are performed in two phases. By adopting maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) processing at the HAP, the uplink and downlink achievable rate expressions in the large-antenna limit and approximate results that hold for any finite number of antennas are derived. Moreover, the optimum energy beamformer and time-split parameter at the HAP are found to maximize the downlink sum-rate under a constraint on uplink sum-rate. Our findings reveal that our proposed energy beamforming with ZF and MRC/MRT processing for information transfer achieves up to 47% and 14% average sum rate gains as compared with the suboptimum energy beamformer, respectively.}

	abstract = {Wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC) has been identified as a promising technology for low-power communication systems, which can reap the benefits of energy beamforming to improve energy transfer efficiency. However, existing studies on energy beamforming fail to simultaneously take energy supply and information transfer in WPBC into account. This paper takes the first step to fill this gap, by considering the restrictive relationship between the energy harvesting rate and achievable rate with estimated backscatter channel state information (BS-CSI). To ensure reliable communication and user fairness, we formulate the energy beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem by maximizing the minimum achievable rate for all backscatter tags subject to the energy constraint. We derive the closed-form expression of the energy harvesting rate, as well as the lower bound of the achievable rate for maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. Our numerical results indicate that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art energy beamforming schemes. Additionally, the achievable rate of our scheme approaches more than 90% of the rate limit achieved via beamforming with perfect CSI for both receivers.}

	abstract = {Within the framework of 5G, blockage effects occurring in the mmWave band are critical. Previous works describe the effects of blockages in isolated and multiple links for simple blocking objects, modeled with mathematical tools such as stochastic geometry and random shape theory. Our study uses these tools to characterize a scenario with N links, including the possible correlation among them in terms of blocking for several models of blocking objects. We include numerical evaluations highlighting that assuming independence among the links' blocking elements is a too-brief simplification and does not accurately describe the real scenario. This paper also applies the formulation developed for the case of N links to optimize the relay positioning in mmWave cells for coverage enhancement, that is, to minimize the communication failure probability. We also show that both link budget and blockages affect the optimum positioning of the relays as they are both essential for successful transmission.}

	abstract = {The 5G mobile communication systems introduce multiples functional splits between base station elements, new transmission bands and a large number of antennas supporting beamforming. In this scenario, a viable strategy to avoid building penetration losses is to deploy the antenna elements indoor and use a fronthaul link to establish the connection between them and the rest of the radio access network. This work explores a 5G fronthaul scheme based on analog radio over coaxial cables, leveraging this existing fixed access infrastructure to facilitate 5G deployments. Results indicate that the fronthaul solution discussed here is able to support the high capacity requirement of 5G, with the additional benefits of low transmit power, low latency and low cost. The main novelty of this paper is to investigate the potential of this kind of fronthaul architecture considering both the physical layer and economic aspects.}

	abstract = {We study a millimeter wave (mm-wave) wireless network deployed along the roads of an urban area, to support localization and communication services simultaneously for outdoor mobile users. In this network, we propose a mm-wave initial beam-selection scheme based on localization-bounds, which greatly reduces the initial access delay as compared to traditional initial access schemes for standalone mm-wave small cell base station (BS). Then, we introduce a downlink transmission protocol, in which the radio frames are partitioned into three phases, namely, initial access, data, and localization, respectively. We establish a trade-off between the localization and communication performance of mm-wave systems, and show how enhanced localization can actually improve the data-communication performance. Our results suggest that dense BS deployments enable to allocate more resources to the data phase while still maintaining appreciable localization performance. Furthermore, for the case of sparse deployments and large beam dictionary size (i.e., with thinner beams), more resources must be allotted to the localization phase for optimizing the rate coverage. Based on our results, we provide several system design insights and dimensioning rules for the network operators that will deploy the first generation of mm-wave BSs.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band has attracted considerable interest recently due to its superior high frequency and large available bandwidth. THz could act a vital part in the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks. In this paper, we introduce the downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology into THz band small cell networks, where the total performance is optimized considering the two key enabling technologies. In order to decrease the energy consumption triggered by increasing of wireless services, we pay great attention to energy efficiency (EE) optimization and resource allocation in the THz-NOMA downlink systems by solving the subchannel assignment and power optimization. We first exploit a channel model for the THz-NOMA downlink system by using the key features of THz-NOMA networks. Then we utilize Dinkelbach-style algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem and decompose it into two subproblems. A subchannel assignment algorithm and a power optimization based on alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm are developed to get the solution. Finally, to embody the strengths of THz-NOMA performance, we compare our proposed schemes against the conventional schemes. Simulation results yield substantially higher EE and further prove the availability of our proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Proactive caching has emerged as a promising means to accommodate increased demands for wireless capacity. However, studies of proactive caching usually focus on minimizing the overall load of cache-aided networks. How to calculate each user’s caching gain is still an open problem. In this paper, a two-phase cache-aided network is investigated, in which users with heterogeneous preferences are served by a base station through a shared link. Effective throughput is considered as a performance metric, which describes the reduction in each user’s transmission cost. All possible values of effective throughputs achieved by legitimate caching policies form an achievable domain. It is proved that the achievable domain is a convex set and can be characterized by its boundary. A special type of caching policies, termed uncoded placement absolutely-fair (UPAF) caching, is studied. For the two-user case, games are formulated to allocate effective throughput gains for the two users. For the general multiuser case, a UPAF policy is proposed to organize user cooperation. It is shown that users with more concentrated preferences can obtain higher effective throughputs.}

Noisy density evolution (DE) that allows to theoretically study the performance of these LDPC decoders can only consider symmetric deviation models due to the all-zero codeword assumption. A novel DE method is proposed that admits the use of asymmetric deviation models, thus widening the range of faulty implementations that can be analyzed. DE equations are provided for three noisy decoders: belief propagation, Gallager B, and quantized min-sum (MS). Simulation results confirm that the proposed DE accurately predicts the performance of LDPC decoders with asymmetric deviations. Furthermore, asymmetric versions of the Gallager B and MS decoders are proposed to compensate the effect of asymmetric deviations. The parameters of these decoders are then optimized using the proposed DE, leading to better ensemble thresholds and improved finite-length performance in the presence of asymmetric deviations.}

In this paper, we study two types of systematic mMDS sliding window codes over erasure channels, i.e., scalar codes defined over a finite field GF(2 L ), and vector codes defined over a vector space GF(2) L . We first devise an efficient heuristic algorithm to produce an mMDS sliding window scalar code over relatively small GF(2 L ). Then, we investigate a special class of mMDS sliding window vector codes whose encoding/decoding are achieved by basic circular-shift and bit-wise XOR operations, and propose a general method to generate such mMDS vector codes. Our complexity analysis shows that the proposed vector codes yield much lower encoding/decoding complexity than the scalar codes. The theoretical and numerical results also demonstrate that mMDS sliding window codes dominate MDS block codes in terms of decoding delay and erasure-correction capability.}

	abstract = {The pilot scheme currently used in 5th generation (5G) cellular networks assigns the same set of orthogonal pilot signals to all cells. This results in inter-cell interference, also known as pilot contamination, which can significantly degrade performance, especially in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. To mitigate this interference, we propose a novel Dual Pilot Scheme (DPS) that assigns a slightly modified set of nearly-orthogonal pilot signals. DPS is a general scheme that can be implemented in any wireless communication system, including 5G and beyond. We demonstrate the integration of DPS in a massive MIMO system in both microscopic and macroscopic levels and analytically prove that DPS enables more accurate estimates of the channel state information in the minimum mean-squared error sense, under the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) and the correlated Rayleigh fading wireless communication channel models. We further validate and demonstrate the advantages of DPS over various channel models of massive MIMO 5G technology by extensive simulations.}

In addition, a novel scheme “Filter Shape Index Modulation” (FSIM) is proposed. This FSIM scheme allows a higher Spectral Efficiency (SE) gain than the time and frequency IM dimensions in Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) systems. In the FSIM system, the bit-stream is mapped using an Amplitude Phase Modulation (APM) as QAM or PSK, and an index of a filter-shape changing at the symbol rate. This filter shape, being changed at each symbol, enables a SE gain in SISO system without sacrificing any time or frequency resources. Compared to an equivalent 8QAM and 16QAM schemes and at the same SE, the FSIM with QPSK using 2 and 4 non-optimal filter shapes achieves a gain of 3.8 dB and 1.7 dB respectively at BER= 10 -4 , and this superiority is maintained in frequency selective fading channel compared to equivalent SISO-IM schemes. A low complexity detection scheme, approaching the maximum likelihood detector performance, is proposed along with a full performance characterization in terms of theoretical probability of filter index error and BER lower bound. Finally, FSIM can achieve better spectral and energy efficiencies when a filter bank and an ISI cancellation technique are optimally designed.}

	abstract = {In Diffusive Molecular Communication (DMC), information is transmitted by diffusing molecules. Synaptic signaling, as a natural implementation of this paradigm, encompasses functional components that, once understood, can facilitate the development of synthetic DMC systems. To unleash this potential, however, a thorough understanding of the synaptic communication channel based on biophysical principles is needed. Since synaptic transmission critically depends also on non-neural cells, such understanding requires the consideration of the so-called tripartite synapse. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive channel model of the tripartite synapse encompassing a three-dimensional, finite-size spatial model of the synaptic cleft, molecule uptake at the presynaptic neuron and at glial cells, reversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron, and spillover to the extrasynaptic space. Based on this model, we derive analytical time domain expressions for the channel impulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system and for the number of molecules taken up at the presynaptic neuron and at glial cells, respectively. These expressions provide insight into the impact of macroscopic physical channel parameters on the decay rate of the CIR and the reuptake rate, and reveal fundamental limits for synaptic signal transmission induced by chemical reaction kinetics and the channel geometry. Adapted to realistic parameters, our model produces plausible results when compared to previous experimental and simulation studies and we provide results from particle-based computer simulations to further validate the analytical model. The proposed comprehensive channel model admits a wide range of synaptic configurations making it suitable for the investigation of many practically relevant questions, such as the impact of glial cell uptake and spillover on signal transmission in the tripartite synapse.}

With the aim to improve the spectrum efficiency and enhance the reliability, we construct a multi-dimension codebook based on a factor graph matrix to spread information bits in a non orthogonal way, thus the signals could overlap and multiple users are allowed to share all sub-carrier resources via the non orthogonal spreading. The information bits using the same codebook are regarded as a layer, while each user could choose to use one or multiple layers. Then the resultant symbols are spread by the reference chaotic sequence and its quadrature version generated by Hilbert transform in the time domain. At the receiver, reverse operations are conducted, and we propose the Minimum Distance (MD) detection method to retrieve the estimates. Furthermore, theoretical performances, including the Symbol Error Rate (SER), capacity, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency and computational complexity, are analyzed and compared among the proposed design and benchmarks. Simulation results are then provided to validate the theoretical analysis. Moreover, the Bit Error Rate (BER) performances under different channel conditions demonstrate the superior reliability and efficiency to benchmarks.}

For example, interactive AR/VR gaming service needs to render the live scene by jointly computing user features such as 3D positions and video data generated from the Internet. In this article, we consider the bidirectional computation task model, where each task is served via three mechanisms, i.e., local computing with local caching, local computing without local caching, and computing at the mobile edge computing server. To minimize the average bandwidth, we formulate the joint caching and computing optimization problem under the latency, cache size and average power constraints. In the homogeneous scenario, we derive the optimal policy and analytical expression for the minimum bandwidth. In the heterogeneous scenario, to reduce the computation complexity of the NP-hard problem, we relax some constraints of the original problem and propose a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) suboptimal solution, which may be infeasible. We then reformulate the original problem as an auxiliary problem based on the LR solution and solve this via Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP), which outputs feasible local optimal solution. Simulation has shown that LR-based algorithms outperform the baselines including greedy and CCCP algorithms in the bandwidth performance and time efficiency.}

	abstract = {Microwave backhaul links are characterized by high signal-to-noise ratios permitting spectrally-efficient transmission. The used signal constellation sizes and achievable data rates are typically limited by transceiver impairments, predominantly by phase noise from non-ideal carrier generation. In this article, we propose a new method to improve the data rate over such microwave links. We make use of the fact that adjacent frequency channels are inactive in many deployment scenarios. We argue that additional data can be transmitted in the skirts of the spectral mask imposed on the transmission signal by regulation. To accomplish this task, we present a shaped wideband single-carrier transmission using non-Nyquist pulse shapes. In particular, we design spectrum-skirt filling (SSF) pulse shaping filters that follow the spectral mask response, and perform detection using an accordingly increased sampling frequency at the receiver. We evaluate the achievable information rates of the SSF-based transmission considering practical dispersive channels and non-ideal transmitter and receiver processing. To compensate for phase noise impairments, we derive carrier phase tracking and estimation techniques, and utilize them in tandem with nonlinear precoding which mitigates the intersymbol interference introduced by the non-Nyquist SSF shaping filter. Quantitative performance evaluations show that the proposed system design achieves higher data rates in a dispersive microwave propagation environment with respect to the conventional transmission with Nyquist pulse shaping.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation scheme realized in the delay-Doppler domain, which targets the robust wireless transmissions in high-mobility environments. In such scenarios, OTFS signal suffers from multipath channel with continuous Doppler spread, which results in significant inter-symbol interference and inter-Doppler interference (IDI). In this article, we analyze the interference generation mechanism, and compare statistical distributions of the IDI in two typical cases, i.e., limited-Doppler-shift channel and continuous-Doppler-spread channel (CoDSC). Focusing on the OTFS signal transmission over the CoDSC, our study firstly indicates that the widespread IDI incurs a computational burden for the element-wise detector like the message passing in the state-of-the-art works. Addressing this challenge, we propose a block-wise OTFS receiver by exploiting the structure and characteristics of the OTFS transmission matrix. In the receiver, we deliberately design an iteration strategy among the least squares minimum residual based channel equalizer, reliability-based symbol detector and interference eliminator, which can realize fast convergence by leveraging the sparsity of channel matrix. The simulations demonstrate that, in the CoDSC, the proposed scheme achieves much less detection error, and meanwhile reduces the computational complexity by an order of magnitude, compared with the state-of-the-art OTFS receivers.}

	abstract = {We propose a new iterative detection and decoding (IDD) algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based on expectation propagation (EP) with application to massive MIMO scenarios. Two main results are presented. We first introduce EP to iteratively improve the Gaussian approximations of both the estimation of the posterior by the MIMO detector and the soft output of the channel decoder. With this novel approach, denoted by double-EP (DEP), the convergence is very much improved with a computational complexity just two times the one of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) based IDD, as illustrated by the included experiments. Besides, as in the LMMSE MIMO detector, when the number of antennas increases, the computational cost of the matrix inversion operation required by the DEP becomes unaffordable. In this work we also develop approaches of DEP where the mean and the covariance matrix of the posterior are approximated by using the Gauss-Seidel and Neumann series methods, respectively. This low-complexity DEP detector has quadratic complexity in the number of antennas, as the low-complexity LMMSE techniques. Experimental results show that the new low-complexity DEP achieves the performance of the DEP as the ratio between the number of transmitting and receiving antennas decreases.}

	abstract = {Multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC) allows each user to offload partial task bits to multiple MEC servers via multi-access radio transmission, enabling the collaboration of edge computing. By leveraging the advantage of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in improving the transmission efficiency, it is expected to effectively reduce the energy consumption of users in multi-access MEC with the aid of NOMA. However, considering the co-channel interference of NOMA and computation collaboration among MEC servers, the joint task offloading and resource allocation is a challenging problem. In this article, with the objective to minimize the weighted sum energy of users, we first propose optimal task offloading and resource allocation algorithms for the special single-user (OTORA-SU) and general multi-user (OTORA-MU) cases, by exploiting the convex and layered structure of the formulated problem. Interestingly, it is found that the single user always preferentially offloads task bits to the MEC servers with better channel gains, regardless of the computation capacity of each MEC server. Then, a low-complexity algorithm (LTORA-MU) is proposed for the general multi-user case, which converges fast and achieves near-optimal performances. Considering the channel estimation error, the impacts of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) are also investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that for both perfect and imperfect CSI and SIC, 1) the proposed OTORA-SU and LTORA-MU outperform the local computing, full offloading, FDMA-based offloading and non-collaborative MEC schemes; 2) as the number of MEC servers grows, the ratio of offloading task bits increases while the energy consumption is decreased.}

	abstract = {The ordered transmissions scheme requires fewer sensor nodes to transmit their measurements than the conventional unordered transmissions scheme (UTS) in which all nodes transmit. Yet, it achieves the same error probability as UTS. For the practically relevant scenario in which the measurements of the sensor nodes are spatially correlated, we present a novel correlation-aware ordered transmissions scheme (CA-OTS) for the binary hypothesis testing problem with Gaussian statistics. It uses the timer scheme to make the nodes transmit their measurements in the decreasing order of the absolute values of the measurements without any node knowing the measurements of other nodes. CA-OTS applies to the general case where the hypotheses differ in the mean vector and covariance matrix, and markedly reduces the number of transmissions. It differs from the literature that assumes that the measurements of the nodes, when conditioned on the hypotheses, are statistically independent or the covariance matrix has a special structure. When the mean vector or covariance matrix is the same for the two hypotheses, we propose novel refinements that require even fewer transmissions. We also derive insightful upper bounds for them that apply to a general product-correlation model.}

	abstract = {Wireless random access protocols are attracting a revived research interest as a simple yet effective solution for machine-type communications. In the quest to improve reliability and spectral efficiency of such schemes, the use of multiple receivers has recently emerged as a promising option. We study the potential of this approach considering a population of users that transmit data packets following a simple slotted ALOHA policy to a set of uncoordinated relays (phase-1). These, in turn, independently forward - part of - what decoded towards a collecting sink (phase-2). For an on-off fading channel model, we provide exact expressions for phase-1 throughput and packet loss rate for an arbitrary number of relays, characterising the benefits of multi-receiver schemes. Moreover, a lower bound on the minimum amount of phase-2 resources needed to deliver all information collected at the relays is provided. The bound is proven to be achievable via random linear coding when no constraints in terms of latency are set, with an overhead that approaches zero with the inverse of the packet length. We complement our study discussing a family of simple forwarding policies that require no packet-level coding, and optimising their performance based on the amount of available phase-2 resources. The behaviour of both random linear coding and simplified policies is also characterised when receivers are equipped with finite buffers, revealing non-trivial tradeoffs.}

	abstract = {This work considers a layered coding approach for efficient transmission of data over a wireless block fading channel without transmitter channel state information (CSI), which is connected to a limited capacity reliable link, known as the bottleneck channel. Two main approaches are considered, the first is an oblivious approach, where the sampled noisy observations are compressed and transmitted over the bottleneck channel without having any knowledge of the original information codebook. The second approach is a non-oblivious decode-forward (DF) relay where the sampled noisy data is decoded, and whatever is successfully decoded is reliably transmitted over the bottleneck channel. The bottleneck channel from relay to destination has a fixed capacity C. We examine also the case where the channel capacity can dynamically change due to variable loads on the backhaul link. The broadcast approach is analyzed for cases that only the relay knows the available capacity for next block, and for the case that neither source nor relay know the capacity per block, only its capacity distribution. Fortunately, it is possible to analytically describe in closed form expressions, the optimal continuous layering power distribution which maximizes the average achievable rate. Numerical results demonstrate the achievable broadcast rates.}

	abstract = {Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) composed of space-borne (e.g., satellites) and airborne vehicles (e.g., drones and blimps) have recently been proposed by 3GPP as a new paradigm of infrastructures to enhance the capacity and coverage of existing terrestrial wireless networks. The mobility of non-terrestrial base stations (NT-BSs) however leads to a dynamic environment, which imposes unique challenges for handover and throughput optimization particularly in multi-user access control for NTNs. To achieve performance optimization, each terrestrial user equipment (UE) should autonomously estimate the dynamics of moving NT-BSs, which is different from the existing user access control schemes in terrestrial wireless networks. Consequently, new learning schemes for optimum multi-user access control are desired. In this article, we therefore propose a UE-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme, in which a centralized agent deployed at the backhaul side of NT-BSs is responsible for training the parameter of a deep Q-network (DQN), and each UE independently makes its own access decisions based on the parameter from the trained DQN. With the proposed scheme, each UE is able to access a proper NT-BS intelligently to enhance the long-term system throughput and avoid frequent handovers among NT-BSs. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we justify the performance of the proposed scheme, and show its effectiveness in addressing the fundamental issues in the NTNs deployment.}

	abstract = {Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is a technique that improves spectral efficiency by allowing concurrent communication between one access point (AP) and multiple clients. In practice, the expected gain is not always achieved and is sometimes even negative. We experimentally demonstrate that the downlink MU-MIMO performance in a practical network not only depends on the client's channel but is also influenced by factors that are not captured by conventional models, such as client motion and device type. We propose a data-driven algorithm with a low computational complexity that determines whether a client should operate in MU mode and the MU-MIMO group for clients in MU mode. Such a mode and group selection algorithm is based on a sequence of channel state information (CSI), SNR, and client device type. The algorithm can automatically adapt to the motion and characteristics of individual clients. Experimental results using implementation on a commodity 802.11ac AP show that the proposed data-driven mode and group selection algorithm can improve network throughput by up to 35% over existing algorithms based on conventional models. We also show that the proposed data-driven algorithm has limited sensitivity to environmental changes and can be deployed into new environments without retraining.}

Each UE k spreads its data symbols over d k <; <; F sub-carriers. The performance of LDS-NOMA system depends on the allocation of the non-zero elements in the LDS-codes. We aim to identify the LDS resource allocations, based solely on pathlosses, that maximize the ergodic mutual information (EMI). This problem can be solved only via an exhaustive search. Thus, relying on analysis in the regime where F, K, and d k ,∀k converge to +∞ at the same rate, we present EMI as a deterministic equivalent plus a residual term. The deterministic equivalent is a function of pathloss values and LDS-codes, and the small residual term scales as O (1 / min(d k 2 )). First, we formulate an optimization problem to identify the resource allocations that maximize the deterministic equivalent of EMI. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions give a simple resource allocation rule that facilitates the construction of desired LDS-codes via an efficient partitioning algorithm. The finite-regime analysis shows that such sparse solutions additionally harness the small incremental gain inherent in the residual term, and thus, provides a near-optimal performance. The spectral efficiency enhancement relative to regular and random spreading is validated numerically.}

By taking into account the fairness among cell-edge users, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable rate of cell-edge users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BSs and the phase shifts at the IRS. As a compromise approach, we transform the non-convex max-min problem into an equivalent form based on the mean-square error method, which facilities the design of an efficient suboptimal iterative algorithm. In addition, we investigate two scenarios, namely the single-user system and the multiuser system. For the former scenario, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained based on the dual subgradient method, while the phase shift matrix is optimized based on the Majorization-Minimization method. For the latter scenario, the transmit beamforming matrix and phase shift matrix are obtained by the second-order cone programming and semidefinite relaxation techniques, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement achieved by deploying an IRS. Furthermore, the proposed JP-CoMP design significantly outperforms the conventional coordinated scheduling/coordinated beamforming coordinated multipoint (CS/CB-CoMP) design in terms of max-min rate.}

As increasing the density of base stations (BSs) and users that share the same spectrum, however, both inter-user-interference (IUI) and inter-cell interference (ICI) problems give rise to a significant loss in spectral efficiencies in such systems. To resolve this problem under the constraint of local channel state information per BS, in this paper, we present a novel noncooperative multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding technique, called signal-to-interference-pulse-leakage-pulse-noise-ratio (SILNR) maximization precoding. The key innovation of our distributed precoding method is to maximize the product of SILNRs of users per cell using local channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We show that our precoding technique only using local CSIT can asymptotically achieve the multi-cell cooperative bound attained by cooperative precoding using global CSIT in some cases. We also present a precoding algorithm that is robust to CSIT errors in multi-cell scenarios. By multi-cell system-level simulations, we demonstrate that our distributed precoding technique outperforms all existing noncooperative precoding methods considerably and can also achieve the multi-cell bound very tightly even with not-so-many antennas at BSs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a new framework for optimizing the resource allocation in a millimeter-wave-non-orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-NOMA) communication for crowded venues is proposed. MmWave communications suffer from severe blockage caused by obstacles such as the human body, especially in a dense region. Thus, a detailed method for modeling the blockage events in the in-venue scenarios is introduced. Also, several mmWave access points are considered in different locations. To maximize the network sum rate, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard in general. Hence, a three-stage low-complex solution is proposed to solve the problem. At first, a user scheduling algorithm, i.e., modified worst connection swapping (MWCS), is proposed. Secondly, the antenna allocation problem is solved using the simulated annealing algorithm. Afterward, to maximize the network sum rate and guarantee the quality of service constraints, a non-convex power allocation optimization problem is solved by adopting the difference of convex programming approach. The simulation results show that, under the blockage effect, the proposed mmWave-NOMA scheme performs on average 23% better than the conventional mmWave-orthogonal multiple access scheme. Moreover, the proposed solution's performance is close to the optimal value while reducing complexity by 96%.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a light fidelity (LiFi)-enabled bidirectional Internet of Things (IoT) communication system, where visible light and infrared light are used in the downlink and uplink, respectively. In order to efficiently improve the energy efficiency (EE) of the bidirectional LiFi-IoT system, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with a quality-of-service (QoS)-guaranteed optimal power allocation (OPA) strategy is applied to maximize the EE of both downlink and uplink channels. We derive closed-form OPA sets based on the identification of the optimal decoding orders in both downlink and uplink channels, which can enable low-complexity power allocation. Moreover, we propose an adaptive channel and QoS-based user pairing approach by jointly considering users’ channel gains and QoS requirements. We further analyze the EE and the user outage probability (UOP) performance of both downlink and uplink channels in the bidirectional LiFi-IoT system. Extensive analytical and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of NOMA with OPA in comparison to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA with typical channel-based power allocation strategies. It is also shown that the proposed adaptive channel and QoS-based user pairing approach greatly outperforms individual channel/QoS-based approaches, especially when users have diverse QoS requirements.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a joint iterative optimization based hybrid beamforming technique for massive MU-MIMO systems. The proposed technique jointly and iteratively optimizes the transmitter precoders and combiners, aiming to approach the global optimum solution for the system sum-rate maximization problem. The proposed technique develops an adaptive algorithm exploiting the stochastic gradients (SG) of the local beamformers and provides low-complexity closed-form solutions. Furthermore, an efficient adaptive scheme is developed based on the proposed adaptive algorithm and the closed-form solutions. The proposed algorithm requires the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) feedback from each user and a limited size transition vector to be exchanged between the transmitter and receivers at each step to update beamformers locally. Analytic result shows that the proposed adaptive algorithm achieves low-complexity when the array size is large and is able to converge within a small number of iterations. Simulation result shows that the proposed technique is able to achieve superior performance comparing to the existing state-of-art techniques. In addition, the knowledge of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is not required as the channels are also adaptively estimated with each coherence time which is a practical assumption since the CSI is usually unavailable or have time-varying nature in real-time applications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a low-latency virtual reality (VR) delivery system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base station (U-BS) is deployed to deliver VR content from a cloud server to multiple ground VR users. Each VR input data requested by the VR users can be either projected at the U-BS before transmission or processed locally at each user. Popular VR input data is cached at the U-BS to further reduce backhaul latency from the cloud server. For this system, we design a low-complexity iterative algorithm to minimize the maximum communications and computing latency among all VR users subject to the computing, caching and transmit power constraints, which is guaranteed to converge. Numerical results indicate that our proposed algorithm can achieve a lower latency compared to other benchmark schemes. Moreover, we observe that the maximum latency mainly comes from communication latency when the bandwidth resource is limited, while it is dominated by computing latency when computing capacity is low. In addition, we find that caching is helpful to reduce latency.}

	abstract = {Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) are two influential services of the emerging 5G cellular network. Latency and reliability are major concerns for uRLLC applications, whereas eMBB services claim for the maximum data rates. Owing to the trade-off among latency, reliability and spectral efficiency, sharing of radio resources between eMBB and uRLLC services, heads to a challenging scheduling dilemma. In this paper, we study the co-scheduling problem of eMBB and uRLLC traffic based upon the puncturing technique. Precisely, we formulate an optimization problem aiming to maximize the minimum expected achieved rate (MEAR) of eMBB user equipment (UE) while fulfilling the provisions of the uRLLC traffic. We decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, namely scheduling problem of eMBB UEs and uRLLC UEs while prevailing objective unchanged. Radio resources are scheduled among the eMBB UEs on a time slot basis, whereas it is handled for uRLLC UEs on a mini-slot basis. Moreover, for resolving the scheduling issue of eMBB UEs, we use penalty successive upper bound minimization (PSUM) based algorithm, whereas the optimal transportation model (TM) is adopted for solving the same problem of uRLLC UEs. Furthermore, a heuristic algorithm is also provided to solve the first sub-problem with lower complexity. Finally, the significance of the proposed approach over other baseline approaches is established through numerical analysis in terms of the MEAR and fairness scores of the eMBB UEs.}

	abstract = {NarrowBand-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new 3GPP radio access technology designed to provide better coverage for a massive number of low-throughput low-cost devices in delay-tolerant applications with low power consumption. To provide reliable connections with extended coverage, a repetition transmission scheme is introduced to NB-IoT during both Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure and data transmission procedure. To avoid the difficulty in replacing the battery for IoT devices, the energy harvesting is considered as a promising solution to support energy sustainability in the NB-IoT network. In this work, we analyze RACH success probability in a self-powered NB-IoT network taking into account the repeated preamble transmissions and collisions, where each IoT device with data is active when its battery energy is sufficient to support the transmission. We model the temporal dynamics of the energy level as a birth-death process, derive the energy availability of each IoT device, and examine its dependence on the energy storage capacity and the repetition value. We show that in certain scenarios, the energy availability remains unchanged despite randomness in the energy harvesting. We also derive the exact expression for the RACH success probability of a randomly chosen IoT device under the derived energy availability, which is validated under different repetition values via simulations. We show that the repetition scheme can efficiently improve the RACH success probability in a light traffic scenario, but only slightly improves that performance with very inefficient channel resource utilization in a heavy traffic scenario.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a traffic-aware flow migration approach, which reduces data plane load in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) during a network update. SDN update involves rerouting of multiple traffic flows to accommodate new flows. An unplanned flow migration schedule overloads the data plane by burdening the data links and flooding the rule-space of capacity-constrained SDN switches. The overload of data links and switches blocks the update process, and the network fails to address the Quality of Service (QoS) demands of the traffic flows, especially latency-sensitive flows. Prior approaches migrate flows without considering load reduction of the data plane along with QoS demands of the flows. In this work, we propose a load reduction strategy that prioritizes traffic flows based on QoS demands and aims to avoid link congestion and rule-space overflow during flow migration. The proposed scheme significantly reduces the maximum data link bandwidth usage. In particular, the maximum data link bandwidth usage is 13.22% less than the two-phase update approach.}

	abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) relaying is a concept, where some users relay data of cell-edge users (CUEs) experiencing a bad channel quality to a base station. While this research topic has received plenty of attention, a critical aspect of the D2D relaying remains a selfish nature of the users and their limited willingness to relay data for others. Thus, we propose a scheme to identify potential candidates for the relaying and provide a sound incentive to these relaying users (RUEs) to motivate them helping other users. First, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis showing when and if the relaying is beneficial for the CUE(s) and related RUE. Second, to choose among all possible incentive-compliant relaying options, we formulate the optimal CUE-to-RUE matching problem maximizing a network-wide performance. Since the optimal solution is hard to obtain for a high number of users, we propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm and prove its constant worst-case approximation guarantees to the optimum. Finally, we derive a closed-form expression for a fair allocation of the resources among the CUEs and the RUEs. The proposed framework more than doubles the users' capacity and/or reduces the energy consumption by up to 87% comparing to existing incentive-based relaying schemes.}

In this paper, we introduce radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting paradigm into WNCS framework for the first time in the literature. We study the optimal power control, energy harvesting and scheduling problem with the objective of providing maximum level of adaptivity under periodicity, delay and reliability requirements. We show that the power allocation problem is separable from the scheduling problem at optimality and provide the exact expression for optimal power control. The scheduling problem is then formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and proven to be NP-Hard. For the scheduling, we propose polynomial-time heuristic algorithms motivated by the analogy between scheduling sensor nodes with energy harvesting requirements over time units and jobs with sequence dependent setup times on identical machines. We prove the theoretical worst-case bound for the performance of these heuristics. We show via extensive simulations that the proposed algorithms perform close-to-optimal and significantly better than Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm in terms of adaptivity, delay, reliability and average runtime.}

However, most of the existing works either considered enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) payload communication or ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) control information communication. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation for the eMBB payload and URLLC control information communication multiplexing in a multi-UAV relay network. We firstly propose a multi-UAV relay model comprehensively considering path loss, small-scale channel fading and different quality of service requirements of eMBB and URLLC communications. Then we formulate the multiplexing problem as a joint user association, bandwidth and transmit power optimization problem to improve total transmission data rate and reduce power consumption. The solution of this problem is challenging due to different capacity characteristics of eMBB and URLLC communications, the coupling of continuous variables and integer variables, and the non-convexity. To mitigate these challenges, we equivalently decompose the original optimization problem into a URLLC problem and an eMBB problem. For the URLLC problem, we derive closed-form expressions of the optimal bandwidth and transmit power. For the eMBB problem, we develop an iterative solution framework of alternatively optimizing user association, bandwidth and transmit power.}

We develop a unified analytical framework and derive theoretical bounds for such a cache-enabled FR1-FR2 hybrid network under limited backhaul scenario to analyze the exact and approximate latency, average success probability of file delivery, and average data rate considering two open-access user association policies: i) location-based and ii) content-based association. Numerical results demonstrate that wireless edge caching (WEC) can improve the performance of hybrid wireless networks, albeit certain trade-offs, e.g., increasing cache-enabled SBSs cannot always improve the network performance and there exists an optimal SBS density that provides the best latency and throughput performance. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the network with respect to other key network design parameters such as cache size, content popularity, backhaul capacity, and blockages for both the user associations. Our results show that latency under content-based user association is less than that of location-based user association, and although the difference in the average rates under the two user associations is not obvious, content-based association can extricate more backhaul capacity and thus reduce installation cost significantly.}

In SDIoT, multiple controllers are deployed to enhance network scalability. With the growth of IoT, the number of devices is increasing rapidly. The management of control plane load is an essential issue for IoT networks because of the dynamic traffic characteristics. IoT traffic is highly dynamic due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices in terms of mobility, activation model, Quality of Service (QoS) demand, and flow generation rate. The challenge is to prevent controller overload and distribute traffic optimally under the consideration of heterogeneous IoT devices. The proposed scheme estimates control plane load based on the mobility and activation model of IoT devices. For mobility prediction, we use Order- m fallback Markov Predictor as it consumes less space and performs efficiently even for small values of m. Based on the prediction results, we implement a traffic-aware rule-caching mechanism and a master controller assignment scheme to reduce the control plane load. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the peak intensity of the control traffic by 23.08% and 16.67%, as compared to the considered benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {A novel dimming control scheme, termed as generalized dimming control (GDC), is proposed for visible light communication (VLC) systems. The basic idea of GDC is to exploit adaptively time, spatial and signal domain resources for enhancing communication performance under practical illumination constraints. In particular, to satisfy the illumination constraints, an incremental algorithm for index mapping is first proposed to achieve target optical power and uniform illumination. Next, GDC having the optimal activation pattern is investigated to improve the bit-error rate (BER) performance of VLC. In particular, the BER performance of GDC is analyzed using the union bound technique. Based on the analytical BER bound, the optimal activation pattern of GDC scheme having the minimum BER criterion (GDC-MBER) is obtained by exhaustively searching all conditional pairwise error probabilities. However, since GDC-MBER requires high search complexity, two low-complexity GDC schemes having the maximum free distance criterion (GDC-MFD) are proposed. The first low-complexity GDC-MFD scheme, termed as GDC-MFD1, is derived by a lower bound of the free distance using the Rayleigh-Ritz theorem. The second low-complexity GDC-MFD scheme, termed as GDC-MFD2, is proposed to reduce further the computation by exploiting the time-invariance characteristics of the VLC channel. Simulation and numerical results show that GDC-MBER, GDC-MFD1 and GDC-MFD2 have similar BER performance, and they can achieve more than 3 dB SNR gains compared with conventional dimming control schemes for a BER of 10 -4 and a dimming level of 50%.}

The physical layer builds upon DC-biased orthogonal frequency division multiple access. Channel state information at the physical layer serves as a performance indicator for better data rate opportunity while queue state information at medium access control layer provides the information about packet urgency. A packet based traffic arrival model is considered such that incoming packets with random inter arrival times join a separate queue dedicated to each user if the admission control accepts them, otherwise packets are dropped. We formulate and solve a stochastic cross-layer optimization problem to optimize the network resources under the constraints of queue stability and power to maximize the average system throughput. By using the Lyapunov optimization technique, we convert the long term time-average optimization problem into series of single time slot online problem. Then, we decompose the problem into independent sub problems and propose packet admission, resource (access point and subcarrier) allocation and power control solutions. We present simulation results to demonstrate the superiority of proposed scheme over existing solutions in the literature.}

	abstract = {Physical-layer security (PLS) has the potential to strongly enhance the overall system security as an alternative to or in combination with conventional cryptographic primitives usually implemented at higher network layers. Secret-key generation relying on wireless channel reciprocity is an interesting solution as it can be efficiently implemented at the physical layer of emerging wireless communication networks, while providing information-theoretic security guarantees. In this article, we investigate and compare the secret-key capacity based on the sampling of the entire complex channel state information (CSI) or only its envelope, the received signal strength (RSS). Moreover, as opposed to previous works, we take into account the fact that the eavesdropper's observations might be correlated and we consider the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime where we can find simple analytical expressions for the secret-key capacity. As already found in previous works, we find that RSS-based secret-key generation is heavily penalized as compared to CSI-based systems. At high SNR, we are able to precisely and simply quantify this penalty: a halved pre-log factor and a constant penalty of about 0.69 bit, which disappears as Eve's channel gets highly correlated.}

	abstract = {In a majority of research on covert communications, knowledge about channel state information (CSI) of main channel and/or warden channel is assumed to be known or partially known. However, a covert user may not afford to perform channel estimation in practice, and acquiring the warden's CSI is even impossible. In this paper, we investigate covert communications over non-coherent Rayleigh fading channels, in both i.i.d. fast fading and slow fading cases. We observe that the purpose of covert communication in many scenarios is to hide the existence of the sender, not the receiver. Therefore, we allow the receiver to work in full-duplex mode such that it can emit artificial noise (AN) while receiving signals simultaneously. We analyse the achievable covert rates with fixed and varying AN power and show that in both fast and slow fading cases, it is possible to achieve a positive covert rate. For the slow fading case, we further extend the proposed strategy to a multi-user scenario, in which multiple other users share the same spectral resource and cause interference at the warden. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the correctness of our analysis, which provide new insights on the AN design problem in non-coherent channels.}

	abstract = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided secure communication system is conceived and investigated, where the UAV transmits legitimate information to a ground user in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). To guarantee the security, the UAV employs a power splitting approach, where its transmit power can be divided into two parts for transmitting confidential messages and artificial noise (AN), respectively. We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power levels and the corresponding power splitting ratios allocated to different time slots during the whole flight time, subject to both the maximum UAV speed constraint, the total mobility energy constraint, the total transmit power constraint, and other related constraints. To efficiently tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm by blending the benefits of the block coordinate descent (BCD) method, the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Specially, we show that the proposed algorithm exhibits very low computational complexity and each of its updating steps can be formulated in a nearly closed form. Besides, it can be easily extended to the case of three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. Our simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {The secrecy capacity based on the assumption of having continuous distributions for the input signals constitutes one of the fundamental metrics for the existing physical layer security (PHYS) solutions. However, the input signals of real-world communication systems obey discrete distributions. Furthermore, apart from the capacity, another ultimate performance metric of a communication system is its symbol error ratio (SER). In this article, we pursue a radically new approach to PHYS by considering rigorous direct SER optimization exploiting the discrete nature of practical modulated signals. Specifically, we propose a secure precoding technique based on a multi-objective SER criterion, which aims for minimizing the confidential messages' SER at their legitimate user, while maximizing the SER of the confidential messages leaked to the illegitimate user. The key to this challenging multi-objective optimization problem is to introduce a priority factor that controls the priority of directly minimizing the SER of the legitimate user against directly maximizing the SER of the leaked confidential messages. Furthermore, we define a new metric termed as the security-level, which is related to the conditional symbol error probability of the confidential messages leaked to the illegitimate user. Additionally, we also introduce the secure discrete-input continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity referred to as secure-DCMC-capacity, which serves as a classical security metric of the confidential messages, given a specific discrete modulation scheme. The impacts of both the channel's Rician factor and the correlation factor of antennas on the security-level and the secure-DCMC-capacity are investigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed priority-aware secure precoding based on the direct SER metric is capable of securing transmissions, even in the challenging scenario, where the eavesdropper has three receive antennas, while the legitimate user only has a single one.}

	abstract = {This paper employs hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to assist the cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for secure transmission in Internet of Things networks where the security-required (SR) users with high-security requirements and quality of services (QoS)-sensitive (QS) users with real-time process requirements are paired to perform NOMA for increasing the network connectivity. In addition, the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) is considered at both legitimate users and eavesdropper for providing a realistic analysis. The closed-form expressions for the connection outage probability (COP), the secrecy transmission probability (RSP), and effective secrecy throughput (EST) of the SR user are derived in the proposed lightweight but efficient randomized retransmission scheme (RRS). As benchmarks, the secrecy performances of the fixed retransmission scheme (FRS) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme are also investigated. Besides, the asymptotic secrecy analysis is given to gain a better insight into secrecy performance. The analytical results developed in the paper demonstrate that HARQ is beneficial to secrecy transmission and the RRS outperforms or equals to the FRS and OMA scheme when the transmit power and secrecy coding redundancy is sufficiently high.}

	abstract = {Proactive tile-based video streaming can avoid motion-to-photon latency of wireless virtual reality (VR) by computing and delivering the predicted tiles to be requested before playback. All existing works either focus on designing predictors or allocating computing and communications resources. Yet to avoid the latency, the successively executed prediction, communication, and computing tasks should be accomplished within a predetermined time. Moreover, the quality of experience (QoE) of proactive VR streaming depends on the worst performance of the three tasks. In this paper, we jointly optimize the duration of the observation window for predicting tiles and the durations for computing and transmitting the predicted tiles, aimed at balancing the performance for three tasks to maximize the QoE given arbitrary predictor and configured resources. We obtain the closed-form optimal solution by decomposing the formulated problem equivalently into two subproblems. With the optimized durations, we find a resource-limited region where the QoE increases rapidly with configured resources, and a prediction-limited region where the QoE can be improved more efficiently with a better predictor. Simulation results using three existing predictors and a real dataset validate the analysis and demonstrate the gain from the joint optimization over non-optimized counterparts.}

	abstract = {Through field experiments, we observed a varying instantaneous charging capacity of the energy buffer with respect to the dynamic intensity of the incident RF signal in the RF energy harvesting system (RF-EHS). The dependency of charging capacity on the incident power of RF signal challenges existing RF energy harvesting models that assume constant charging capacity. In order to accurately describe the energy harvesting process in the real system, we propose a new energy clamp model. The new model reveals that RF intensity higher than the sensitivity of the harvester circuit cannot always guarantee successful energy reception, especially when the energy level of energy buffer is high while the intensity of the incident power is relatively weak. In order to improve the efficiencies of energy harvest and energy utilization in an RF-EHS, we develop new offline (i.e., non-causal) optimal and online (i.e., causal) suboptimal data transmission strategies based on the energy clamp model. Simulation results show that the new strategy can considerably improve the throughput after taking into account the varying instantaneous charging capacity caused by the dynamic RF power density in the air.}

We perform a comprehensive investigation on various aspects of this problem. First, when users have sufficient transmit powers, we present a new sufficient condition guaranteeing arbitrary information rate constraints. This result strengthens the feasibility condition in existing literature. Then, we design novel penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based and nonlinear equality constrained alternative direction method of multipliers (neADMM) based solutions to tackle the IRS-dependent-QoS-constraints, which effectively solve the feasibility check and power minimization problems. Besides, we further extend our proposals to the cases where channel status information (CSI) is imperfect and develop an online stochastic algorithm that satisfy QoS constraints stochastically without requiring prior knowledge of CSI errors.

This reduction is bought at the cost of introducing precoder redundancy, which results in some throughput loss and additional precoding/decoding complexity. When the goal is to meet some spectral emission mask constraints, it is desirable to avoid unnecessary sidelobe suppression in order to keep precoder redundancy at a minimum. In this context, we introduce a general framework under which we develop a novel Lagrange multiplier-based mask-compliant orthogonal precoder design targeting minimal redundancy. We also adapt to this framework two previously proposed designs based on spectral notches and minimum out-of-band emission, respectively, to explicitly incorporate mask constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed designs under different practical masks for multicarrier wireless systems.}

	abstract = {The access point (AP) deployment is a fundamental task for constructing an accurate localization system. Existing literature mainly deals with the AP placement problem using optimal geometry analysis since the target-AP geometry will affect the localization performance. However, some non-ideal phenomena in practical scenario, e.g., the existence of obstacles, array orientation and path loss, will degrade the accuracy of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as well as the localization accuracy. In this article, we reformulate the AP planning incorporating these factors. We decompose the problem into two subproblems, namely AP selection problem and error minimization problem. The AP selection problem selects the minimum number of APs to satisfy a desired localization accuracy, aided by a refined orientation updating procedure. We design a centralized and a distributed error minimization algorithm to further decrease the localization error. The centralized algorithm shows superiority in time efficiency. Nevertheless, the case with large number of APs may lead to excessive computational cost. Accordingly, we further devise the distributed algorithm which is adaptive to large-scale deployment. Numerical studies in indoor environments with barriers are conducted to verify our proposed approach.}

Particularly, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and two orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), are studied. The objective is to maximize the system average sum rate for the delay-tolerant transmission. We propose two adjustment schemes, namely, dynamic phase adjustment and one-time phase adjustment. The power budget, minimum average data rate, and discrete unit modulus reflection coefficient are considered as constrains. To solve the problem, two phase shifters adjustment algorithms with low complexity are proposed to obtain near optimal solutions. With given phase shifters and satisfaction of time-sharing condition, the optimal resource allocations are obtained using the Lagrangian dual decomposition. The numerical results reveal that: i) the average sum rate of proposed NOMA network aided by IRS outperforms the conventional NOMA network over fading channels; ii) with continuous IRS adjustment in the fading block, the proposed TDMA scheme performs better than the FDMA scheme; iii) increasing the minimum average user rate requirement has less impact on the proposed IRS-NOMA system than on the IRS-OMA system.}

A practical mMIMO relay, however, due to limited antenna spacing and the use of cost-effective equipment, usually experiences spatially-correlated channels and hardware impairments, respectively. We consider a hardware-impaired two-way full-duplex (FD) spatially-correlated mMIMO relaying with multiple MIMO FD user-pairs, and derive a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression which is valid for a practical number of finite relay antennas. We use this expression to develop a quadratic transformation approach to optimize the non-convex global energy efficiency (GEE) and weighted sum energy efficiency (WSEE) metrics, which are fractional functions of optimization variables. The proposed approach first converts the fractional problem into its equivalent fraction-free counterpart, and then uses novel transformations to make the problem concave, and solve it using an iterative algorithm. We use this optimization to i) investigate the impact of spatial correlation and hardware impairments on GEE; ii) decide hardware impairment values for a tolerable reduction in GEE; and iii) investigate the impact of weights in WSEE on the users energy efficiency.}

An optimization problem is formulated under practical channel models to maximize the minimum achievable expected rate among all pairs of ground nodes by jointly designing UAVs' three-dimensional (3D) placement as well as the bandwidth-and-power allocation. This problem, however, is non-convex and thus difficult to solve. As such, we propose a new method, called iterative Gibbs-sampling and block- coordinate-descent (IGS-BCD), to efficiently obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution by synergizing the advantages of both the deterministic (BCD) and stochastic (GS) optimization methods. Specifically, our proposed method alternates between two optimization phases until convergence is reached, namely, one phase that uses the BCD method to find locally-optimal UAVs' 3D placement and the other phase that leverages the GS method to generate new UAVs' 3D placement for exploration. Moreover, we present an efficient method for properly initializing UAVs' placement that leads to faster convergence of the proposed IGS-BCD algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed IGS-BCD and initialization methods outperform the conventional BCD or GS method alone in terms of convergence-and-performance trade-off, as well as other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Algebraic codes such as BCH code are receiving renewed interest as their short block lengths and low/no error floors make them attractive for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G wireless networks. This article aims at enhancing the traditional adaptive belief propagation (ABP) decoding, which is a soft-in-soft-out (SISO) decoding for high-density parity-check (HDPC) algebraic codes, such as Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, and product codes. The key idea of traditional ABP is to sparsify certain columns of the parity-check matrix corresponding to the least reliable bits with small log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) values. This sparsification strategy may not be optimal when some bits have large LLR magnitudes but wrong signs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Perturbed ABP (P-ABP) to incorporate a small number of unstable bits with large LLRs into the sparsification operation of the parity-check matrix. In addition, we propose to apply partial layered scheduling or hybrid dynamic scheduling to further enhance the performance of P-ABP. Simulation results show that our proposed decoding algorithms lead to improved error correction performances and faster convergence rates than the prior-art ABP variants.}

	abstract = {In this article, we study the problem of latency and reliability trade-off in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in the presence of decoding complexity constraints. We consider linear block encoded codewords transmitted over a binary-input AWGN channel and decoded with order-statistic (OS) decoder. We first investigate the performance of OS decoders as a function of decoding complexity and propose an empirical model that accurately quantifies the corresponding trade-off. Next, a consistent way to compute the aggregate latency for complexity constrained receivers is presented, where the latency due to decoding is also included. It is shown that, with strict latency requirements, decoding latency cannot be neglected in complexity constrained receivers. Next, based on the proposed model, several optimization problems, relevant to the design of URLLC systems, are introduced and solved. It is shown that the decoding time has a drastic effect on the design of URLLC systems when constraints on decoding complexity are considered. Finally, it is also illustrated that the proposed model can closely describe the performance versus complexity trade-off for other candidate coding solutions for URLLC such as tail-biting convolutional codes, polar codes, and low-density parity-check codes.}

	abstract = {Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising candidate for the next generation non-volatile memory technology due to its simple read/write operations and high storage density. However, its crossbar array structure causes a severe interference effect known as the “sneak path.” In this paper, we propose channel coding techniques that can mitigate both the sneak-path interference and the channel noise. The main challenge is that the sneak-path interference is data-dependent, and also correlated within a memory array, and hence the conventional error correction coding scheme will be inadequate. In this work, we propose an across-array coding strategy that assigns a codeword to multiple independent memory arrays, and exploit a real-time channel estimation scheme to estimate the instantaneous status of the ReRAM channel. Since the coded bits from different arrays experience independent channels, a “diversity” gain can be obtained during decoding, and when the codeword is adequately distributed over different memory arrays, the code actually performs as that over an uncorrelated channel. By performing decoding based on the scheme of treating-interference-as-noise (TIN), the ReRAM channel over different memory arrays is equivalent to a block varying channel we defined, for which we propose both the capacity bounds and a coding scheme. The proposed coding scheme consists of a serial concatenation of an optimized error correction code with a data shaper, which enables the ReRAM system to achieve a near capacity limit storage efficiency.}

This class of codes enjoy several advantages such as flexible code rate adjustment by varying the coupling ratio and the encoding and decoding architectures of the underlying component codes can remain unchanged. For this work, we first provide the construction methods for partially coupled turbo codes with coupling memory m and study the corresponding graph models. We then derive the density evolution equations for the corresponding ensembles on the binary erasure channel to precisely compute their iterative decoding thresholds. Rate-compatible designs and their decoding thresholds are also provided, where the coupling and puncturing ratios are jointly optimized to achieve the largest decoding threshold for a given target code rate. Our results show that for a wide range of code rates, the proposed codes attain close-to-capacity performance and the decoding performance improves with increasing the coupling memory. In particular, the proposed partially parity-coupled turbo codes have thresholds within 0.0002 of the BEC capacity for rates ranging from 1/3 to 9/10, yielding an attractive way for constructing rate-compatible capacity-approaching channel codes.}

By considering realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI), we formulate a joint task offloading and power allocation problem for minimizing the total energy consumption, including both computation and communication power consumptions. We solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem in two steps. First, we solve the computational task allocation and computational resource allocation for a given power allocation. Then, we conceive a sequential optimization framework for determining the specific power allocation decision that minimizes the total energy consumption of the fog access node. Given the computational tasks, the computational resources, and the power allocation, we propose an iterative algorithm for the system optimization.

	abstract = {We consider distributed and dynamic caching of coded content at small base stations (SBSs) in an area served by a macro base station (MBS). Specifically, content is encoded using a maximum distance separable code and cached according to a time-to-live (TTL) cache eviction policy, which allows coded packets to be removed from the caches at periodic times. Mobile users requesting a particular content download coded packets from SBSs within communication range. If additional packets are required to decode the file, these are downloaded from the MBS. We formulate an optimization problem that is efficiently solved numerically, providing TTL caching policies minimizing the overall network load. We demonstrate that distributed coded caching using TTL caching policies can offer significant reductions in terms of network load when request arrivals are bursty. We show how the distributed coded caching problem utilizing TTL caching policies can be analyzed as a specific single cache, convex optimization problem. Our problem encompasses static caching and the single cache as special cases. We prove that, interestingly, static caching is optimal under a Poisson request process, and that for a single cache the optimization problem has a surprisingly simple solution.}

We analyze how SWIPT affects ALSI and establish the condition for ALSI to converge when there is no energy buffer. Unlike ALSI in TWFD relaying without SWIPT (Chang et al., 2019), ALSI in TWFD relaying with SWIPT always converges and does not grow unbounded. In addition, we study the delay performance in such a system under AF and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols. In AF protocol, the condition for successful signal transmissions is provided. When that condition is met, the received signals at the relay can always get through the channels but experience delays. Otherwise, the outage event occurs. In DF protocol, the best-effort scenario (having no energy buffer) and the QoS scenario (having energy buffer) are discussed. The probability of successful transmissions and the distribution of the delay in both scenarios are derived. Simulation results of DF protocol show that the best-effort scenario is suitable for the delay-tolerant service and the QoS scenario is suitable for the delay-sensitive service. Furthermore, AF protocol is more suitable for the service with less QoS demanding.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) technologies play an important role in modern and future wireless communication systems as they can improve the capacity without increasing the bandwidth. MIMO detection is one of the key technologies for MIMO system designs. MIMO detection schemes based on Message Passing (MP) algorithms have attracted extensive attention in recent years. The MIMO detection scheme based on Expectation Propagation (EP), which is also a kind of MP algorithms, has been proved to achieve the Bayes-optimal performance under the conditions of large system limit and compression rate threshold. However, there is improvement space for the detection performance of the EP algorithm when the conditions are not satisfied, which are the common cases in the practical applications. In this paper, when the conditions of the large system limit and compression rate threshold are not satisfied, we analyze the influences of two factors, the initial parameters selection and the moment matching strategy, on the performance of EP based detection scheme. As a result, we propose an improved EP detection scheme based on optimizing the two factors. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the original EP detection scheme in different MIMO scenarios.}

While each client wants a subset of the data chunks and already has another subset as its side information, the server transmits some (uncoded or coded) chunks to the clients over a noiseless broadcast channel. The objective of the problem is to satisfy the demands of all clients with the minimum number of transmissions. This paper investigates the index coding setting from a game-theoretical perspective. We consider selfish clients, where each selfish client has private side information and a private valuation of each data chunk it wants. In this context, our objectives are following: 1) to motivate each selfish client to reveal the correct side information and true valuation of each data chunk it wants; 2) to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the total valuation of the data chunks recovered by the clients minus the total cost incurred by the transmissions from the server. Our main contribution is to jointly develop coding and incentive schemes for achieving the first objective perfectly and achieving the second objective optimally or approximately with guaranteed approximation ratios (potentially within some restricted sets of coding matrices).}

	abstract = {In this article, a two-user scenario of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based mobile edge computing (MEC) network is investigated. By treating the users and the MEC server as leader and follower , respectively, a Stackelberg game is formulated. More specifically, the leader tends to minimize the total energy consumption for task offloading and local computing by optimizing the task assignment coefficients and transmit power. On the other side, the follower aims to minimize the total execution time by allocating different computational resources for processing the offloaded tasks. In order to solve the formulated problem, the Stackelberg equilibrium is considered. Based on the given insights, a closed-form solution of the follower level problem is obtained and included in the leader level one. Furthermore, by analyzing the leader’s strategies, the leader level problem is solved through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and closed-form expressions for the optimal task assignment coefficients and offloading time, are derived. Finally, this work is extended to the multi-user scenario, where a matching-based user pairing algorithm is proposed to assign users into different sub-channels. Simulation results indicate that: i) the derived closed-form solutions and the proposed user pairing algorithm can significantly improve energy efficiency; ii) the different task assignment strategies can be dynamically implemented to handle the varying wireless environment.}

In particular, assuming ideal pulse shaping filters at the transceiver, we derive the impacts of windowing on the effective channel and its estimation performance in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the total average transmit power, and the effective noise covariance matrix. When the channel state information (CSI) is available at the transceiver, we analyze the minimum squared error (MSE) of data detection and propose an optimal transmitter window to minimize the detection MSE. The proposed optimal transmitter window can be interpreted as a mercury/water-filling power allocation scheme, where the mercury is firstly filled before pouring water to pre-equalize the time-frequency (TF) domain channels. When the CSI is not available at the transmitter but can be estimated at the receiver, we propose to apply a Dolph-Chebyshev (DC) window at either the transmitter or the receiver, which can effectively enhance the sparsity of the effective channel in the DD domain. Thanks to the enhanced DD domain channel sparsity, the channel spread due to the fractional Doppler is significantly reduced, which leads to a lower error floor in both channel estimation and data detection compared with that of rectangular window. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the obtained analytical results and confirm the superiority of the proposed window designs in improving the channel estimation and data detection performance over the conventional rectangular window design.}

	abstract = {Consider a multi-cell mobile edge computing network, in which each user wishes to compute the product of a user-generated data matrix with a network-stored matrix. This is done through task offloading by means of input uploading, distributed computing at edge nodes (ENs), and output downloading. Task offloading may suffer long delay since servers at some ENs may be straggling due to random computation time, and wireless channels may experience severe fading and interference. This paper aims to investigate the interplay among upload, computation, and download latencies during the offloading process in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime from an information-theoretic perspective. A policy based on cascaded coded computing and on coordinated and cooperative interference management in uplink and downlink is proposed and proved to be approximately optimal for a sufficiently large upload time. By investing more time in uplink transmission, the policy creates data redundancy at the ENs, which can reduce the computation time, by enabling the use of coded computing, as well as the download time via transmitter cooperation. Moreover, the policy allows computation time to be traded for download time. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed policy can improve over existing schemes by significantly reducing the end-to-end execution time.}

In particular, we transform the decoding condition of transmission scheme w.r.t. phase duration into the achievable DoF region w.r.t. achievable DoF, through achievable DoF tuple expression connecting phase duration and achievable DoF. As a result, the DoF region of order-2 messages is characterized and an achievable DoF region of order-1 messages is completely expressed. Besides, for order-1 messages, we derive the sufficient condition, under which the proposed achievable DoF region is the DoF region.}

	abstract = {Coded distributed computing (CDC) can alleviate the communication load in distributed computing systems by leveraging coding opportunities via redundant computation. While the optimal computation-communication tradeoff has been well studied for homogeneous systems, it remains largely unknown for heterogeneous systems where workers have different computation capabilities. This paper characterizes the upper and lower bounds of the optimal communication load as two linear programming problems for a general heterogeneous CDC system using the MapReduce framework. Our achievable scheme first designs a parametric data shuffling strategy for any given mapping strategy, and then jointly optimizes the mapping strategy and the data shuffling strategy to obtain the upper bound. The parametric data shuffling strategy allows adjusting the size of the multicast message intended for each worker set, so that it can largely decrease the number of unicast messages and hence increase the communication efficiency. Numerical results show that our achievable communication load is lower than those achieved in existing works. Our lower bound is established by unifying an improved cut-set bound and a peeling method. The obtained upper and lower bounds degenerate to the existing result in homogeneous systems, and coincide with each other when the system is approximately homogeneous or grouped homogeneous.}

	abstract = {We investigate a K-user parallel packet-erasure broadcast channel. There is an ongoing effort to harness millimeter-wave bands, which are known to be unstable having high outage probabilities, by combining them with stable legacy bands. Motivated by this effort, we consider a heterogeneous scenario in which the parallel subchannels are categorized into two classes having different outage probabilities. For the two-user case, we characterize the sum capacity by developing an explicit achievable scheme and deriving a matching upper bound. In contrast to suboptimal schemes that apply coding on a per-subchannel basis only, our scheme applies coding across subchannels to exploit coding opportunities that arise from asymmetric outage probabilities more efficiently, thereby achieving optimality. By extending our scheme systematically to be applicable for the K-user case, we show that it can provide significant gains over existing schemes. Compared to the K-user scheme currently employed in practice, which allocates chunks of subchannels to users exclusively, we demonstrate the performance improvement attainable by our scheme to be substantial, as the multiplicative gain scales with K. Moreover, we find that our scheme outperforms a per-subchannel extension of state-of-the-art K-user schemes by large margins, further reducing the optimality gap. Our results suggest a potential coding scheme that can be employed in future wireless systems to meet ever-growing mobile data demands.}

	abstract = {Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has been recently proposed for high-rate data services. In underwater scenarios, the channel conditions are complicated due to various effects of the water waves, such as absorption, scattering and turbulence, which exhibit different statistical properties with diverse water types. Such capricious phenomena make channel estimation (CE) and signal detection (SD) become challenging issues for high-rate and reliable transmissions. To address these challenges, we devise a deep learning (DL) based joint channel classification (CC), CE and SD scheme for UWOC systems. Different from existing systems, where CE is typically an independent and fundamental module, we combine CE with SD by utilizing a new deep neural network (DNN). Furthermore, the proposed scheme exploits the channel characteristics extracted through an offline training powered by a new robust DNN channel classifier (CC), which can identify and classify the water types online to produce optimized estimated combinational weights (ECW) for improving the CE/SD performances under time-varying UWOC channels. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in terms of link performances in various UWOC channel environments.}

In this article, a multi-cell massive multi-input-multi-output system is considered, where locations of base stations are distributed as a Poisson point process. Assuming probabilistic caching, average success probability (ASP) of the system is derived for a known content popularity (CP) profile, which in practice is time-varying and unknown in advance. Further, modeling CP variations across time as a Markov process, reinforcement Q-learning is employed to learn the optimal content placement strategy to optimize the long-term-discounted ASP and average cache refresh rate. In the Q-learning, the number of Q-updates are large and proportional to the number of states and actions. To reduce the space complexity and update requirements towards scalable Q-learning, two novel (linear and non-linear) function approximations-based Q-learning approaches are proposed, where only a constant (4 and 3 respectively) number of variables need updation, irrespective of the number of states and actions. Convergence of these approximation-based approaches are analyzed. Simulations verify that these approaches converge and successfully learn the similar best content placement, which shows the successful applicability and scalability of the proposed approximated Q-learning schemes.}

In this paper, by leveraging distributed massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO) together with machine learning, a novel machine learning based framework solution is proposed to address the preamble collision problem in GFRA. The key idea is to identify and employ the neighboring access points (APs) of a collided RA UE for its data decoding rather than all the APs, so that the mutual interference among collided RA UEs can be effectively mitigated. To this end, we first design a tailored deep neural network (DNN) to enable the preamble multiplicity estimation in GFRA, where an energy detection (ED) method is also proposed for performance comparison. With the estimated preamble multiplicity, we then propose a K-means AP clustering algorithm to cluster the neighboring APs of collided RA UEs and organize each AP cluster to decode the received data individually. Simulation results show that a decent performance of preamble multiplicity estimation in terms of accuracy and reliability can be achieved by the proposed DNN, and confirm that the proposed schemes are effective in preamble collision resolution in GFRA, which are able to achieve a near-optimal performance in terms of uplink achievable rate per collided RA UE, and offer significant performance improvement over traditional schemes.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel antenna clustering-based method for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) full-duplex (FD) system. For a point-to-point communication set up, the proposed method enables a wireless device with multiple antennas to simultaneously transmit information and harvest energy using the same time-frequency resources. And the energy transmitting device with multiple antennas simultaneously receives information from the energy harvesting (EH) device. This is achieved by clustering the antennas into two MIMO subsystems: one for information transmission (IT) and another for EH. Furthermore, the self-interference (SI) signal at the EH device caused by the FD mode of operation is harvested by the device. For implementation-friendly antenna clustering and MIMO precoding, we propose two methods: (i) a sub-optimal method based on relaxation of objective function in a combinatorial optimization problem, and (ii) a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method. For the proposed DRL solution, we design a hybrid discrete/continuous action agent that jointly clusters the MIMO antennas between EH and IT, and at the same time, find the best values for MIMO precoding matrices at both devices. This is achieved by using two interacting agent learning subsystems, namely, deep double Q-learning (DDQN), for antenna clustering and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), for MIMO precoding. The effect of imperfect CSI is also studied and investigated. Finally, we study the performances of the two implementation methods and compare them with the conventional time switching-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. Our findings show that the proposed MIMO clustering-based SWIPT method gives a significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared to the time switching-based SWIPT method. In particular, the DRL-based method provides the highest spectral efficiency. Besides, the numerical results show that, for the considered system set up, the number of antennas in each device should exceed three to mitigate self-interference to an acceptable level.}

We aim to maximize the downlink sum rate by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) placement of the UAV, beam pattern and transmit power. To address this problem, we first transform the non-convex problem into a total path loss minimization problem, and hence the optimal 3D placement of the UAV can be achieved via standard convex optimization techniques. Then, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) based algorithm is presented for the shaped-beam pattern synthesis of an antenna array. Finally, by transforming the original problem into an optimal power allocation problem under the fixed 3D placement of the UAV and beam pattern, we derive the closed-form expression of transmit power based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In addition, inspired by fraction programming (FP), we propose a FP-based suboptimal algorithm to achieve a near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant performance gain in terms of sum rate for all IoT devices, as compared with orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme.}

	abstract = {To support massive access for future wireless networks, we propose a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced downlink multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) symbiotic radio (SR) system. In the proposed system, each RIS not only enhances the primary transmission from the primary transmitter (PT) to the associated primary receiver (PR) nearby, but also acts as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device to enable IoT transmissions to the same PR. Therefore, each PR needs to jointly decode the information from both the PT and its corresponding RIS. We are interested in maximizing the weighted sum-rate of both primary and IoT transmissions by jointly designing the active transmit beamforming at PT and the passive beamforming at each RIS under the maximum transmit power constraint at the PT and various constraints on the reflection coefficients (RCs), which include the ideal, continuous-phase and the discrete-phase cases. The formulated problem is non-convex, which cannot be solved directly. Thus, fractional programming (FP) method and alternating optimization (AO) technique are adopted to tackle the problem. In particular, three low-complexity algorithms are proposed to trade off between computational complexity and convergence rate. Compared to different benchmark schemes, simulation results demonstrate that with the aid of the RISs, the PRs can benefit from the enhanced primary transmission from the PT, and receive information from the associated RISs via IoT transmission.}

This paper develops algorithms for computing the optimal power allocation to achieve the maximal network throughput subject to residual self-interference (RSI) at the non-ideal full-duplex sources. As a generalization of a time-division duplex (TDD) scheme, we consider a three-phase CMA (3P-CMA) scheme which treats the TDD scheme as a special case. The throughput of the 3P-CMA scheme consistently exceeds that of the TDD scheme regardless of the RSI power gain. Also shown in this paper is a semi-closed form of the optimal power allocation when the three-phases are constrained to be identical, i.e., resulting in a one-phase CMA (1P-CMA) scheme. The optimal power allocation of the 1P-CMA scheme takes much less time to compute, and its network throughout is close to that of the 3P-CMA scheme when the RSI power gain is low.}

In this paper, we study a 2-step random access approach that uses code division multiple access (CDMA) to form multiple channels for data packet transmissions with a spreading factor less than the number of channels. As a result, the length of data transmission phase in 2-step random access can be shorter at the cost of multiuser interference. To see how the decrease of the length of data transmission phase can improve the spectral efficiency, we derive the throughput as well as the spectral efficiency. From the results of analysis, we can show that the 2-step CDMA-based random access approach can have a higher spectral efficiency than conventional 2-step approach with orthogonal channel allocations, which means that the performance of MTC can be improved by successfully transmitting more data packets per unit time using CDMA. This is also confirmed by simulation results.}

	abstract = {Distributed scheduling is an attractive approach for the Multiple-Access Channel (MAC). However, when a subset of the users access the channel simultaneously, distributed rate coordination is necessary, and is a major challenge, since the achievable rate of each user highly depends on the channels of other active users. That is, given a detection technique, e.g., Zero-Forcing (ZF), the rate at which a user can transmit depends on the channels other transmitting users have, a knowledge which is usually unavailable in distributed schemes. Fixing a rate and accepting some outage probability when this rate is too high is common practice in these cases. In this paper, we analyze the outage probability of a distributed, asymptotically optimal threshold-based scheduling algorithm under ZF. We rigorously evaluate the distribution of the relevant projections and give upper and lower bounds on the outage probability as a function of the algorithm parameters. At the limit of a large number of users, the bounds match, resulting in the true asymptotic characterization of the outage probability.}

Unlike previous works, we adopt radio frequency (RF) and free space optical for the aerial-terrestrial and satellite-aerial links, respectively. Specifically, by assuming that imperfect angular information (IAI) of each UE is known at the HAP, we develop a space division multiple access (SDMA) scheme to maximize the ergodic sum rate (ESR). To this end, we first exploit the IAI to calculate the analytical expression of channel correlation matrix. Then, by considering the limitation of array freedom, we propose a subspace-based UE grouping and scheduling scheme to cluster all UEs into groups. Next, we present a computationally effective beamforming (BF) scheme for each UE at HAP to efficiently implement SDMA in the RF link. Furthermore, a closed-form expression for the ESR of the SATN is derived to validate the proposed BF and SDMA schemes. Finally, simulation results corroborate the derived theoretical formulas and reveal the impacts of array size, angular estimation error, the number of UEs and scheduling threshold on the system performance.}

	abstract = {Content caching is recognized as a promising solution to release the heavy burden of backhaul links and decrease the content transmission latency in Fog radio access networks (Fog-RANs). However, the content caching design is still a challenging problem with considering the user request patterns, the content delivery strategies, and the limited caching capacity. Recommendation has the capability of reshaping users' content requests for further prompting caching gain. The joint recommendation, caching, beamforming holds the potential to improve the system performance of Fog-RANs. In this paper, a joint recommendation, caching, and beamforming scheme is proposed for multi-cell multi-antenna recommendation aware Fog-RANs. Aiming at minimizing the content transmission latency, we formulate a joint recommendation, caching, and beamforming optimization problem. The minimization problem is a very challenging two-timescale mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is hard to solve in general. By exploring structural properties of the problem, we propose an alternative optimization algorithm with low complexity through decomposing the original problem into three sub-problems. Extensive simulations show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the content transmission delay.}

	abstract = {The soaring mobile data traffic demands have spawned the innovative concept of mobile edge caching in ultra-dense next-generation networks, which mitigates their heavy traffic burden. We conceive cooperative content sharing between base stations (BSs) for improving the exploitation of the limited storage of a single edge cache. We formulate the cooperative caching problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) based multi-agent decision problem, which jointly optimizes the costs of fetching contents from the local BS, from the nearby BSs and from the remote servers. To solve this problem, we devise a multi-agent actor-critic framework, where a communication module is introduced to extract and share the variability of the actions and observations of all BSs. To beneficially exploit the spatio-temporal differences of the content popularity, we harness a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) for estimating the time-variant popularity distribution in each BS. Based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, we conceive a cooperative edge caching algorithm where the BSs operate cooperatively, since the distributed decision making of each agent depends on both the local and the global states. Our experiments conducted within a large scale cellular network having numerous BSs reveal that the proposed algorithm relying on the collaboration of BSs substantially improves the benefits of edge caches.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates online decentralized cache strategy design in multi-cell networks without the knowledge of user preference. The goal is to minimize the cumulative transmission delay of multi-cell networks within a finite time interval. Each small base station (SBS) aims to decide on its own cache action autonomously based on its past observations and limited information transmitted from other SBSs without a central controller. To coordinate the cache actions of different SBSs in a decentralized manner, we first propose an ϵ-calibration learning algorithm for each SBS to predict the cache strategy of other SBSs in real-time, which can progressively improve the accuracy in cache action prediction. Then a decentralized multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) algorithm is developed for each SBS to decide its own cache strategy based jointly on its past observations and estimated upcoming cache action of other SBSs. This decentralized MAMAB algorithm with ϵ-calibration enables multiple SBSs to converge to a reasonable joint cache action and realize a cooperative cache decision making in a decentralized manner with limited information exchange. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed decentralized caching algorithm outperforms other decentralized caching algorithms and can rapidly approach towards the centralized caching solutions.}

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted lots of attention because of their high mobility and low cost. This article investigates a communication system assisted by multiple UAV-mounted base stations (BSs), aiming to minimize the number of required UAVs and to improve the coverage rate by optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) positions of UAVs, user clustering, and frequency band allocation. Compared with the existing works, the constraints of the required quality of service (QoS) and the service ability of each UAV are considered, which makes the problem more challenging. A three-step method is developed to solve the formulated mixed-integer programming problem. First, to ensure that each UAV can serve more number of users, the maximum service radius of UAVs is derived according to the required minimum power of the received signals for the users. Second, an algorithm based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed to minimize the number of required UAVs. Third, the 3D position and the frequency band of each UAV are designed to increase the power of the target signals and to reduce the interference. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution for UAV-assisted communication systems.}

	abstract = {Cache-aided wireless device-to-device (D2D) networks have demonstrated more promising performance improvement for video distribution than conventional distribution methods; thus, understanding the fundamental scaling behavior of such networks is highly important. However, the existing scaling laws for multi-hop networks are not optimal even in the case of Zipf popularity distributions (gaps between upper and lower bounds are not constants); furthermore, there are no scaling law results for such networks for the more practical case of a Mandelbrot-Zipf (MZipf) popularity distribution. We thus in this work investigate the throughput-outage performance for cache-aided wireless D2D networks adopting multi-hop communications, with the MZipf popularity distribution for file requests and users distributed according to Poisson point process. We propose an achievable content caching and delivery scheme, and then analyze its performance. We obtain the optimal scaling law by showing that the achievable performance is tight to the proposed outer bound. Since the Zipf distribution is a special case of the MZipf distribution, the optimal scaling law for the networks considering the Zipf popularity distribution is also obtained, which closes the gap in literature.}

Closed-form solutions for the steady-state probabilities of the models are obtained, which are then utilized to derive expressions for several key performance metrics. Numerical results are provided to draw insights on the performance. In particular, a performance comparison between IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4 in terms of the average delay, the collision probability, and the channel utilization is presented. The results show that IEEE 802.11p is superior in terms of average delay, whereas C-V2X Mode 4 excels in collision resolution.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a precoded optical space-domain index modulation scheme for indoor visible light communications, which is based on the optimization of the minimum Euclidean distance of optical spatial modulation (OSM) with real-valued modulation constellations. We find that the precoding matrix design can be formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), whose solution is generally intractable. To tackle this problem, we first consider the case of two optical transmit antennas ( N t = 2) in the precoded OSM and derive a closed-form solution for arbitrary M-order pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). Based on the derived solutions and the error vector reduction method, we then propose a low-complexity iterative (LCI) algorithm to identify the precoding matrix for the setup N t > 2. To strike a flexible complexity-BER (bit error rate) tradeoff, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-assisted matrix-based optimization method to transform the non-convex QCQP problem into a series of linear convex subproblems, which can be solved by low-complexity solvers. Simulation results show that these proposed algorithms are capable of substantially improving the system error performance compared with conventional OSM systems. Besides, a symbol-based SCA algorithm is introduced and it is shown to outperform the matrix-based SCA and the suboptimal LCI algorithm in terms of the BER.}

Moreover, a cognitive-based resource allocation policy and tractable bounds for the harvested energy are introduced. Furthermore, by taking into account the random location of the VLC and RF user terminals, the closed-form outage probability for the VLC user is given, while for the RF user, the outage probability is derived in terms of infinite-series, which is also approximated by a tractable closed-form expression. In addition, the outage probability of the RF user is minimized by optimizing the direct current (DC) component.

In this paper, we analytically study the performance of the generalized Kennedy receiver having optimally displaced threshold detection (ODTD) in a realistic situation with noises and imperfect devices. We first prove that the MAP detection for a generalized Kennedy receiver is equivalent to a threshold detection in this realistic situation. Then we analyze the properties of the optimum threshold and the optimum displacement for ODTD, and propose a heuristic greedy search algorithm to design these parameters. We prove that the ODTD asymptotically approaches the Kennedy receiver with threshold detection when the signal power is large, and we also clarify the connection between the generalized Kennedy receiver with threshold detection and the one-port homodyne detection. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristic greedy search algorithm can obtain a lower and smoother error probability than the existing methods.}

	abstract = {In contrast with the traditional cryptography, physical layer security has attracted the attention of many researchers having aim at reinforcing the security of communication systems. As far as vehicular communication is concerned, it is challenging to maintain secure and reliable communication between the connected vehicles due to the density, mobility, and dynamic network topology. This paper considers a vehicle to infrastructure communication in which a legitimately fixed transmitter equipped with a single antenna transmits a confidential message to a legitimate mobile receiver equipped with multiple antennas in the presence of a passive mobile eavesdropper. In such a single input multiple output wireless system, the receiver performs the maximal ratio combining technique assuming constant vehicle speed. We assume that the antennas are closely spaced and depending upon the imperfect channel state information (CSI), we derive the closed-form expressions for the average outage probability, secrecy outage probability, and average secrecy outage rate over the uniform, exponential, and arbitrary correlated Nakagami-\nm\nchannels for dual antenna branches. In order to gain insight we also perform the high SNR asymptotic analysis of the outage probability and secrecy outage probability. Simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of our derived analytic expressions. The computation error analysis is carried out to provide the suitability of the correlation type at the legitimate receiver side. Our findings suggest that the performance of the case with exponential channel correlation is better than those for the uniform and arbitrary. Numerical results show the joint effect of vehicle mobility and the antenna correlation on secrecy performance. Moreover, we also observed that the imperfect knowledge of the CSI degrades the security of the confidential messages severely under the effect of mobility.}

	abstract = {Technically, the security performance of generalized spatial modulation (GenSM) networks can be enhanced by dynamically adjusting the precoder allocated to the legitimate signal as communication channel varies. For this purpose, our paper proposes a secure transmission strategy upon designing both digital and analog precoders for hybrid GenSM systems, where an eavesdropper is taken into account. The concept of the hybrid GenSM system has arose to improve the spatial multiplexing (SMX) gain for remedying the shortcoming of the limited number of radio frequency chains in traditional GenSM systems. However, this may lead to a great deal of security degradation since the SMX gain of the unintended receiver will be also improved. To this end, we develop a secrecy enhancement scheme by devising both analog and digital precoders for hybrid GenSM networks. Specifically, we derive an efficiently closed-form alternative to the original secrecy rate (SR) expression for reducing the excessive computational complexity of the joint optimization problem over the hybrid precoder. Then, by using this alternative as our cost function, an iterative algorithm is proposed. In particular, we elaborately conceive a pair of concave maximization problems in order to optimize the digital and analog precoders, respectively. Our proposed strategy not only utilizes semi-positive definite relaxing technique over the analog precoder but also invokes a lower bound of the alternative to further simplify the optimization over the vectored digital precoder. Subsequently, both the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed alternating iteration algorithm are analyzed. Compared to existing designs, our proposed strategy strikes a compelling role in balancing the SR performance and complexity. Finally, our simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of the SR performance achieved.}

The received signals of the legitimate users are optimized jointly, such that their bit error ratios (BERs) are minimized and Eve's BER is significantly degraded. The emission power of randomly selected light-emitting diodes is adjusted, by exploiting users' channel state information at the transmitter. Our strategy ensures that legitimate users receive confidential messages fully in an undistorted fashion, while any meaningful leakage to Eve is strongly prohibited, without any artificial noise addition. Every user can decode only its information, hence inter-user security is also guaranteed. The PLS improvements are presented in terms of both BERs and achievable secrecy rates in practical VLC scenarios. For various user configurations, it is shown that MU-GSSK-SCD increases the BER at Eve to the 0.5 level, while providing minimized BERs to the legitimate users. The achievable secrecy rate region is derived for MU-GSSK-SCD and it is shown that full secrecy can be achieved at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level with a user separation as small as 90 cm.}

In this paper, the sliced lattice Gaussian sampling algorithm is proposed to further improve the convergence performance of the Markov chain targeting at lattice Gaussian sampling. We demonstrate that the Markov chain arising from it is uniformly ergodic, namely, it converges exponentially fast to the stationary distribution. Meanwhile, the convergence rate of the underlying Markov chain is also investigated, and we show the proposed sliced sampling algorithm entails a better convergence performance than the independent Metropolis-Hastings-Klein (IMHK) sampling algorithm.

	abstract = {Nonlinear device characteristics present a severe performance-bottleneck for several upcoming next-generation wireless communication systems and prevent them from delivering high data-rates to the end-users. In this context, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) based signal processing methods have gained widespread deployment and have been found to outperform classical polynomial-filtering-based solutions significantly. Furthermore, recent RKHS based techniques that rely on explicit feature-maps called random Fourier features (RFF) have emerged. These techniques alleviate the dependence on learning a dictionary and avoid the computations and errors incurred in dictionary-based learning. However, the performance of existing RKHS based solutions depends on choosing a suitable kernel-width. For the widely-used Gaussian kernel, we propose a methodology of assigning kernel-bandwidths that capitalizes on a stochastic sampling of kernel-widths using an ensemble drawn from a pre-designed probability density function. The technique is found to deliver a comparable convergence/error-rate performance to the scenario when the kernel-width is chosen by brute-force trial and error for tuning it for best performance. The desirable properties of the proposed kernel-sampling technique are supported by analytical proofs and are further highlighted by computer-simulations presented in the form of case studies in the context of next-generation communication systems.}

	abstract = {Path fading and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals constitute serious problems in the wireless localization process. These problems cause unpredictable degradation in the localization precision. In this paper, a novel wireless localization approach, which is based on twice receiving array signal spectra fusions and asymmetric second-order stochastic resonance (ASSR) networks, is proposed. By combining and repetitively processing the above two techniques, the receiving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be enhanced. Additionally, the receiving array signal without the line-of-sight (LOS) component can be determined and removed from the spectra fusion process. The theoretical analyses presented verify the unbiasedness and asymptotic efficiency of the proposed twice receiving spectra fusion approach. Computer simulations demonstrate that the fused spectra can significantly improve the wireless localization precision compared with conventional and up-to-date localization methods, especially under low SNR conditions.}

	abstract = {The combination of orthogonal frequency modulation (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques plays an important role in modern communication systems. In order to meet the growing throughput demands, future MIMO-OFDM receivers are expected to utilize a massive number of antennas, operate in dynamic environments, and explore high frequency bands, while satisfying strict constraints in terms of cost, power, and size. An emerging technology to realize massive MIMO receivers of reduced cost and power consumption is based on dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), which inherently implement controllable compression in acquisition. In this work we study the application of DMAs for MIMO-OFDM receivers operating with bit-constrained analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We present a model for DMAs which accounts for the configurable frequency selective profile of its metamaterial elements, resulting in a spectrally flexible hybrid structure. We then exploit previous results in task-based quantization to show characterized the achievable OFDM recovery accuracy for a given DMA configuration in the presence of bit-constrained ADCs, and propose methods for adjusting the DMA parameters based on channel state information. Our numerical results demonstrate that by properly exploiting the spectral diversity of DMAs, notable performance gains are obtained over existing designs of conventional hybrid architectures, demonstrating the potential of DMAs for realizing high performance massive antenna arrays of reduced cost and power consumption.}

To balance the communication and sensing performance, we formulate a joint UAV location, user association, and UAV transmission power control problem to maximize the total network utility under the constraint of localization accuracy. We then propose a computationally practical method to solve this NP-hard problem by decomposing it into three sub-problems, i.e., UAV location optimization, user association and transmission power control. Three mechanisms are then introduced to solve the three sub-problems based on spectral clustering, coalition game, and successive convex approximation, respectively. The spectral clustering result provides an initial solution for user association. Based on the three mechanisms, an overall algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve the whole problem. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the minimum user data rate significantly, as well as the fairness of the network. Moreover, the proposed algorithm increases the network utility with a lower power consumption and similar localization accuracy, compared to conventional techniques.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have the potential to transform wireless communication channels into smart reconfigurable propagation environments. To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large, especially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can compensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the multiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and IRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength IRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To address this issue, in this article, we develop a physics-based model and a scalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition the IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact of each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two stages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For physics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model each tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless channel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations for the electric and magnetic vector fields. In the offline design stage, the IRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different transmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a given configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply to an impinging electromagnetic wave. In the online optimization stage, the best transmission mode of each tile is selected such that a desired quality-of-service (QoS) criterion is maximized. We consider an exemplary downlink system and study the minimization of the base station (BS) transmit power subject to QoS constraints for the users. Since the resulting mixed-integer programming problem for joint optimization of the BS beamforming vectors and the tile transmission modes is non-convex, we derive two efficient suboptimal solutions, which are based on alternating optimization and a greedy approach, respectively. We show that the proposed modeling and optimization framework can be used to efficiently optimize large IRSs comprising thousands of unit cells.}

Based on different channel conditions and computational capacities, computational tasks are partially offloaded to the MEC server via OMA or NOMA protocols. In order to minimize the total energy consumption, an optimization problem under the task execution latency constraint is formulated and divided into two sub-problems. By utilizing matching theory, the formulated sub-channel allocation problem is solved by a proposed low-complexity algorithm, where the joint optimization of task assignment and power allocation is performed at each iteration. Based on the delay constraint, some insights are obtained, and the closed-form solutions of task assignment coefficients and transmit power are derived. Furthermore, the offloading strategy in both OMA and NOMA schemes is analyzed, which shows that the optimal task assignment coefficient is decided by the energy consumption efficiency (ECE). Simulation results indicate that: i) the proposed sub-channel allocation algorithm and derived closed-form solutions can significantly improve the MEC system in terms of the energy consumption; ii) the provided offloading strategy can be dynamically and efficiently employed with different channel conditions and computational capacities.}

	abstract = {Cell-free (CF) massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) with large number of distributed access points (APs) has emerged as a new paradigm allowing higher macro diversity for randomly distributed users. However, the fronthaul traffic bandwidth between central processing unit and the APs can explode in particular in the uplink, requiring expensive star-topology with point-to-point fronthaul links. To achieve a scalable CF massive MIMO architecture and a cost-effective fronthauling solution, we consider, in this paper, a point-to-multipoint fronthaul topology where (a subset of) the APs share a serial fronthaul link offering a per-user limited fronthaul bandwidth. We develop a novel unified optimization framework for iterative power control and AP scheduling that provides a systematic user-centric solution towards scalable uplink CF massive MIMO. Experimental results show that power control is not sufficient to guarantee the best objective and, therefore, the appropriate association of the users to the APs is required to improve the overall system signal-to-noise ratio. Under the stringent fronthaul bandwidth, the proposed joint optimization framework results in i) significant 5% outage data rate increase ii) near uniform distribution of the served users per APs and, hence, an increased diversity and iii) fast convergence of the algorithm within a few iterations.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communication have been envisioned as two promising technologies for the Internet-of-things due to their high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Motivated by this fact, we consider an ambient backscatter NOMA system in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper. Under the realistic assumptions of residual hardware impairments (RHIs), channel estimation errors (CEEs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC), we investigate the physical layer security (PLS) of the ambient backscatter NOMA systems with emphasis on reliability and security. In order to further improve the security of the considered system, an artificial noise scheme is proposed where the radio frequency (RF) source acts as a jammer that transmits interference signals to the legitimate receivers and eavesdropper. On this basis, the analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the intercept probability (IP) are derived. To gain more insights, the asymptotic analysis and corresponding diversity orders for the OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are carried out, and the asymptotic behaviors of the IP in the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region are explored as well. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by the Monte Carlo simulation results. These results show that compared with the non-ideal conditions, the reliability of the considered system is high under ideal conditions, but the security is low.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been recognized as a promising technique in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks for fast data aggregation from a large number of wireless devices. However, the computation accuracy of AirComp highly depends on the devices with the worst channels condition, which degrades severely when the number of devices becomes large. To address this issue, we exploit the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with hybrid beamforming, in order to enhance the computational accuracy of AirComp in a cost-effective manner. In particular, we consider the scenario with a large number of multi-antenna devices simultaneously sending data to an access point (AP) equipped with massive antennas for functional computation over the air. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the transmit digital beamforming at the wireless devices and the receive hybrid beamforming at the AP, with the objective of minimizing the computational mean-squared error (MSE) subject to the individual transmit power constraints at the wireless devices. To solve the non-convex hybrid beamforming design optimization problem, we propose an alternating-optimization-based approach, in which the transmit digital beamforming and the receive analog and digital beamforming are optimized in an alternating manner. In particular, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms to handle the challenging receive analog beamforming problem, by exploiting the techniques of successive convex approximation (SCA) and coordinate descent (CD), respectively. It is shown that for the special case with a fully-digital receiver at the AP, the achieved MSE of the massive MIMO AirComp system is inversely proportional to the number of receive antennas. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed hybrid beamforming design substantially enhances the computation MSE performance as compared to other benchmark schemes, while the SCA-based algorithm performs closely to the performance upper bound achieved by the fully-digital beamforming.}

While previous works assumed Rayleigh or Rician fading, we use the fluctuating two-ray (FTR) distribution to model the small-scale fading in mmWave frequency. First, we obtain the statistical characterizations of the product of independent FTR random variables (RVs) and the sum of product of FTR RVs. For the RIS-aided and amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems, we derive exact end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions. To maximize the end-to-end SNR, we propose a novel and simple way to obtain the optimal phase shifts at the RIS elements. The optimal power allocation scheme for the AF relay system is also proposed. Furthermore, we evaluate important performance metrics including the outage probability and the average bit-error probability. To validate the accuracy of our analytical results, Monte-Carlo simulations are subsequently conducted to provide interesting insights. It is found that the RIS-aided system can attain the same performance as the AF relay system with low transmit power. More interestingly, as the channel conditions improve, the RIS-aided system can outperform the AF relay system using a smaller number of reflecting elements.}

	abstract = {Communication overhead is one of the major performance bottlenecks in large-scale distributed computing systems, in particular for machine learning applications. Conventionally, compression techniques are used to reduce the load of communication by combining intermediate results of the same computation task as much as possible. Recently, via the development of coded distributed computing (CDC), it has been shown that it is possible to enable coding opportunities across intermediate results of different computation tasks to further reduce the communication load. We propose a new scheme, named compressed coded distributed computing (in short, compressed CDC), which jointly exploits the above two techniques (i.e., combining the intermediate results of the same computation and coding across the intermediate results of different computations) to significantly reduce the communication load for computations with linear aggregation (reduction) of intermediate results in the final stage that are prevalent in machine learning (e.g., distributed training algorithms where partial gradients are computed distributedly and then averaged in the final stage). In particular, compressed CDC first compresses/combines several intermediate results for a single computation, and then utilizes multiple such combined packets to create a coded multicast packet that is simultaneously useful for multiple computations. We characterize the achievable communication load of compressed CDC and show that it substantially outperforms both combining methods and CDC scheme. Based on the compressed CDC technique, we then study a distributed training problem as one of its application. We characterize the communication load for this distributed training problem and show that it is asymptotically optimal.}

	abstract = {One of the key weaknesses of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is the error floor that they typically exhibit at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Such an error floor is usually attributed to problematic structures known as trapping sets (TSs). The overwhelming majority of existing error floor estimation schemes consider the case of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signalling. Unfortunately, these schemes are not readily extensible to estimate the error floor of high order LDPC coded modulation systems considered herein. To provide such a scheme, in this work, we use mean-shift importance sampling (MS-IS) to develop a novel error floor estimation methodology for high-order pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) LDPC coded systems. First, a computationally efficient graphical-based approach is used to identify the TSs of a given LDPC code. Subsequently, a novel analytical approach is devised to identify the TSs that are likely to have a higher contribution in the error floor. These TSs are referred to as potentially dominant TSs (PDTSs). Finally, a new methodology for categorizing the PDTSs into equivalence classes is developed. A representative PDTS of each equivalence class is chosen and an MS-IS framework is devised to obtain the error rate corresponding to each equivalence class. To arrive at the desired MS-IS scheme, we develop an algorithm that invokes the geometry of the constellation to determine the MS value. In contrast with the conventional MS-IS method used in BPSK signalling, in the proposed MS-IS scheme, the MS value is a variable that is determined based on the TS and the transmitted codeword. The computational complexity of the three main steps of our methodology, viz. extracting the PDTSs, determining the MS values, and applying the MS-IS scheme, depends merely on the size of the constellation and the structure of the code, but not on the SNR. Numerical simulations confirm the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed technique at different SNRs.}

	abstract = {A Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) is called quasi-reversible if there are consecutive elements a 1 ,⋯,a 2 in the defining set, where a 1 is a negative integer and a 2 is a positive integer. A matrix in band form presented in this article involves the use of the Newton identities and symmetric polynomial identities. This matrix is the coefficient matrix of a linear system. The solution to such a linear system is the coefficients of an error-locator polynomial for quasi-reversible BCH codes. Its computational complexity is significantly lower than BCH decoding using the linear system with coefficient matrix in column echelon form. This article also proposes a new partial syndrome matrix with radical locators and a lot of zeros. Such a matrix is still in band form. The expansion of its matrix determinant is exactly a radical-locator polynomial. Compared to the former radical-locator polynomials in the literature, the newly discovered radical-locator polynomial not only requires less storage memory but also results in computational benefits. Surprisingly, the resulting polynomials are much sparser than those for the narrow-sense BCH codes. Finally, a complete algebraic decoding algorithm for quasi-reversible BCH codes is provided. The error-locator and radical-locator polynomials of degree less than or equal to 5 are listed.}

	abstract = {In his pioneering work on LDPC codes, Gallager dismissed codes with parity-check matrices of weight two after proving that their minimum Hamming distances grow at most logarithmically with their code lengths. In spite of their poor minimum Hamming distances, it is shown that quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with parity-check matrices of column weight two have good capability to correct phased bursts of erasures which may not be surpassed by using quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with parity-check matrices of column weight three or more. By modifying the parity-check matrices of column weight two and globally coupling them, the erasure correcting capability can be further enhanced. Quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with parity-check matrices of column weight three or more that can correct phased bursts of erasures and perform well over the AWGN channel are also considered. Examples of such codes based on Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes are presented.}

	abstract = {Constrained coding is used widely in digital communication and storage systems. In this article, we study a generalized sliding window constraint called the skip-sliding window. A skip-sliding window (SSW) code is defined in terms of the length L of a sliding window, skip length J, and cost constraint E in each sliding window. Each valid codeword of length L + kJ is determined by k+1 windows of length L where window i starts at (iJ + 1)th symbol for all non-negative integers i such that i ≤ k; and the cost constraint E in each window must be satisfied. SSW coding constraints naturally arise in applications such as simultaneous energy and information transfer, and SSW codes are also potential candidates for visible light communications. In this work, two methods are given to enumerate the size of SSW codes and further refinements are made to reduce the enumeration complexity. Using the proposed enumeration methods, the noiseless capacity of binary SSW codes is determined and some useful observations are made, such as the fact that SSW codes provide greater capacity than certain related classes of constrained codes. Moreover, we provide noisy capacity bounds for SSW codes.}

In this paper, two energy and spectrally efficient transmission strategies, namely wireless power transfer assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (WPT-NOMA) and backscatter communication (Back-Com) assisted NOMA (BAC-NOMA), are proposed by utilizing this feature of IoT and employing spectrum and energy cooperation among the devices. In particular, the use of NOMA ensures that the devices with different QoS requirements can share the same spectrum, and WPT and Back-Com are employed to utilize the cooperation among the devices with different energy profiles, which avoids the use of a dedicated power beacon. Furthermore, for the proposed WPT-NOMA scheme, the application of hybrid successive interference cancelation (SIC) decoding order is also considered, and analytical results are developed to demonstrate that WPT-NOMA can avoid outage probability error floors and realize the full diversity gain. Unlike WPT-NOMA, BAC-NOMA suffers from an outage probability error floor, and the asymptotic behavior of this error floor is analyzed in the paper by applying the extreme value theory. In addition, the effect of a unique feature of BAC-NOMA, i.e., employing one device’s signal as the carrier signal for another device, is studied, and its impact on the diversity gain is revealed. Simulation results are also provided to compare the performance of the proposed strategies and verify the developed analytical results.}

	abstract = {Bit rate fairness is an important concern in current G.fast and the forthcoming fifth generation DSL systems where the frequency is extended to hundreds of MHz and crosstalk couplings reach unprecedented levels. In this paper, we study the price of fairness (PoF) in dynamic spectrum management (DSM) enabled DSL systems. We propose optimal low complexity PoF-constrained max-min fairness (MMF), weighted max-min fairness (WMMF), proportional fairness (PF), and (p,α)-PF algorithms. The proposed algorithms inherently provide weight factors which can be used to reduce the computational complexity of user encoding or decoding order optimizing algorithms used in nonlinear vectoring. Our simulation results show that although PoF grows exponentially with the minimum bit rate, fairness can be improved considerably with a relatively small price in DSM level 2 spectrum balancing and particularly in DSM level 3 using minimum mean square error (MMSE) generalized decision feedback equalizer (GDFE). It is also seen that the proposed optimal PoF-constrained MMF algorithm can reach the solutions of PF and (p,α)-PF measures for some PoF. That is, the PoF-constrained MMF or WMMF algorithms can be used instead of the non-linear PF and (p,α)-PF measures, which often result in computationally intensive solutions.}

	abstract = {In cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) the fluctuations of the channel gain from the access points to a user are large due to the distributed topology of the system. Because of these fluctuations, data decoding schemes that treat the channel as deterministic perform inefficiently. A way to reduce the channel fluctuations is to design a precoding scheme that equalizes the effective channel gain seen by the users. Conjugate beamforming (CB) poorly contributes to harden the effective channel at the users. In this work, we propose a variant of CB dubbed enhanced normalized CB (ECB), in that the precoding vector consists of the conjugate of the channel estimate normalized by its squared norm. For this scheme, we derive an exact closed-form expression for an achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE), accounting for channel estimation errors, pilot reuse and user's lack of channel state information (CSI), assuming independent Rayleigh fading channels. We also devise an optimal max-min fairness power allocation based only on large-scale fading quantities. ECB greatly boosts the channel hardening enabling the users to reliably decode data relying only on statistical CSI. As the provided effective channel is nearly deterministic, acquiring CSI at the users does not yield a significant gain.}

	abstract = {A channel delay spread larger than the cyclic prefix (CP) creates inter-carrier/symbol interference (ISI/ICI) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Recent interests in low-latency applications have motivated the usage of shorter OFDM symbols where one can either downscale the CP at the cost of interference, or maintain it but with larger overhead. Alternatively, this paper studies channel shortening methods exploiting the properties of large multi-antenna precoding in order to steer the transmitted signal energy toward channel paths inside an insufficient CP. It is shown that ISI/ICI can asymptotically be canceled by conventional subcarrier-based precoding with an infinite number of antennas. This is achieved by introducing time-delay selectivity inside frequency-selective precoders in order to remove undesired delayed signals, providing a trade-off between interference mitigation and multi-path combining gains, and leading to subsequent gains in high SNR. This frequency-domain precoding method, coined time-frequency (TF) precoding, is compared to time-reversal (TR) filtering whose asymptotic rate is optimal but introduces post-modulation processing with channel-dependent signal distortion. In addition to maintain the legacy precoded multi-antenna OFDM structure, finite-size analysis shows that TF-precoding converges faster to its asymptotic rate than TR-filtering, so that TF-precoding can outperform TR-filtering in the high-SNR regime with not-so-many antennas.}

	abstract = {We study the optimal design of heterogeneous Coded Elastic Computing (CEC) where machines have varying computation speeds and storage. CEC introduced by Yang et al. in 2018 is a framework that mitigates the impact of elastic events, where machines can join and leave at arbitrary times. In CEC, data is distributed among machines using a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code such that subsets of machines can perform the desired computations. However, state-of-the-art CEC designs only operate on homogeneous networks where machines have the same speeds and storage. This may not be practical. In this work, based on an MDS storage assignment, we develop a novel computation assignment approach for heterogeneous CEC networks to minimize the overall computation time. We first consider the scenario where machines have heterogeneous computing speeds but same storage and then the scenario where both heterogeneities are present. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization formulation and solve it exactly by decomposing it into a convex optimization problem to find the optimal computation load and a filling problem to find the exact computation assignment. A low-complexity filling algorithm is adapted and can be completed within a number of iterations equal to at most the number of available machines.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the Nyquist criteria for ordinary linear modulation are generalized to the discrete-Fourier transform-spread (DFT-spread) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) of constellation-rotated PAM symbols. Unlike the conventional Nyquist criteria with a linear receiver, the new criteria are to remove intersymbol interference in the output of a widely-linear (WL) receiver. It is shown that not only the folded spectrum, but also the shifted and reverse-folded spectrum is crucial in the criteria, where the shift offset is determined by the rotation angle. As a design example, combinations of a constellation rotation angle and a square-root raised cosine pulse are proposed. It is shown that the proposed design can achieve better performance both in spectral efficiency and in peak-to-average power ratio than the conventional DFT-spread OFDM of π/2-BPSK symbols. The optimal one-tap frequency-domain equalizer is also derived under the WL zero-forcing (ZF) constraint. It is shown that, when the rotation angle is properly chosen, the proposed one-tap WL-ZF equalizer significantly outperforms the one-tap linear ZF equalizer in output signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed equalizer also outperforms the conventional equalizer in error vector magnitude measured at the output of a nonlinear power amplifier.}

TAS does so with a hardware complexity and cost comparable to a single antenna system. We present a novel and optimal joint TAS and continuous power adaptation rule for a practically relevant, less explored model in which the secondary transmitter knows only the statistics of channel gains from itself to one or more primary receivers. The rule minimizes the average symbol error probability (SEP) of the secondary system for an entire class of stochastic interference constraints. This general class subsumes the average interference constraint and its novel generalization, and the interference-outage constraint. We derive closed-form expressions for the transmit power and selected antenna. We then develop a general analysis of the optimal average SEP that applies to several widely-used fading models. We also present computationally-efficient approaches to determine the parameters that specify the optimal rule. Our comprehensive numerical results characterize the very different impacts of the interference constraint on both secondary and primary systems. They show that the optimal rule reduces the average SEP by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.}

They are multiple CCCs with inter-set zero cross-correlation zone (ZCCZ) property and multiple aperiodic ZCCSs with ideal inter-set aperiodic cross-correlation property respectively, the latter is referred to as an aperiodic inter-group complementary (IGC) code set and each ZCCS is called a group.

The obtained multiple CCCs have potential applications in interference-free multi-cell environments to support a large number of users. In addition, a construction of aperiodic polyphase IGC code sets is presented from polyphase PU matrices. We remark that different groups of the derived IGC code sets yield different constituent sequence lengths, thus they could provide a variety of quality of service (QoS) in quasi-synchronous multi-cell multi-rate communication systems.

Leveraging the heterogeneity, we propose a novel UMA protocol, called iterative collision resolution for slotted ALOHA (IRSA) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), to improve the conventional IRSA. In addition to the inter-slot successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique used in existing IRSA-based schemes, the proposed protocol further employs the intra-slot SIC technique that enables collision resolution for certain configurations of collided packets. A novel multi-dimensional density evolution is then proposed to analyze and to optimize the proposed protocol. Simulation results show that the proposed IRSA with NOMA protocol can efficiently exploit the heterogeneity among users and the multi-dimensional density evolution can accurately predict the throughput performance. Last, an extension of the proposed IRSA with NOMA protocol to the frame-asynchronous setting is investigated, where a boundary effect similar to that in spatially-coupled low-density parity check codes can be observed to bootstrap the decoding process.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the hybrid interweave/underlay channel access mode is studied for an energy harvesting (EH) cognitive radio network with multi-class secondary users (SUs). The hybrid channel access mode combines the benefits of interweave transmission (opportunistic access with high throughput) and that of the underlay transmission (any time transmission with controlled power). EH upgrades the SUs' devices to be self sustainable. Additionally, classifying the SUs helps to meet their different quality of service (QoS) requirements. The system is modelled as a mixed observable Markov decision process (MOMDP) to handle the uncertainty in the primary user (PU) activity and consider future rewards. The MOMDP model is solved to maximize the SUs' throughput using two algorithms, namely, the point-based value iteration and the heuristic search value iteration (HSVI). Moreover, skipping the schedule of some SUs is proved to increase the channel utilization. The HSVI is proved to be efficient and reduces the time complexity significantly. Compared to related work in literature, the proposed model is proved to be superior in terms of throughput, tunable to meet the different QoS requirements of SU classes, and can accommodate any number of SU classes. Finally, the effect of some system parameters on the proposed system performance is studied and some insights are derived about the structure of the optimal policy and the system parameters values.}

	abstract = {It is known that source-channel separation is sub-optimal for communicating correlated Gaussian sources over a Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC). Considering a two-to-one GMAC which undergoes Rayleigh block-fading, we present a novel approach to practical joint source-channel coding for the scenario in which the common receiver has instantaneous CSI but only the CSI distribution is available to the individual transmitters. This approach, referred to as source-channel trellis-coded vector quantization (SC-TCVQ), simply relies on using TCVQs as fixed-rate source-channel encoders. One key issue is the optimization of the TCVQ codebooks to the mean channel signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR), and to this end, we present an analytical method to obtain the rates required for codebook design. Another key issue is the joint estimation of the sources at the receiver, for which we present a detector-estimator based on the Cartesian product of the two encoder-trellises. Simulation results show that the proposed SC-TCVQ codes, in some cases, can even beat the asymptotic performance bound for a separate source-channel code consisting of a distributed vector quantizer and capacity achieving channel codes. SC-TCVQ appears to be the best known practical code design to date for the given communication problem.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a method to calculate the exact average block error probability of some random code ensembles under maximum-likelihood decoding. The proposed method is applicable to various channels and ensembles. The focus is on both spherical and Gaussian random codes on the additive white Gaussian noise channel as well as binary random codes on both the binary symmetric channel and the binary erasure channel. While for the uniform spherical ensemble Shannon, in 1959, argued with solid angles in N-dimensional space, the presented approach projects the problem into two dimensions and applies standard trigonometry. This simplifies the derivation and also allows for the analysis of the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian ensemble which turns out to perform better for short blocklengths and high rates. Moreover, a new lower bound on the average block error probability of the uniform spherical ensemble is found. For codes with more than three codewords, it is tighter than the sphere packing bound, but requires exactly the same computing effort. Furthermore, tight approximations are proposed to simplify the computation of both the exact average error probability and the two bounds. For the binary symmetric channel and the binary erasure channel, bounds on the average block error probability for i.i.d. random coding are derived and compared to the exact calculations.}

This scheme is obtained from resolvable designs satisfying certain conditions which we call cross resolvable designs. To be able to compare different multi-access coded schemes with different number of users we normalize the rate of the schemes by the number of users served. Based on this per-user-rate we show that our scheme performs better than the well known Maddah-Ali - Niesen (MaN) scheme and the recently proposed (“Multi-access coded caching: gains beyond cache-redundancy” by Serbetci, Parrinello and Elia) SPE scheme. It is shown that the resolvable designs from affine planes are cross resolvable designs and our scheme based on these performs better than the MaN scheme for large memory size cases. The exact size beyond which our performance is better is also presented. The SPE scheme considers only the cases where the product of the number of users and the normalized cache size is 2, whereas the proposed scheme allows different choices depending on the choice of the cross resolvable design.}

To meet this demand, we study the content caching problem modelled as a Markov decision process in the network edge server when the popularity profiles are unknown and time-varying. In order to adapt to the changing trends of content popularity, a context-aware popularity learning algorithm is proposed. We prove that the learning error of this scheme is sublinear in the number of requests. In light of the learned popularities, a reinforcement learning-based caching scheme is designed on top of the state-action-reward-state-action algorithm with a function approximation. A reactive caching algorithm is also proposed to reduce the complexity. The time complexities of both the caching schemes are studied to demonstrate their feasibility in real time systems and a theoretical analysis is performed to prove that the cache hit rate of the reactive caching algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimal cache hit rate. Finally the simulations are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms.}

In practice, there is little or even no statistical knowledge on the system noise, which in many cases is non-Gaussian, impulsive and not analyzable. Existing detection methods have mainly focused on specific noise models, which are not robust enough with unknown noise statistics. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel ML detection framework to effectively recover the desired signal. Our framework is a fully probabilistic one that can efficiently approximate the unknown noise distribution through a normalizing flow. Importantly, this framework is driven by an unsupervised learning approach, where only the noise samples are required. To reduce the computational complexity, we further present a low-complexity version of the framework, by utilizing an initial estimation to reduce the search space. Simulation results show that our framework outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of bit error rate (BER) in non-analytical noise environments, while it can reach the ML performance bound in analytical noise environments.}

We formulate the general PF joint RA optimization problem as a weighted sum-rate maximization problem at each time-slot and develop a solution technique to obtain a quasi-optimal feasible solution via the introduction of auxiliary variables and a carefully chosen approximation of the spectral-efficiency function. To obtain results for larger settings (i.e., larger number of antennas and users), we propose an approximation to the general problem that yields quasi-optimal feasible solutions. Moreover, we consider state-of-the-art linear precoding techniques and propose a general heuristic RA scheme that takes PAPCs into account. Numerical results show that PAPCs have significant impact on performance even for a very large number of antennas, and that the best existing linear precoding technique, RZFT (regularized zero-forcing transmission) performs very well when RA is performed carefully as long as the PAPCs are not tight. However, RZFT is far from optimal under tight PAPCs, which highlights the need for practical PAPC-aware precoding techniques in this regime.}

In this context, the node locations are modeled with Poisson point processes. The time division duplexing mode is employed, and uplink channels are estimated locally using uplink pilots. Furthermore, unique pilot sequences are used between NOMA clusters, while pilot reuse occurs within each cluster to strike a balance between the training overhead and the number of clusters. Matched-filter-based precoding is utilized for downlink transmission. The aggregate received signal is analytically characterized by deriving the moment generating function and approximations via moment matching. Then, the asymptotic achievable rates of the NOMA users are derived, thereby quantifying the adverse impact of error propagation owing to imperfect successive interference cancellation. Special scenarios with prior downlink channel state information and log-distance power control are also considered. We show that NOMA greatly increases the achievable average rate, especially under low path loss exponents and dense networks, while user fairness may be boosted by the adoption of a log-distance transmit power control scheme with proper parameter selection (i.e. lower values for the power control parameter).}

As existing approaches are mostly ad-hoc, thereby lacking performance guarantee, we will tailor an enhanced transceiver design explicitly for wMU mmWave mMIMO, with the goal of maximizing mutual information (MI). The proposed scheme follows the prevalent hybrid block diagonalization (HBD-)based framework that is well-known for balancing the transmitter-end processing flexibility and the user-end detection complexity. In this paper, we for the first time prove that HBD is optimal in the sense of MI. In terms of the transceiver design, we start by decoupling the hybrid processing into a two-stage analog and digital processing, and then derive the MI bounds associated with HBD. By optimizing the tight MI bound, excellent HBD transceivers are devised for both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS). The proposed HBD technique does not rely on substantial computational complexity, striking channel sparsity, or high-resolution analog beamformers, and can achieve a superb MI performance even with inferior hardware configurations.}

Conditions with small timing offsets we term “quasi-synchronous” (QS). In this paper, we propose two new sets of nonlinear chirps to improve CSS system performance in QS conditions. We analytically and numerically evaluate cross-correlation distributions. We also derive the bit error probability for Binary CSS analytically and validate our theoretical result with both numerical and simulation results; our error probability expression is applicable to any binary time-frequency (TF) chirp waveform. Finally, we show that in QS conditions our two new nonlinear chirp designs outperform the classical linear chirp and all existing nonlinear chirps from the literature. To complete our analysis, we demonstrate that our nonlinear CSS designs outperform existing chirps in two realistic (empirically modeled) dispersive air to ground channels.}

We aim at exploring how the satellite distribution and formation size influence the channel capacity in this case.

The single-antenna satellite case is considered where we present the specific forms of the derived capacity bounds to prove that the capacity first increases linearly then increases more and more slowly with the satellite formation size, and there exists an optimal LEO satellite distribution to achieve the maximum capacity of the system.

In this paper, we aim to address this challenge by developing a joint resource allocation method as a multi-objective optimization (MO) problem to maximize the average sum rate and fairness among users as key and sub-key objectives, respectively. For this purpose, the exact analytical expressions for the average sum rate and users' individual rate are extracted based on an adaptive weighted graph matrix (AWGM). An AWGM matrix beneficially replaces the factor graph and the power allocation matrices to simplify the MO problem based on the asymmetric modified bipartite matching (AMBM) algorithm. The power allocation strategy is utilized during the optimal resource assignment process using the AMBM algorithm. After the AMBM process, we propose a low-complexity four-step algorithm to obtain the AWGM. The simulation results show that our proposed method can compromise and improve the multiple objectives' performance and guarantees a stable range of network performance at different times.}

The high cost and power consumption associated with the massive use of radio frequency (RF) chains prohibit fully-digital implementation of the precoder, and therefore, we consider a hybrid analog-digital architecture where a small-sized baseband precoder is followed by two successive networks of analog on-off switches and variable phase shifters according to a fully-connected structure. We jointly optimize the digital baseband precoder and the states of the switching network on a symbol-level basis, i.e., by exploiting both the channel state information (CSI) and the instantaneous data symbols, whereas the phase-shifting network is designed only based on the CSI due to practical considerations. Our approach to this joint optimization is to minimize the Euclidean distance between the optimal fully-digital and the hybrid symbol-level precoders. Remarkably, the use of a switching network allows for power-savings in the analog precoder by switching some of the phase shifters off according to the instantaneously optimized states of the switches. Our numerical results indicate that, on average, up to 50 percent of the phase shifters can be switched off. We provide an analysis of energy efficiency by adopting appropriate power dissipation models for the analog precoder, where it is shown that the energy efficiency of precoding can substantially be improved thanks to the phase shifter selection approach, compared to the fully-digital and the state-of-the-art hybrid symbol-level schemes.}

Within a cell, the transmissions of different users are modeled as a Gaussian multiple access channel, treating inter-cell interference as additive Gaussian noise. By analyzing the geometry of the feasible power region, using successive interference cancellation at each base station is proved to be optimal in minimizing the total transmission power of all users under rate constraints. The decoding order at each base station, however, remains to be determined. If the decoding order is decided without base station cooperation, the overall control algorithm is fully distributed but is suboptimal in general. To achieve optimality, a partially distributed algorithm is designed, which requires base stations to exchange control messages. Given any feasible instance, the algorithm is proved to converge to the optimal solution. The performance of the fully distributed and partially distributed power control algorithms is compared by computer simulations. The fully distributed algorithm is nearly optimal in terms of outage probability. When a high data rate is required, the partially distributed algorithm is able to reduce the total power consumption by about 20%.}

We analyze the convergence performance of our proposed iterative SIC turbo receiver by utilizing a customized extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart and simplify the corresponding detector algorithms to further reduce receiver complexity. Our proposed iterative SIC turbo receiver demonstrates performance improvement over existing receivers and robustness against imperfect SIC process and channel state information uncertainty.}

	abstract = {Multibeam antenna arrays (MBAAs) have the capability to improve the capacity of a wireless network by facilitating simultaneous transmissions to multiple users. However, in practical deployments of wireless personal or local area networks (WPANs/WLANs) where piconet coordinators or access points (PNCs/APs) are deployed with MBAAs, it is quite likely to observe non-uniform node densities in various regions. To optimally utilize MBAAs in such scenarios, concurrent transmission scheduling in WPANs/WLANs is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Then, a practical heuristic transmission scheduler that aims to maximize the number of concurrent communications by dynamically configuring the directions of beams is proposed. In addition, a service tag based fair scheduler is also proposed to achieve weighted fairness in WPANs/WLANs with MBAAs. Our results show that the performance improvements provided by the proposed heuristic scheduler are higher for antennas with lower beamwidths, and as the non-uniformity in the network increases, the traffic supported in the network increases in the range 24-41%, compared to the existing methods. The proposed service tag based scheduler can further improve the network throughput and achieve better fairness at the cost of a few beam direction reconfigurations, as compared to the existing methods and our heuristic scheduler.}

	abstract = {Age of Information (AoI) is a critical metric for several Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where sensors keep track of the environment by sending updates that need to be as fresh as possible. The development of edge computing solutions has moved the monitoring process closer to the sensor, reducing the communication delays, but the processing time of the edge node needs to be taken into account. Furthermore, a reliable system design in terms of freshness requires the knowledge of the full distribution of the Peak AoI (PAoI), from which the probability of occurrence of rare, but extremely damaging events can be obtained. In this work, we model the communication and computation delay of such a system as two First Come First Serve (FCFS) queues in tandem, analytically deriving the full distribution of the PAoI for the M/M/1 - M/D/1 and the M/M/1 - M/M/1 tandems, which can represent a wide variety of realistic scenarios.}

	abstract = {Although grant-based mechanisms have been a predominant approach for wireless access for years, the additional latency required for initial handshake message exchange and the extra control overhead for packet transmissions have stimulated the emergence of grant-free (GF) transmission. GF access provides a promising mechanism for carrying low and moderate traffic with small data and fits especially well for massive machine type communications (mMTC) applications. Despite a surge of interest in GF access, how to handle heterogeneous mMTC traffic based on GF mechanisms has not been investigated in depth. In this paper, we propose a priority enabled GF access scheme which performs dynamic slot allocation in each 5G new radio subframe to devices with different priority levels on a subframe-by-subframe basis. While high priority traffic has access privilege for slot occupancy, the remaining slots in the same subframe will be allocated to low priority traffic. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we develop a two-dimensional Markov chain model which integrates these two types of traffic via a pseudo-aggregated process. Furthermore, the model is validated through simulations and the performance of the scheme is evaluated both analytically and by simulations and compared with two other GF access schemes.}

The FE-OWC system comprises optical antennas, optical chains, and baseband units at both BS and UTs. The innovative optical antenna consists of an array of fiber ports and a transceiver lens, which can form a number of transmit and receive optical beams and provide a full beam coverage for simultaneous downlink and uplink connections with a number of UTs, respectively. We present analysis to characterize downlink and uplink channel models and gains, including both optical and electrical parts, between the BS and UTs and conduct a complete link budget analysis. We further design downlink and uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) as well as massive MIMO transmission protocols and develop asymptotically optimal schemes for a large number of fiber ports. Numerical results illustrate that the FE-OWC system has the potential to support over 10 Gbps data rate per UT and Tbps system throughput required in future 6G mobile communication systems.}

The recently proposed phase-matching QKD protocol can drastically improve the transmission distance of QKD. However, in the coexistence system, the noise generated by classical signals, especially spontaneous Raman scattering noise, is a big challenge. Moreover, the classical optical amplifier, which is necessary for the realistic long-distance classical communication, makes the noise more serious. In view of this, we establish the unified Raman noise model for three discrete-variable QKD protocols (BB84, measurement-device-independent and phase-matching QKD protocols) in the presence of classical optical amplifiers, which can be applied to both single-core single-mode fiber and multicore fiber. Then, we derive the key rate of the three QKD protocols coexisting with classical signals using the proposed unified Raman noise model. Finally, simulation results show that multicore fiber is promising for simultaneous long-distance transmission of QKD and the dense wavelength division multiplexing system.}

We assume that the side information (SI) at the user includes a subset of files stored privately. Moreover, the identity of requests and side information at the user are not revealed to any of the servers. The problem involves finding the minimum load transmitted from the servers to the user such that the requested files can be decoded with the help of received data and side information. By providing matching lower and upper bounds for certain regimes, we characterize the minimum load imposed on all the servers. Our result shows that the capacity is the same as the capacity of a multi-message PIR problem without PSI, but with a library of reduced size, i.e., the library is equal to the original library size minus the size of SI. Finally, we extend our setup to the case where instead of storing complete files as SI, the user can store a fraction of files. For this scenario, we propose an achievability scheme based on which we discuss the best storing strategies.}

	abstract = {Impulse noise presents a severe performance bottleneck in multicarrier systems. For digital subscriber lines (DSL), the use of a common-mode (CM) sensor is a viable technique to mitigate the impulse noise that couples into the useful differential-mode (DM) signal. In this paper, we use time and frequency domain approaches to develop algorithms using the joint processing of CM and DM signals and analyze the performance of dual-sensor based interference cancellation schemes for downstream DSL systems. First, we consider the frequency domain approach and analyze the performance of a per-tone impulse noise canceler without requiring an impulse detector. We derive closed-form expressions on the performance of canceler in various interference scenarios in terms of system parameters. Next, we develop a novel per-symbol time-domain impulse noise canceler by simultaneous estimation of the CM2DM transfer function and the CM impulse noise using a limited number of null carriers. The proposed algorithm eliminates the issues of convergence of the per-tone canceler and stationarity of the impulse noise over multiple symbols. Using derived analytical expressions, we show that the proposed canceler effectively mitigates the impulse noise on a per-symbol basis. We also demonstrate the performance of the considered canceler schemes using measurement and simulation results.}

	abstract = {Underwater acoustic communications (UACs) are demanded in a wide range of marine applications. However, one of the main challenges for UACs is unexpected interferences from nearby acoustic activities, especially dynamic and short-period interferences (called shot interference), which are hard to detect, estimate, and mitigate over time- and frequency-selective acoustic channels. In this article, we propose a novel filter that mitigates the interference effects for both single-carrier and multi-carrier systems without any prior knowledge of the interference. An Adaptive Sliding Window Interference Detection (ASWID) algorithm is developed to detect the location and the number of interfered symbols. Meanwhile, a least trimmed squares (LTS) equalizer is presented for the shot interference estimation and mitigation based on robust regression. The proposed algorithms are evaluated through numerical simulations and real channel measurements. Our results show that the proposed designs can detect and mitigate shot interferences effectively for single-carrier and multi-carrier UAC systems.}

Multiple parameters of each ray, including the delay, amplitude, cross-polarization ratio (XPR), initial phases of four polarization combinations, and the azimuth and elevation angles of arrival and departure, must be known and are measured using a channel sounder. The number of rays in every cluster is usually greater than the number of elements in the antenna array of the channel sounder, which represents a challenging issue in multipolarized channel measurements. Based on the broadband extended array response of an electromagnetic vector antenna array, a new subspace estimation method is proposed to resolve a large number of rays. The inter-element spacing of the array can be greater than half the carrier wavelength, which reduces inter-element coupling and simplifies the array design, especially for millimeter-wave bands. The delay of each cluster is first estimated using the reference antenna element. Next, two-dimensional angles of every ray are estimated using the classic rank-deficient multiple signal classification algorithm. Finally, the initial phases, XPR, and amplitude of every ray are estimated. Simulation results validate the proposed method.}

By smartly tuning the signal reflection via a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements, IRS is capable of dynamically altering wireless channels to enhance the communication performance. It is thus expected that the new IRS-aided hybrid wireless network comprising both active and passive components will be highly promising to achieve a sustainable capacity growth cost-effectively in the future. Despite its great potential, IRS faces new challenges to be efficiently integrated into wireless networks, such as reflection optimization, channel estimation, and deployment from communication design perspectives. In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview of IRS-aided wireless communications to address the above issues, and elaborate its reflection and channel models, hardware architecture and practical constraints, as well as various appealing applications in wireless networks.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where an aerial BS is dispatched for satisfying the data request of a maximum number of ground users, weighted according to their data demand, before exhausting its on-board energy resources. The resulting trajectory optimization problem is a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP) which is challenging solve. Specifically, there are coupling constraints which cannot be solved directly. We exploit a penalty decomposition method to reformulate the optimization formulation into a new form and use block coordinate descent technique to decompose the problem into sub-problems. Then, successive convex approximation technique is applied to tackle non-convex constraints. Finally, we propose a double-loop iterative algorithm for the UAV trajectory design. In addition, to achieve a better coverage performance, the problem of designing the initial trajectory for the UAV trajectory is considered. In the results section, UAV trajectories with the proposed algorithm are shown. Numerical results show the coverage performance with the proposed schemes compared to the benchmarks.}

	abstract = {The integration of the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication can increase the throughput of 5G networks. As an attractive technique in the MIMO systems, hybrid beamforming (HBF) can improve the 5G capacity by employing spatial domain resources. However, with the increase of the number of antennas, the traditional beamforming algorithms fail to efficiently keep a balance between the hardware complexity and beamforming gains. In this paper, with the aid of bidirectional location information, a bidirectional positioning assisted HBF (BPA-HBF) scheme is proposed. Specifically, we first propose a new scheme to decouple the optimal problem of traditional HBF as two phases. In the analog beamforming (ABF) phase, the dominated path among the multi-path components is determined by the transmitter and receiver. In addition, the codebook-based beamforming weight vectors are bidirectionally and synchronously determined according to the angle parameters of the dominated path. In the second phase, based on the ABF matrices, the digital beamformers are designed to maximize the energy efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the proposed BPA-HBF scheme can lead to a lower convergence time and complexity than the conventional schemes. In addition, the results show that the algorithm convergence time can be significantly reduced by increasing the positioning precision.}

	abstract = {Large intelligent surfaces (LISs) constitute a new and promising wireless communication paradigm that relies on the integration of a massive number of antenna elements over the entire surfaces of man-made structures. The LIS concept provides many advantages, such as the capability to provide reliable and space-intensive communications by effectively establishing line-of-sight (LOS) channels. In this paper, the system spectral efficiency (SSE) of an active LIS system is asymptotically analyzed under a practical LIS environment with a well-defined uplink frame structure. In order to verify the impact on the SSE of pilot contamination, the SSE of a multi-LIS system is asymptotically studied and a theoretical bound on its performance is derived. Given this performance bound, an optimal pilot training length for multi-LIS systems subjected to pilot contamination is characterized and, subsequently, the number of devices that need to be serviced by the LIS in order to maximize the performance is derived. Simulation results show that the derived analyses are in close agreement with the exact mutual information in presence of a large number of antennas, and the achievable SSE is limited by the effect of pilot contamination and intra/inter-LIS interference through the LOS path, even if the LIS is equipped with an infinite number of antennas. Additionally, the SSE obtained with the proposed pilot training length and number of scheduled devices is shown to reach the one obtained via a brute-force search for the optimal solution.}

	abstract = {Implementing wireless body area networks (WBANs) is very challenging, due to limited power supply, inadequate computation capability, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we propose a hybrid offloading scheme with backscatter communication (BackCom) under imperfect CSI, where each sensor firstly receives radio frequency (RF) energy and then offloads body data task via low-power BackCom to the access point (AP) for edge computing. Aiming to minimize the end-to-end system latency, we jointly optimize the computation speed of AP for processing computation tasks, the power of the signal transmitted by the AP, and the power reflection coefficient under energy and data rate chance constraints. To solve the proposed distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization problem, we approximate chance constraints by the Bernstein-type-inequality (BTI) method and Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method in the Gaussian distribution and arbitrary distribution of channel estimation errors, respectively. To tackle the NP-hard problem efficiently, the original problem can be decomposed into two subproblems, which are solved by successive linear programming and iterative algorithm, respectively. Simulation results show that the CVaR method outperforms the other methods for the non-Gaussian CSI mismatch, and the Bernstein method is more suitable for the Gaussian distribution of CSI errors.}

However, due to the critical challenge of having an intelligent interference coordination between multicast groups along with the cellular network, it is necessary to judiciously perform resource allocation for the combined network. In this work, we present a framework for a joint channel and power allocation strategy to maximize the sum rate of the combined network while guaranteeing minimum rate to individual groups and cellular users. The objective function is augmented by an austerity function that penalizes excessive assignment of low rate channels. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer-non-convex program, which requires exponential complexity to obtain the optimal solution. To tackle this, we exploit fractional programming and integer relaxation to obtain a parametric convex approximation. Based on sequential convex approximation approach, we first propose a centralized algorithm that ensures convergence to a limit point. Next, we propose a distributed algorithm in which via dual decomposition, separable sub-problems are formulated to be solved at the respective groups in cooperation with the base station. We provide convergence guarantees of the proposed solutions and demonstrate their merits by simulations, showing improvement in network throughput.}

	abstract = {In this work, large-scale multiple-antenna systems are investigated, where the base station employs a large antenna array with low-cost and low-power 1-bit analog-to-digital converters. To compensate for the performance loss caused by the coarse quantization, oversampling is applied at the receiver. Unlike existing works that use uniform oversampling, which samples the signal at a constant rate, a novel dynamic oversampling scheme is proposed. The basic idea is to perform time-varying nonuniform oversampling, which selects samples with nonuniform patterns that vary over time. We consider two system design criteria: a design that maximizes the achievable sum rate and another design that minimizes the mean square error of detected symbols. Dynamic oversampling is carried out using a dimension reduction matrix Δ, which can be computed by the generalized eigenvalue decomposition or by novel submatrix-level feature selection algorithms. Moreover, the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of convergence, computational complexity and power consumption at the receiver. Simulations show that systems with the proposed dynamic oversampling outperform those with uniform oversampling in terms of computational cost, achievable sum rate and symbol error rate performance.}

We propose an optimization scheme, including task assignment, power allocation and user association, to minimize energy consumption. Specifically, we transform the probabilistic problem into a non-probabilistic one. To efficiently solve this nonconvex energy minimization problem, we first investigate the one-user two-BS case and derive the optimal closed-form expressions of task assignment and power allocation via the bilevel programming method. Subsequently, based on the derived optimal solution, we propose a low complexity algorithm for the user association in the multi-user multi-BS scenario. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can yield much better performance than the conventional OMA scheme and the identical results with lower complexity from the exhaustive search with the small number of BSs.}

	abstract = {Full-duplex communications have the potential to almost double the spectral efficiency. To realize such a potentiality, the signal separation at base station’s antennas plays an essential role. This article addresses the fundamentals of such separation by proposing a new smart antenna architecture that allows every antenna to be either shared or separated between uplink and downlink transmissions. The benefits of such architecture are investigated by an assignment problem to optimally assign antennas, beamforming and power to maximize the weighted sum spectral efficiency. We propose a near-to-optimal solution using block coordinate descent that divides the problem into assignment problems, which are NP-hard, a beamforming and power allocation problems. The optimal solutions for the beamforming and power allocation are established while near-to-optimal solutions to the assignment problems are derived by semidefinite relaxation. Numerical results indicate that the proposed solution is close to the optimum, and it maintains a similar performance for high and low residual self-interference powers. With respect to the usually assumed antenna separation technique and half-duplex transmission, the sum spectral efficiency gains increase with the number of antennas. We conclude that our proposed smart antenna assignment for signal separation is essential to realize the benefits of multiple antenna full-duplex communications.}

The nonlinearities introduced by the ADCs make the problem challenging: in particular, the existing linear detectors perform poorly. Also, the channel coding used in commercial wireless systems necessitates soft symbol detection to obtain satisfactory performance. In this paper, we present a low-complexity variational Bayesian (VB) inference procedure to jointly solve the (possibly correlated) channel estimation and soft symbol decoding problem. We present the approach in progressively more complex scenarios, including the case where even the channel statistics are not available at the receiver. Finally, we combine our proposed VB procedure with a belief propagation (BP) based channel decoder, which further enhances the performance without any additional complexity. We numerically evaluate the bit error rate (BER) and the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) in the channel estimates obtained by our algorithm as a function of various system parameters, and benchmark the performance against genie-aided and state-of-the-art receivers. The results show that VB procedure is a promising technique for the design of low-complexity advanced receivers in low resolution ADC based systems.}

In this article, we consider nested array-based spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes and propose a line-counting based optimization scheme for minimizing the number of dominant absorbing sets in order to improve its performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Since the parity-check matrices of different nested sub-codes partially overlap, the optimization of one nested sub-code imposes constraints on the optimization of the other sub-codes. To tackle these constraints, a multi-step optimization process is applied first to one of the nested codes, then sequential optimization of the remaining nested codes is carried out based on the constraints imposed by the previously optimized sub-codes. Results show that the order of optimization has a significant impact on the number of dominant absorbing sets in the Tanner graph of the code, resulting in a trade-off between the performance of a nested code structure and its optimization sequence: the code which is optimized without constraints has fewer harmful structures than the code which is optimized with constraints. We also show that for certain code parameters, dominant absorbing sets in the Tanner graphs of all nested codes are completely removed using our proposed optimization strategy.}

There was a notable study on the condition, so called the ` t-value condition', for exponentially few small weight codewords. Meanwhile, it was shown that by introducing degree-one variable nodes, the threshold performances of MET-LDPC code ensembles of low rates can be significantly improved. However, the degree-one variable nodes may result in small weight codewords and thus must be carefully introduced to MET-LDPC code ensembles. Despite the importance, the existing t-value condition was developed only for MET-LDPC code ensembles without degree-one variable nodes. This work extends the t-value condition to MET-LDPC code ensembles with degree-one variable nodes, which includes the existing work as a special case. The extended t-value condition provides useful insights into the contributions of degree-one variable nodes to the distribution of small weight codewords. Thus, the results of this work allow us to design MET-LDPC code ensembles of low rates with both good threshold performances and exponentially few small weight codewords. In addition, it will be demonstrated that MET-LDPC codes at finite lengths based on the designed code ensembles have good error-rate performances both in the waterfall and low-error-rate regions.}

By adding penalty terms to the objective function of the LP decoding model, ADMM variable node (VN) penalized decoding can suppress the non-integral solutions and improve the frame error rate (FER) performance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. In this paper, we propose a novel ADMM check node (CN) penalized decoding algorithm. Codeword solutions which satisfy all parity-check equations will have smaller penalty values than non-codeword solutions, including the non-integral solutions. We discuss the required properties of CN-penalty functions, propose a few functions that satisfy those properties, and study their performance/complexity trade-offs. We also investigate the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that its performance is independent of the transmitted codeword. Using Monte Carlo simulations and instanton analysis, we then demonstrate that the proposed CN-penalized decoder outperforms ADMM VN penalized decoders in both waterfall and error floor regions. This comes at the expense of some increase in the decoding complexity.}

In this work, we first present a novel sequence repetition node corresponding to a particular class of bit sequences. Most existing special node types are special cases of the proposed sequence repetition node. Then, a fast parallel decoder is proposed for this class of node. To further speed up the decoding process of general nodes outside this class, a threshold-based hard-decision-aided scheme is introduced. The threshold value that guarantees a given error-correction performance in the proposed scheme is derived theoretically. Analysis and hardware implementation results on a polar code of length 1024 with code rates 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 show that our proposed algorithm reduces the required clock cycles by up to 8%, and leads to a 10% improvement in the maximum operating frequency compared to state-of-the-art decoders without tangibly altering the error-correction performance. In addition, using the proposed threshold-based hard-decision-aided scheme, the decoding latency can be further reduced by 57% at E b /N 0 = 5.0 dB.}

For Gray labeled square M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, we investigate the optimal delay scheme with the largest spectrum efficiency of DBICM for a fixed maximum number of delayed time slots and a given signal-to-noise ratio. When analyzing the capacity of DBICM, we find two important properties: the capacity improvement due to delayed coded bits being mapped to the real and imaginary parts of the transmitted symbols are independent of each other; a pair of delay schemes with delayed coded bits having identical bit-channel capacity lead to equivalent DBICM capacity. Using these two properties, we efficiently optimize the delay scheme for any uniform Gray-QAM systems. Furthermore, these two properties enable efficient LDPC code designs regarding unequal error protection via bit-channel type classifications. Moreover, we use protograph-based extrinsic information transfer charts to jointly optimize degree distributions and channel assignments of LDPC codes and propose a constrained progressive edge growth like algorithm to jointly construct LDPC codes and bit-interleavers for DBICM, taking distinctive bit-channel's capacity into account. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed LDPC coded DBICM systems significantly outperform LDPC coded BICM systems.}

	abstract = {Age of information (AoI) is gaining attention as a valuable performance metric for many IoT systems, in which a large number of devices report time-stamped updates to a central gateway. This is the case, for instance, of remote sensing, monitoring, or tracking, with broad applications in the industrial, vehicular, and environmental domain. In these settings, AoI provides insights that are complementary to those offered by throughput or latency, capturing the ability of the system to maintain an up-to-date view of the status of each transmitting device. From this standpoint, while a good understanding of the metric has been reached for point-to-point links, relatively little attention has been devoted to the impact that link layer solutions employed in IoT systems may have on AoI. In particular, no result is available for modern random access protocols, which have recently emerged as promising solutions to support massive machine-type communications. To start addressing this gap we provide in this paper the first study of the AoI of a scheme in this family, namely irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA). By means of a Markovian analysis, we track the AoI evolution at the gateway, prove that the process is ergodic, and derive a compact closed form expression for its stationary distribution. Leaning on this, we compute exact formulations for the average AoI and the age violation probability. The study reveals non-trivial design trade-offs for IRSA and highlights the key role played by the protocol operating frame size. Moreover, a comparison with the performance of a simpler slotted ALOHA strategy highlights a remarkable potential for modern random access schemes in terms of information freshness.}

	abstract = {Ultrasonic intra-body communication (IBC) is a promising enabling technology for future healthcare applications, due to low attenuation and medical safety of ultrasonic waves for the human body. A splitting receiver, referred to as the splitting-detection separate-decision (SDSD) receiver, is introduced for ultrasonic pulse-based IBCs, and SDSD can significantly improve bit-error rate (BER) performance over the traditional coherent-detection (CD) and energy detection (ED) receivers. To overcome the high complexity and improve the BER performance of SDSD, a splitting-detection joint-decision (SDJD) receiver is proposed. The core idea of SDJD is to split the received signal into two streams that can be separately processed by CD and ED, and then summed up as joint decision variables to achieve diversity combining. The theoretical channel capacity and BER of the SDSD and SDJD are derived for M-ary pulse position modulation ( M-PPM) and PPM with spreading codes. The derivation takes into account the channel noise, intra-body channel fading, and channel estimation error. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that both SDSD and SDJD can achieve higher channel capacity and lower BER than the CD and ED receivers with perfect channel estimation, while SDJD can achieve the lowest BER with imperfect channel estimation.}

	abstract = {Supporting reliable and seamless connectivity for aerial users, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is one of the key challenges for the next-generation cellular networks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a joint beamforming, user association, and UAV-height control framework for cellular-connected multi-UAV communications. Our objective is to maximize the minimum achievable rate for UAVs subject to co-existing terrestrial users' rate constraints. A hierarchical bi-layer iterative algorithm is devised to solve the problem. By using the projection gradient method in inner layer iterations and the geometric program modeling plus the convex-concave procedure in outer layer iterations, our proposed algorithm is proved to converge to a local optimum. We also examine our proposed algorithm under the practical condition where channel estimation is not perfect. Numerical results show that our proposed joint beamforming, user association, and UAV-height control framework outperforms the conventional nearest UAV association method in terms of UAVs' minimum achievable rate for both perfect and imperfect channel estimation cases. We also observe different UAVs' heights (i.e., between 100m and 300m) do not affect the UAVs' achievable rates. For the case with moving UAV, we also study the trade-off between UAVs' minimum achievable rate and the frequency of updating optimization variables.}

	abstract = {The coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) transmits coded multicast messages from a server to users equipped with caches via a capacitated shared-link and was shown to be information theoretically optimal within a constant multiplicative factor. This work extends the MAN scheme to a class of two-hop wired-wireless networks including one server connected via fronthaul links to a layer of H helper nodes (access points/base stations), which in turn communicate via a wireless access network to K users, each equipped with its own cache. Two variants are considered, which differ in the modeling of the access segment. Both models should be regarded as abstractions at the “network layer” for physical scenarios such as local area networks and cellular networks, spatially distributed over a certain coverage area. The key of our approach consists of routing MAN-type multicast messages through the network and formulating the optimal routing scheme as an optimization problem that can be solved exactly or for which we give powerful heuristic algorithms. Our approach addresses at once many of the open practical problems identified as stumbling blocks for the application of coded caching in practical scenarios, namely: asynchronous streaming sessions, finite file size, scalability of the scheme to large and spatially distributed networks, user mobility and random activity (users joining and leaving the system at arbitrary times), decentralized prefetching of the cache contents, end-to-end encryption of HTTPS requests, which renders the helper nodes oblivious of the users' demands.}

The DP method has complexity O(q (N-M) 2 M), where N and M are the alphabet sizes of the DMC output and quantizer output, respectively. Then, starting from the quadrangle inequality, two techniques are applied to reduce the DP method's complexity. One technique makes use of the Shor-Moran-Aggarwal-Wilber-Klawe (SMAWK) algorithm and achieves complexity O(q (N-M) M). The other technique is much easier to be implemented and achieves complexity O(q (N 2 - M 2 )). We further derive a sufficient condition under which the optimal SDQ is optimal among all quantizers and the two techniques are applicable. This generalizes the results in the literature for binary-input DMC. Next, we show that the cost function of α-mutual information ( α-MI)-maximizing quantizer belongs to the category of C. We further prove that under a weaker condition than the sufficient condition we derived, the aforementioned two techniques are applicable to the design of α-MI-maximizing quantizer. Finally, we illustrate the particular application of our design method to practical pulse-amplitude modulation systems.}

	abstract = {This work considers cache placement for ultra-dense fog radio access networks (F-RANs). In an F-RAN, the fog access points (F-APs) form overlapping clusters based on their geographical locations. A cluster of F-APs then acts as a distributed cache to cooperatively serve user requests. The fronthaul traffic minimization problem is formulated in information-theoretic terms. For the k-association networks, cache placement can be optimized by concatenating an MDS code with a repetition code. By repeating the same packet in some F-APs, multicasting over the fronthaul link can be done in cache placement, which saves energy and bandwidth. Such an idea is applied to both uncoded and coded caching schemes based on hypergraph coloring. Their associated optimization problems are shown to be NP-complete. For the uncoded case, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed, which carefully repeats the subfiles. For the coded case, a heuristic algorithm that minimizes the field size requirement of the MDS repetition scheme is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed uncoded and coded caching schemes during both the cache placement phase and content delivery phase in reducing fronthaul traffic load and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a low-complexity recursive approach for massive and scalable code-domain nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with applications to emerging low-capacity scenarios. The problem definition in this paper is inspired by three major requirements of the next generations of wireless networks. Firstly, the proposed scheme is particularly beneficial in low-capacity regimes which is important in practical scenarios of utmost interest such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC). Secondly, we employ code-domain NOMA to efficiently share the scarce common resources among the users. Finally, the proposed recursive approach enables code-domain NOMA with low-complexity detection algorithms that are scalable with the number of users to satisfy the requirements of massive connectivity. To this end, we propose a novel encoding and decoding scheme for code-domain NOMA based on factorizing the pattern matrix, for assigning the available resource elements to the users, as the Kronecker product of several smaller factor matrices. As a result, both the pattern matrix design at the transmitter side and the mixed symbols' detection at the receiver side can be performed over matrices with dimensions that are much smaller than the overall pattern matrix. Consequently, this leads to significant reduction in both the complexity and the latency of the detection. We present the detection algorithm for the general case of factor matrices. The proposed algorithm involves several recursions each involving certain sets of equations corresponding to a certain factor matrix. We then characterize the system performance in terms of average sum rate, latency, and detection complexity. Our latency and complexity analysis confirm the superiority of our proposed scheme in enabling large pattern matrices. Moreover, our numerical results for the average sum rate show that the proposed scheme provides better performance compared to straightforward code-domain NOMA with comparable complexity, especially at low-capacity regimes.}

	abstract = {Conventional anti-jamming methods mostly rely on frequency hopping to hide or escape from jammers. These approaches are not efficient in terms of bandwidth usage and can also result in a high probability of jamming. Different from existing works, in this article, a novel anti-jamming strategy is proposed based on the idea of deceiving the jammer into attacking a victim channel while maintaining the communications of legitimate users in safe channels. Since the jammer's channel information is not known to the users, an optimal channel selection scheme and a sub-optimal power allocation algorithm are proposed using reinforcement learning (RL). The performance of the proposed anti-jamming technique is evaluated by deriving the statistical lower bound of the total received power (TRP). Analytical results show that, for a given access point, over 50% of the highest achievable TRP, i.e. in the absence of jammers, is achieved for the case of a single user and three frequency channels. Moreover, this value increases with the number of users and available channels. The obtained results are compared with two existing RL based anti-jamming techniques, and a random channel allocation strategy without any jamming attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed anti-jamming method outperforms the compared RL based anti-jamming methods and the random search method, and yields near optimal achievable TRP.}

We evaluate the performance of the proposed receiver system in both simulation experiments and sea trials. Our proposed receiver system comprises of DBN based de-noising and classification of the received signal. First, the received signal is segmented into frames before the each of these frames is individually pre-processed using a novel pixelization algorithm. Then, using the DBN based de-noising algorithm, features are extracted from these frames and used to reconstruct the received signal. Finally, DBN based classification of the reconstructed signal occurs. Our proposed DBN based receiver system does show better performance in channels influenced by the Doppler effect and multi-path propagation with a performance improvement of 13.2dB at 10 −3 Bit Error Rate (BER).}

We aim at maximizing the total completed task-input bits (TCTB) of all UEs with limited energy budgets during a given time slot, through jointly optimizing the RIS reflecting coefficients, the AP's receive beamforming vectors, and the UEs' energy partition strategies for local computing and offloading. A three-step block coordinate descending (BCD) algorithm is first proposed to effectively solve the non-convex TCTB maximization problem with guaranteed convergence. In order to reduce the computational complexity and facilitate lightweight online implementation of the optimization algorithm, we further construct two deep learning architectures. The first one takes channel state information (CSI) as input, while the second one exploits the UEs' locations only for online inference. The two data-driven approaches are trained using data samples generated by the BCD algorithm via supervised learning. Our simulation results reveal a close match between the performance of the optimization-based BCD algorithm and the low-complexity learning-based architectures, all with superior performance to existing schemes in both cases with perfect and imperfect input features. Importantly, the location-only deep learning method is shown to offer a particularly practical and robust solution alleviating the need for CSI estimation and feedback when line-of-sight (LoS) direct links exist between UEs and the AP.}

We formalize the problem using a novel sequential decision-making model named contextual combinatorial volatile multi-armed bandits (MABs), in which each association is considered as an arm, volatility of an arm is imposed by the dynamic arrivals of the users, and context is the additional information linked with the user and the SBS such as user/SBS distance and the transmission frequency. As the next-generation communications are envisioned to take place over highly dynamic links such as the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band, we consider the association problem over an unknown channel distribution with a limited feedback in the form of acknowledgments and under the absence of channel state information (CSI). As the links are unknown and dynamically varying, the assignment problem cannot be solved offline. Thus, we propose an online algorithm which is able to solve the user-SBS association problem in a multi-user and time-varying environment, where the number of users dynamically varies over time. Our algorithm strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation and achieves sublinear in time regret with an optimal dependence on the problem structure and the dynamics of user arrivals and departures. In addition, we demonstrate via numerical experiments that our algorithm achieves significant performance gains compared to several benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is a promising architecture for next generation wireless systems by deploying a very large number of distributed access points (APs), which simultaneously serve a smaller number of user equipments (UEs) over the same time-frequency resources. It guarantees uniformly good service at high spectral efficiency with simple linear precoding techniques and max-min power control. In this article, we propose a new joint maximum-ratio and zero-forcing (JMRZF) precoding scheme, where part of APs are combined to perform centralized zero-forcing (ZF), while other APs apply simple maximum-ratio transmission (MRT). Our proposed precoder offers an adaptable trade-off between the spectral efficiency and front-haul signalling overhead. A corresponding AP subset selection scheme is also proposed which is based on large-scale fading coefficients. A closed-form expression for the achievable spectral efficiency of our proposed scheme is derived, which represents a generalized result including both fully distributed MRT and fully centralized ZF cases. Based on this closed-form expression, max-min power control is formulated and solved via the second order cone and first order methods. The former can obtain the global optimal solution, but its computational complexity is very high. On the other hand, the latter technique is sub-optimal, yet, it has very low computational complexity. Hence, it is suitable for large-scale cell-free massive MIMO systems with hundreds or thousands of APs and users. Numerical results show that our proposed JMRZF scheme can substantially outperform the local precoding schemes, even when a small part of APs are combined to deploy ZF and is implementable even when each AP has very few antennas. In addition, it is shown that our max-min power controls improves the spectral efficiency significantly, compared to the uniform power control scheme.}

	abstract = {Grant-access based legacy networks are unable to deliver Uplink (UL) dominated sporadic transmission of short packets with low signalling overhead, which are the requirements of Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC). Hence, grant-free Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques are more suited for mMTC. Due to the inherent sparsity in the user activity pattern in an mMTC system, the existing literature revolves around Compressive Sensing based Multi User Detection (CS-MUD) algorithms, which employ random or Zadoff-Chu spreading sequences for NOMA. In this paper we explore the utility of sinusoidal spreading sequences, which allow some non-iterative algorithms to be employed in the context of active user detection, channel estimation and data detection in a UL grant-free mMTC system. These algorithms do not need prior knowledge about the user behaviour statistics, noise statistics, and the level of sparsity in the user activity, which might be difficult to obtain at the Base Station (BS). We present a comprehensive performance and complexity analysis to assess the feasibility of our proposal. Extensive numerical trials demonstrate the utility of sinusoidal codes for mMTC.}

	abstract = {The fundamental capacity limits of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multi-user wireless communication systems are investigated in this article. Specifically, the capacity and rate regions for both capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission schemes are characterized by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection matrix and wireless resource allocation under the constraints of a maximum number of IRS reconfiguration times. In NOMA, all users are served in the same resource blocks by employing superposition coding and successive interference cancelation techniques. In OMA, all users are served by being allocated orthogonal resource blocks of different sizes. For NOMA, the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of IRS reconfiguration times is firstly considered, where the optimal solution is obtained by employing the Lagrange duality method. Inspired by this result, an inner bound of the capacity region for the general case with a finite number of IRS reconfiguration times is derived. For OMA, the optimal transmission strategy for the ideal case is to serve each individual user alternatingly with its effective channel power gain maximized. Based on this result, a rate region inner bound for the general case is derived. Finally, numerical results are provided to show that: i) a significant capacity and rate region improvement can be achieved by using IRS; ii) the capacity gain can be further improved by dynamically configuring the IRS reflection matrix.}

We assume that the users are cooperative, however, there is no coordination and communication among them, and the number of users in the system is unknown. We formulate this problem as a multi-player multi-armed bandit problem and propose a decentralized learning algorithm that performs almost optimal exploration of the transmission rates to learn fast. We prove that the regret of our learning algorithm with respect to the optimal allocation increases logarithmically over rounds with a leading term that is logarithmic in the number of transmission rates. Finally, we compare the performance of our learning algorithm with the state-of-the-art via simulations and show that it substantially improves the throughput and minimizes the number of collisions.}

	abstract = {Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology to exploit the new dimension of the power domain to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. However, most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users’ channel gains are quite different, which may be invalid in practice. To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA scheme to introduce desirable channel gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at the RIS. Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station, the phase-shift matrix at the RIS, and user ordering. To address challenge due to the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem under a specific user ordering into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. To accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method. We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering both the channel conditions and users’ target data rates. Simulation results validate the ability of an RIS in enlarging the channel-gain difference when the users’ original channel conditions are similar and the superiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method in reducing the total transmit power.}

	abstract = {To achieve the more significant passive beamforming gain in the double-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided system over the conventional single-IRS counterpart, channel state information (CSI) is indispensable in practice but also more challenging to acquire, due to the presence of not only the single- but also double-reflection links that are intricately coupled and also entail more channel coefficients for estimation. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient channel estimation scheme for the double-IRS aided multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system to resolve the cascaded CSI of both its single- and double-reflection links. First, for the single-user case, the single- and double-reflection channels are efficiently estimated at the multi-antenna base station (BS) with both the IRSs turned ON (for maximal signal reflection), by exploiting the fact that their cascaded channel coefficients are scaled versions of their superimposed lower-dimensional CSI. Then, the proposed channel estimation scheme is extended to the multi-user case, where given an arbitrary user's cascaded channel (estimated as in the single-user case), the other users' cascaded channels can also be expressed as lower-dimensional scaled versions of it and thus efficiently estimated at the BS. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and joint training reflection design for double IRSs, as compared to various benchmark schemes.}

In contrast to existing works, we consider deployments where the receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. This allows us to employ linear combining techniques based on the Min-Max, the maximum ratio and the minimum mean-square error criteria along with Tomlinson-Harashima precoders (THP) for RS-based MU-MIMO systems to enhance the sum-rate performance. Moreover, we incorporate the Multi-Branch (MB) concept into the RS architecture to further improve the sum-rate performance. Closed-form expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the sum-rate at the receiver end are devised through statistical analysis. Simulation results show that the proposed RS-THP schemes achieve better performance than conventional linear and THP precoders.}

	abstract = {Cache optimization, i.e., determining the optimal content placement and routing paths, is essential for obtaining high performance of cache-enabled networks. This paper studies the problem of optimizing system throughput and content delivery cost over cache networks with lossy links (i.e., ICN-based wireless IoT systems), where content is divided into packet-level chunks, and packets may be lost in transmission. We first propose a new performance metric - the expected overall content routing cost for satisfied requests (RCS), for better characterizing content delivery cost under packet losses. RCS at the same time possesses the attractive mathematical property of super-modularity. We then formulate an optimization problem for the task through jointly optimizing content caching and request routing, and analyze it under fixed-routing scenario. The formulated problem is NP-hard and we prove it is reducible to the one of minimizing content routing cost without packet losses. We establish rules for the reduction, and leverage existing efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We also propose a potential-based online algorithm that is simple and adaptive to traffic changes and packet losses. The effectiveness of our mechanism is validated through extensive simulations over a wide array of network topologies.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a cooperative multiple-input single-output (MISO) heterogeneous communication network based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA). We aim to investigate a resource allocation problem regarding the uncertainty of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and the imperfect SIC case. Since there is an essential need for low-complexity algorithms with reasonably good performance for the extremely complex access architectures, we propose two novel methods based on matching game with externalities and successive convex approximation (SCA) to realize the hybrid scheme where the number of the cooperative nodes is variable. Moreover, we propose a new matching utility function to manage the interference caused by cooperative networks and PD-NOMA. We also devise two robust beamforming techniques to cope with the channel uncertainty based on the worst-case and stochastic-case scenarios. Simulation results evaluate the performance and the sensibility of the proposed methods and demonstrate that although the performance of the proposed distributed matching algorithm is slightly inferior to that of the SCA type, the complexity of the matching theory approach is substantially lower than that of the latter one.}

	abstract = {Attaining reliable communications traditionally relies on a closed-loop methodology but inevitably incurs a good amount of networking latency thanks to complicated feedback mechanism and signaling storm. Such a closed-loop methodology thus shackles the current cellular network with a tradeoff between high reliability and low latency. To completely avoid the latency induced by closed-loop communication, this article aims to study how to jointly employ open-loop communication and multi-cell association in a heterogeneous network (HetNet) so as to achieve ultra-reliable and low-latency communications. We first introduce how mobile users in a HetNet adopt the proposed proactive multi-cell association (PMCA) scheme to form their virtual cell that consists of multiple access points (APs) and then analyze the communication reliability and latency performances. We show that the communication reliability can be significantly improved by the PMCA scheme and maximized by optimizing the densities of the users and the APs. The analyses of the uplink and downlink delays are also accomplished, which show that extremely low latency can be fulfilled in the virtual cell of a single user if the PMCA scheme is adopted and the radio resources of each AP are appropriately allocated.}

These codes provide access to hot data through the systematic server containing the object and multiple recovery groups. When a request for an object is received, it can be replicated (forked) to the systematic server and all recovery groups. We first consider the low-traffic regime and present the close-form expression for the download time. By comparison across systems with availability, maximum distance separable (MDS), and replication codes, we demonstrate that availability codes can reduce download time in some settings but are not always optimal. In the high-traffic regime, the system contains multiple inter-dependent Fork-Join queues, making exact analysis intractable. Accordingly, we present upper and lower bounds on the download time, and an M/G/1 queue approximation for several cases of interest. Via extensive numerical simulations, we evaluate our bounds and demonstrate that the M/G/1 queue approximation has a high degree of accuracy.}

	abstract = {We develop a joint offloading and resource allocation framework for a multi-layer cooperative fog computing network, aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of multiple mobile devices subject to their service delay requirements. The resulting optimization involves both binary (offloading decisions) and real variables (resource allocations), making it an NP-hard and computationally intractable problem. To tackle it, we first propose an improved branch-and-bound algorithm (IBBA) that is implemented in a centralized manner. However, due to the large size of the cooperative fog computing network, the computational complexity of the proposed IBBA is relatively high. To speed up the optimal solution searching as well as to enable its distributed implementation, we then leverage the unique structure of the underlying problem and the parallel processing at fog nodes. To that end, we propose a distributed framework, namely feasibility finding Benders decomposition (FFBD), that decomposes the original problem into a master problem for the offloading decision and subproblems for resource allocation. The master problem (MP) is then equipped with powerful cutting-planes to exploit the fact of resource limitation at fog nodes. The subproblems (SP) for resource allocation can find their closed-form solutions using our fast solution detection method. These (simpler) subproblems can then be solved in parallel at fog nodes. The numerical results show that the FFBD always returns the optimal solution of the problem with significantly less computation time (e.g., compared with the centralized IBBA approach). The FFBD with the fast solution detection method, namely FFBD-F, can reduce up to 60% and 90% of computation time, respectively, compared with those of the conventional FFBD, namely FFBD-S, and IBBA.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide an effective solution for improving the coverage, capacity, and the overall performance of terrestrial wireless cellular networks. In particular, UAV-assisted cellular networks can meet the stringent performance requirements of the fifth generation new radio (5G NR) applications. In this article, the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in UAV-assisted cellular networks is studied under the reliability and latency constraints of 5G NR applications. The framework of ruin theory is employed to allow solar-powered UAVs to capture the dynamics of harvested and consumed energies. First, the surplus power of every UAV is modeled, and then it is used to compute the probability of ruin of the UAVs. The probability of ruin denotes the vulnerability of draining out the power of a UAV. Next, the probability of ruin is used for efficient user association with each UAV. Then, power allocation for 5G NR applications is performed to maximize the achievable network rate using the water-filling approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ruin-based scheme can enhance the flight duration up to 61% and the number of served users in a UAV flight by up to 58%, compared to a baseline SINR-based scheme.}

	abstract = {Channel modeling is a challenging vital step towards the development of diffusion-based molecular communication networks (DMCNs). Analytical approaches for diffusion channel modeling are limited to simple and specific geometries and boundary conditions. Also, simulation- and experiment-driven methods are very time-consuming and computationally complex. In this paper, the channel model for DMCN employing the fundamental concentration Green's function (CGF) is characterized. A general homogeneous boundary condition framework is considered that includes any linear reaction systems at the boundaries in the environment. To obtain the CGF for a general DMCN including multiple transmitters, receivers, and other objects with arbitrary geometries and boundary conditions, a semi-analytical method (SAM) is proposed. The CGF linear integral equation (CLIE) is analytically derived. By employing the numerical method of moments, the problem of CGF derivation from CLIE is transformed into an inverse matrix problem. Moreover, a sequential SAM is proposed that converts the inversion problem of a large matrix into multiple smaller matrices reducing the computational complexity. Particle-based simulator confirms the results obtained from the proposed SAM. The convergence and run time for the proposed method are examined. Further, the error probability of a simple diffusion-based molecular communication system is analyzed and examined using the proposed method.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new construction of asymmetric quantum codes (AQCs) by combining classical concatenated codes (CCs) with tensor product codes (TPCs), called asymmetric quantum concatenated and tensor product codes (AQCTPCs) which have the following three advantages. First, only the outer codes in AQCTPCs need to satisfy the orthogonal constraint in quantum codes, and any classical linear code can be used for the inner, which makes AQCTPCs very easy to construct. Second, most AQCTPCs are highly degenerate, which means they can correct many more errors than their classical TPC counterparts. Consequently, we construct several families of AQCs with better parameters than known results in the literature. Third, AQCTPCs can be efficiently decoded although they are degenerate, provided that the inner and outer codes are efficiently decodable. In particular, we significantly reduce the inner decoding complexity of TPCs from\nΩ(\nn\n2\na\nn\n1\n)(a>1)\nto\nO(\nn\n2\n)\nby considering error degeneracy, where\nn\n1\nand\nn\n2\nare the block length of the inner code and the outer code, respectively. Furthermore, we generalize our concatenation scheme by using the generalized CCs and TPCs correspondingly.}

	abstract = {This article investigates the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-antenna covert communications. In particular, with the help of an IRS, a favorable communication environment can be established via controllable intelligent signal reflection, which facilitates the covert communication between a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) and a legitimate full-duplex receiver (Bob) in the existence of a watchful warden (Willie). In order to shelter the desired communication, Bob generates jamming signals with a varying power to confuse Willie. The beamforming vector employed by Alice and the passive phase shifts of the IRS are optimized jointly to maximize the covert rate under the constraints of the successful detection probability at Willie and the communication outage experienced by Bob. We focus on the worst case by characterizing the minimum successful detection probability at Willie. The formulated problem is non-convex, due to the coupling between the beamforming vector of Alice and the phase shifts of the IRS, and the unit modulus constraint on the phase shifts of the IRS. To tackle the above issues, we first employ the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to handle the coupling effect. After that, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to develop an iterative algorithm for locating a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the joint design problem. Moreover, we show that our proposed iterative algorithm can be adapted to handle the multi-antenna Willie case. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm and show the great potential brought by the IRS for covert communications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the dimension of artificial noise (AN) and corresponding transmit power in multiple-input multiple-output single-eavesdropper channels are investigated. It is widely known that AN is transmitted in the null space of the channel matrix of a legitimate link between a source and a destination. Here, the secrecy outage probabilities are derived for various dimensions of AN. Recognizing the fact that the secrecy outage performance depends on the dimension of the AN, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the secrecy rate under a secrecy outage constraint. The optimal power splitting factor between the information and AN signals is then derived. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviors of the optimal power splitting factor and the resulting maximum secrecy rate are examined. Through asymptotic analyses and numerical verification, it is formally shown that the full-dimension AN maximizes the secrecy rate under a secrecy outage constraint. Because the complexity of AN design increases as the dimension of the AN increases, we can achieve a tradeoff between secrecy performance and AN design complexity by determining the dimension of the AN. This study can provide a guideline of AN design specifically pertaining to the dimension of the AN.}

	abstract = {Conventional authentication techniques based on cryptography and computational hardness are facing growing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The dramatically increased security overhead and latency from the inherent computational processing make these conventional static security techniques undesirable for emerging machine communications. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight continuous authentication scheme for identifying multiple resource-constrained IoT devices via their pre-arranged pseudo-random access time sequences. A transmitter will be authenticated as legitimate if and only if its access time sequential order is matched with a pre-agreed unique pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) between itself and the base station. The seed for generating the PRBS between each transceiver pair is acquired by exploiting the channel reciprocity, which is time-varying and difficult for a third party to predict. Hence, the proposed scheme provides seamless protection for legitimate communications by refreshing the seeds adaptively without incurring long latency, complex computation, and high communication overhead. Our results show that the proposed scheme achieves high entropy and low bit mismatch rate. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of our scheme over the existing schemes in quantization performance, authentication performance, and computation cost.}

	abstract = {Surveillance performance is studied for a wireless eavesdropping system, where a full-duplex legitimate monitor eavesdrops a suspicious user's link with artificial noise (AN) assistance. Different from the existing works, the suspicious receiver is assumed to be capable of detecting the presence of AN. Once such receiver detects the AN, the suspicious user will stop transmission, which can therefore degrade the surveillance performance. Hence, to improve the surveillance performance, AN should be transmitted covertly with a low detection probability. Under these assumptions, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the surveillance performance under a covert constraint. Then, based on the detection ability at the suspicious receiver, a novel scheme is proposed to solve the optimization problem using an iterative search. Moreover, we investigate the impact of both the suspicious-transmitter-to-suspicious-receiver and the monitor-to-suspicious-receiver links uncertainties on the covert surveillance performance. Simulations are performed to verify the analyses. We show that the uncertainty in the suspicious user's link can enhance the surveillance performance, while the uncertainty in the monitor-to-suspicious-receiver link can degrade the surveillance performance.}

	abstract = {In conventional hybrid beamforming approaches, the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains is the bottleneck on the achievable spatial multiplexing gain. Recent studies have overcome this limitation by increasing the update-rate of the RF beamformer. This paper presents a framework to design and evaluate such approaches, which we refer to as agile RF beamforming, from theoretical and practical points of view. In this context, we consider the impact of the number of RF-chains, phase shifters' speed, and resolution to design agile RF beamformers. Our analysis and simulations indicate that even an RF-chain-free transmitter, which its beamformer has no RF-chains, can provide a promising performance compared with fully-digital systems and significantly outperform the conventional hybrid beamformers. Then, we show that the phase shifter's limited switching speed can result in signal aliasing, in-band distortion, and out-of-band emissions. We introduce performance metrics and approaches to measure such effects and compare the performance of the proposed agile beamformers using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process. Although this paper aims to present a generic framework for deploying agile RF beamformers, it also presents extensive performance evaluations in communication systems in terms of adjacent channel leakage ratio, sum-rate, power efficiency, error vector magnitude, and bit-error rates.}

	abstract = {MmWave cell-free systems where multiple base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve user using the mmWave band signal have gained much attention recently due to its capability to dramatically improve the system capacity. One potential drawback of mmWave cell-free systems is that an intensive deployment of BSs increases the energy consumption of network substantially. To improve the energy efficiency, acquisition of accurate downlink channel state information (CSI) at the BSs is essential. However, this task is not easy since the CSI feedback overhead scales linearly with the number of antennas as well as the number of BSs. In this paper, we propose an approach to maximize the energy efficiency of mmWave cell-free systems under the limited feedback. Key idea of the proposed energy-efficient dominating path selection (EE-DPS) algorithm is to choose a small number of paths in the angular domain channel and then exploit the channel information of chosen paths in the data precoding and power allocation. By choosing the dominating paths maximizing the energy efficiency and then feeding back the components of chosen paths, we achieve a considerable reduction in the feedback overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that EE-DPS achieves more than 80% energy efficiency improvement over the conventional CSI feedback-based schemes.}

In this article, we analyze the uplink spectral efficiency of a multiuser massive MIMO system with low-resolution ADCs in the context of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) under multipath channels. Firstly, we develop an efficient pilot scheme which results in a constant average power of the quantization noise for different channel delay power spectrums and also minimizes the mean squared error of channel estimation. Then a tight approximation of the uplink achievable rate is derived in a closed form considering both perfect channel state information (CSI) and estimated CSI. Then we analyze the impact of multipath channels on the system performance. Under perfect CSI, we discover that an increment of multipath taps has a positive impact on compensating the performance degradation due to the quantization noise. Under imperfect CSI, the most beneficial channel is uniformly distributed over a specific number of taps. Simulations are conducted to verify our analytical results.}

	abstract = {The performance of the uplink of single and multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems depends crucially on the receiver architecture and the quality of channel state information at the receiver. Therefore, several previous works have developed minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers and proposed balancing the resources spent on acquiring channel state information and transmitting the payload of data packets. Somewhat surprisingly, the most popular MIMO linear MMSE receivers do not exploit the correlation structure that is present in autoregressive Rayleigh fading environments. Therefore, in this article we first develop a new linear receiver that not only takes channel state information errors into account in minimizing the MSE of the received data symbols, but it also utilizes that the subsequent noisy channel coefficients are correlated. For this new linear MMSE receiver, we derive the achieved MSE as a function of the number of receive antennas and the pilot-to-data power ratio. Interestingly, we find that the pilot power that minimizes the MSE of the data symbols does not depend on the number of antennas and that the new linear MMSE receiver outperforms previously proposed MIMO receivers when the autocorrelation coefficient of the channel is high.}

Ultra-Dense Networks (UDNs) will be efficacious in supporting both types of communications. In a UDN, a massive number of low-power and low-cost Small Cells (SCs) are deployed with density higher than that of the HTC users. In such a scenario, the backhaul capacities constitute an intrinsic bottleneck for the system. Hence, we propose a multiple association scheme where each HTC user associates to and activates multiple SCs to overcome the backhaul capacity constraints mainly encountered in the downlink. In addition, having more active cells allows for more MTC devices to be supported by the network. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we formulate a novel mathematical framework investigating the performance of HTC in both downlink and uplink as well as the uplink MTC. Stretched Exponential Path Loss (SEPL) model is considered to practically reflect the UDN environment. Extensive simulations were conducted to verify the accuracy of the mathematical analysis under different system parameters. Results show the existence of an optimum number of SCs to which an HTC user may connect under backhaul capacity constraints. Besides, the proposed multiple-association scheme improves the performance of MTC in terms of both ASE and density of supported devices.}

Subject to power budget constraints, a non-convex constrained optimization problem is firstly formulated to maximize EE of single-user D-MIMO. We propose a near-optimal joint design scheme with the block coordinate descent method, which has an effective iterative algorithm to find optimal BF for fixed PA, and an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach methods to find optimal PA for fixed BF. We also develop a low-complexity suboptimal joint scheme, which has closed-form BF and PA by maximizing an effective signal-to-noise ratio for fixed PA and a derived EE upper bound for fixed BF, respectively. It has lower complexity than the near-optimal scheme with slight performance loss. With these results, two joint design schemes are developed for multiuser D-MIMO. The first scheme can achieve the best performance, while the second one based on closed-form PA and BF has slight performance loss in comparing to that of the former, but with lower complexity. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed schemes over some existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have been recently considered as an energy-efficient solution for future wireless networks due to their fast and low-power configuration, which has increased potential in enabling massive connectivity and low-latency communications. Accurate and low-overhead channel estimation in RIS-based systems is one of the most critical challenges due to the usually large number of RIS unit elements and their distinctive hardware constraints. In this paper, we focus on the uplink of a RIS-empowered multi-user Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) uplink communication systems and propose a channel estimation framework based on the parallel factor decomposition to unfold the resulting cascaded channel model. We present two iterative estimation algorithms for the channels between the base station and RIS, as well as the channels between RIS and users. One is based on alternating least squares (ALS), while the other uses vector approximate message passing to iteratively reconstruct two unknown channels from the estimated vectors. To theoretically assess the performance of the ALS-based algorithm, we derived its estimation Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB). We also discuss the downlink achievable sum rate computation with estimated channels and different precoding schemes for the base station. Our extensive simulation results show that our algorithms outperform benchmark schemes and that the ALS technique achieves the CRB. It is also demonstrated that the sum rate using the estimated channels always reach that of perfect channels under various settings, thus, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed estimation algorithms.}

The proposed framework has the potential of simplifying the cumbersome procedure of analyzing the coverage probability and allowing the unification of single- and multi-antenna networks through compact analytical representations. By harnessing this key feature, we develop a novel statistical machinery to study the scaling laws of wireless networks densification considering general channel power distributions including small-scale fading and shadowing as well as associated beamforming and array gains due to the use of multiple antenna. We further formulate the relationship between network density, antenna height, antenna array seize and carrier frequency showing how the coverage probability can be maintained with ultra-densification. From a system design perspective, we show that, if multiple antenna base stations are deployed at higher frequencies, monotonically increasing the coverage probability by means of ultra-densification is possible, and this without lowering the antenna height. Simulation results substantiate performance trends leveraging network densification and antenna deployment and configuration against path loss models and signal-to-noise plus interference thresholds.}

	abstract = {In this work, we design a generalized joint transmission coordinated multi-point (JT-CoMP)-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) model for a virtualized multi-infrastructure network. In this model, all users benefit from multiple joint transmissions of CoMP thanks to the multi-connectivity opportunity provided by wireless network virtualization (WNV) in multi-infrastructure networks. The NOMA protocol in CoMP results in an unlimited NOMA clustering (UNC) scheme, where the order of each NOMA cluster is the maximum possible value. We show that UNC results in maximum successful interference cancellation (SIC) complexity at users. In this regard, we propose a limited NOMA clustering (LNC) scheme, where the SIC is performed to only a subset of users. We formulate the problem of joint power allocation and user association for the UNC and LNC schemes. Then, one globally and one locally optimal solution are proposed for each problem based on mixed-integer monotonic optimization and sequential programming, respectively. Numerical assessments reveal that WNV and LNC improves users sum-rate and reduces users SIC complexity by up to 35% and 46% compared to the non-virtualized CoMP-NOMA system and UNC model, respectively. Therefore, the proposed algorithms are suitable candidates for the implementation on open and intelligent radio access networks.}

However, due to the intrinsic imaginary inter-carrier/inter-symbol interference of FBMC/OQAM signals, accurate channel estimation and equalization remain open issues for FBMC/OQAM systems in dispersive channels. In this article, two new signal models of the analysis filter bank (AFB) output are first derived in the absence of any channel assumption and in the presence of a relaxed channel assumption, respectively. Based on the new-built models, initial channel estimation with least squares (LS) (IniCE-LS) is presented and its output is used as the initial condition of recursive weighted LS (RWLS) estimation; moreover, non-iterative and iterative channel equalization combined with RWLS channel estimation (i.e., N-ICE-RWLS and ICE-RWLS) are proposed by using the real-time reconstructed FBMC/OQAM data symbols as pilots. The proposed N-ICE-RWLS and ICE-RWLS schemes not only allow to improve channel estimation and equalization performance, but also achieve high transmission efficiency. Considering the requirements of practical application, we further develop the low-complexity implementation methods of N-ICE-RWLS and ICE-RWLS. All these schemes are validated by analyzing the channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER) over various frequency selective channels.}

We derive maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the effective angles from the base station (BS) to the user and the effective angles of propagation from the IRS to the user. It is demonstrated that the accuracy of the estimated angles improves with the number of BS antennas. Also, deploying the IRS closer to the BS increases the accuracy of the estimated angle from the IRS to the user. Then, based on the estimated angles, we propose a joint optimization of BS beamforming and IRS beamforming, which achieves similar performance to two benchmark algorithms based on full CSI and the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method respectively. Simulation results show that the optimized BS beam becomes more focused towards the IRS direction as the number of reflecting elements increases. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form approximation, upper bound and lower bound for the achievable rate. The analytical findings indicate that the achievable rate can be improved by increasing the number of BS antennas or reflecting elements. Specifically, the BS-user link and the BS-IRS-user link can obtain power gains of order N and NM 2 , respectively, where N is the antenna number and M is the number of reflecting elements.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via passive reflection. To reap the promising gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential, whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited channel training resources. In this paper, in order to optimize the performance of IRS-aided multiuser communications with imperfect CSI, we propose to jointly design the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive reflection coefficients of the IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift and also the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of each user is derived assuming a practical IRS channel estimation method, which shows that the interference due to CSI errors is intricately related to the AP transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Next, for the single-user case, by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach method and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method, a new penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected to CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the users' weighted sum-rate. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular, useful insights are drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control (with/without the conventional phase-shift control) on the system performance under imperfect CSI.}

A reduced-edge factor graph is formulated in each consecutive iteration with the aid of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and EC. Based on the simplified factor graph, the EC-IDD gradually reduces its complexity in each subsequent iteration, while improving the bit error rate (BER) performance, compared to the state-of-the-art joint detection and decoding (JDD) of polar-coded SCMA. Furthermore, an embedded decision-directed channel estimator (DD-CE) is proposed for our polar-coded SCMA system under realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI). Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EC-IDD achieves better BER performance than the state-of-the-art JDD under both perfect and imperfect CSI, despite achieving a complexity reduction of 92%. Finally, the BER of the proposed joint DD-CE and EC-IDD algorithm under imperfect CSI converges to that of EC-IDD operating under perfect CSI.}

However, their expected error-detection capability becomes degraded, when we increase the list size of the SCL decoder in order to improve their error-correction performance. In this paper, we propose a configuration design scheme for the SCL decoder and a post-decoding validation check scheme in order to provide a better tradeoff between error-detection and error-correction performance. Firstly, a configuration of the SCL decoder is designed to improve its own error detection capability. Specifically, a part of dynamic frozen bits (also called parity-check bits) is used for path checking during SCL decoding rather than their original purpose of use, path pruning. Furthermore, the number of paths to be checked by the applied cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code is limited. Secondly, a new metric corresponding to the correlation between the received signal vector and the decoded one is presented to check the validity of the decoding result. These proposed schemes are analyzed to provide a proper configuration of the SCL decoder and determine a threshold for post-decoding validation check. Numerical results show that a better tradeoff between error correction and detection is achieved, compared with conventional schemes.}

However, the DM schemes may suffer a rate loss and increase both complexity and latency, when they are not suited for the input bit stream with redundancy. In this paper, a novel PAS strategy is proposed for a joint source and channel coded modulation system, where the residual source redundancy after source coding can be exploited to obtain both shaping and coding gains. It is shown that the residual source redundancy can be controlled by choosing the row weight distribution for source code, thus making the probability distribution of the modulated symbols be optimized under an appropriate interleaver design. To guarantee the error-floor performance, the source code is constrained by predicting the probability distribution of source bits within target finite-length frames. By jointly designing source and channel codes, the residual source redundancy can also be exploited to achieve the coding gain. Compared with the state-of-the-art code pairs, the proposed code pairs have better error-floor performance, and achieve higher coding and shaping gains without suffering from the rate-loss and the latency caused by DM.}

In this paper, we mainly focus on how to use concatenation of SPARCs and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes on the encoding side and use list decoding on the decoding side to improve the finite-length performance of the AMP decoder for SPARCs over complex AWGN channels. Simulation results show that such a concatenated coding scheme works much better than SPARCs with the original AMP decoder and results in a steep waterfall-like behavior in the bit-error rate performance curves. Furthermore, we apply our proposed concatenated coding scheme to spatially coupled SPARCs. Besides that, we also introduce a novel class of design matrices, i.e., matrices that describe the encoding process, based on circulant matrices derived from Frank or from Milewski sequences. This class of design matrices has comparable encoding and decoding computational complexity as well as very close performance with the commonly-used class of design matrices based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices, but gives us more degrees of freedom when designing SPARCs for various applications.}

A low-complexity detection scheme based on log-likelihood ratio criterion is proposed to relieve the high computational complexity of the maximum-likelihood detection at the cost of a negligible performance loss. Upper-bounded bit error rate (BER) and lower-bounded achievable rate are both derived in closed-form to evaluate the performance of JM-OFDM-SNM. To suit different application scenarios, we further propose two enhanced schemes, named adaptive JM-OFDM-SNM (AJM-OFDM-SNM) and JM-OFDM with in-phase/quadrature SNM (JM-OFDM-IQ-SNM), where the former adjusts the constellation orders for different numbers of active subcarriers, and the latter extends the indexing to in-phase and quadrature domains. Simulation results corroborate the tightness of the derived BER expression in the high signal-to-noise ratio region and show that (A)JM-OFDM-SNM improves the performance of OFDM-SNM, while both AJM-OFDM-SNM and JM-OFDM-IQ-SNM schemes perform better than JM-OFDM-SNM at the same SE.}

	abstract = {Long range (LoRa) demonstrates high potential in supporting massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. In this paper, we study the resource allocation in energy harvesting (EH)-enabled LoRa networks with imperfect spreading factor (SF) orthogonality. We maximize the user fairness in terms of the minimum time-averaged throughput while jointly optimizing the SF assignment, the EH time duration, and the transmit power of all LoRa users. First, we provide a general expression of the packet collision time between LoRa users which depends on the SFs and EH duration requirements of each user. Then, we develop two SF allocation schemes that either assure fairness or not for the LoRa users. Within this, we optimize the EH time and the power allocation for single and multiple uplink transmission attempts. For the single uplink transmission attempt, the optimal power allocation is obtained using bisection method. For the multiple uplink transmission attempts, the suboptimal power allocation is derived using concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Our results unearth new findings. Firstly, we demonstrate that the unfair SF allocation algorithm outperforms the others in terms of the minimum data rate. Additionally, we observe that co-SF interference is the main limitation in the throughput performance, and not really energy scarcity.}

	abstract = {Computation over multiple access channel (CoMAC) scheme provides a promising solution to future large-scale wireless networks by utilizing the superposition property of the wireless channel to compute a class of functions with a summation structure (e.g., mean, norm, etc.). However, its implementation usually requires all nodes' channel state information (CSI) and its performance is limited by the channel condition of the worst node. In order to avoid massive CSI aggregation and improve the limited performance, we propose an automatic repeat request (ARQ)-aided CoMAC scheme in this paper. The transmitters and signaling procedures are designed to achieve the tradeoff between the achievable function rate and the transmission delay. The corresponding performance of the proposed ARQ-aided CoMAC scheme and the traditional ARQ-aided communication scheme are compared for both homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks. By optimizing the ARQ level, we further maximize the achievable function rate of the proposed scheme. Asymptotic closed-form expressions are derived by resorting to the extreme value theory and point mass approximation. Monte Carlo simulations are given to illustrate and verify the performance of the proposed designs.}

	abstract = {The use of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter significantly enhances the performance of wireless communication systems. However, the requirement of CSI feedback places an undue burden on the reverse link, especially in links that employ multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where CSI takes the form of a precoding matrix (precoder) for each subcarrier. Typical deployments use quantization and feedback of CSI at certain subcarriers, with interpolation to fill in missing CSI at the transmitter. Past work has used the orthogonal structure of precoders with Flag manifolds for quantization and interpolation of CSI, although interpolation is complicated due to the absence of analytic expressions for geodesics on Flag manifolds. Other approaches have involved the parameterization of the precoder into scalar parameters that are amenable to quantization and interpolation. In this paper, we present efficient methods to quantize and interpolate on Flag manifolds, using both optimal algorithms as well as simplified suboptimal algorithms. Further, we unify these with the parameterization based approaches and show that these translate directly to low-complexity quantization and interpolation on Flag manifolds. Simulations reveal that the proposed precoder quantization and interpolation effectively enhance achievable rates with limited complexity.}

The source is simultaneous wireless information and power transfer enabled, and the relays are capable of both time splitting (TS) and power splitting (PS) based energy harvesting (EH). Contrary to the majority of literature in communication, which uses extreme value theory (EVT) to derive the statistics of extremes of sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables (RVs), we demonstrate how EVT can be used to derive the maximum statistics of sequences of independent and non-identically distributed normalised SNR and hence the distribution of the maximum SNR. Using these results, we derive simple expressions for evaluating the outage capacity, and achievable throughput at the destination. Finally, we present the utility of the results for deciding the optimum TS and PS factors of the hybrid EH relays that maximise outage capacity, and achievable throughput at the destination. Furthermore, we establish the stochastic ordering of the e2e SNR, which in turn allows the characterisation of the variations in the e2e performance with respect to the variations in different system parameters.}

Secondly, the closed-form expressions for the expectation of AMSE ( Exp amse ) and variance of AMSE ( Var amse ) are acquired, where Var amse is inversely proportional to the number of antennas ( M). As M becomes infinite, the PDF of AMSE at Exp amse has an order of root M. When the pilot power decreases with M in a power law, the LS case keeps deteriorating while the MMSE case converges to a constant which basically depends on the Rician K-factor. Next, the spectral efficiency is investigated by considering AMSE. When Exp amse accelerates, the spectral efficiency of the LS method keeps dropping and that of the MMSE method firstly is degraded and then is improved to a constant except Rayleigh fading. Finally, all results are validated via simulations.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we concern the uplink of a massive single-input multiple-output enabled ultra-reliable low-latency communication system, in which a single-antenna transmitter aims to timely and reliably send data to a receiver equipped with a large number of antennas over Rayleigh fading channels. For such a scenario, to eliminate the considerable overhead caused by channel estimation, we adopt a noncoherent maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver, which is known to be optimal in terms of average symbol-error rate for equiprobable discrete input signals. We propose a two-dimensional noncoherent constellation design framework to enhance the reliability of the considered system. Specifically, our design principle is to maximize the minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditional distributions induced by different transmitted signals under average power constraint for any given transmission rate. The resulting optimization problem is shown to be a challenging mixed discrete-continuous problem. We manage to solve the problem by deliberately designing optimal bit allocation and optimal constellation structure as a function of signal-to-noise ratios. We then unveil that the proposed constellation can facilitate efficient ML detection with low computational complexity. Finally, simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme has a superior error performance than conventional training-based schemes and existing energy detection designs.}

The error probability performance is based on an approximation of the minimum Euclidean distance. A numerical power spectral density calculation for this particular SSB modulation in terms of the modulation index is presented. Reasonable tradeoffs in designing modulation schemes have been proposed using multi-objective optimization to ensure sizable improvements in bit error rate (BER), spectral efficiencies, and complexity without losing the property of being a SSB signal. Performance comparisons are made with known CPM schemes, e.g., Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) and Raised Cosine based CPM (RC).}

	abstract = {A novel coding strategy is proposed for a broadcast setting with two transmitter (TX) antennas and two single-antenna receivers (RX). The strategy consists of using space-time block coding to send a common message (to be decoded by both RXs) across the two TX antennas, while each TX antenna also sends a private message to one of the RXs. The relative weight of the private and common messages from each TX antenna is tuned to maximize the instantaneous achievable sum-rate of the channel. Closed-form expressions for the optimal weight factors are derived. In terms of the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) metric, the new scheme is able to achieve the sum-GDoF with finite precision channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) of the two user broadcast channel. Moreover, as opposed to the existing rate-splitting schemes, the proposed scheme yields instantaneous achievable rates that are independent of the channel phases. This property is instrumental for link adaptation when only magnitude CSIT is available. Our numerical results indeed demonstrate the superiority of the scheme for the 2-user setting in case of magnitude CSIT. Extension to a more general K-user scenario is briefly discussed.}

	abstract = {The work establishes the exact performance limits of stochastic coded caching when users share a bounded number of cache states, and when the association between users and caches, is random. Under the premise that more balanced user-to-cache associations perform better than unbalanced ones, our work provides a statistical analysis of the average performance of such networks, identifying in closed form, the exact optimal average delivery time. To insightfully capture this delay, we derive easy-to-compute closed-form analytical bounds that prove tight in the limit of a large number Λ of cache states. In the scenario where delivery involves K users, we conclude that the multiplicative performance deterioration due to randomness - as compared to the well-known deterministic uniform case - can be unbounded and can scale as Θ([log Λ]/[log log Λ]) at K = Θ(Λ ), and that this scaling vanishes when K = Ω(Λ log Λ ). To alleviate this adverse effect of cache-load imbalance, we consider various load-balancing methods, and show that employing proximity-bounded load balancing with an ability to choose from h neighboring caches, the aforementioned scaling reduces to Θ([log(Λ/h)]/[log log(Λ/h)]) at K=Θ(Λ ), while when the proximity constraint is removed, the scaling is of a much slower order Θ(log log Λ ). The above analysis is extensively validated numerically.}

A lower bound for the leading term in the negative logarithm of the distortion, termed the energy-distortion exponent, is derived through an achievable scheme based on high-resolution quantization coupled with orthogonal signaling. The higher-order term in the negative logarithm of the distortion, termed the energy-distortion dispersion, is optimized while keeping the leading term, the energy-distortion exponent, at its optimal (respectively, the best known) value for the zero-delay (respectively, low-delay) regime. In contrast with the decaying dispersion previously reported in the literature, the proposed coding scheme achieves a constant dispersion. When the scheme is optimized, this constant can be improved with respect to its naïve value, i.e., that achieved by optimizing purely the source coding performance instead of the end-to-end distortion. Lastly, a tradeoff of achievable energy-distortion exponents is derived for broadcast scenarios by extending the point-to-point scheme to include a successive refinement source coder coupled with two rounds of orthogonal signaling. A simple parametric computation algorithm is derived for the tradeoff.}

To further improve the Quality-of-Service in these applications, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project has considered the use of terrestrial cellular networks to support UAV sensing services, also known as the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this paper, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs, where the sensory data can be transmitted either to the base station via cellular links, or to the mobile devices by underlay UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications. To evaluate the freshness of the sensory data, the concept of age of information (AoI) is adopted, in which a lower AoI implies fresher data. Since UAVs' AoIs are determined by their trajectories during sensing and transmission, we investigate the AoI minimization problem for UAVs by designing their trajectories. This problem is a Markov decision problem with an infinite state-action space, and thus we utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to approximate the state-action space. Then, we propose a multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a lower AoI than a greedy algorithm, policy gradient algorithm, and overlay U2D scheme.}

First, a rotation-based precoder is developed to solve the above problems independently. Rotation-based precoding is a new precoding and power allocation scheme that beats existing solutions for PHY security and multicasting and is reliable in different antenna settings. Next, a DNN-based precoder is designed to unify the solution for all objectives. The proposed DNN concurrently learns the solutions given by conventional methods, i.e., analytical or rotation-based solutions. A binary vector is designed as an input feature to distinguish the objectives. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional solutions, the proposed DNN-based precoder reduces on-the-fly computational complexity more than an order of magnitude while reaching near-optimal performance (99.45% of the averaged optimal solutions). The new precoder is also more robust to the variations of the numbers of antennas at the receivers.}

	abstract = {Remote classification involves offloading complex object-recognition tasks from mobile devices to servers at the network edge. It brings to the mobile device the capability of discerning hundreds of object classes by using the computational and storage capabilities of the infrastructure. Remote classification is challenged by the finite and variable data rate of the wireless channel, which affects the capability to transfer high-dimensional features and thus limits the classification resolution. We introduce a set of metrics under the name of classification capacity that are defined as the maximum number of classes that can be discerned over a given communication channel while meeting a target probability for classification error. We treat both the cases of a channel where the instantaneous rate is known and unknown. The objective is to choose a subset of classes from a class library that offers satisfactory performance over a given channel. We treat two different cases of subset selection. First, a device can select the subset by pruning the class library until arriving at a subset that meets the targeted error probability while maximizing the classification capacity. Adopting a subspace data model, we prove the equivalence of classification capacity maximization to the problem of packing on the Grassmann manifold. The results show that the classification capacity grows exponentially with the instantaneous communication rate, and super-exponentially with the dimensions of each data cluster. This also holds for ergodic and outage capacities with fading if the instantaneous rate is replaced with an average rate and a fixed rate, respectively. In the second case, a device has a unique preference of class subset for every communication rate, which is modeled as an instance of uniformly sampling the library. Without class selection, the classification capacity and its ergodic and outage counterparts are proved to scale linearly with their corresponding communication rates instead of the exponential growth in the last case.}

	abstract = {In the near future, it is envisioned that cellular networks will have to cope with extensive internet of things (IoT) devices. Therefore, a required feature of cellular IoT will be the capability to serve simultaneously a large number of devices with heterogeneous demands and qualities of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we focus on an overloaded multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) with two groups of CSIT qualities, namely, one group of users (representative of high-end devices) for which the transmitter has partial knowledge of the CSI, the other group of users (representative of IoT devices) for which the transmitter only has knowledge of the statistical CSI (i.e., the distribution information of the user channels). We introduce rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), a new multiple access based on multi-antenna rate-splitting (RS) technique for cellular IoT. Two strategies are proposed, namely, time partitioning-RSMA (TP-RSMA) and power partitioning-RSMA (PP-RSMA). The former independently serves the two groups of users over orthogonal time slots while the latter jointly serves the two groups of users within the same time slot in a non-orthogonal manner. We first show at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that PP-RSMA achieves the optimal degrees-of-freedom (DoF) in an overloaded MISO BC with heterogeneous CSIT qualities. We then show at finite SNR that PP-RSMA achieves explicit sum rate gain over TP-RSMA and all baseline schemes by marrying the benefits of PP and RSMA. Furthermore, PP-RSMA is robust to CSIT inaccuracy and flexible to cope with quality of service (QoS) rate constraints of all users. The DoF and rate analysis helps us in drawing the conclusion that PP-RSMA is a powerful framework for cellular IoT with a large number of devices.}

	abstract = {We consider two users A and B wanting to exchange their messages M A and M B via a relay in a wireless communication network. To this aim, we have two methods: direct forward (DF) and computation and forward (CAF). In the first method, after an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) phase, the receiver decodes the two messages. In the second method, after a NOMA phase, the receiver decodes only the (modulo) sum. In the latter case the capacity region (computation region) is not known. This paper compares the two methods. To such aim, we propose a unified coding framework and identify a lower bound of achievable computation rates. We consider three constellations for the symmetric two-user Gaussian channel with Eisenstein constellation showing highest performance. We also show that a minimum signal-to-noise ratio is required for our CAF method to outperform DF, and we obtain the numerical values of such minimum ratios for the three constellations. Finally, we show achievability of our bounds, which is proved to require affine codes for computation, which has not been proved before. Overall, our results are useful for communication system designers towards practical implementation of multiple access methods in integrated wireless systems.}

We aim to maximize the network spectral efficiency while achieving individual quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, considering imperfect and partial channel state information. The spectral efficiency maximization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and proved to be NP-hard. To make it more tractable, we first solve the coupling between subcarrier assignment and power allocation variables by replacing the product of two variables with one auxiliary variable. We then relax the binary subcarrier assignment variables to integer variables and introduce penalty terms to penalize the objective function. Majorization minimization method is adopted to further handle the coupling between uplink and downlink due to full-duplex transmission. We prove that the proposed joint resource allocation scheme converges to local optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of channel estimation error on spectral efficiency and the superiority of the proposed algorithm.}

Different than the state-of-the-art size-weighted popularity (SWP) and popularity-based caching schemes that assume equal file size, the file PSA caching scheme utilizes knowledge of the file popularity and size distributions to maximize the network average cache hit probability and the network average success probability subject to the available cache capacity. Moreover, the maximization of the network average success probability is shown to be non-convex and dynamic programming and branch and bound algorithms are employed to circumvent its convexity. New expressions for the optimal file caching probabilities that maximize the network average success probability in noise-limited and interference-limited HetNet scenarios are provided which are evaluated using numerical techniques. The results demonstrate that the proposed file PSA caching scheme provides up to 7% gain in the network average success probability compared to the SWP-based scheme. Lastly, the combination of coded caching with cooperative transmission achieves up to 40% gain compared to a non-cooperative transmission scheme without coded caching.}

The received signal is characterized by the conditional Poisson distribution, given the mean photon count following Málaga distributed correlated fading. We consider multi-scattered non-coplanar links and use the stochastic analytical method to model the channel. A system model is developed, utilizing the cooperative diversity drawn from the fact that the users are randomly distributed. A novel centralized cooperative spectrum sensing technique is developed that all the raw data available at each collaborative user are combined at the fusion center to make a decision. Another novel decentralized technique is also proposed where only one-bit information is required to be sent to the fusion center. For this decentralized technique, we propose a unique voting rule that leverages the location flexibility of randomly distributed users with each user experiencing correlated fading. Results demonstrate their effectiveness and provide insights into the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing system. Interestingly, it is also found that the use of the proposed voting rule requires fewer than the total number of collaborative users while satisfying a given error rate, and yields the Bernoulli distributed output of the fusion center.}

Recent efforts to boost the performance of IM/DD LiFi systems include the usage of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology, among which spatial multiplexing (SMX) has gained certain attention. This paper combines coherent detection and spatial multiplexing, and proposes a novel scheme called CD SMX (coherent-detection spatial-multiplexing) LiFi systems to improve LiFi performances. Compared with CD single-input-single-output (SISO) LiFi systems and CD spatial modulation (SM) LiFi systems, the proposed scheme provides a spectral efficiency gain. Unlike IM/DD or radio frequency (RF) SMX systems, the proposed CD SMX LiFi system is free from inter-channel interferences (ICI) due to the matching properties of coherent detection. The performance of the proposed CD SMX system is studied via both theoretical analysis and computer simulations. It is reported that the proposed system achieves a large gain over its IM/DD counterpart, and a moderate gain over a coherent system with SM.}

	abstract = {Covert communication conceals transmission of messages between Alice and Bob from an adversary, Willie, who tries to determine if a transmission took place or not. While covert communication in a basic, standard setting where all variables are known to Willie, results in the well-known square-root law, when a jammer is present and assists Alice by creating uncertainty in Willie's decoder, a strictly positive transmission rate is possible. In this work, we analyze the case where the jammer is equipped with multiple antennas. Specifically, we analyze the effect of multiple antennas at the jammer on Alice's transmission power and consequently on the transmission rate. We consider both the case where the channel knowledge of Willie is known as well as the case where it is unknown. We formulate several optimization problems for the transmission strategies of the jammer to maximize his assistance to Alice, in terms of maximizing Bob's received SNR and consequently the covert rate. When the channel information is known to the jammer, we show that under an achievable covertness scheme, the optimal strategy of the jammer is to perform beamforming towards a single direction with all his available power. This direction though, is not trivial, since it reflects a tradeoff point between minimizing the interference at Bob and maximizing the interference at Willie. When the channel knowledge is unknown, we show that the optimal strategy of the jammer is either to transmit isotropically to all directions or to the null-space of Bob, where this choice depends on certain channel conditions. This is in contrast to current schemes in the literature. Furthermore, we extend the optimization problems to the case where Bob is also equipped with multiple antennas, and provide insightful results, shown to be asymptotically optimal, accompanied by simulations.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising approach for enabling the computation-intensive yet latency-sensitive mobile Internet services in future wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the secrecy based energy-efficient MEC via cooperative Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) transmission. We consider that an edge-computing device (ED) offloads its computation-workload to the edge-computing server (ECS) subject to the overhearing-attack of a malicious eavesdropper. To enhance the secrecy of the ED's offloading transmission, a group of conventional wireless devices (WDs) are scheduled to form a NOMA-transmission group with the ED for sending data to the cellular base station (BS) while providing cooperative jamming to the eavesdropper. We formulate a joint optimization of the ED's offloaded workload, transmit-power, NOMA-transmission duration as well as the selection of the WDs, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of the ED and the selected WDs, while subject to the ED's latency-requirement and the selected WDs' required data-volumes to deliver. Despite the nature of mixed binary and non-convex programming of the formulated problem, we exploit the vertical decomposition and propose a three-layered algorithm for solving it efficiently. To further address the fairness among different WDs, we investigate a system-wise utility maximization problem that accounts for the fairness in the WDs' delivered data and the total energy consumption of the ED and WDs. By exploiting our previously designed layered-algorithm, we further propose a stochastic learning based algorithm for determining each WD's optimal data-volume delivered. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as the performance advantage of the secrecy based computation offloading via NOMA.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted spectrum sharing underlay cognitive radio (CR) wiretap channel (WTC) is studied, and we aim at enhancing the secrecy rate of secondary user in this channel subject to total power constraint at secondary transmitter (ST), interference power constraint (IPC) at primary receiver (PR) as well as unit modulus constraint at IRS. Due to extra IPC and eavesdropper (Eve) are considered, all the existing solutions for enhancing secrecy rate of IRS-assisted non-CR WTC as well as enhancing transmission rate in IRS-assisted CR channel without eavesdropper fail in this work. Therefore, we propose new numerical solutions to optimize the secrecy rate of this channel under full primary, secondary users’ channel state information (CSI) and three different cases of Eve’s CSI: full CSI, imperfect CSI with bounded estimation error, and no CSI. To solve the difficult non-convex optimization problem, an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the beamformer at ST and phase shift coefficients at IRS. In particular, when optimizing the phase shift coefficients during each iteration of AO, a Dinkelbach based solution in combination with successive approximation and penalty based solution is proposed under full CSI and a penalty convex-concave procedure solution is proposed under imperfect Eve’s CSI. For no Eve’s CSI case, artificial noise (AN) aided approach is adopted to help enhancing the secrecy rate. Simulation results show that our proposed solutions for the IRS-assisted design greatly enhance the secrecy performance compared with the existing numerical solutions with and without IRS under full and imperfect Eve’s CSI. And positive secrecy rate can be achieved by our proposed AN aided approach given most channel realizations under no Eve’s CSI case so that secure communication also can be guaranteed. All of the proposed AO algorithms are guaranteed to monotonic convergence.}

	abstract = {Node identification based on unique hardware features like clock skews has been considered an efficient technique in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Spoofing attacks imitating unique hardware features, however, could significantly impair or break down conventional clock-skew-based node identification due to exposed clock information through broadcasting. To defend against Spoofing attacks, we propose a new node identification scheme called node identification against Spoofing attack (NISA). It utilizes the reverse time synchronization framework, where sensor nodes’ clock skews are estimated at the head of a WSN, and the spatially-correlated radio link information to achieve simultaneous node identification and attack detection. We further provide centralized and distributed NISA for covering both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios, the former of which employs a single-input and multiple-output convolutional neural network. With a real WSN testbed consisting of TelosB sensor nodes running TinyOS, we investigate the identifiability of clock skews under temperature and voltage variations and evaluate the performance of both centralized and distributed NISA. Experimental results demonstrate that both centralized and distributed NISA could provide accurate node identification and Spoofing attack detection.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of communicating over a relay-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with additive noise, in which physically separated relays forward quantized information to a central decoder where the transmitted message is to be decoded. We assume that channel state information is available in the transmitter and show that the design of a rational-forcing precoder - a precoder which is matched to the quantizers used in the relays - is beneficial for reducing the symbol error probability. It turns out that for such rational-forcing precoder based systems, there is natural tradeoff between the peak to average power ratio in the transmitter and the rate of communication between the relays and the central decoder. The precoder design problem is formulated mathematically, and several algorithms are developed for realizing this tradeoff. Optimality of the decoder communication rate is shown based on a result in distributed function computation. Numerical and simulation results show that a useful tradeoff can be obtained between the excess decoder communication rate and the peak-average power ratio in the transmitter.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has shown to be a promising modulation technology that achieves the robust wireless transmission in high-mobility environments. The high mobility incurred Doppler effect in OTFS system, is represented as a continuous and relatively large band in the Doppler frequency. It yields the equivalent channel responses (ECRs) in the system change significantly within one symbol block, posing a challenge to channel estimation (CE) or tracking. In order to tackle this issue, in this paper, a set of transform-domain basis functions is designed to span a low-dimensional subspace for modeling the OTFS channel. Then, the CE can be performed by estimating a few projection coefficients of ECRs in the developed subspace, with training pilots. According to the individual transmission characteristic of OTFS signal, we propose a corner-inserted pilot pattern, which targets the low pilot overhead and satisfactory CE performance. Moreover, an OTFS signal detector, leveraging the time-domain channel equalization, linear-complexity interference cancellation and delay-Doppler domain maximal ratio combining detection, is developed to retrieve the transmitted data symbols. The simulations show the precisely estimated ECRs enable the detector to ideally demodulate 256-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signaling, under a velocity of 550 km/h at 5.9 GHz carrier frequency.}

	abstract = {We propose a holographic version of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and investigate its application to terahertz (THz) massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. Capitalizing on the miniaturization of THz electronic components, RISs can be implemented by densely packing sub-wavelength unit cells, so as to realize continuous or quasi-continuous apertures and to enable holographic communications. In this paper, in particular, we derive the beam pattern of a holographic RIS. Our analysis reveals that the beam pattern of an ideal holographic RIS can be well approximated by that of an ultra-dense RIS, which has a more practical hardware architecture. In addition, we propose a closed-loop channel estimation (CE) scheme to effectively estimate the broadband channels that characterize THz massive MIMO systems aided by holographic RISs. The proposed CE scheme includes a downlink coarse CE stage and an uplink finer-grained CE stage. The uplink pilot signals are judiciously designed for obtaining good CE performance. Moreover, to reduce the pilot overhead, we introduce a compressive sensing-based CE algorithm, which exploits the dual sparsity of THz MIMO channels in both the angular domain and delay domain. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of holographic RISs over the non-holographic ones, and the effectiveness of the proposed CE scheme.}

	abstract = {The speed at which millimeter-Wave (mmWave) channel estimation can be carried out is critical for the adoption of mmWave technologies. This is particularly crucial because mmWave transceivers are equipped with large antenna arrays to combat severe path losses, which consequently creates large channel matrices, whose estimation may incur significant overhead. This paper focuses on the mmWave channel estimation problem. Our objective is to reduce the number of measurements required to reliably estimate the channel. Specifically, channel estimation is posed as a “source compression” problem in which measurements mimic an encoded (compressed) version of the channel. Decoding the observed measurements, a task which is traditionally computationally intensive, is performed using a deep-learning-based approach, facilitating a high-performance channel discovery. Our solution not only outperforms state-of-the-art compressed sensing methods, but it also determines the lower bound on the number of measurements required for reliable channel discovery.}

	abstract = {In Massive MIMO base stations (BSs), the hardware design needs to balance high spectral efficiency (SE) with low complexity. The level of hardware impairments (HWIs) indicates how strong the signal distortion introduced by hardware imperfections is. In particular, the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have an important impact on signal distortion and power consumption. This article addresses the fundamental problem of selecting the optimal hardware quality in the Massive MIMO space. In particular, we examine the optimal HWI and ADC bit allocation per BS antenna to maximize the SE. The results show that in co-located arrays with low channel gain variations across antennas, equal ADC bit allocation is optimal. In contrast, cell-free Massive MIMO systems benefit the most from optimizing the ADC bit allocation achieving improvements in the order of 2 [bit-per-channel-use] per user equipment when using regularized zero-forcing (RZF). In addition, when including the impact of power consumption in cell-free Massive MIMO with RZF, allocating low values of mixed ADC bit resolutions across the BS antennas can increase the energy efficiency up to 30% compared to equal ADC bit allocation.}

First, the communication capacity and radar detection performance metrics of these schemes are analytically evaluated.

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is envisioned as a revolutionary technology for future wireless communication systems since it can intelligently change radio environment and integrate it into wireless communication optimization. However, most existing works adopted an ideal IRS reflection model, which is impractical and can cause significant performance degradation in realistic wideband systems. To address this issue, we first study the dual phase- and amplitude-squint effect of reflected signals and present a simplified practical IRS reflection model for wideband signals. Then, an IRS enhanced wideband multiuser multi-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MISO-OFDM) system is investigated. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer and IRS reflection for the case of using both continuous and discrete phase shifters to maximize the average sum-rate over all subcarriers. By exploiting the relationship between sum-rate maximization and mean square error (MSE) minimization, the original problem is equivalently transformed into a multi-block/variable problem, which can be efficiently solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Complexity and convergence for both cases are analyzed or illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can offer significant average sum-rate enhancement compared to that achieved using the ideal IRS reflection model, which confirms the importance of the use of the practical model for the design of wideband systems.}

A major challenge in dense mmWave networks is the interference experienced by the user from the neighboring BSs which limits the density of deployed BSs. A promising solution to this challenge is to adopt user-centric BS cooperation that allows a user to be connected to a set (cluster) of BSs instead of being associated with a single one. In this paper, we investigate the performance of user-centric mmWave networks with dynamic clustering. First, we propose a dynamic clustering model to enable the user-centric BS cooperation. Then, based on the proposed model, we analyze the coverage probability and average spectral efficiency (ASE) performances using stochastic geometry tools. We also propose a BS clustering optimization framework to achieve maximum ASE performance for given network configuration. Finally, numerical and simulation results are provided, showing that the proposed dynamic clustering schemes always outperform static clustering and single-BS selection schemes and yield an optimum system performance for given network parameters.}

In particular, we consider two multiple access schemes for the CUs, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA). For both NOMA and TDMA, the PU sum-rate maximization problems under the minimum CU sum-rate constraint are first simplified by exploring particular problem structure, then are transformed to convex problems, and finally are solved optimally. The PU sum-rates of the two schemes are compared theoretically as well as numerically. It is revealed that the circuit power consumption at the CUs, the required minimum CU sum-rate, and the PU energy harvesting sensitivity and saturation thresholds play key roles in the PU performance comparison of the two schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless powered sensor network (WPSN). Specifically, a power station (PS) provides wireless energy to multiple internet of thing (IoT) devices which supports them to deliver their own messages to an access point (AP). Moreover, we deploy an IRS to enhance the performance of the WPSN by intelligently adjusting the phase shift of each reflecting element. To evaluate the performance of the IRS assisted WPSN, we maximize its sum throughput to jointly optimize the phase shift matrices and the transmission time allocations. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, we first derive the optimal phase shifts of the wireless information transfer (WIT) in closed-form. Consequently, a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxed approach is considered to jointly design the phase shift matrix of the wireless energy transfer (WET) and the transmission time allocations. In addition, we propose a low complexity scheme to gain insights and reduce the computational complexity incurred by the SDP relaxed scheme. Specifically, the optimal solutions of the phase shifts and the transmission time allocation are derived in closed-form by the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, the Lagrange dual method and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the proposed schemes and confirm the beneficial role of the IRS in comparison to the benchmark schemes, where the proposed IRS assisted scheme achieves almost 100% higher sum throughput, in comparison to the counterpart without IRS.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a part of our ground-breaking work on evaluation of buildings in terms of wireless friendliness at the building-design stage. The main goal is to devise building design practices that provide for a good performance of wireless networks deployed in buildings. In this paper, the interference gain (IG) and power gain (PG) are defined as two figures of merit (FoM) of the wireless performance of buildings. The FoMs bridge the gap between building design and wireless communications industries. An approach to derive exact closed-form equations for these FoMs is proposed for the first time. The derived analytic expressions facilitate straightforward and more computationally efficient numerical evaluation of the proposed FoMs as compared to Monte Carlo simulations for well-known indoor propagation models. It is shown that the derived closed-form expression can be readily employed to evaluate the impact of building properties, such as the sizes and the aspect ratios (ARs) of rooms, on the wireless performance. The proposed approach sheds light to architects on evaluation and design of wireless-friendly building layouts.}

To address the above issue, both partially connected RF PSs and low-resolution PSs have been proposed. However, the performance limits of these low-cost designs have not been investigated theoretically. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in their spectral efficiency. To fill this knowledge gap, we derive the mean square error performance discrepancy between an optimal precoder/combiner and the hybrid analog-digital precoder/combiner under the constraint of 1-bit PSs relying on lattice theory. Then, by observing that this performance gap can be reduced by deactivating parts of the PSs whilst improving both the spectral and energy efficiency, we develop an adaptive RF PS connection network. To resolve the associated hybrid precoding and combining problems, we appropriately adapt Babai's algorithm from the lattice decoding literature. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme both in terms of its spectral and energy efficiency.}

However, such advantages come together with significant challenges in channel estimation and data detection due to the severe quantization noise present. In this study, we first derive linear minimum mean-square-error channel estimator for cyclic-prefix (CP) free single carrier MIMO (SC-MIMO) under frequency-selective channel. Then, we propose a novel iterative receiver for quantized CP-free uplink wideband SC-MIMO for uncorrelated or correlated Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. This detector utilizes an efficient message passing algorithm based on Bussgang decomposition, reduced state sequence estimation and Ungerboeck factorization. Therefore, it achieves remarkable complexity reduction and exhibits significant performance advantages compared to the existing quantized SC-MIMO receivers from the literature.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is crucial to modern wireless systems and becomes more and more challenging with the growth of user throughput in sub-6 GHz multiple input multiple output configuration. Plenty of literature spends great efforts in improving the estimation accuracy, while the interpolation schemes are overlooked. To deal with this challenge, we exploit the super-resolution image recovery scheme to model the non-linear interpolation mechanisms. Moreover, in order to extend the estimation scheme into the non-stationary environment which is especially attractive in the coming 6G, we utilize the recurrent network structure to approximate the non-linear channel statistic correlation to model the non-stationary behavior which is difficult to accomplish in the theoretical way. To make it more practical, we offline generate numerical channel coefficients according to the statistical channel models to train the neural networks and directly apply them in different environments. As shown in this paper, the proposed unified super-resolution based channel estimation scheme can outperform the conventional approaches in both stationary and non-stationary scenarios, which we believe can significantly change the current channel estimation method in the near future.}

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate a two-hop decode-and-forward (DF) multicasting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless relay communication system. Different to conventional systems, the radio frequency (RF) energy from the source node is harvested at the relay node and used for forwarding signals to a group of receivers. Considering the structure of the energy harvesting (EH) relay node, we present a power splitting (PS) based protocol and a novel time switching (TS) based protocol by introducing two additional TS factors. For both protocols, we maximize the system mutual information (MI) of the multicasting MIMO relay system by jointly optimizing the source and relay covariance matrices under the constraints of the source energy and the relay harvested energy. In addition, a practical nonlinear EH model is adopted, where the energy harvested by the relay node is bounded as the incident RF signal power increases, and the harvested power is zero when the input power is below the minimum power for harvesting. For the TS based protocol, we also consider peak transmission power constraints at both the source and relay nodes. The performance of the proposed algorithms is verified via numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the novel TS based protocol achieves a larger MI than the conventional TS protocol. The PS and TS based protocols achieve tradeoffs at different source power levels. In particular, compared with the PS based protocol, the proposed novel TS based protocol can reach a higher system MI when the EH bound is not reached, while the former protocol reaches a higher MI when the EH circuit is saturated. We show that the peak harvested energy constraint plays an important role in selecting the optimal location of the relay node.}

	abstract = {In various practical systems, certain data patterns are prone to errors if written or transmitted. In magnetic recording and communication over transmission lines, data patterns causing consecutive transitions that are not sufficiently separated are prone to errors. In Flash memory with two levels per cell, data patterns causing high–low–high charge levels on adjacent cells are prone to errors. Constrained codes are used to eliminate error-prone patterns, and they can also achieve other goals. Recently, we introduced efficient binary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes and asymmetric LOCO (A-LOCO) codes to increase density in magnetic recording systems and lifetime in Flash systems by eliminating the relevant detrimental patterns. Due to their application, LOCO and A-LOCO codes are associated with level-based signaling. Studying the power spectrum of a random signal with certain properties is principal for any storage or transmission system. It reveals important properties such as the average signal power at DC, the bandwidth of the signal, and whether there are discrete power components at certain frequencies. In this paper, we first modify a framework from the literature in order to introduce a method to derive the power spectrum of a sequence of constrained data associated with level-based signaling. We apply our method to infinitely long sequences satisfying symmetric and asymmetric constraints. Next, we show how to generalize the method such that it works for a stream of finite-length codewords as well, thus demonstrating how to overcome the associated finite-length challenges. We use the generalized method to devise closed forms for the spectra of finite-length LOCO and A-LOCO codes from their transition diagrams. Our LOCO and A-LOCO spectral derivations can be performed for any code length and can be extended to other constrained codes. We plot these power spectra, and discuss various important spectral properties for both LOCO and A-LOCO codes. We also briefly discuss an alternative method for deriving the power spectrum and introduce an idea towards reaching the spectra of self-clocked codes.}

	abstract = {Belief propagation (BP) decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with various dynamic decoding schedules have been proposed to improve the efficiency of the conventional flooding schedule. As the ultimate goal of an ideal LDPC code decoder is to have correct bit decisions, a dynamic decoding schedule should be variable node (VN)-centric and be able to find the VNs with probable incorrect decisions and having a good chance to be corrected if chosen for update. We propose a novel and effective metric called conditional innovation (CI) which serves this design goal well. To make the most of dynamic scheduling which produces high-reliability bit decisions, we limit our search for the candidate VNs to those related to the latest updated nodes only. Based on the CI metric and the new search guideline separately or in combination, we develop several highly efficient decoding schedules. To reduce decoding latency, we introduce multi-edge updating versions which offer extra latency-performance tradeoffs. Numerical results show that both single-edge and multi-edge algorithms provide better decoding performance against most dynamic schedules and the CI-based algorithms are particularly impressive at the first few decoding iterations.}

They are recently proven to bear asymmetric signatures; and hence can be efficiently mitigated using improper Gaussian signaling (IGS), thanks to its additional design degrees of freedom. Discrete asymmetric signaling (AS) can practically realize the IGS by shaping the signals’ geometry or probability. In this paper, we adopt the probabilistic shaping (PS) instead of uniform symbols to mitigate the impact of HWDs and derive the optimal maximum a posterior detector. Then, we design the symbols’ probabilities to minimize the error rate performance while accommodating the improper nature of HWD. Although the design problem is a non-convex optimization problem, we simplified it using successive convex programming and propose an iterative algorithm. We further present a hybrid shaping (HS) design to gain the combined benefits of both PS and geometric shaping (GS). Finally, extensive numerical results and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations highlight the superiority of the proposed PS over conventional uniform constellation and GS. Both PS and HS achieve substantial improvements over the traditional uniform constellation and GS with up to one order magnitude in error probability and throughput.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a two-dimensional (2-D) modulation technique that has the potential to overcome the challenges faced by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in high Doppler environments. The performance of OTFS in a multi-user scenario with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques has been impressive. Due to the requirement of massive connectivity in 5G and beyond, it is essential to devise and examine the OTFS system with the existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. This paper proposes a multi-user OTFS system based on a code-domain NOMA technique called sparse code multiple access (SCMA). This system is referred to as the OTFS-SCMA model. The framework for OTFS-SCMA is designed for both downlink and uplink. First, the sparse SCMA codewords are strategically placed on the delay-Doppler plane. The overall overloading factor of the OTFS-SCMA system is equal to that of the underlying basic SCMA system. The receiver in downlink performs the detection in two sequential phases: first, the conventional OTFS detection using the method of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation, and then the SCMA detection. We propose a single-phase detector based on a message-passing algorithm (MPA) to detect multiple users’ symbols for the uplink. The expressions for the asymptotic diversity orders of the proposed OTFS-SCMA system are derived for downlink and uplink. OTFS-SCMA provides a significant diversity gain over other multiple access systems for OTFS. Based on the diversity analysis, an algorithm is proposed to devise an optimal codeword allocation scheme. The performance of the proposed OTFS-SCMA system is validated through extensive simulations both in downlink and uplink. We consider delay-Doppler planes of different parameters and various SCMA systems of overloading factor up to 200%. The performance of OTFS-SCMA is compared with those of the existing OTFS-OMA, OFDM-SCMA and OTFS-power-domain (PD)-NOMA techniques. The analysis of OTFS-SCMA with channel estimation is also presented along with the BER performance.}

We consider scenarios of input Fock and coherent states ensembles and show that the latter always exhibits worse performance than the former. We obtain capacity of a discrete-time Poisson channel as a limiting behavior of the Fock states ensemble capacity. We show also that in the regime of a moderate number of photons and low losses the Fock states ensemble with direct detection is beneficial with respect to capacity limits achievable with quadrature detection.}

	abstract = {The Hurwitz lattice provides the densest four-dimensional packing. This fact has motivated research on four-dimensional Hurwitz signal constellations for optical and wireless communications. This work presents a new algebraic construction of finite sets of Hurwitz integers that is inherently accompanied by a respective modulo operation. These signal constellations are investigated for transmission over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. It is shown that these signal constellations have a better constellation figure of merit and hence a better asymptotic performance over an AWGN channel when compared with conventional signal constellations with algebraic structure, e.g., two-dimensional Gaussian-integer constellations or four-dimensional Lipschitz-integer constellations. We introduce two concepts for set partitioning of the Hurwitz integers. The first method is useful to reduce the computational complexity of the symbol detection. This suboptimum detection approach achieves near-maximum-likelihood performance. In the second case, the partitioning exploits the algebraic structure of the Hurwitz signal constellations. We partition the Hurwitz integers into additive subgroups in a manner that the minimum Euclidean distance of each subgroup is larger than in the original set. This enables multilevel code constructions for the new signal constellations.}

	abstract = {Consider an energy harvesting (EH) sensor that continuously monitors a system and sends time-stamped status update to a destination. The sensor harvests energy from nature and uses it to power its updating operations. The destination keeps track of the system status through the successfully received updates. With the recently introduced information freshness metric “Age of Information” (AoI), our objective is to design optimal online status updating policy to minimize the long-term average AoI at the destination, subject to the energy causality constraint at the sensor. Due to the noisy channel between the sensor and the destination, each transmitted update may be erased with a fixed probability, and the AoI at the destination will be reset to zero only when an update is successfully received. We first consider status updating without feedback available to the sensor and show that the Best-effort Uniform updating (BU) policy is optimal in a broadly defined class of online policies. We then investigate status updating with perfect feedback to the sensor and prove similar optimality of the Best-effort Uniform updating with Retransmission (BUR) policy. In order to prove the optimality of the proposed policies, for each case, we first identify a lower bound on the long-term average AoI among a broad class of online policies, and then construct a sequence of virtual policies to approach the lower bound asymptotically. Since those virtual policies are sub-optimal to the original policy, the original policy is thus optimal.}

Although there has been considerable effort on reducing latency, few attention has been focused on the low-latency transmission of distortion-tolerant data, e.g. IIoT's analog samples, over fading channels. In this paper, we present a cross-layer approach to jointly adapt the transmission power, rate, and compression ratio based on the instantaneous buffer and channel states. In particular, to minimize the average delay under both average power and distortion constraints, we formulate a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with multi-dimensional state and action spaces. A novel solution is then presented by judiciously decomposing the multi-dimensional CMDP into a deterministic hierarchical optimization consisting of a linear programming and a convex optimization problem. Furthermore, we show the optimality of a threshold-based scheduling policy that highly reduces the complexity and present an optimal delay-power-distortion tradeoff that characterizes a fundamental performance tradeoff between the physical, network, and application layers. The joint lossy compression and power allocation scheme realizes a deep cross-layer optimization of source coding, queuing control, and wireless transmission, which outperforms the traditional cross-layer design consisting of only two layers, not to mention layered protocols.}

	abstract = {The key role of spectrum sensing in cognitive radios attracted substantial research attention to improve the performance of detectors. We consider a general model for the receiver noise with the potential of generalization towards modeling noise in various environments. This general noise model describes accurately noise characteristics ranging from the Gaussian noise to the severe impulsive noise. However, many previous studies are based on the ideal Gaussian noise, and they cannot capture the non-Gaussian models. To provide a robust detector against different behaviors of the noise in various environments, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) compatible with different noise models. The proposed CNN detector is data-driven, and due to its single-dimensional input layer, it is consistent with the received signal and requires no pre-processing. The likelihood ratio test (LRT), the Wald, and the Rao tests for this problem are derived to enrich the paper with comparative evaluations of the proposed CNN and conventional model-based approaches and other neural networks. Although various simulated scenarios substantiate the general superiority and robustness of the CNN-based against impulsive noise and mismatch of parameters, it requires higher computational complexity than other discussed detectors.}

However, due to privacy and communication issues, it is not possible to collect this data at a centralized location. Federated learning is a machine learning setting where the centralized location trains a learning model over remote devices. Federated learning algorithms cannot be employed in the real world scenarios unless they consider unreliable and resource-constrained nature of the wireless medium. In this paper, we propose a federated learning algorithm that is suitable for cellular wireless networks. We prove its convergence, and provide a sub-optimal scheduling policy that improves the convergence rate. We also study the effect of local computation steps and communication steps on the convergence of the proposed algorithm. We prove, in practice, federated learning algorithms may solve a different problem than the one that they have been employed for if the unreliability of wireless channels is neglected. Finally, through numerous experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the convergence of our proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based joint classification method to characterize the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) and Doppler shift using spectrogram images, in order to enable efficient adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) designs. It is necessary to maintain high communication performances even in stringent environments where transceivers move at high speed due to the diversification of wireless applications. To optimize the transmission rate in such dynamic environments, AMC scheme is known to be effective. AMC is generally designed based on feedback information (FBI) such as the SNR and Doppler shift acquired on the receiving side. Here, the challenge is an increase in calculation burden, processing delay and estimation accuracy of the FBI. We focused on the spectrogram which is composed of power values in the time and frequency domains. Its two-dimensional fluctuation represents the Doppler shift as well as noise values. In the proposed method, such key information for AMC can be simultaneously extracted from a single spectrogram via a trained CNN. Therefore it is expected to contribute to reducing the computational burden and speeding up the signal processing. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than traditional methods.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and balancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises significantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to minimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update coefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL), that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning error. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster than similar schemes existing in the literature.}

However, little attention has been paid to the theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we investigate the mean square error (MSE) performance of machine learning-based estimation. Hypothesis testing is employed to analyze its MSE upper bound. Furthermore, we build a statistical model for hypothesis testing, which holds when the linear learning module with a low input dimension is used in machine learning-based channel estimation, and derive a clear analytical relation between the size of the training data and performance. Then, we simulate the machine learning-based channel estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to verify our analysis results. Finally, the design considerations for the situation where only limited training data is available are discussed. In this situation, our analysis results can be applied to assess the performance and support the design of machine learning-based channel estimation.}

	abstract = {Wireless connectivity is instrumental in enabling scalable federated learning (FL), yet wireless channels bring challenges for model training, in which channel randomness perturbs each worker’s model update while multiple workers’ updates incur significant interference under limited bandwidth. To address these challenges, in this work we formulate a novel constrained optimization problem, and propose an FL framework harnessing wireless channel perturbations and interference for improving privacy, bandwidth-efficiency, and scalability. The resultant algorithm is coined analog federated ADMM (A-FADMM) based on analog transmissions and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In A-FADMM, all workers upload their model updates to the parameter server (PS) using a single channel via analog transmissions, during which all models are perturbed and aggregated over-the-air. This not only saves communication bandwidth, but also hides each worker’s exact model update trajectory from any eavesdropper including the honest-but-curious PS, thereby preserving data privacy against model inversion attacks. We formally prove the convergence and privacy guarantees of A-FADMM for convex functions under time-varying channels, and numerically show the effectiveness of A-FADMM under noisy channels and stochastic non-convex functions, in terms of convergence speed and scalability, as well as communication bandwidth and energy efficiency.}

In our research, the statistical channel state information (CSI) is exploited to reduce the signaling overhead. To maximize the minimum EE among the neighbouring cells, we design the transmit covariance matrices for each base station (BS). Specifically, optimization schemes for this max-min EE problem are developed, in the centralized and distributed ways, respectively. To obtain the transmit covariance matrices, we first find out the closed-form optimal transmit eigenmatrices for the BS in each cell, and convert the original transmit covariance matrices designing problem into a power allocation one. Then, to lower the computational complexity, we utilize an asymptotic approximation expression for the problem objective. Moreover, for the power allocation design, we adopt the minorization maximization method to address the non-convexity of the ergodic rate, and use Dinkelbach’s transform to convert the max-min fractional problem into a series of convex optimization subproblems. To tackle the transformed subproblems, we propose a centralized iterative water-filling scheme. For reducing the backhaul burden, we further develop a distributed algorithm for the power allocation problem, which requires limited inter-cell information sharing. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by extensive numerical results.}

This work proposes a Viterbi joint sequence detector as well as a 2-symbol joint tag information detector that can resolve a collision between two tags in the physical layer. In sharp contrast to prior art, the proposed closed-form signal model takes into account the asynchrony level between the two collided tag responses, which is not uncommon with commercial, low-cost RFID tags that follow industry’s Gen2 protocol. The asynchrony is considered as the time offset\nτ\nbetween the beginnings of the two tags’ responses and is modeled through a derived shaping matrix that depends on the delayed tag information. Performance evaluation of the proposed detectors with simulated data under Ricean fading, as well as experimental data with software-defined radio, reveals improved performance compared to prior art, under various operating regimes. It is also shown that for different values of the parameter\nτ\n, BER does not present a monotonic behaviour. As a collateral dividend, it is found that clustering techniques on the filtered received signal should explicitly take into account the time offset\nτ\n, since the latter modifies the number of observed clusters.}

	abstract = {The scalability issue hinders the deployment of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) in the Wide Area Networks (WANs). Existing solutions have two issues: (1) network performance relies on complicated controller synchronization, which increases the complexity of network control; (2) fine-grained flow processing enables flexible flow control at the cost of high processing load on the controllers and high flow table occupancy on switches. In this paper, we propose a scalable routing solution named HybridFlow, which achieves a good load balancing performance using a single controller with low control overhead (i.e., flow routing and rerouting overhead). HybridFlow mainly employs two techniques: hybrid routing and crucial flow rerouting. Hybrid routing enabled by commercial SDN switches gives us opportunities to reduce the processing load of the controller by routing flows with the hybrid OpenFlow/OSPF mode. Thus, the majority of flows can be routed by OSPF without involving the controller. Crucial flow rerouting realizes load balancing by dynamically identifying crucial flows based on a new metric called Variation Slope and rerouting these flows with the hybrid OpenFlow/OSPF mode. The simulation based on the real traffic traces and network typologies shows that compared with the optimal solution, HybridFlow can achieve 87% of the optimal load balancing performance by rerouting 36% less flows on average.}

	abstract = {Edge caching is an efficient technique for mitigating redundant data transmissions over backhaul links. Contents are constantly evolving, and thus the cached contents should be updated timely to guarantee freshness. Information freshness is captured by the Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this paper, we explore a content resale problem, where a Network Service Provider (NSP) purchases contents from Content Providers (CPs) then sells contents to users. We model the problem as a three-stage sequential problem. Then we decompose the problem into two sub-problems on deciding the contents to be purchased and cached, and the respective prices. We solve the sub-problems through the framework of Stackelberg game and auction respectively. For the content purchase, we consider four different cases to design the auction mechanisms. In the auctions, the NSP has to reveal its private information due to the AoI characteristics. Furthermore, we prove that such disclosure will not bring the loss of the NSP’s utility. Finally, numerical results in different cases are provided to show that the NSP can efficiently exploit the benefit from the knowledge about CPs’ production costs and the competition among CPs under our proposed mechanism.}

	abstract = {Slotted Aloha provides a simple way for accommodating the massive access of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Yet, the delay performance of slotted Aloha has long been observed to significantly deteriorate as the network size grows. It is therefore important to study how to optimize the delay performance of slotted Aloha in a large-scale network. This paper focuses on the optimization of access delay of a buffered slotted Aloha network, where n nodes transmit to a common receiver in fading channels. Specifically, by deriving the closed-form expressions of the network steady-state points in both unsaturated and saturated conditions, the first and second moments of access delay of each packet are obtained as explicit functions of system parameters, and minimized by optimizing the transmission probability of each node. The analysis shows that to achieve the minimum mean access delay, the transmission probability of each node should be reduced as the network size increases, leading to a diminishing node data rate unless the information encoding rate is jointly optimized. The minimum mean access delay for a given data rate requirement is further characterized, and effects of key parameters such as the minimum required data rate for each node, the mean received signal-to-noise ratio of each packet and the number of nodes on the rate-constrained minimum mean access delay are discussed. The practical insights of the analysis are also demonstrated by taking the example of an LTE-M system with smart grid applications.}

	abstract = {The combination of space division multiplexing technology with elastic optical networks allows to overcome the possible capacity crunch in backbone networks and also improves network flexibility by jointly managing spectral and spatial resources. However, against this background implemented by multi-core fibers, the interaction between spatial modes will appear as signal crosstalk, thereby affecting the service’s transmission quality. Spectrum resources without crosstalk are always preferred for the services to guarantee quality of service, possibly resulting in the spectrum fragmentation. Conversely, if resources with crosstalk are selected for services to reduce fragments, it may lead to serious crosstalk on the services already carried in the adjacent cores. To achieve a tradeoff between these two factors, this paper firstly exploits the association rule mining method to quantitatively analyze the potential correlation between them. By executing FP-growth mining algorithm, rules not beneficial to service provisioning will be filtered out. Then, an association rules-based core and spectrum assignment algorithm is presented, considering transmission requirements for different levels of services. Simulation results indicate the presented strategy can decrease the proportion of services affected by crosstalk and also reduce the possibility of fragments generation. Additionally, it can effectively make improvement on the blocking and resource utilization.}

	abstract = {In intelligent transportation systems, vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is an important technique for data exchange among vehicles and other mobile terminals (MTs) on the roads. In VANET, radio frequency (RF) and visible light communication (VLC) links could cooperate to improve the communication quality of MTs. However, in order to fully exploit the benefits of these two kinds of communication links and improve the VANET performance, a topology control (TC) scheme should be developed to help MTs establish VLC and RF links with their neighbors properly based on the distribution of MTs in the VANET. Since there is usually not a central controller in the VANET, the TC scheme should be conducted locally at each MT. As the size of VANET increases, distributed TC becomes more challenging since MTs usually need to make decisions with only local knowledge about the VANET. In addition, the frequent changes of VANET structure due to MT movements require that the TC scheme can adapt to the dynamic changes quickly. In consideration of those challenges, an adaptive TC scheme is proposed in this paper, aiming to achieve a balance between connectivity and power consumption for MTs in the hybrid VLC/RF VANET. In the proposed TC scheme, MTs can adjust their related links locally and iteratively based on merely its knowledge about the local VANET topology. Moreover, the TC problem is modelled by the coordination game, which guarantees that the proposed TC scheme can converge to a Nash Equilibrium state and can also adapt to the changes in VANET structure dynamically.}

	abstract = {In a software defined network, the controller needs to obtain/collect traffic measurement information ( i.e. , flow statistics) from switches for different applications, such as traffic engineering. Existing solutions seldom consider the per-switch cost, which may lead to heavy statistics collection cost ( e.g. , high CPU overhead) on some switches. Due to limited computing power on most commodity switches, heavy statistics collection cost on those switches may seriously interfere with the basic rule operations, especially when some switches need to deal with many new-arrival flows or update routes of existing flows. To address this challenge, we design and implement efficient flow statistics collection (FSC) with limited interference on the basic rule operations. We formally propose a cooperative flow statistics collection with per-switch cost constraint (CP-FSC) problem. We prove that the CP-FSC problem is NP-hard and present an efficient algorithm with approximation ratio 1/2, based on dynamic programming. To reduce the time complexity, a greedy-based algorithm with approximation ratio 1/3 is also presented. We implement the proposed FSC algorithms on our SDN platform. The experimental results and the extensive simulation results show 36%-59% performance improvement compared with the existing solutions.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel optimization model for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) working simultaneously as relays to help two set of ground users; namely relay users and device-to-device (D2D) users. The relay users are assumed out communication rages from each other and use the UAV link to for their data transmission. While the D2D users are assumed to be nearby users and use the UAV for managing the resources without being involved in the transmission. The goal of the paper is to operate the UAVs in an energy-efficient manner to support the different set of users by i) optimizing the available bandwidth and power allocations of the D2D links, and ii) acting as relays when needed to maintain the communication links between relay users. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the throughput-energy utility while respecting the resource availability including the UAVs’ energy consumption, UAV-user association, and trajectory constraints. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we propose to solve it in three steps using Taylor series approximation. Firstly, we optimize the transmit power of the UAVs and users. Then, we optimize the bandwidth allocation for a given transmit power values. Finally, an efficient heuristic algorithm based on a recursive shrink-and-realign process is proposed to optimize the UAVs’ trajectories. The performance of the proposed method shows advantages in terms of average throughput compared to the fixed power and bandwidth solutions.}

	abstract = {Layered or hybrid optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been proposed for use in optical communications due to its excellent spectral and power efficiencies, especially in visible light communications (VLC). However, most of the current works concentrate on transmitter and receiver design as well as the quality of service in communication networks. In this paper, we propose a spectrum-efficient dimmable triple-layer hybrid optical OFDM (DTH-OFDM) scheme to tackle the illumination requirements, considering different practical indoor VLC scenarios from low illumination to high illumination intensities. In the proposed DTH-OFDM scheme, the required dimming level is achieved by jointly adjusting the dimming factors and direct current bias. We investigate the comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed DTH-OFDM in detail, including probability density function, bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiencies. In addition, a joint dimming control and optimal power allocation problem for DTH-OFDM is formulated and solved using convex optimization under the constraints of light emitting diode (LED) nonlinearity, dimming target and communications reliability. Numerical results show that, the proposed DTH-OFDM can offer continuous and arbitrary dimming target with higher spectral efficiency and lower BER compared with its counterparts, as well as an enhanced tolerance to the LED nonlinearity.}

Based on the simulation of photon distribution, the power distribution at the single-mode fiber end of the PL is quantitatively described as a truncated Gaussian distribution over a simplex. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), bit-error rate (BER), and outage probability of PL based receiver using selection combining (SC), equal-gain combining (EGC), and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) over Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels are analyzed and compared with the single-mode fiber (SMF) receiver and multimode fiber (MMF) receiver. We demonstrate that EGC is the most suitable combining for PL based receiver because the PL power distribution has limited influence on the BER and outage probability when EGC is used and can greatly affect the BER and outage probability when SC is used. Numerical results show that PL based receiver with EGC requires 6 dB less SNR than the SMF receiver and 5.5 dB less SNR than the MMF receiver at BER of 10 −6 in moderate turbulence.}

This work investigates the secrecy performance of a UAV-to-vehicle (UAV-2-V) communication system, where the information delivered over both downlink and uplink between a UAV (\nS\n) acting as a temporary aerial base-station and a legitimate vehicle (\nD\n) moving along a road which is overheard by an eavesdropping vehicle (\nE\n) on the same road. The location of\nS\nis assumed to be uniformly distributed in the sky, while the locations of\nD\nand\nE\nare uniformly distributed on the highway. The statistical characteristics, including the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the received signal-to-noise ratio over both downlink and uplink, are characterized respectively. Closed-form expressions for the approximate and asymptotic secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the downlink experiencing Rician fading channels have been derived accordingly. Moreover, the secrecy outage performance of the uplink is investigated by deriving the closed-form expression of the exact and asymptotic SOP in two cases: the eavesdropping channel suffers Rician and Weibull fading, respectively. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are shown to verify our proposed analytical models.}

	abstract = {Covert transmission is studied for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided communication system, where Alice aims to transmit messages to Bob without being detected by the warden Willie. Specifically, an IRS is used to increase the data rate at Bob under a covert constraint. For the considered model, when Alice is equipped with a single antenna, the transmission power at Alice and phase shift at the IRS are jointly optimized to maximize the covert transmission rate with either instantaneous or partial channel state information (CSI) of Willie's link. In addition, when multiple antennas are deployed at Alice, we formulate a joint transmit beamforming and IRS phase shift optimization problem to maximize the covert transmission rate. One local optimal algorithm and two low-complexity suboptimal algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. Furthermore, for the case of imperfect CSI of Willie's link, the optimization problem is reformulated by using the triangle and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities. The reformulated optimization problems are solved using an alternative algorithm, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and Gaussian randomization techniques. Finally, simulations are performed to verify our analysis. The numerical results show that an IRS can degrade the covert transmission rate when Willie is closer to the IRS than Bob.}

In \\ell\n-SDMM, the goal is to design a joint communication-computation procedure that optimally balances conflicting communication and computation metrics without leaking any information on both \\boldsymbol A\nand \\boldsymbol B\nto any set of \\ell {< }N\nservers. To this end, the user applies coding with \\tilde { \\boldsymbol A}_{i}\nand \\tilde { \\boldsymbol B}_{i}\nrepresenting encoded versions of \\boldsymbol A\nand \\boldsymbol B\ndestined to the i\n-th server. Now, SDMM involves multiple tradeoffs. One such tradeoff is the tradeoff between upload (UL) and download (DL) costs. To find a good balance between these two metrics, we propose two schemes which we term USCSA and GSCSA that are based on secure cross subspace alignment (SCSA). We show that there are various scenarios where they outperform existing SDMM schemes from the literature with respect to UL-DL efficiency. Next, we implement schemes from the literature, including USCSA and GSCSA, and test their performance on Amazon EC2. Our numerical results show that USCSA and GSCSA establish a good balance between the time spent on the communication and computation in SDMMs. This is because they combine advantages of polynomial codes, namely low time for the upload of \\tilde { \\boldsymbol A}_{i}\nand \\tilde { \\boldsymbol B}_{i}\n, i\\in [1:N]\n, and the computation of \\boldsymbol O_{i}=\\tilde { \\boldsymbol A}_{i}\\tilde { \\boldsymbol B}_{i}\n, with those of SCSA, being a low timing overhead for the download of \\boldsymbol O_{i}\n, i\\in [1:N]\n, and the decoding of \\boldsymbol A \\boldsymbol B\n.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the security problem of a multi-eavesdrop multiple-input-single-output (MISO) wiretap channel, where an N-antenna transmitter communicates with a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple single-antenna smart eavesdroppers. To overcome the security risk of the traditional secure constructive interference-based (CI-based) scheme when facing the smart eavesdroppers, we propose a novel deception scheme (DS) via a random transmission strategy, where the eavesdroppers are expected to decode the deception symbols correctly but unable to distinguish the authenticity of the decoded symbol. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed for the deception signal-to interference-plus-noise (SINR)-balancing problem when perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed. Furthermore, we consider a practical scenario where only imperfect CSI is available, and explore two different methods for the deception optimization problem, i.e., convexification relaxation approach (CRA) and Lagrangian relaxation approach (LRA), respectively. For both CSI cases, a closed-form solution to the considered CI-based deception scheme is obtained. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional secure precoding schemes, and also demonstrate the significant computation efficiency improvements for the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a multi-sine multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) system with the objective to increase the output DC power. We jointly optimize the multi-sine waveform and beamforming accounting for the rectenna nonlinearity, and consider two combining schemes for the rectennas at the receiver, namely DC and RF combinings. For DC combining, the waveform and transmit beamforming are optimized, as a function of the channel state information (CSI). For RF combining, the optimal transmit and receive beamformings are provided in closed form and the waveform is optimized. We also consider a practical RF combining circuit using phase shifter and RF power combiner and optimize the waveform, transmit beamforming, and analog receive beamforming adaptive to the CSI. Two types of performance evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and accurate and realistic circuit simulations, are provided. The evaluations demonstrate that the joint waveform and beamforming design can increase the output DC power by leveraging the beamforming gain, the frequency diversity gain, and the rectenna nonlinearity. It also shows that the joint waveform and beamforming design provides a higher output DC power than the beamforming-only design with a relative gain of 180% in a two-transmit antenna sixteen-sinewave two-receive antenna setup.}

In particular, we study non-coherent detectors based on memory-bits-based thresholds in order to achieve low bit-error-ratio (BER) transmission. The main challenge of realizing detectors based on memory-bits-based thresholds is to obtain the channel state information based only on the received signals. We tackle this issue by reformulating the thresholds through intermediate variables, which can be obtained by clustering multi-dimensional data from the received signals, and by using the K-means clustering algorithm. In addition to estimating the thresholds, we show that the transmitted bits can be retrieved from the clustered data. To reduce clustering errors, we propose iterative clustering methods from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional data, which are shown to reduce the BER. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the problem of developing an efficient signal sampling framework for distributed blind spectrum sensing, together with the corresponding local cognitive radio (CR) decision and fusion rules. A novel collaborative sampling and binary output (CSBO) generating scheme is proposed to overcome the disadvantage of traditional energy detectors for blind spectrum sensing, in which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and level of noise power at the CRs are unknown and thus the decision threshold of local energy detectors cannot be specified. In designing the fusion rule in conjunction with the proposed CSBO scheme, both fixed-sample-size tests and sequential tests are considered. It is theoretically shown that the proposed CSBO scheme outperforms traditional blind cooperative energy detectors with uniform sampling schemes in terms of its ability to increase the amount of information acquired under a given number of samples. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analyses, and demonstrate that, compared with the fixed-sample-size test, the sequential test requires fewer observations on average to achieve comparable detection performance. The reduction in the expected sample size needed in the sequential CSBO test when compared to the fixed-sample-size CSBO can reach 50% when primary signal is present.}

This concept yields a Minimum Mean-Square-Error equalizer for InterSymbol Interference (ISI) processing combined with a block which we call Constellation Matcher in charge of the symbol estimates realignment with the constellation. From this framework, we explore different scheduling strategies leading to iterative EP-based receivers with our without decision feedback. Then, by extending the family of the EP process to a subset of non-circular Gaussian distributions results in a Widely Linear (WL) equalization. This new WL-EP receiver best fits the CFTN model, allowing enhanced performance at the cost of a slightly increased complexity. Also, we propose to restrict the Gaussian family to circular Gaussian distributions with identity covariance matrices up to a scaling factor. Combined with CFTN, this particular family allows a low-complexity Frequency-Domain processing of the equalization without requiring any cyclic prefix. The proposed EP-based receivers for CFTN are then evaluated for different spectral efficiencies and computational complexities. Our simulations show that they completely handle the ISI up to 5 bits/s/Hz and double the spectral efficiency compared to Nyquist signaling with almost no performance loss.}

As a newly conceived DFRC system, many realistic issues, such as channel estimation and synchronization, are not effectively solved yet. In this paper, we develop a multi-antenna receiver-based downlink communication scheme for the FH-MIMO DFRC, addressing the above issues in multi-path channels. By exploring the unique FH-MIMO radar waveform, we suppress both inter-antenna and inter-hop interference, and introduce minimal constraints on the radar waveform to facilitate DFRC. We then develop accurate estimation methods for timing offset and channel parameters. These methods are further employed to design reliable demodulation methods. We also derive performance bounds for the proposed estimation methods and embedded communications. Simulation results validate the efficacy of our receiving scheme, showing that the performance of estimators and data communications approaches analytical bounds.}

We derive closed-form expressions for the fundamental statistics of the \\kappa - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading model, such as the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF). Additionally, we solve the associated integral that is commonly used to obtain the moment generating function (MGF) of statistical distributions to provide an MGF-type function which is valid for performance analysis over the specified parameter space. Analytic expressions for the PDF, higher order moments and AF are also derived for the \\eta - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading model, while infinite series expressions are obtained for the corresponding CDF and MGF-type function. The suitability of the new models for characterizing composite fading channels is demonstrated through a series of extensive field measurements for wearable, cellular, and vehicular communications. For all of the measurements, two propagation geometry problems with special relevance to the two new composite fading models, namely the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) channel conditions, are considered. It is found that both the \\kappa - \\mu / inverse gamma and \\eta - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading models provide an excellent fit to fading conditions encountered in the field. The goodness-of-fit of these two composite fading models is also evaluated and compared using the resistor-average distance. As a result, it is shown that the \\kappa - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading model provides a better fit compared to the \\eta - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading model when strong dominant signal components exist. On the contrary, the \\eta - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading model outperforms the \\kappa - \\mu / inverse gamma composite fading model when there is no strong dominant signal component and/or the parameter \\eta is not equal to unity, indicating that the scattered wave power of the in-phase and quadrature components of each cluster of multipath are not identical.}

The modified Cramér-Rao vector bounds (MCRVB) are chosen as the benchmark of symbol timing offset and frequency offset estimation problem, which can be viewed as the time and frequency synchronization performance metric for the broad coverage precoder design. By considering the minimax MCRVB criterion and the per-antenna equal power constraint, the precoder design approach is formulated as the non-convex constrained minimax problem over the discrete radiation power pattern. This optimization problem is solved by the smoothing techniques combined with the manifold optimization method. To reduce the calculation complexity, the nonmonotone conjugate gradient method is applied. Simulation results show that the average and the minimum received powers in the coverage area of the proposed scheme are higher than those of the scheme based on fairness criterion. Compared with the existing omnidirectional and broad coverage schemes, the proposed scheme has the best synchronization performance among all the contrast solutions.}

	abstract = {In industrial internet of things (IIoT), ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is proposed to guarantee the requirement of real-time wireless control systems in worst case, so as to maintain the system working in all cases. However, it is extremely challenging to maintain URLLC throughout the whole control process due to the scarcity of wireless resource. This paper develops an autonomous device-to-device (D2D) communication scheme by jointly considering reliability in URLLC and control requirement. In the proposed scheme, we consider the actual control requirement, i.e., control convergence rate, into communication design, where we find that it can be converted into a constraint on communication reliability. Then, the communication reliability constraint comes from control aspect, instead of URLLC, which leads to that the system does not need to guarantee worst case in URLLC. Second, the sensors autonomously decide whether to be activated with optimal probabilities to participate in the control process, which can maintain the communication reliability requirement with significantly less resource consumption. Simulation results show remarkable performance gain of our method. For instance, compared with fixed activation probability 40% only considering URLLC, the average power consumption of the proposed method can be reduced by at most about 100%.}

The analysis accounts for the main factors that affect the system performance, such as the UAV height, air bubbles, temperature gradient, water salinity variations, detection techniques, and pointing errors. Employing the fixed-gain AF and DF relays, expressions for some key performance metrics are derived, e.g., outage probability (OP), average bit error rate (ABER), and average channel capacity. Moreover, in order to get further insights, asymptotic analyses for the OP and ABER are also carried out. Additionally, for the two relaying systems, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal UAV altitude that minimizes the OP. Simulation results show that the UAV altitude influences the system performance and there is an optimal altitude which ensures a minimum OP. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the diversity order of the fixed-gain AF relaying depends on the RF link and pointing errors, while the diversity order of the DF relaying depends on the detection techniques and pointing errors.}

The path-loss is formulated in terms of a computable integral that depends on the transmission distances, the polarization of the radio waves, the size of the surface, and the desired surface transformations. Closed-form expressions are obtained in two asymptotic regimes that are representative of far-field and near-field deployments.

In this paper, a SWIPT-enhanced cell-free massive MIMO network is proposed. In such a network, a large set of spatially distributed access points (APs) interconnected via a central processing unit (CPU) can collaboratively serve a large number of both energy harvesting mobile stations (MSs) (requiring wireless energy transfer) and conventional MSs (not requiring wireless energy transfer) on the same time-frequency resources. We consider spatially correlated Rician fading channels and the use of different precoding schemes that are based on different channel estimators differing on the assumed knowledge of the line-of-sight component. Mathematically manageable expressions are derived for the harvested energy during the downlink (DL) energy harvesting phase and the achievable spectral and energy efficiencies during the uplink (UL) payload transmission phase. A coupled UL/DL optimization problem is formulated aiming at finding the power control coefficients that maximize the minimum of the weighted achievable UL signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of all MSs. Extensive numerical results are presented that serve to highlight the existing trade-offs among the achievable spectral and energy efficiencies, the harvested energy, the energy dedicated to UL pilot transmission or the system configuration.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted two-way relay network, in which two users exchange information through the base station (BS) with the help of an RIS. By jointly designing the phase shifts at the RIS and beamforming matrix at the BS, our objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the two users, under the transmit power constraint at the BS. We first consider the single-antenna BS case, and propose two algorithms to design the RIS phase shifts and the BS power amplification parameter, namely the SNR-upper-bound-maximization (SUM) method, and genetic-SNR-maximization (GSM) method. When there are multiple antennas at the BS, the optimization problem can be approximately addressed by successively solving two decoupled subproblems, one to optimize the RIS phase shifts, the other to optimize the BS beamforming matrix. The first subproblem can be solved by using SUM or GSM method, while the second subproblem can be solved by using optimized beamforming or maximum-ratio-beamforming method. The proposed algorithms have been verified through numerical results with computational complexity analysis.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of the so-called Internet of Things is expected to significantly expand and support the deployment of resource-limited devices. Therefore, intelligent scheduling protocols and technologies such as wireless power transfer, are important for the efficient implementation of these massive low-powered networks. This paper studies the performance of a wireless powered communication network, where multiple batteryless devices harvest radio-frequency from a dedicated transmitter in order to communicate with a common information receiver (IR). We investigate several novel selection schemes, corresponding to different channel state information requirements and implementation complexities. In particular, each scheme schedules the\nk\n-th best device based on: a) the end-to-end (e2e) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), b) the energy harvested at the devices, c) the uplink transmission to the IR, and d) the conventional/legacy max-min selection policy. We consider a non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of each selection scheme by using tools from high order statistics. Moreover, an asymptotic scenario in terms of the number of devices is considered and, by applying extreme value theory, the system’s performance is evaluated. We derive a complete analytical framework that provides useful insights for the design and realization of such networks.}

The encoding is to “mix together” a pair of basic codes by superposition, while the decoding can be implemented as a successive cancellation list decoding algorithm. The most significant features of the TPST code are its predictable performance that can be estimated numerically from the basic codes and its flexible construction in the sense that it can be easily adapted to different coding rates. To construct good TPST codes in the finite length regime, we propose two design approaches – rate allocation and partial superposition. By taking tail-biting convolutional codes (TBCC) as basic codes, we show by numerical results that the constructed TPST-TBCCs have performance close to the random coding union bound in the short length regime.}

In particular, increasing the computation load in the Map phase by a factor of r can create coded multicasting opportunities to reduce the communication load in the Shuffle phase by the same factor. However, the CDC scheme is designed for the homogeneous settings, where each node maps the same number of files and is assigned the same number of reduce functions. It requires an exponentially large number of input files (data batches), reduce functions and multicasting groups relative to the number of nodes to achieve the promised gain. We address the CDC limitations by proposing a novel CDC approach based on a combinatorial design, which accommodates heterogeneous networks and maintains a multiplicative computation-communication trade-off. In addition, the proposed approach requires an exponentially less number of input files compared to the original CDC scheme proposed by Li et al. Finally, we derive a new information theoretic converse for general heterogeneous CDC and show that the communication load of the proposed design is optimal within a constant factor.}

In particular, coded distributed computing (CDC) introduced by Li et al. can efficiently trade computation resources to reduce the communication load in MapReduce like computing systems. For the more general cascaded CDC, Map computations are repeated at r nodes to significantly reduce the communication load among nodes tasked with computing Q Reduce functions s times. In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity combinatorial design for cascaded CDC which 1) determines both input file and output function assignments, 2) requires significantly less number of input files and output functions, and 3) operates on heterogeneous networks where nodes have varying storage and computing capabilities. We provide an analytical characterization of the computation-communication tradeoff, from which we show the proposed scheme can outperform the state-of-the-art scheme proposed by Li et al. for the homogeneous networks. Further, when the network is heterogeneous, we show that the performance of the proposed scheme can be better than its homogeneous counterpart. In addition, the proposed scheme is optimal within a constant factor of the information theoretic converse bound while fixing the input file and the output function assignments.}

	abstract = {Shaped polar codes were recently proposed to improve the spectral efficiency of polar coded modulation, based on probabilistic shaping. The key principle for them is to adjust the probability of occurrence of 1's in each codeword by introducing the shaping bits, which makes the distribution of modulated symbols close to the Gaussian distribution. But, they have a serious problem from a practical viewpoint, since additional polar decoding is required to determine the shaping bits. In this paper, we investigate an algebraic approach to the design of structurally shaped polar codes. We first select a shaping set in an algebraic and systematic way and determine the shaping bits by using simple binary and integer operations without any additional polar decoding. We then propose a method to construct structurally shaped polar codes, and analyze their shaped probability in an approximate way. Finally, we present the encoding and decoding procedures for the proposed shaped polar codes. Numerical results show that the proposed shaping scheme has similar performance than the conventional shaping scheme regardless of whether cyclic redundancy check is employed, while the former can be implemented in an extremely simpler way than the latter.}

	abstract = {An information source generates independent and identically distributed status update messages from an observed random phenomenon which takes n distinct values based on a given probability mass function (PMF). These update packets are encoded at the transmitter node to be sent to a receiver node which wants to track the observed random variable with as little age as possible. The transmitter node implements a selective k encoding policy such that rather than encoding all possible n realizations, the transmitter node encodes the most probable k realizations. We consider three different policies regarding the remaining n-k less probable realizations: highest k selective encoding which disregards whenever a realization from the remaining n-k values occurs; randomized selective encoding which encodes and sends the remaining n-k realizations with a certain probability to further inform the receiver node at the expense of longer codewords for the selected k realizations; and highest k selective encoding with an empty symbol which sends a designated empty symbol when one of the remaining n-k realizations occurs. For all of these three encoding schemes, we find the average age and determine the age-optimal real codeword lengths, including the codeword length for the empty symbol in the case of the latter scheme, such that the average age at the receiver node is minimized. Through numerical evaluations for arbitrary PMFs, we show that these selective encoding policies result in a lower average age than encoding every realization, and find the corresponding age-optimal k values. Since we focus on real-valued codeword lengths in this paper, the resulting age value obtained in each case studied here serves as a lower bound to what can be attained by integer-valued codeword lengths in that case.}

	abstract = {Cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) enable a network platform for beyond the fifth generation of communication networks (B5G), which incorporates the advances in cloud computing technologies to modern radio access networks. Recently, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA), relying on multi-antenna rate splitting (RS) at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, has been shown to manage the interference in multi-antenna communication networks efficiently. This paper considers applying RSMA in C-RAN. We address the practical challenge of a transmitter that only knows the statistical channel state information (CSI) of the users. To this end, the paper investigates the problem of stochastic coordinated beamforming (SCB) optimization to maximize the ergodic sum-rate (ESR) in the network. Furthermore, we propose a scalable and robust RS scheme where the number of the common streams to be decoded at each user scales linearly with the number of users, and the common stream selection only depends on the statistical CSI. The setup leads to a challenging stochastic and non-convex optimization problem. A sample average approximation (SAA) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) based algorithm is adopted to tackle the intractable stochastic non-convex optimization and guarantee convergence to a stationary point asymptotically. The numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RS strategy and show a gain up to 27% in the achievable ESR compared with state-of-the-art schemes, namely treating interference as noise (TIN) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes.}

	abstract = {LoRa is a modulation technology for low power wide area networks (LPWAN) with enormous potential in 5G era. However, the performance of LoRa system deteriorates seriously in fading-channel environments. To tackle this problem, in this paper we introduce multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration employing space-time block coding (STBC) schemes into the LoRa system to formulate an STBC-MIMO LoRa system. Then, we investigate the theoretical performance of the proposed system over Rayleigh fading channels. To this end, we derive the distribution of the decision metric for the demodulator in the proposed system. Based on the above distribution, we propose a closed-form approximate BER expression of the proposed system when perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are considered. Furthermore, we analyze the diversity order and the throughput of the proposed system. The results of the diversity analysis demonstrate that the diversity order of the system in the imperfect CSI scenario with fixed channel estimate error variance is zero. However, in the imperfect CSI scenario with a decreasing channel estimate error variance and the perfect CSI scenario, the system can achieve full diversity. In addition, the results of the throughput analysis show that the throughput of the proposed system is little affected by CSI conditions. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the excellent performance of the proposed system. Due to such superiority, the proposed STBC-MIMO LoRa system can be considered as a good scheme for LPWAN.}

	abstract = {In this work, Generalized Space-Time Super-Modulation (GSTSM) is introduced which enables the transmission of an additional flexible-rate and highly-reliable information stream concurrently with the conventionally transmitted symbols, without the need for increasing the corresponding packet length. This is attained by jointly exploiting the spatial and temporal dimensions of multiple-antenna systems, which enables efficient detection for conventional and additional information subchannels even in highly correlated channel conditions or AWGN channels. In the context of machine-type communications, GSTSM enables grant-free medium access without transmitting additional headers to convey each machine's signature information. Hence, it is shown that even at an extreme case where the data packets of two users are always colliding, GSTSM offers throughput gains of up to 33% compared to the best examined header-based scheme. For the same scenario, it is shown that GSTSM based on joint multi-user detection provides throughput gains of up to 2.5× compared with the case where users' signals are detected independently. In addition, it yields over 90% improvement in achievable rates compared with the schemes that require centralized medium-access coordination. For both joint and independent signal detection schemes, it is also shown that adopting an iterative detection/decoding approach allows to further improve the throughput gains.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is expected to play a central role in next generation mobile systems (5G) and beyond, by providing multi-Gbps data rates. However, the severe pathloss and sensitivity to blockages at mmWave frequencies significantly challenge practical implementations. One effective way to mitigate these effects and to increase the communication range is beamforming in combination with relaying. In this paper, we study the beam scheduling problem for mmWave half-duplex (HD) relay networks, where the relay topology can be arbitrary. Based on theoretically optimal scheduling results, we first implement a network simplification procedure to reduce the network topology complexity, and then propose two practically relevant beam scheduling schemes: the deterministic edge coloring (EC) scheduler and the adaptive backpressure (BP) scheduler. The former consists of a very simple one-time computation of the sequence of scheduling states, which is then repeated periodically. The one-time computation depends on the underlying network topology, and therefore it must be repeated when such topology changes. As such, this approach is more suited to quasi-static scenarios. The latter is an “online” approach which updates scheduling weights and solves at each time slots a weighted sum rate maximization. Hence, it's computational complexity may be significantly higher than that of EC, but it is better suited to dynamic time-varying scenarios. With the aid of computer simulations, we show that both the proposed schedulers guarantee network stability within the network capacity. Particularly, in comparison with two baseline schemes, the proposed schedulers achieve much smaller queuing backlogs, much smaller backlog fluctuations, and much lower packet end-to-end delays.}

In this paper, we investigate the capacity region of a two-user communication network with one access point (AP) aided by M IRS elements for enhancing the user-AP channels, where the IRS incurs negligible delay, thus the user-AP channels via the IRS follow the classic discrete memoryless channel model. In particular, we consider two practical IRS deployment strategies that lead to different effective channels between the users and AP, namely, the distributed deployment where the M elements form two IRSs, each deployed in the vicinity of one user, versus the centralized deployment where all the M elements are deployed in the vicinity of the AP. First, we consider the uplink multiple-access channel (MAC) and derive the capacity/achievable rate regions for both deployment strategies under different multiple access schemes. It is shown that the centralized deployment generally outperforms the distributed deployment under symmetric channel setups in terms of achievable user rates. Next, we extend the results to the downlink broadcast channel (BC) by leveraging the celebrated uplink-downlink (or MAC-BC) duality framework, and show that the superior rate performance of centralized over distributed deployment also holds. Numerical results are presented that validate our analysis, and reveal new and useful insights for optimal IRS deployment in wireless networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we conduct rate-distortion and outage probability analyses for Wyner-Ziv (WZ) systems, where the information sequences from a source and a helper are transmitted to the destination over block Rayleigh fading multiple access channels (MACs). This work has been motivated by decision-making systems, where the aim is to make right decisions based on the observations. Hence, the most critical performance metric is the accuracy of decisions, even allowing distortion in wireless transmission. A sufficient condition for the successful transmissions is that the WZ and MAC regions intersect. For the ease of calculating the outage probability, we propose an approximated, yet accurate, WZ rate region. The outage probabilities of the WZ systems are then evaluated both in orthogonal and MAC transmissions. It is shown that the transmission efficiency of the system with MAC is significantly improved compared to orthogonal transmission. Furthermore, a helper-selection scheme is introduced to further reduce the outage probability of the WZ-MAC systems. The results show that the outage probability decreases, of which decay corresponds to the (L+1)-order diversity with L helpers in small value range of the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while it converges into L as the average SNR becomes large.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of cache-aided Multiuser Private Information Retrieval (MuPIR) which is an extension of the single-user cache-aided PIR problem to the case of multiple users. In cache-aided MuPIR, each of the\nK\nu\ncache-equipped users wishes to privately retrieve a message out of\nK\nmessages from\nN\ndatabases each having access to the entire message library. Demand privacy requires that any individual database learns nothing about the demands of all users. The users are connected to each database via an error-free shared-link. In this paper, we aim to characterize the optimal trade-off between user cache memory and communication load for such systems. First, we propose a novel approach of cache-aided interference alignment (CIA) , for the MuPIR problem with\nK=2\nmessages,\nK\nu\n=2\nusers and\nN≥2\ndatabases. The CIA approach is optimal when the cache placement is uncoded. For general cache placement, the CIA approach is optimal when\nN=2\nand 3 verified by the computer-aided converse approach. Second, for the general case, we propose a product design (PD) which incorporates the PIR code into the linear caching code. The product design is shown to be order optimal within a multiplicative factor of 8 and is exactly optimal in the high memory regime.}

	abstract = {Sparse, group-sparse and online channel estimation is conceived for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We exploit the angular sparsity of the mmWave channel impulse response (CIR) to achieve improved estimation performance. First a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based technique is developed for the estimation of each individual subcarrier’s quasi-static channel, which leads to an improved performance versus complexity trade-off in comparison to conventional channel estimation. Then a novel group-sparse Bayesian learning (G-SBL) scheme is conceived for reducing the channel estimation mean square error (MSE). The salient aspect of our G-SBL technique is that it exploits the frequency-domain (FD) correlation of the channel’s frequency response (CFR), while transmitting pilots on only a few subcarriers, thus it has a reduced pilot overhead. A low complexity (LC) version of G-SBL, termed LCG-SBL, is also developed that reduces the computational cost of the G-SBL significantly. Subsequently, an online G-SBL (O-SBL) variant is designed for the estimation of doubly-selective mmWave MIMO OFDM channels, which has low processing delay and exploits temporal correlation as well. This is followed by the design of a hybrid transmit precoder and receive combiner, which can operate directly on the estimated beamspace domain CFRs, together with a limited channel state information (CSI) feedback. Our simulation results confirms the accuracy of the analysis.}

	abstract = {Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based channel estimation (CE) for massive multiple-input multiple-output communication systems has achieved remarkable success. However, complexity even needs to be reduced, and robustness can even be improved. Meanwhile, existing methods do not accurately explain which channel features help the denoising of CNNs. In this paper, we first compare the strengths and weaknesses of CNN-based CE in different domains. When complexity is limited, the channel sparsity in the angle-delay domain improves denoising and robustness whereas large noise power and pilot contamination are handled well in the spatial-frequency domain. Thus, we develop a novel network, called dual CNN, to exploit the advantages in the two domains. Furthermore, we introduce an extra neural network, called HyperNet, which learns to detect scenario changes from the same input as the dual CNN. HyperNet updates several parameters adaptively and combines the existing dual CNNs to improve robustness. Experimental results show improved estimation performance for the time-varying scenarios. To further exploit the correlation in the time domain, a recurrent neural network framework is developed, and training strategies are provided to ensure robustness to the changing of temporal correlation. This design improves channel estimation performance but its complexity is still low.}

	abstract = {Accurate downlink channel state information (CSI) is required to be fed back to the base station (BS) in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in order to achieve maximum antenna diversity and multiplexing. However, downlink CSI feedback overhead scales with the number of transceiver antennas, a major hurdle for practical deployment of FDD massive MIMO systems. To solve this problem, we propose a compressive sampled CSI feedback method based on deep learning (SampleDL). In SampleDL, the massive MIMO channel matrix is sampled uniformly in time/frequency dimension before being fed into neural networks (NNs), which will reduce the computational resource/time at user equipment (UE) as well as enhance the CSI recovery accuracy at the BS. Both theoretical analysis and normalized mean square errors (NMSE) results confirm the advantages of the proposed method in terms of time complexity and recovery accuracy. Besides, a suitable CSI feedback period is explored by link level simulations, which aims to further reduce the overhead of CSI feedback without degrading the communication quality.}

	abstract = {Edge nodes (ENs) in Internet of Things commonly serve as gateways to cache sensing data while providing accessing services for data consumers. This paper considers multiple ENs that cache sensing data under the coordination of the cloud. Particularly, each EN can fetch content generated by sensors within its coverage, which can be uploaded to the cloud via fronthaul and then be delivered to other ENs beyond the communication range. However, sensing data are usually transient with time whereas frequent cache updates could lead to considerable energy consumption at sensors and fronthaul traffic loads. Therefore, we adopt Age of Information to evaluate data freshness and investigate intelligent caching policies to preserve data freshness while reducing cache update costs. Specifically, we model the cache update problem as a cooperative multi-agent Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing the long-term average weighted cost. To efficiently handle the exponentially large number of actions, we devise a novel reinforcement learning approach, which is a discrete multi-agent variant of soft actor-critic (SAC). Furthermore, we generalize the proposed approach into a decentralized control, where each EN can make decisions based on local observations only. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SAC-based caching schemes.}

	abstract = {The combination of artificial intelligence and mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as a promising evolution path of the future wireless networks. As a model-level coordination learning paradigm, federated learning can make full use of the distributed computation resource in the MEC systems, which allows the users to keep their private data locally. However, due to the unreliable wireless transmission circumstances and resource constraints in the MEC systems, both the performance and training efficiency of federated learning cannot be guaranteed. To solve this problem, the optimization design of federated learning in the MEC systems is studied in this paper. First, an optimization problem is formulated to manage the tradeoff between model accuracy and training cost. Second, a joint optimization algorithm is designed to optimize the model compression, sample selection, and user selection strategies, which can approach a stationary optimal solution in a computationally efficient way. Finally, the performance of our proposed optimization scheme is evaluated by numerical simulation and experiment results, which show that both the accuracy loss and the cost of federated learning in the MEC systems can be reduced significantly by employing our proposed algorithm.}

During each time slot, the secondary user performs the two tasks: data transmission and energy harvesting based on the signals received from the primary users. The goal of the paper is to maximize the secondary user’s long-term throughput, by optimizing its transmit power and the time-sharing coefficient for its two tasks. The long-term throughput maximization problem is challenging due to the need for making decisions that yield long-term gains but might result in short-term losses. For example, when in a given time slot, a primary user with large channel gains transmits, intuition suggests that the secondary user should not carry out data transmission due to the strong interference from the primary user but perform energy harvesting only, which results in zero data rate for this time slot but yields potential long-term benefits. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is applied to emulate this intuition, where the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed together with convex optimization. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL assisted NOMA transmission scheme can yield significant performance gains over two benchmark schemes.}

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based UAV anti-jamming video transmission scheme to choose the video compression quantization parameter, the channel coding rate, the modulation and power control strategies against jamming attacks. More specifically, this scheme applies RL to choose the UAV video compression and transmission policy based on the observed video task priority, the UAV-controller channel state and the received jamming power. This scheme enables the UAV to guarantee the video quality-of-experience (QoE) and reduce the energy consumption without relying on the jamming model or the video service model. A safe RL-based approach is further proposed, which uses deep learning to accelerate the UAV learning process and reduce the video transmission outage probability. The computational complexity is provided and the optimal utility of the UAV is derived and verified via simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve the video quality and reduce the transmission latency and energy consumption of the UAV compared with existing schemes.}

	abstract = {In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), vehicles are expected to feature with advanced applications and services which demand ultra-high data rates and low-latency communications. For that, the millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has been emerging as a very promising solution. However, incorporating the mmWave into ITS is particularly challenging due to the high mobility of vehicles and the inherent sensitivity of mmWave beams to dynamic blockages. This article addresses these problems by developing an optimal beam association framework for mmWave vehicular networks under high mobility. Specifically, we use the semi-Markov decision process to capture the dynamics and uncertainty of the environment. The Q-learning algorithm is then often used to find the optimal policy. However, Q-learning is notorious for its slow-convergence. Instead of adopting deep reinforcement learning structures (like most works in the literature), we leverage the fact that there are usually multiple vehicles on the road to speed up the learning process. To that end, we develop a lightweight yet very effective parallel Q-learning algorithm to quickly obtain the optimal policy by simultaneously learning from various vehicles. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed solution can increase the data rate by 47% and reduce the disconnection probability by 29% compared to other solutions.}

In this article we investigate the problem of client scheduling and resource block (RB) allocation to enhance the performance of model training using FL, over a pre-defined training duration under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and limited local computing resources. First, we analytically derive the gap between the training losses of FL with clients scheduling and a centralized training method for a given training duration. Then, we formulate the gap of the training loss minimization over client scheduling and RB allocation as a stochastic optimization problem and solve it using Lyapunov optimization. A Gaussian process regression-based channel prediction method is leveraged to learn and track the wireless channel, in which, the clients' CSI predictions and computing power are incorporated into the scheduling decision. Using an extensive set of simulations, we validate the robustness of the proposed method under both perfect and imperfect CSI over an array of diverse data distributions. Results show that the proposed method reduces the gap of the training accuracy loss by up to 40.7% compared to state-of-the-art client scheduling and RB allocation methods.}

The proposed detection algorithm works on a modified factor graph which concatenates a neural network function node to the variable nodes of the conventional FTN factor graph to approach the maximum a posterior probabilities (MAP) error performance. In specific, the neural network performs as a function node in the modified factor graph to deal with the residual intersymbol interference (ISI) that is not considered by the conventional detector with a limited complexity. We modify the updating rule in the conventional sum-product algorithm so that the neural network assisted detector can be complemented to a turbo equalization receiver. Furthermore, we propose a compatible training technique to improve the detection performance of the proposed DL-SPDA with turbo equalization. In particular, the neural network is optimized in terms of the mutual information between the transmitted sequence and the extrinsic information. We also investigate the maximum-likelihood bit error rate (BER) performance of a finite length coded FTN system. Simulation results show that the error performance of the proposed algorithm approaches the MAP performance, which is consistent with the analytical BER.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the sum-rate maximization problem is studied for wireless networks that use downlink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). In the considered model, the base station (BS) divides the messages that can be transmitted to its users into a “private” part and a “common” part. Here, the common message is a message that multiple users want to receive and the private message is a message that is dedicated to only a specific user. The RSMA mechanism enables a BS to adjust the split of common and private messages so as to control the interference by decoding and treating interference as noise and, thus optimizing the data rate of users. To maximize the users' sum-rate, the network can determine the rate allocation for the common message to meet the rate demand, and adjust the transmit power for the private message to reduce the interference. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the sum-rate of all users. To solve this nonconvex maximization problem with a single-antenna BS, the optimal power used for transmitting the private message to the users is first obtained in closed form for a given rate allocation and common message power. Based on the optimal private message transmit power, the optimal rate allocation is then derived under a fixed common message transmit power. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution of common message transmit power. To solve this nonconvex maximization problem with a multiple-antenna BS, a successive convex approximation method is utilized. Simulation results show that the RSMA can achieve up to 15.6% and 21.5% gains in terms of data rate compared to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), respectively.}

	abstract = {To achieve better connectivity in future communication networks, the deployment of different types of access points (APs) is underway. APs are expected to be equipped with self-organizing capabilities to reduce costs. Moreover, due to the spectrum crunch, frequency reuse among the deployed APs is inevitable, exacerbating the problem of inter-cell interference (ICI). Therefore, ICI mitigation in self-organizing networks (SONs) is commonly identified as a key radio resource management mechanism to enhance performance. To this end, this paper proposes a novel solution for the uncoordinated channel and power allocation problems. Based on the multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework, the proposed technique does not require any communication between the APs. The case of varying channel rewards across APs is considered. In contrast to previous work on channel allocation using the MAB framework, APs are permitted to choose multiple channels for transmission. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple access is used, allowing multiple APs to access each channel simultaneously. This results in an MAB model with varying channel rewards, multiple plays and non-zero reward on collision. The proposed algorithm has an expected regret in the order of O (log 2 T), with extensive numerical results revealing it significantly outperforms a well-known baseline algorithm in terms of energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {With the growing interest in providing internet access and cellular connectivity in the commercial aircraft, the compatibility between Air-to-Air (A2A) communications and current Air-to-Ground (A2G) macro-cellular communications is necessary to form an Aeronautical Ad hoc Network (AANet). Due to the typical features of airborne communications, such as high mobility, long transmission range and three-dimensional macro-cells, AANet is affected by intermittent links, which results in variant delayed data transmissions. To this end, we exploit a dynamic graph approach to model such an AANet with rapidly changing topology under a realistic airborne scenario. Targeting the problem of intermittent transmissions, by employing A2A, an AANet can bear three transmission modes: direct transmission, connected relay transmission and opportunistic transmission. To investigate the potential gain of A2A transmissions in terms of the end-to-end data flow transmission delay and the data traffic amount, we formulate an integer non-linear programming problem that minimizes the average end-to-end delay from Internet Gateways (IGWs) on shore to the aircraft receivers through multiple options of the transmission modes. Through solving this minimization problem based on the realistic dynamic graph model, the tradeoffs between the end-to-end transmission delay and other key network factors related to AANet formation and resource allocation can be obtained without much compromise on the transmission delay. The results show that the average end-to-end delay of the AANet is comparable to the direct transmission delay when having a tradeoff with the data traffic amount, buffer size and the spectrum sharing.}

	abstract = {Cross-modal communication is playing an increasingly important role in improving receivers' immersive experience. The main challenge lies in ensuring the heterogeneous requirements of the cross-modal stream. Especially, the discontinuity of the received haptic signals caused by the delay should be eliminated. Unfortunately, existing schemes study the cross-modal stream separately, which leads to that the haptic signal is distorted, or the audio-visual quality is reduced. To solve this problem fundamentally, we propose a joint transmission framework combining prediction and device-to-device (D2D) communication by taking advantage of the correlation of the haptic signals and the proximity feature of the receivers. Specifically, on the theoretical end, to completely eliminate the discontinuity, we propose a prediction mechanism by predicting and sending the future signals in advance. To compensate for the reliability loss brought by prediction, D2D links are efficiently established on the receivers' side. On the technical end, we first design a minimum resource (e.g., power) consumption search algorithm based on the binary search to obtain the optimal prediction horizon. Moreover, we develop a simple but efficient transmission mode selection algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed scheme in saving the power consumption.}

	abstract = {Radio access network (RAN) slicing is one of the key technologies in 5G and beyond mobile networks, where multiple logical subnets, i.e., RAN slices, are allowed to run on top of the same physical infrastructure so as to provide slice-specific services. Due to the dynamic environments of wireless networks and the diverse requirements of RAN slices, inter-slice radio resource management (IS-RRM) has become a highly challenging task in RAN slicing. In this paper, we propose a novel online convex optimization (OCO) framework for IS-RRM, which directly learns the instant resource allocation from the data revealed by previous allocations, such that sophisticated modeling and parameterization can be avoided in highly complicated and dynamic wireless environments. Specifically, an online IS-RRM scheme that employs multiple expert-algorithms running in parallel is proposed to keep track of the environmental changes and adjust the resource allocation accordingly. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our proposed scheme can guarantee long-term performance comparable to the optimal strategies given in hindsight.}

	abstract = {Network slicing is a key paradigm in 5G and is expected to be inherited in future 6G networks for the concurrent provisioning of diverse quality of service (QoS). Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.}

	abstract = {In ultra-dense networks (UDNs), the dense deployment of base stations (BSs) is facing challenges due to the pronounced unbalanced traffic loads, severe inter-cell interference, and uncertain traffic demands. In this paper, we tame traffic uncertainty for the joint optimization of BS activation and user association in UDNs to mitigate interference and balance traffic loads among BSs. Specifically, we address the traffic uncertainty by using chance constraint programming with the known first- and second-order statistics of the uncertain traffic. We formulate the joint BS activation and user association problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, which is then decomposed into a set of user association sub-problems by modeling the BS states (active or idle) as a Markov chain. We solve the user association sub-problem at each BS state by transforming it into a convex problem over the positive orthant. In particular, at each BS state, the candidate serving BSs that lead to the optimal load balancing performance are identified for each user and parts of the user's traffic are offloaded to the identified BSs. Based on the obtained solutions, we propose a distributed near-optimal BS activation and user association scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is more robust to traffic uncertainty and provides better load-balancing performance than the existing schemes.}

This paper investigates the age and energy tradeoff for multicast networks with retransmissions, where each sensed status update is encoded as a short blocklength packet and is broadcasted to multiple destinations via independent and identically distributed error-prone channels. By considering the stopping threshold, the average AoI and EE expressions for stopping at earliest- l , stopping at preselected- l , and wait-for-all schemes are derived as a function of the packet length. On this basis, the average AoI-EE ratio is introduced and is minimized to trade off age and energy by optimizing the packet length. Numerical results indicate that among the three schemes, earliest- l scheme attains the minimum AoI when the packet length is small, and preselected- l scheme attains the maximum EE when the packet length is large. An optimal packet length can always be found for each scheme to minimize age-energy ratio. Moreover, the selection of stopping threshold l will also impact the age and energy performance.}

	abstract = {Software-defined Internet-of-Things networking (SDIoT) greatly simplifies the network monitoring in large-scale IoT networks by per-flow sampling, wherein the controller keeps track of all the active flows in the network and samples the IoT devices on each flow path to collect real-time flow statistics. There is a tradeoff between the controller’s sampling preference and the balancing of loads among devices. On the one hand, the controller may prefer to sample some of the IoT devices on the flow path because they yield more accurate flow statistics. On the other hand, it is desirable to sample the devices uniformly so that their energy consumptions and lifespan are balanced. This paper formulates the flow sampling problem in large-scale SDIoT networks by means of a Markov decision process and devises policies that strike a good balance between these two goals. Three classes of policies are investigated: the optimal policy, the state-independent policies, and the index policies (including the Whittle index and a second-order index policies). The second-order index policy is the most desired policy among all: 1) in terms of performance, it is on an equal footing with the Whittle index policy, and outperforms the state-independent policies by much; 2) in terms of complexity, it is much simpler than the optimal policy, and is comparable to state-independent policies and the Whittle index policy; 3) in terms of realizability, it requires no prior information on the network dynamics, hence is much easier to implement in practice.}

Considering a Gaussian laser beam, we first design a phase-shift distribution across the IRS that enables the reflection of the incident beam in any desired direction, i.e., realizing the generalized law of reflection. Moreover, for the designed phase-shift profile, we show that there exists an equivalent mirror-assisted FSO system that generates a reflected electric field on a mirror that is identical to that on the IRS in the original system. However, the location of the laser source and the properties of the emitted Gaussian laser beam are different in the original and the equivalent systems. This equivalence allows us to study the mirror-assisted system, employing the image method from geometric optics, instead of directly analyzing the original IRS-assisted system. Based on this analysis, we model the geometric and misalignment losses (GML) and characterize the impact of the physical parameters of the IRS, such as its size, position, and orientation, on the end-to-end FSO channel. Moreover, we develop a statistical model for the GML which accounts for the random movements of IRS, transmitter (Tx), and receiver (Rx) due to building sway. Furthermore, we analyze the outage probability of an IRS-assisted FSO link based on the derived channel model. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the developed channel model and offer various insights for system design. For instance, both our simulations and theoretical analysis reveal that even if the variances of the fluctuations of the Tx, IRS, and Rx positions caused by building sway are identical, their impact on the end-to-end channel is not necessarily the same and depends on the relative positioning of these three nodes.}

We prove the tightness of the derived bounds for large peak power with zero background radiation at an exponential convergence rates, and for low peak power at an order-two convergence rates. Moreover, we propose an approximation on the achievable rate, which is more accurate compared with the derived bounds in the medium signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime. We also verify the accuracy of the proposed model on the achievable rate analysis via the comparison with the model with non-negligible shot and thermal noise. As for the capacity analysis, we assume that the symbol duration can be arbitrarily short, and demonstrate that the capacity approaches that of the continuous-time Poisson channel as both the sampling interval and the symbol duration approach zero, and the sampling interval equals the symbol duration. For large peak power, the capacity with a non-perfect receiver converges, while that of continuous Poisson capacity channel linearly increases.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as a revolutionary technique, appears to ameliorate undesirable propagation environment in a controllable manner, which has the potential to substantially boost security of private information in the future smart radio environment. Much recent attention has been directed to the RIS-enhanced secure communication, among which the terrestrial network scenarios are generally concerned, while the exploration of aerial-ground communication integrated with RIS remains an open issue. Furthermore, in the available research, the ideal assumption of line-of-sight channel for aerial-ground link cannot be exploited in complex urban environment. Inspired by this, we provide in this paper the secrecy rate maximization problem under a complex urban scenario, where the drone's high mobility and RIS's tunable capability are utilized to against the potential eavesdropper. Although the established problem is intractable to tackle, we devise an iterative algorithm combining alternating optimization and successive convex approximation method as the solution, which jointly optimizes the phase shifts, the drone's trajectory along with transmit power for the single-user scenario. The proposed designs are also extended to the multi-user multi-eavesdropper system. Eventually, extensive simulation experiments indicate the remarkable benefits brought by our proposed scheme on secrecy performance and the necessity of optimizing phase shifts.}

We first provide theoretical modeling for the instantaneous/average covert rate when the system works solely under the FD mode or HD mode, and then explore the corresponding optimal transmit power control of relay for the covert rate maximization. For an improvement of covert rate, we further propose a joint FD/HD mode that flexibly switches between the FD and HD modes depending on channel state of the relay self-interference channel. Under the joint FD/HD mode, we also examine the related problems of theoretical modeling for covert rate and optimal transmit power control of relay for covert rate maximization. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to illustrate the covert rate performances of the relaying system under the FD, HD and joint FD/HD modes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a new class of soft-input soft-output block decision feedback equalizer (BDFE) for turbo equalization over inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels under minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion is proposed. First, the BDFE which employs both the a posteriori moments of estimated symbols and the a priori moments of unestimated symbols is investigated, and two recursive schemes are derived to reduce the complexity. Then, to mitigate error propagation, the bidirectional BDFE (Bi-BDFE) consisting of a forward BDFE and a backward BDFE is proposed. Furthermore, a threshold is employed to reduce the number of inverse matrix update process for the BDFE (T-BDFE), which can attain a flexible trade-off between complexity and performance. Finally, the bidirectional equalization is introduced into a low-complexity approximate solution of the BDFE (Bi-LC-BDFE) to further reduce the complexity and obtain time diversity gain, which utilizes a time-invariant covariance matrix. Simulation results show that the proposed equalizers significantly outperform the block linear equalizer (BLE), the exact MMSE-based linear equalizer (Exact-MMSE-LE) and the soft-decision feedback equalizers (SDFE), while keeping a similar complexity as the BLE. In addition, the Bi-BDFE can achieve better performance than the Max-Log-MAP equalizer while its complexity is on the same order as the BDFE.}

Our proposed transceiver designs rely on majorization theory and hyperparameter estimates obtained from the BL module for minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of parameter estimation at the fusion center (FC). The linear transceiver design framework is initially proposed for the general scenario with arbitrary SNR sensor observations, followed by a special case with high-SNR sensor observations scenario. Our analysis also incorporates the channel correlation. The MMSE channel estimates are determined for the sensors (SNs), followed by a robust transceiver design procedure that is resilient to the channel state information (CSI) uncertainty arising due to the channel estimation error, an aberration that is unavoidable in practical implementations. Our simulation results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed BL framework and optimal MMSE transceiver design in sparse parameter estimation relying on realistic imperfect channel estimates over the benchmarks.}

The two main components of an M-MIMO receiver are a detector and a decoder. To improve the trade-off between reliability and complexity, a Bayesian concept has been considered as a promising approach that enhances classical detectors, e.g. minimum-mean-square-error detector. This work proposes an iterative M-MIMO detector based on a Bayesian framework, a parallel interference cancellation scheme, and a decision statistics combining concept. We then develop a high performance M-MIMO receiver, integrating the proposed detector with a low complexity sequential decoding for polar codes. Simulation results of the proposed detector show a significant performance gain compared to other low complexity detectors. Furthermore, the proposed M-MIMO receiver with sequential decoding ensures one order magnitude lower complexity compared to a receiver with stack successive cancellation decoding for polar codes from the 5G New Radio standard.}

Compared to its conventional counterpart as spatial modulation (SM)-OFDM, the proposed OSM-OFDM scheme aims at providing a simplified implementation structure with less number of radio frequency (RF) chains, by introducing an offset between the RF chain and the index of the activated transmit antenna on each subcarrier. Specifically, three types of offset antenna selection (OAS) methods are developed to meet different scene requirements for different number of available RF chains. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we quantify the bit error rate upper bounds of OSM-OFDM with different types of OAS methods. Finally, extensive computer simulations demonstrate that OSM-OFDM provides a flexible tradeoff among implementation cost, computation complexity and error performance.}

In this paper, we consider wireless communication networks where transmitters are all distributed according to homogeneous PPP and study the CCDF of the interference. Mainly, we derive generalized bounds on the CCDF of aggregate interference from whole homogeneous PPP based on discretization of interference, which considerably enhance tightness compared to the previous bounds. These bounds can be used to the analysis requiring the distribution for aggregate interference, such as deployment and activation of BSs, massive MIMO, and millimeter wave communication networks. As examples of utilizing the derived bounds, we derive tractable coverage probabilities of uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) users and downlink users in cellular networks under line-of-sight(LoS)/non-line-of-signt (NLOS) channels, respectively. In NOMA, we derive the closed-form bounds on coverage probability when successive interference cancellation is adopted for NOMA signal demodulation. Using the proposed bounds, we also obtain the bounds on coverage probability of a cellular system with LoS/NLOS channels. The tightness of bounds in this work is shown via numerical comparison. Moreover, we mathematically prove the convergence of bounds to exact CCDF.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deemed as a promising solution to improve the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless communications cost-effectively. In this paper, we consider a wireless network where multiple base stations (BSs) serve their respective users with the aid of distributed IRSs in the downlink communication. Specifically, each IRS assists in the transmission from its associated BS to user via passive beamforming, while in the meantime, it also randomly scatters the signals from other co-channel BSs, thus resulting in additional signal as well as interference paths in the network. As such, a new IRS-user/BS association problem arises pertaining to optimally balance the passive beamforming gains from all IRSs among different BS-user communication links. To address this new problem, we first derive a tractable lower bound of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver of each user, termed average-signal-to-average-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASAINR), based on which two ASAINR balancing problems are formulated to maximize the minimum ASAINR among all users by optimizing the IRS-user associations without and with BS transmit power control, respectively. We also characterize the scaling behavior of user ASAINRs with the increasing number of IRS reflecting elements to investigate the different effects of IRS-reflected signal versus interference power. Moreover, to solve the two ASAINR balancing problems that are both non-convex optimization problems, we propose an optimal solution to the problem without BS power control and low-complexity suboptimal solutions to both problems by applying the branch-and-bound method and exploiting new properties of the IRS-user associations, respectively. Numerical results verify our performance analysis and also demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed solutions over benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate resource allocation for IRS-assisted green multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. To minimize the total transmit power, both the beamforming vectors at the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at multiple IRSs are jointly optimized, while taking into account the minimum required quality-of-service (QoS) of multiple users. First, two novel algorithms, namely a penalty-based alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm and an inner approximation (IA) algorithm, are developed to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available. Existing designs employ semidefinite relaxation in AltMin-based algorithms, which, however, cannot ensure convergence. In contrast, the proposed penalty-based AltMin and IA algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a stationary point and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the design problem, respectively. Second, the impact of imperfect knowledge of the CSI of the channels between the AP and the users is investigated. To this end, a non-convex robust optimization problem is formulated and the penalty-based AltMin algorithm is extended to obtain a stationary solution. Simulation results reveal a key trade-off between the speed of convergence and the achievable total transmit power for the two proposed algorithms. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total transmit power at the AP compared to various baseline schemes and that the optimal numbers of transmit antennas and IRS reflecting elements, which maximize the system energy efficiency of the considered system, are finite.}

This paper derives exact and asymptotic bit error rate (BER) expressions under Rayleigh fading channels for NOMA systems with arbitrary number of users and arbitrary number of receiving antennas and modulation orders, including binary phase-shift keying and rectangular/square quadrature amplitude modulation. Furthermore, the power coefficients’ bounds, which ensure users’ fairness, and solve the constellation ambiguity problem, are derived for\nN=2\nand 3 users cases with any modulation orders. In addition, this paper determines the optimal power assignment that minimizes the system’s average BER. These results provide valuable insight into the system’s BER performance and power assignment granularity. For instance, it is shown that the feasible power coefficients range becomes significantly small as the modulation order, or\nN\n, increases, where the BER performance degrades due to the increased inter-user interference. Hence, the derived expressions can be crucial for the system scheduler in allowing it to make accurate decisions of selecting appropriate\nN\n, modulation orders, and power coefficients to satisfy the users’ requirements. The presented expressions are corroborated via Monte Carlo simulations.}

Under the assumption of imperfect angles of departure for the wiretap channels, the hybrid beamformer at the base station and digital beamformers at the satellite are jointly designed to maximize the achievable secrecy-energy efficiency, while satisfying signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints of both the earth stations (ESs) and cellular users. Since the formulated optimization problem is nonconvex and mathematically intractable, we propose two robust BF schemes to obtain approximate solutions with low complexity. Specifically, for the case of a single ES, we integrate the Charnes-Cooper approach with an iterative search algorithm to convert the original nonconvex problem into a solvable one and obtain the BF weight vectors. In the case of multiple ESs, by exploiting the sequential convex approximation method, we convert the original problem into a linear one with multiple matrix inequalities and second-order cone constraints, for which we obtain a solution with satisfactory performance. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed robust BF design schemes are validated via simulations using realistic satellite and terrestrial downlink channel models.}

During the hovering periods, the UAV works on full-duplex mode to simultaneously collect data from the target device and charge other devices within its coverage. Practical propulsion power consumption model and non-linear energy harvesting model are taken into account. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly optimize three objectives: maximization of sum data rate, maximization of total harvested energy and minimization of UAV's energy consumption over a particular mission period. These three objectives are in conflict with each other partly and weight parameters are given to describe associated importance. Since IoT devices keep gathering information from the physical surrounding environment and their requirements to upload data change dynamically, online path planning of the UAV is required. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve online decision. An extended deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn control policies of UAV over multiple objectives. While training, the agent learns to produce optimal policies under given weights conditions on the basis of achieving timely data collection according to the requirement priority and avoiding devices' data overflow. The verification results show that the proposed MODDPG (multi-objective DDPG) algorithm achieves joint optimization of three objectives and optimal policies can be adjusted according to weight parameters among optimization objectives.}

	abstract = {In this paper, motivated by the framework of diversity-achieving quadrature spatial modulation (DA-QSM), we propose a generalized quadrature space-frequency index modulation (GQSF-IM) transmission scheme for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The dispersion matrices potentially transmit some combination of each symbol from each antenna at every subcarrier, and their structures lead to desirable coding properties. By setting two well-designed dispersion-matrix sets for both the in-phase (I-) and quadrature (Q-) dimensions, each resource block (RB) of MIMO-OFDM independently selects part of dispersion matrices from each set to modulate the real and imaginary parts of complex symbols, respectively. Thus a simple and systematic method which easily generates dispersion-matrix set with large size is presented. It can be verified that the proposed GQSF-IM scheme subsumes the existing QSF-IM scheme as its special case. Moreover, it can be proved that the GQSF-IM scheme automatically achieves the second order transmit diversity without requiring any parameter or matrix optimization. Owing to obtaining higher transmit diversity order, simulation results of bit error rate (BER) performance show that GQSF-IM outperforms QSF-IM in different channels such as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), correlated Rayleigh fading, and Rician channels. Furthermore, GQSF-IM can achieve obvious better BER performance when it combines with interleaving for more diversity gains.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose primitive rateless (PR) codes. A PR code is characterized by the message length and a primitive polynomial over\nGF(2)\n, which can generate a potentially limitless number of coded symbols. We show that codewords of a PR code truncated at any arbitrary length can be represented as subsequences of a maximum-length sequence (\nm\n-sequence). We characterize the Hamming weight distribution of PR codes and their duals and show that for a properly chosen primitive polynomial, the Hamming weight distribution of the PR code can be well approximated by the truncated binomial distribution. We further find a lower bound on the minimum Hamming weight of PR codes and show that there always exists a PR code that can meet this bound for any desired codeword length. We provide a list of primitive polynomials for message lengths up to 40 and show that the respective PR codes closely meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound at various rates. Simulation results show that PR codes can achieve similar block error rates as their BCH counterparts at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and code rates. PR codes are rate-compatible and can generate as many coded symbols as required; thus, demonstrating a truly rateless performance.}

Despite being one of the oldest classes of channel codes, finding a low complexity soft-input decoding scheme is still an open problem. In this work, we present a versatile decoding architecture for RM codes based on their rich automorphism group. The decoding algorithm can be seen as a generalization of multiple-bases belief propagation (MBBP) and may use any polar or RM decoder as constituent decoders. We provide extensive error-rate performance simulations for successive cancellation (SC)-, SC-list (SCL)- and belief propagation (BP)-based constituent decoders. We furthermore compare our results to existing decoding schemes and report a near-ML performance for the RM(3,7)-code (e.g., 0.04 dB away from the ML bound at BLER of 10 −3 ) at a competitive computational cost. Moreover, we provide some insights into the automorphism subgroups of RM codes and SC decoding and, thereby, prove the theoretical limitations of this method with respect to polar codes.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new finite precision iterative decoder for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The proposed decoder, named Sign-Preserving Min-Sum (SP-MS), significantly improves the decoding performance compared to the classical Offset Min-Sum (OMS) decoder when messages are quantized on\nq=2\n, 3, or 4 bits. The particularity of the SP-MS decoder is that messages cannot take the 0 value, and can fully benefit from the\nq\nbits of precision. The optimization of the SP-MS decoder is investigated in the asymptotic limit of the code length using density evolution (DE). Our study shows that 3-bit SP-MS decoders can achieve the same error-correcting performance as 5-bit OMS decoders, and 2-bit SP-MS decoders outperform 3-bit OMS decoders. The finite-length simulations confirm the conclusions of the DE analysis for several LDPC codes. Our SP-MS decoder shows a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain up to 0.43 dB, with a memory/wire reduction of up to 40%, compared to the OMS decoder. Moreover, the SP-MS decoder converges faster and uses fewer iterations than the OMS decoder, with an improvement of up to 83.3% of the average decoding throughput. On an FPGA, the SP-MS decoder reduces resource utilization by up to 56% compared to the OMS decoder.}

This paper aims to investigate how to decode polar codes when channel parameter is unknown. Specifically, we study a generalized Gilbert-Elliott channel model, which assumes that the channel switches between a finite number of states. On the platform of Soft CANcellation (SCAN), which is a low-complexity iterative decoding algorithm of polar codes superior to the widely-used Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder, we propose three adaptive algorithms, i.e. , Sliding-Window SCAN (SWSCAN), Weighted-Window SCAN (W 2 SCAN), and Linear-Weighting SCAN (LWSCAN). These adaptive SCAN decoders are seeded with a coarse estimate of channel state, and after each SCAN iteration, the decoders progressively refine the estimate of channel state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive SCAN decoders outperform the original SCAN decoder and other competitors.}

	abstract = {The problem of coding for informed receivers (IR) is considered, where a transmitter multicasts a bunch of messages to its associated receivers, each of which already has a subset of messages as side information. Which receiver has what side information is unknown to the transmitter. A family of polar codes for IR was proposed for binary-input channels in (Huang and Shieh, 2018), which was shown to provide excellent side information gain regardless of side information configuration and content. A trial extension of this scheme to high-order modulations, however, was unsatisfactory. In this paper, two families of systematic polar coded modulations for IR are proposed. In the first family, by building a connection between the message bits and modulated symbols under systematic polar codes, we leverage the bit assignments and labeling techniques such that receiver side information can be directly translated to a minimum distance gain. In the second family, a permutation operation is added before modulation such that the message bits can be properly reordered to further advance and balance the gains among different side information configurations. Simulations show that the proposed schemes provide large and balanced side information gains and significantly outperform the system directly adapted from (Huang and Shieh, 2018) onto high-order modulations.}

	abstract = {The effects of quantization and coding on the estimation quality of Gauss-Markov processes are considered, with a special attention to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Samples are acquired from the process, quantized, and then encoded for transmission using either infinite incremental redundancy (IIR) or fixed redundancy (FR) coding schemes. A fixed processing time is consumed at the receiver for decoding and sending feedback to the transmitter. Decoded messages are used to construct a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the process as a function of time. This is shown to be an increasing functional of the age-of-information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since the sampling time pertaining to the latest successfully decoded message. Such functional depends on the quantization bits, codewords lengths and receiver processing time. The goal, for each coding scheme, is to optimize sampling times such that the long-term average MMSE is minimized. This is then characterized in the setting of general increasing functionals of AoI, not necessarily corresponding to MMSE, which may be of independent interest in other contexts. We first show that the optimal sampling policy for IIR is such that a new sample is generated only if the AoI exceeds a certain threshold, while for FR it is such that a new sample is delivered just-in-time as the receiver finishes processing the previous one. Enhanced transmissions schemes are then developed in order to exploit the processing times to make new data available at the receiver sooner. For both IIR and FR, it is shown that there exists an optimal number of quantization bits that balances AoI and quantization errors, and hence minimizes the MMSE. It is also shown that for longer receiver processing times, the relatively simpler FR scheme outperforms IIR.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the application of widely linear (WL) receivers in an uplink multi-user system using real-valued modulation schemes, where the cellular base station (BS) with multiple antennas provides connectivity for randomly deployed single-antenna users. The targeted use case is massive machine type communication (mMTC) with grant-free access in the uplink, where the network is required to host a large number of low data rate devices transmitting in an uncoordinated fashion. Four types of WL receivers are investigated, namely the WL zero-forcing (ZF) and the WL minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receivers, along with their enhanced versions employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) with channel-dependent ordering, i.e., the WL-ZF-SIC and WL-MMSE-SIC receivers. The outage performances of these receivers are analytically characterized in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and compared to those of conventional linear (CL) receivers using complex-valued modulation schemes. For the non-SIC receivers, we show that, when compared to the CL counterparts, the WL receivers yield a higher diversity gain when decoding the same number of users and have the same diversity gain but a decreased coding gain when the number of users is nearly doubled. The outage performance analysis of WL-SIC receivers is facilitated by the marginal distribution of ordered eigenvalues of a real-valued Wishart matrix. It is shown that the SIC operation with channel-dependent ordering brings no additional diversity gain to the WL receivers but instead increases the coding gain. Moreover, the coding gain of WL-SIC receivers grows as the number of users increases and even exceeds that of CL-SIC receivers under suitable conditions. For the mMTC scenario with grant-free transmission, it is demonstrated that the WL receivers outperform their CL counterparts in terms of offering a lower outage (and packet drop) probability and a higher system throughput for a given packet drop probability.}

Traditional spatial domain modulation schemes include spatial modulation, spatial shift keying (SSK), and variations of these two schemes. To fully make use of the spatial degree of freedom and improve the achievable data rate of traditional spatial domain modulation schemes, we propose a successive-coded SSK (SC-SSK) modulation scheme. The core of the proposed SC-SSK scheme is a multiple step coded modulation strategy, in which different information bits are mapped to the designed pattern in each step. The constellation of the transmit signals is designed. A QR decomposition based successive detection algorithm is proposed for this particular coded modulation strategy. The achievable rate, the error rate performance, and the computational complexity of the proposed SC-SSK scheme are analyzed in detail. Simulations are carried out to compare the proposed the SC-SSK scheme with the reference spatial domain modulation schemes, and reveal the advantages of the proposed SC-SSK scheme.}

In particular, some 6G applications may require extremely low-latency on the order of 0.1ms, through which practical designs of channel coding can be investigated based on Finite-Blocklength Coding (FBC). In this paper, we focus on a joint FBC scheme over multi-user downlinks in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), in which only several symbol durations are available for users within a requirement of extremely low-latency. Since a higher coding rate is obtained by enlarging the blocklength of FBC, we jointly encode users’ data bits over their allocated resources, through which an enlarged blocklength is attained. Specifically, we first formulate the multi-user joint encoding design with a matrix-based method. Then, we present the optimal power-constrained throughput within the extremely low-latency requirement by formulating a nonlinear bipartite matching problem. We finally demonstrate the benefit resulting from the joint FBC in terms of each user’s maximum obtainable distance. With the distance to each user varying, we also perform an analysis of the variation of the optimal power-constrained throughput.}

Under a general Nakagami fading model, we derive the upper bounds for the\nb\n-moments of the conditional signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) distributions for the two modes given the network realization, and further calculate the upper bounds of SINR meta distributions (MDs). Moreover, we extend the MD-based analysis to evaluate the fine-grained performance for the transmission effectiveness, through deriving the bounding results for the user-perceived rate MD and spatial rate capacity (SRC), the latter of which is defined as the effective density of users satisfying a given transmission rate requirement with a certain probability. Numerical results validate the tightness of the proposed bounds and reveal the different effects of the network configuration parameter associated with mm-wave on the link and network performances from the view of individual users.}

	abstract = {With emerging wireless technologies like 6G, many new applications like autonomous systems evolve which have strict demands on the reliability and latency of data communications. In the scenario of the commonly investigated independent slow fading links, the zero-outage capacity (ZOC) is zero and retransmissions are therefore inevitable. In this work, we show that a positive ZOC can be achieved under the same setting of slow fading with constant transmit power and without perfect channel state information at the transmitter, if the joint distribution of the channel gains follows certain structures. This allows reliable reception without any outages, thus not requiring retransmissions. Based on a systematic copula approach, we show that there exists a set of dependency structures for which positive ZOCs can be achieved for both maximum ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC). We characterize the maximum ZOC within a finite number of bits. The results are evaluated explicitly for the special cases of Rayleigh fading and Nakagami-\nm\nfading in order to quantify the ZOCs for common fading models.}

	abstract = {A joint channel estimation and channel coding scheme is presented for channels with memory using polar codes. Unlike the conventional approach of first estimating all channel parameters and then performing channel decoding separately, the proposed scheme incorporates a subset of reliable estimates of channel parameters into the decoding procedure and computes decoding metrics averaged over the statistical behavior of the channel. Specifically, decoding algorithms for finite-state Markov channels of any order, for the Gauss-Markov channel and for flat-fading channels are presented. Further, by adapting list decoding to identify reliably-decoded bits within a codeword, channel estimation and decoding steps are performed iteratively to boost the reliability of channel estimation as well as error correction. In order to improve the performance even further, a new pilot arrangement scheme is developed that utilizes the structure of polar codes and sends pilot symbols embedded within the polar codewords. This construction can be viewed as a new family of shortened polar codes that can be of independent interest. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed approach compared to existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Low-latency and energy-efficient wireless communication holds the potential of enabling the industrial internet of things (IIoT), automatic driving, and telesurgery. Cross-layer scheduling, which is aware of both the channel and queue states, has attracted considerable attention recently because it is capable of reducing the average delay substantially while meeting a given average power constraint. As a result, there has been considerable work, in which joint channel and buffer aware scheduling is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In general, the optimal solution to a CMDP problem is characterized by the stationary probability of actions, yielding probabilistic cross-layer scheduling with possibly high complexity in practice. In this paper, we are interested in the low-latency and energy-efficient stationary cross-layer scheduling policy for wireless channels with continuous channel states, e.g. Rayleigh fading. It is interestingly shown that a deterministic cross-layer scheduling policy can achieve the optimal tradeoff between the average delay and power. In other words, the signaling complexity of cross-layer scheduling can be significantly reduced without causing sub-optimality. Simulation results also demonstrate that our work provides a low-complexity solution for low-latency and energy-efficient wireless communications.}

	abstract = {Wireless closed-loop control is of major significance for future industrial manufacturing. However, control applications pose stringent quality of service requirements for reliable operation. Contrary to traditional ultra-reliable low-latency communications design goals such as low packet loss rates and low latency, research results in the domain of networked control systems (NCS) state that depending on the sampling period, control applications inherently tolerate a few consecutive packet losses. This translates into a better-suited metric to capture control application requirements and therefore a more conclusive design goal for wireless networks: ensuring a maximum age of information (AoI). With a Markov modeling approach, we propose to exploit the tolerance through a novel dynamic multi-connectivity scheme that we term state-aware resource allocation (SARA), which temporally negatively correlates packet losses, thus avoiding long packet loss sequences. Through statistical multiplexing, SARA enables a mean time to failure (MTTF) in the order of years while keeping the per-agent average channel usage close to one, also in a multi-agent setting with competition for resources. Compared with static dual-connectivity, the MTTF can be increased 100-fold whereas the number of required channels reduces by 40%. Our approach also statistically guarantees system-wide AoI distributions, which aid to ensure control performance.}

The model takes into account details of the shared wireless channel, including fading and capture effect, whereas, at the medium access control (MAC) layer, the anti-collision mechanism proposed in the EPC Generation 2 standard is taken as a reference. To address the complexity of the system model, we rely on a semi-analytical approach, that combines a moment matching approximation method to abstract the physical layer and Monte-Carlo simulations to describe the MAC dynamics. Furthermore, based on the space diversity feature offered by the multi-static settings, we introduce the concept of capture diversity and propose a modification to the standard to fully support this form of diversity. Numerical results show the impact of deployment conditions and the relative positions of interrogator, tags, and detection points on the performance of tags’ identification. We show how the number of detection points impacts the system performance under various channel conditions and MAC parameters’ settings. Finally, we validate the proposed update of the MAC protocol, showing substantial performance improvement with respect to the standard collision resolution policy.}

Specifically, the forms of stationary points for two types of distributed compression schemes are characterized here. Subsequently, those acquired solutions are utilized as the centerpiece of the proposed generic, iterative algorithm, termed the Multiterminal Forward-Aware Vector Information Bottleneck (M-FAVIB) , for addressing the design optimizations. Leveraging an unfolding trick, it will be proven that both distributed compression schemes fall into the category of Successive Upper-Bound Minimization , ensuring their convergence to a stationary point. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed compression schemes will be substantiated as well by means of numerical investigations over some typical transmission scenarios.}

	abstract = {Distributed systems operate under storage access and download service uncertainty. We consider two access models. In one, a user can access each storage node with a fixed probability, and in the other, a user can access any fixed-size subset of nodes. We consider two download service models. In the first (small file) model, the time to transmit file data is negligible compared to the overall average download time. In the second (large file) model, the download time scales with the amount of downloaded data. The performance metric is the system’s service rate. For a fixed redundancy level, the systems’ service rate depends on the allocation of coded chunks over the storage nodes. Since finding the general optimal allocation is prohibitively hard, we consider quasi-uniform allocations, where coded content is equally spread among a subset of nodes. The question we address asks what the size of this subset (spreading) should be. We show that concentrating the coded content to a minimum-size subset is universally optimal for the small file model. However, for the large file model, the optimal spreading depends on the system parameters. These conclusions hold for both access models.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmwave) communications, envisaged for the next generation wireless networks, rely on large antenna arrays and very narrow, high-gain beams. This poses significant challenges to beam alignment between transmitter and receiver, which has attracted considerable research attention. Even when alignment is achieved, the link is subject to beam drift (BD). BD, caused by non-ideal features inherent in practical beams and rapidly changing environments, is referred to as the phenomenon that the center of main-lobe of the used beam deviates from the real dominant channel direction, which further deteriorates the system’s performance. To mitigate the BD effect, in this paper we first theoretically analyze the BD effect on the performance of outage probability as well as effective achievable rate, which takes practical factors (e.g., the rate of change of the environment, beam width, transmit power) into account. Then, different from conventional practice, we propose a novel design philosophy where multi-resolution beams with varying beam widths are used for data transmission while narrow beams are employed for beam training. Finally, we design an efficient learning based algorithm which can adaptively choose an appropriate beam width according to the environment. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposals.}

	abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) has become a promising technology, which can be widely applied in health monitoring, and so on. However, the performance of a practical WBAN may severely suffer from the degradation caused by dynamic nature of wireless channels with the movements of human body. Traditional communication frameworks cannot catch up with the channel variation of dynamic WBANs, which may severely degrade the performance, so an accurate channel prediction model is necessary for developing an efficient transmission strategy. In this paper, we propose a DeepBAN communication framework for dynamic WBANs. In our proposed framework, a temporal convolution network (TCN) based deep learning approach is adopted for channel prediction, the computationally intensive task of which is processed by mobile edge computing (MEC), to reduce the response time. Given the predicted channel conditions, we propose a joint power control, time-slot allocation, and relay selection algorithm to maximize the energy efficiency of the system, taking into account the transmission reliability and end-to-end latency requirements. We evaluate the performance of DeepBAN, and the results show that it can achieve energy-efficient, reliable, and low-latency data transmission in dynamic WBANs, which can improve the system energy efficiency by 15% compared with the stochastic scheduling scheme.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology for achieving high rate and large coverage in future wireless networks by smartly reflecting the signals with adjustable phase shifts. To design the reflection beamforming, accurate individual channel state information is required at the RIS, which is a challenge task due to the lack of signal processing ability in passive mode. In this paper, we add signal processing units for a few antennas at the RIS to partially acquire the channels and extrapolate them to the full channels, in which the active antenna selection is a key point but has not been addressed yet. We construct an active antenna selection network that utilizes the probabilistic sampling theory to select the optimal locations of these active antennas. With this active antenna selection network, we further design two deep learning-based schemes, i.e., the channel extrapolation scheme and the beam searching scheme. The former utilizes the selection network and a convolutional neural network to extrapolate the full channels from the partial channels, while the latter adopts a fully-connected neural network to achieve the direct mapping from the partial channels to the optimal beamforming vector with maximal transmission rate. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal antenna selection outperforms the trivial uniform antenna selection, and the performance of beam searching is more stable than that of channel extrapolation with fewer active antennas.}

	abstract = {Huge overhead of beam training imposes a significant challenge in millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communications. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a wide beam based training approach to calibrate the narrow beam direction according to the channel power leakage. To handle the complex nonlinear properties of the channel power leakage, deep learning is utilized to predict the optimal narrow beam directly. Specifically, three deep learning assisted calibrated beam training schemes are proposed. The first scheme adopts convolution neural network to implement the prediction based on the instantaneous received signals of wide beam training. We also perform the additional narrow beam training based on the predicted probabilities for further beam direction calibrations. However, the first scheme only depends on one wide beam training, which lacks the robustness to noise. To tackle this problem, the second scheme adopts long-short term memory (LSTM) network for tracking the movement of users and calibrating the beam direction according to the received signals of prior beam training, in order to enhance the robustness to noise. To further reduce the overhead of wide beam training, our third scheme, an adaptive beam training strategy, selects partial wide beams to be trained based on the prior received signals. Two criteria, namely, optimal neighboring criterion and maximum probability criterion, are designed for the selection. Furthermore, to handle mobile scenarios, auxiliary LSTM is introduced to calibrate the directions of the selected wide beams more precisely. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve significantly higher beamforming gain with smaller beam training overhead compared with the conventional and existing deep-learning based counterparts.}

A simple learning module is employed for the proposed learning-based estimator. The training process is thus much faster and the required training data is reduced significantly. Besides, a training data construction approach utilizing least square (LS) estimation results is proposed so that the training data can be collected during the data transmission. The feasibility of this novel construction approach is verified by theoretical analysis and simulations. Based on this construction approach, two alternative training data generation schemes are proposed. One scheme transmits additional block pilot symbols to create training data, while the other scheme adopts a decision-directed method and does not require extra pilot overhead. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed channel estimation method. Furthermore, the proposed method shows better adaptation to practical imperfections compared with the conventional minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation. It outperforms the existing machine learning-based channel estimation techniques under varying channel conditions.}

We aim to maximize the spectral efficiency of the users by minimizing the sum mean square error (MSE) of the users’ received symbols. For this, a joint non-convex optimization problem is formulated under the sum minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Alternating minimization is used to break the original joint optimization problem into the separate optimization of the active precoding matrix for the base station (BS) and the matrix of phase shifts for the IRS. While the MMSE active precoder is obtained in closed-form, the IRS phase shifts are optimized iteratively using a modified version (developed in this paper) of the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm. Moreover, the underlying joint optimization problem is solved under two different models for the IRS phase shifts, namely by assuming\ni\n) a unimodular (i.e., ideal) constraint on the reflection coefficients and\nii\n) a more practical reflection elements termination by a variable reactive load (which inherently introduces the phase-dependent amplitude attenuation in the IRS phase shifts). Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method under both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) and to show the effect of the practical constraint on the system throughput. The results validate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of throughput and computational complexity.}

Our objective is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming vectors, transmit-relaying power, and RIS phase shifts. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle this problem, the alternating optimization approach is utilized to decouple the variables. In each alternative procedure, the optimal solutions for the active beamforming vectors, transmit-relaying power and phase shifts are obtained. However, the proposed algorithm has high complexity since the optimal phase shifts are solved by integer linear programming (ILP) whose computational complexity is exponential in the number of variables. To strike a good computational complexity-optimality trade-off, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is proposed by adopting the iterative penalty function based semidefinite programming (SDP) and the successive refinement approaches. Numerical results illustrate that: i) the proposed RIS-CNOMA system, aided by our proposed algorithms, outperforms the conventional CNOMA system. ii) the proposed low-complexity suboptimal algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance. iii) whether the RIS-CNOMA system outperforms the RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (RIS-NOMA) system depends not only on the users’ locations but also on the RIS’s location.}

	abstract = {Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink multi-antenna wireless networks. RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. In this work, we study the performance of RSMA under the important setup of imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) originating from user mobility and latency/delay (between CSI acquisition and data transmission) in the network. We derive a lower bound on the ergodic sum-rate of RSMA for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas, number of users, user speed and transmit power. Then, we study the power allocation between common and private streams and obtain a closed-form solution for optimal power allocation that maximizes the obtained lower bound. The proposed power allocation greatly reduces precoder design complexity for RSMA. By Link-Level Simulations (LLS), we demonstrate that RSMA with the proposed power allocation is robust to the degrading effects of user mobility and has significantly higher performance compared to conventional multi-user (massive) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) strategies. The work has important practical significance as results demonstrate that, in contrast to conventional multi-user (massive) MIMO whose performance collapse under mobility, RSMA can maintain reliable multi-user connectivity in mobile deployments.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising solution to build a programmable wireless environment with reconfigurable passive elements, which can achieve high spectral and energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the ergodic capacity of RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems in both uplink and downlink scenarios. Unlike most of prior works, where instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is assumed, we consider the realistic scenario with only statistical CSI. For both scenarios, we first present an analytical expressions for the ergodic sum capacity of the system. Based on which, the joint power control (or transmit beamforming) and phase shift design problem maximizing the ergodic sum capacity is formulated. Capitalizing on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), fractional programming (FP) and alternating optimization (AO) methods, efficient suboptimal solutions are obtained for the non-convex design problems. Simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of the analytical ergodic sum capacity expressions and evaluate the impact of key system parameters such as CSI, Rician\nK\nfactor, number of RIS elements, and RIS location on the ergodic capacity performance. The findings suggest that the proposed statistical CSI design achieves decent performance compared with the instantaneous CSI based design. Moreover, a signal hot spot can be created when placing the RIS close to the users.}

To alleviate the excessive burden in the multi-server MEC system and tap the underutilized resources of wired edge devices, which are called edge computers in this paper, we investigate the computation offloading and shunting scheme in the wireless wireline internetwork. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average total time delay and use the deep reinforcement learning method to obtain the optimal shunting policy. By sensing the state of the wireless wireline internetwork, the proposed scheme can adaptively adjust the shunting ratio and utilize the resources of MEC servers and edge computers intelligently and jointly. Finally, we evaluate the computational complexity and validate the convergence property of this scheme. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that this scheme can improve the resource productivity and reduce the average total time delay.}

	abstract = {Although the logically-centralized perspective is offered in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), the data plane is still distributed. Update commands sent by the centralized controller are executed asynchronously and independently in each switch. The timed SDN enables synchronous and coordinated update operations as each update command can be triggered by a pre-defined timestamp. Prior work on timed update mainly focuses on producing a congestion-free update sequence, whereas finding a congestion-free timed update sequence may prolong the update time. Even worse, such an update order may not exist. In this paper, we propose Chronus + , a novel timed update system that utilizes the switch buffer to shorten the update time while minimizing the switch buffer during updates. First, we formulate the Minimum Switch Buffer Problem (MSBP) as an integer linear programming and show its hardness. Then, we propose a set of efficient algorithms to solve the problem in polynomial time. Extensive evaluations in Mininet and large-scale simulations show that Chronus + can reduce the update time by at least 17% and the switch buffer size by at least 27% compared with state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Modern 5G services with stringent reliability and latency requirements such as smart healthcare and industrial automation have become possible through the advancement of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). However, the rigidity of ground MEC and its susceptibility to infrastructure failure would prevent satisfying the resiliency and strict requirements of those services. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed for providing flexible edge computing capability through UAV-mounted cloudlets, harnessing their advantages such as mobility, low-cost, and line-of-sight communication. However, UAV-mounted cloudlets may have failure rates that would impact mission-critical applications, necessitating a novel study for the provisioned reliability considering UAV node reliability and task redundancy. In this paper, we investigate the novel problem of UAV-aided ultra-reliable low-latency computation offloading which would enable future IoT services with strict requirements. We aim at maximizing the rate of served requests, by optimizing the UAVs’ positions, the offloading decisions, and the allocated resources while respecting the stringent latency and reliability requirements. To do so, the problem is divided into two phases, the first being a planning problem to optimize the placement of UAVs and the second an operational problem to make optimized offloading and resource allocation decisions with constrained UAVs’ energy. We formulate both problems associated with each phase as non-convex mixed-integer programs, and due to their non-convexity, we propose a two-stage approximate algorithm where the two problems are transformed into approximate convex programs. Further, we approach the problem considering the task partitioning model which will be prevalent in 5G networks. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of our solution considering various scenarios, and compare it to other baseline approaches.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the relay-assisted wireless information and power transfer enabled hybrid visible light communication (VLC)-radio frequency (RF) network, where a light emitting diode (LED) access point (AP) serves multiple information users (IUs) and multiple energy harvesting users (EHUs). IUs are allowed to receive information from the LED AP through time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) manner by either the single-hop VLC-ONLY mode or the relay-assisted dual-hop VLC-RF mode, while EHUs harvest energy via the VLC links. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the achievable information rate of IUs by jointly optimizing the access mode selection, the direct current (DC) offset at the LED AP, the peak amplitude of the alternating current (AC) component at the LED AP, the electrical power allocated to the LED AP and the power allocation at relay, subject to the energy harvesting (EH) requirement constraints of EHUs. To tackle the non-convex problem with binary variables, we first decompose it into two subproblems in terms of the two access modes. Then, the subproblems are equivalently transformed and solved by the proposed successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithms. Simulation results show that significant performance gain can be achieved by optimizing the DC offset. It is also observed that the area where the VLC-ONLY mode is superior to the VLC-RF mode is enlarged with the decrease of the minimal EH requirement. Besides, the achievable information rate of IUs by the VLC-RF mode first increases and then decreases with the increment of the distance between the relay and the LED AP.}

	abstract = {This paper presents novel numerical approaches to finding the secrecy capacity of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel subject to multiple linear transmit covariance constraints, including sum power constraint, per antenna power constraints and interference power constraint. An analytical solution to this problem is not known and existing numerical solutions suffer from slow convergence rate and/or high per-iteration complexity. Deriving computationally efficient solutions to the secrecy capacity problem is challenging since the secrecy rate is expressed as a difference of convex functions (DC) of the transmit covariance matrix, for which its convexity is only known for some special cases. In this paper we propose two low-complexity methods to compute the secrecy capacity along with a convex reformulation for degraded channels. In the first method we capitalize on the accelerated DC algorithm which requires solving a sequence of convex subproblems, for which we propose an efficient iterative algorithm where each iteration admits a closed-form solution. In the second method, we rely on the concave-convex equivalent reformulation of the secrecy capacity problem which allows us to derive the so-called partial best response algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. Notably, each iteration of the second method can also be done in closed form. The simulation results demonstrate a faster convergence rate of our methods compared to other known solutions. We carry out extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the impact of various parameters on the achieved secrecy capacity.}

The prior scheme for defending against the attacks in the localization scheme often introduce high communication overhead and their security relies on the capability of the attackers. In this paper, we propose a lightweight secure ToA-based localization scheme in a WSN by exploiting the noise feature caused by external distance attacks. In comparison with the prior scheme, our scheme provides lower communication overhead and a higher level of security. We theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed scheme over fading channels and derive the closed-form expressions. We implemented our scheme and conducted extensive performance comparisons through simulations. Our experimental results show that the closed-form expressions for the detection performance perfectly match with their simulation results as we expected. The communication overhead of the proposed scheme is saved by 72.8% than that of the prior scheme for different numbers of anchors and is independent of the times of measurements.}

Furthermore, exploiting the temporal correlation present in the parameter vector, a rate-distortion theory based framework is developed for the optimal quantization of the sensor observations so that the resultant distortion is minimized for a given bit-budget. Subsequently, optimal precoders are also developed that minimize the sum-MSE (SMSE) for the scenario of transmitting quantized observations. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the decentralized framework, distributed precoder design algorithms are also developed which design precoders using the consensus based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), wherein each SN determines its precoders without any central coordination by the fusion center.

	abstract = {Sensor networks are an indispensable part of the Internet of Things (IoT), where sensors perform data acquisition and information processing tasks to obtain the parameters of interest so that IoT-based monitoring, diagnosis and other systems respond quickly to the changing conditions, instantaneous faults, etc. Distributed estimation algorithms are usually employed to estimate the parameters of interest in these IoT-based applications. However, when sensor networks have highly correlated input signals and nonstationary behavior in which the parameters of interest are time-varying, conventional distributed estimation algorithms suffer from severely degraded learning performance due to the large eigenvalue spread in the covariance matrix of the input signals and the random perturbation of the parameters of interest. To address these problems, this paper proposes two diffusion Bayesian subband adaptive filter (DBSAF) algorithms from a Bayesian learning perspective. As the highly-correlated input signal is whitened in a multiband structure and an estimate of the uncertainty in the parameters of interest is obtained by performing Bayesian inference, the proposed DBSAF algorithms are able to achieve better learning performance in comparison with the competing diffusion algorithms. The transient and steady-state mean square error performance of the proposed DBSAF algorithms are analyzed, and are verified by numerical simulations. A lower bound on the time-varying step-size is derived to maintain the optimal steady-state performance in nonstationary scenarios. A new method for the estimation of the noise variance is also proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate the excellent learning performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison with benchmark algorithms.}

In practical wireless networks, environmental changes cause the oscillator to be imperfect. Thus, it is necessary to track the nonlinear varying clock dynamically. In this paper, we propose a timestamp-free clock skew (frequency difference) and offset (time difference) joint tracking algorithm based on extended Kalman filter (EKF), which can be embedded into the general network data flow to achieve long-term synchronization without additional communication overhead. To further improve energy efficiency of clock synchronization, this paper develops an EKF clock skew tracking algorithm for silent nodes in receiver-only synchronization. For the situation that silent node overhears synchronization information from multiple active nodes, we present multi-information timestamp-free synchronization and multi-observation clock skew fusion scheme for silent nodes. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel training beam sequence design for multiuser millimeter wave tracking systems is proposed. For each receiver, a single-path channel model is firstly investigated, where we introduce a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion to estimate the time-varying angle of departure (AoD), followed by an extended Kalman filter to update the stale complex path gain. We then employ training beam sequence design to minimize the estimated AoD’s average mean squared error (AMSE), which however has no explicit expression. We firstly derive a closed-form upper bound for the AMSE and then simplify this upper bound into a tractable form, based on which a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) is formulated. By solving this NLP optimally using its corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we obtain an efficient training beam sequence. The proposed MAP criterion and its associated training beam sequence design are further extended to multi-path scenarios, where a joint estimation of the multiple paths is firstly discussed, followed by a sequential estimation as a low-complexity alternative. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the existing benchmark methods, especially in the case when the receivers’ channels change rapidly.}

	abstract = {In order to satisfy the requirement of extremely high data rate in traffic hotspot regions, millimeter wave (mmWave) has attracted significant attention in wireless communication networks. While the coverage performance of mmWave networks based on the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) has been widely studied, it provides only very limited information on the link reliability. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained performance analysis of the mmWave networks with hotspots. Specifically, we first establish a general and tractable framework to investigate the performance of mmWave networks using the Poisson cluster process integrated with several features of the mmWave band. Both open and closed association strategies are considered. To show what fraction of users in the networks achieves target reliability when the SINR is given, we derive the tier association probability and the moments of the conditional SINR distribution, based on which the exact meta distributions of SINR are given. Interestingly, in clustered mmWave networks, the widely used standard and generalized beta approximations do not work well when the blockage effect is severe. To resolve this issue, we provide a modified approximation by scaling the standard beta distribution, which is shown to be closer to the exact results. We conduct extensive simulations to study the impact of mmWave and deployment features on the performance of clustered mmWave networks. Numerical results reveal that the optimal scattering variance of mmWave base stations scales with the cluster size to maximize the number of concurrent reliable links, and increasing the antenna directivity results in more reliable communications than elevating the transmit power of mmWave base stations.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the adoption of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for multiple user pairs in two-hop networks is investigated. Different from the existing studies on IRS that mainly focused on tuning the reflection coefficients of all elements, we consider the implementation of true reflection resource management (RRM) through the identification of the best triggered module subset. More precisely, the implementation of true RRM builds on the premise of our proposed modular IRS structure consisting of multiple independent and controllable modules. In the context of modular IRS structure, we investigate the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based max-min problem subject to per source terminals (STs) power budgets and module size constraint, via joint triggered module subset identification, transmit power allocation, and the corresponding passive beamforming. Whereas this problem is NP-hard due to the module size constraint, which can be addressed by the convex sparsity-inducing approximation to the hard module size constraint using mixed\nℓ\n1,F\n-norm\n, where it yields a suitable semidefinite relaxation. Using techniques from separable convex programming, we provide a two-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for the approximated problem. Numerical simulations are used to validate the analysis and assess the performance of the proposed algorithm as a function of the system parameters. Further energy efficiency (EE) performance comparison demonstrates the necessity and meaningfulness of the introduced modular IRS structure. Specifically, for a given network setting, there is an optimal value of the number of triggered modules for system, when the EE is considered.}

	abstract = {Energy-efficient designs play an important role in the Internet of Things (IoT) that monitors multiple phenomena, due to the limited power supply and complicated observation. In this paper, taking into account the power consumptions of observation, coding, and communication, we propose a joint sparse observation and coding scheme for energy-efficient monitoring of multiple phenomena using IoT. Through the analysis of outage performance, we find that the sparse observation and coding scheme can achieve the performance of the full observation scheme in which all nodes observe all phenomena with lower power consumption due to the dynamic and selective observation and coding. With the derived achievable rates and network power consumption, we study the trade-off between achievable rates and network power consumption that is determined by both the observation matrix and the coding matrix. For given rate constraints, we propose an optimization problem to minimize the network power consumption by jointly designing the observation and coding matrices. To solve this NP-hard problem efficiently, we propose a low-complexity algorithm with the convex-concave procedure. Moreover, to improve performance in high noise environment, we adopt collaboration among nodes to suppress observation noises and equalize bad observations by utilizing observation diversity. Finally, simulation results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) is a promising technology for energy- and spectrum-efficient wireless communication, which exploits passive communication for Internet-of-Things (IoT) transmission and achieves a mutualistic spectrum sharing between the passive and active transmissions. In this paper, we study an reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered symbiotic radio over a broadcasting system, i.e., a base station (BS) broadcasts signals to multiple primary receivers (PRs) under the assistance of an RIS, while the RIS also transmits information to an IoT receiver (IR) by riding over the broadcasting signals. We formulate a problem to minimize the BS’s transmit power by jointly optimizing the BS’s active precoding and the RIS’s passive beamforming, under the signal-to-noise-ratio constraints of the primary and IoT transmissions. However, the problem is challenging to be solved optimally, since the variables are coupled and the constraints are non-convex. An iterative algorithm based on block coordinated descent (BCD) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques is first proposed, and its convergence together with complexity are analyzed. Then, to tackle the problem of high computational complexity caused by SDR technique, we further propose an alternative algorithm based on generalized power method (GPM) technique. Simulation results validate that the proposed system outperforms the traditional broadcasting system without RIS. The GPM-based algorithm achieves nearly the same transmit power performance as SDR-based algorithm, with a significantly reduced computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the uplink communication of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted system, in which an user equipment (UE) with single radio frequency (RF) chain delivers information to an access point (AP) by adopting the spatial modulation (SM). Specifically, we first investigate the transmit SM (TSM) scheme and jointly optimize the UE’s power allocation matrix and the RIS reflection coefficients to enhance the system reliability. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem to reduce the system symbol-error-rate (SER) and propose a novel penalty-alternative optimizing algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. Following this, we show that with the assistant of RIS, receive SM (RSM) scheme can also be performed even if the UE has only one RF chain. Based on this observation, a novel RIS-assisted RSM scheme is proposed, which can provide a low cost and complexity solution for system realization. The reflection coefficients of the RIS are also optimized for the proposed RSM. Numerical results show that the RIS-assisted TSM can achieve a lower SER than the conventional communication scheme (CTS) without SM and the proposed RSM scheme has lower detection complexity than that of CTS. It is also shown that the performance of the TSM and RSM schemes is more sensitive to the quantization accuracy of the phase of the RIS coefficients than that of the amplitude.}

We study the joint design of beamformers at an access point (AP) and the phase shifts as well as the energy harvesting schedule at the IRS for maximizing the system sum-rate. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the wireless energy harvesting capability of IRS elements, secure communications, and the robustness against the impact of channel state information (CSI) imperfection. Subsequently, we propose a computationally-efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to the design problem. In each iteration, \\mathcal {S}\n-procedure and the successive convex approximation are adopted to handle the intermediate optimization problem. Our simulation results unveil that: 1) there is a non-trivial trade-off between the system sum-rate and the self-sustainability of the IRS; 2) the performance gain achieved by the proposed scheme is saturated with a large number of energy harvesting IRS elements; 3) an IRS equipped with small bit-resolution discrete phase shifters is sufficient to achieve a considerable system sum-rate of the ideal case with continuous phase shifts.}

	abstract = {We consider utility maximization problems in the downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) whereby a large number of access points (APs) simultaneously serve a group of users. Four fundamental maximization objectives are of interest: (i) average spectral efficiency (SE), (ii) proportional fairness, (iii) harmonic-rate, and (iv) minimum SE of all users, subject to a sum power constraint at each AP. As considered problems are non-convex, existing solutions normally rely on successive convex approximation (SCA) and use off-the-shelf convex solvers, which implement an interior-point algorithm, to solve derived convex problems. The complexity of such methods scales quickly with the problem size. Therefore, we propose an accelerated projected gradient method to solve the considered problems. Particularly, each iteration of the proposed solution is given in a closed form and only requires the first order oracle of the objective, rather than the Hessian matrix as in known solutions, and thus is much more memory efficient. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solution achieves the same utility performance but with far less run-time, compared to the SCA method. Simulation results show that large-scale cell-free massive MIMO has the intrinsic user fairness, i.e. the four utility functions can deliver nearly uniformed services to all users.}

	abstract = {The Terahertz band is envisioned to meet the demanding 100 Gbps data rates for 6G wireless communications. Aiming at combating the distance limitation problem with low hardware-cost, ultra-massive MIMO with hybrid beamforming is promising. However, relationships among wavelength, array size and antenna spacing give rise to the inaccuracy of planar-wave channel model (PWM), while an enlarged channel matrix dimension leads to excessive parameters of applying spherical-wave channel model (SWM). Moreover, due to the adoption of hybrid beamforming, channel estimation (CE) needs to recover high-dimensional channels from severely compressed channel observation. In this paper, a hybrid spherical- and planar-wave channel model (HSPM) is investigated and proved to be accurate and efficient by adopting PWM within subarray and SWM among subarrays. Furthermore, a two-phase HSPM CE mechanism is developed. A deep convolutional-neural-network (DCNN) is designed in the first phase for parameter estimation of reference subarrays, while geometric relationships of the remaining channel parameters between reference subarrays are leveraged to complete CE in the second phase. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the HSPM is accurate at various communication distances, array sizes and carrier frequencies. The DCNN converges fast and achieves high accuracy with 5.2 dB improved normalized-mean-square-error compared to literature methods, and owns substantially low complexity.}

To overcome the lack of wireless resources, we propose a machine learning-based solution, where only one control system is controlled, while the rest of the control systems are actuated by locally predicting the missing state and/or action information using the previous uplink and/or downlink receptions via a Gaussian process regression (GPR). This GPR prediction credibility is determined using the age-of-information (AoI) of the latest reception. Moreover, the successful reception is affected by the transmission power, mandating a co-design of the communication and control operations. To this end, we formulate a network-wide minimization problem of the average AoI and transmission power under communication reliability and control stability constraints. To solve the problem, we propose a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization framework. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can stably control\n2×\nmore number of actuators compared to an event-triggered scheduling baseline with Kalman filtering and frequency division multiple access, which is\n18×\nlarger than a round-robin scheduling baseline.}

We mathematically derive the exact closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP), symbol error rate (SER), and ergodic capacity (EC) of the FD relay system with I-CSI, THN, and RSI over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels. From the derived expressions, the performance of the considered system under the effects of three negative factors (I-CSI, THN, and RSI) is compared with that system in the case of all ideal factors (perfect channel state information (P-CSI), perfect transceiver hardware (P-TH) and perfect self-interference cancellation (P-SIC)), two ideal factors (P-CSI and P-TH, P-CSI and P-SIC, P-TH and P-SIC), or one ideal factor (P-CSI or P-TH or P-SIC). Numerical results show a strong impact of three negative factors on the OP, SER, and EC of the considered FD relay system, especially when the data transmission rate of the system and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are high. In particular, OP, SER, and EC go to the floors in the high SNR regime due to the three negative factors. Therefore, when I-CSI, THNs, and RSI exist in the FD relay system, we should use suitable source and relay transmission power to obtain excellent performance while saving energy consumption. Moreover, when two of the three negative factors are large enough, the remaining factor’s impact becomes weaker and may be neglected in certain circumstances.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a receiver structure for single-carrier uplink transmission with frequency domain equalization (FDE) that is exposed to power amplifier (PA) nonlinearities. A two-stage approach is adopted, in which linear communication channel is equalized at the first stage, and it is followed by post-distortion, where nonlinear distortion is reduced. In the literature, nonlinear processing techniques are proposed, which perform memoryless compensation of nonlinear distortion together with FDE. However, in this study, we show that even if memoryless nonlinearity exists, the received signal is impaired by nonlinear inter-symbol-interference. Therefore, we propose a class of symbol rate post-distortion techniques, which use neighboring received symbols to suppress the nonlinear interference. Three different post-distortion methods, Gaussian process regression (GPR), neural network (NN) and Volterra series (VS) based post-distorters, are considered. Also, a combiner, which intelligently combines the outputs of fractional delayed bank of FDE’s after post-distortion, is proposed to overcome performance degradation of FDE for frequency selective channels under nonlinear distortion. Performances of the proposed techniques are compared with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of bit error rate (BER) and achievable information rate (AIR) metrics. Simulation results demonstrate that post-distortion methods together with bank of FDE outperform state-of-the-art techniques.}

As a consequence, the proposed approach does not require the estimation of either instantaneous channel state information (CSI) or second-order channel statistics for IRS optimization, thus significantly relaxing (or even avoiding) the need of frequently reconfiguring the IRSs, which constitutes one of the most critical issues in IRS-assisted systems. Numerical results confirm the validity of the proposed approach. It is shown, in particular, that IRS-assisted wireless systems that are optimized based on statistical position information still provide large performance gains as compared to the baseline scenarios in which no IRSs are deployed.}

	abstract = {Lossless data transfer over communication networks has traditionally been achieved by means of ARQ protocols. However, the last ten years have seen an increasing interest in using erasure-correcting codes as an alternative, with the goal of reducing latency, feedback overhead, etc. Since these two approaches possess advantages as well as drawbacks, several hybrid ARQ schemes have also been proposed as good compromise solutions, in order to attain the “best of both worlds”. Extending this principle, this paper develops new classes of hybrid ARQ protocols for erasure channels that allow for flexible trade-offs between two important cost metrics, viz., the computational complexity of coding , and the amount of feedback needed. Our hybrid schemes make use of Tornado codes – a class of low-complexity capacity-achieving erasure codes – whose coding structure is well-suited for feedback-based communications. These schemes demonstrate significant cost reductions versus coding-only and feedback-only approaches over a wide region of interest. Moreover, these schemes are easily tuned to achieve different operating points on a trade-off curve. Finally, the proposed schemes showcase novel means of interweaving coding and feedback.}

	abstract = {To provide reliable transmissions with flexible rates for satellite communications, this paper presents a novel method of constructing multi-rate quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The basic idea is to generate low-rate codes from a high-rate mother code by combining shortening and extending, which ensures that the generated code family owns the same code length, in order to maintain the same frame structure. The code construction involves the design of base matrices and exponent matrices for the designed codes. A progressive row elimination and addition algorithm is proposed for designing the code base matrices from a high rate to low rates. This algorithm leads to the nested and systematic structure of the parity-check matrices, which are desirable for practical implementations of their encoders and decoders, while ensuring the optimal decoding thresholds. In addition, we construct a circulation coefficient matrix based on finite fields and select the optimal rows in this matrix to construct exponent matrices while considering of cycle structures. We demonstrate that the designed codes achieve better performance for all the code rates than the LDPC codes in DVB-S2X standards. In addition, the proposed codes do not exhibit error floors for their block error rates down to 10 −5 .}

	abstract = {Hardware impairment is inevitable in many wireless systems. It is particularly severe in low-cost applications due to the imperfect components used. In this paper, the channel estimation and non-coherent detection problems of hardware impaired signals are studied for a single-carrier, single-antenna and single-hop system. Specifically, three different cases are investigated: signals with additive distortion only, signals with in-phase and quadrature imbalance only, and signals with both impairments. The maximum likelihood and Gaussian approximation methods are used to derive the new non-coherent detectors for amplitude modulated signals, while the maximum likelihood and moment-based methods are employed to design the new channel estimators for all signals. Numerical results show that the new non-coherent detectors outperform the existing non-coherent detectors in the presence of hardware impairment. The performance gain can be as high as 8 dB. They also show that the new channel estimators have much higher accuracy than the existing estimator. In some conditions, the accuracy of the new estimator is about 100 times that of the existing estimator.}

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with detecting an integer parameter vector inside a box from a linear model that is corrupted with a noise vector following the Gaussian distribution. One of the commonly used detectors is the maximum likelihood detector, which is obtained by solving a box-constrained integer least squares problem, that is NP-hard. Two other popular detectors are the box-constrained rounding and Babai detectors due to their high efficiency of implementation. In this paper, we first present formulas for the success probabilities (the probabilities of correct detection) of these three detectors for two different situations: the integer parameter vector is deterministic and is uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Then, we give two simple examples to respectively show that the success probability of the box-constrained rounding detector can be larger than that of the box-constrained Babai detector and the latter can be larger than the success probability of the maximum likelihood detector when the parameter vector is deterministic, and prove that the success probability of the box-constrained rounding detector is always not larger than that of the box-constrained Babai detector when the parameter vector is uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Some relations between the results for the box constrained and ordinary cases are presented, and two bounds on the success probability of the maximum likelihood detector, which can easily be computed, are developed. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate our main theoretical findings.}

Finally, we develop an AAM algorithm for uplink NOMA systems by studying the closed-form BER expressions.

However, their inherent correlation in the finite block length (FBL) regime has remained uninvestigated as it is affected by block length and update rate in a complex manner. In this paper, closed-form expressions for average age of information (AoI), peak AoI (PAoI) and delay are derived for an FBL Last-Come First-Served system with retransmission and non-preemption policies, based on which a comprehensive analysis of the relationship among the three metrics in the FBL regime is presented. It is proved that there exists a strong tradeoff between delay and AoI/PAoI given a block length, and that AoI, PAoI and delay have positive correlation given an update rate, regardless of the weight. With the goal of minimizing delay and AoI simultaneously, the weighted sum of delay and PAoI (upper bound on AoI) is formulated and proved to be convex with respect to block length and update rate. A low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed with a closed-form expression of the optimal update rate, whose performance approaches the Pareto boundaries of the PAoI-delay and the AoI-delay regions, at much lower complexity than exhaustive search.}

In this paper, a unified MIMO optimization framework based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is proposed. In this framework, with the aid of matrix optimization theory, Theorem 1 presents a generic optimal transmit covariance matrix for MIMO systems with diverse objective functions subject to various power constraints and different levels of channel state information (CSI). Specifically, Theorem 1 fundamentally reveals that for a diverse family of MIMO systems, the optimal transmit covariance matrices associated with different objective functions under various power constraints can be derived in a unified generic water-filling-like form. When applying Theorem 1 to the case of multiple general power constraints, we firstly equivalently transform multiple power constraints into a single counterpart by introducing multiple weighting factors based on Pareto optimization theory. The optimal weighting factors can be found by the proposed modified subgradient method. On the other hand, for the imperfect MIMO system with statistical CSI errors, we firstly address the non-convexity of the robust optimization problem by following the idea of alternating optimization. Finally, our numerical results verify the optimal solution structure in Theorem 1 and the global optimality of the proposed modified subgradient method, as well as demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed alternating optimization algorithm.}

	abstract = {A multi-user fog radio access network (F-RAN) is designed for supporting content-centric services. The requested contents are partitioned into sub-contents, which are then ‘beamformed’ by the remote radio heads (RRHs) for transmission to the users. Since a large number of beamformers must be designed, this poses a computational challenge. We tackle this challenge by proposing a new class of regularized zero forcing beamforming (RZFB) for directly mitigating the inter-content interferences, while the ‘intra-content interference’ is mitigated by successive interference cancellation at the user end. Thus each beamformer is decided by a single real variable (for proper Gaussian signaling) or by a pair of complex variables (for improper Gaussian signaling). Hence the total number of decision variables is substantially reduced to facilitate tractable computation. To address the problem of energy efficiency optimization subject to multiple constraints, such as individual user-rate requirement and the fronthauling constraint of the links between the RRHs and the centralized baseband signal processing unit, as well as the total transmit power budget, we develop low-complexity path-following algorithms. Finally, we confirm their performance by simulations.}

To address the non-convexity of this problem, we develop a new block coordinate descent (BCD) framework which decouples the D2D-CU pairing, power allocation and receive beamforming, from the configuration of the RISs. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the power allocation and receive beamforming under any D2D-CU pairing, which facilitates interpreting the D2D-CU pairing as a bipartite graph matching solved using the Hungarian algorithm. We transform the configuration of the RISs into a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with multiple quadratic constraints. A low-complexity algorithm, named Riemannian manifold-based alternating direction method of multipliers (RM-ADMM), is developed to decompose the QCQP into simpler QCQPs with a single constraint each, and solve them efficiently in a decentralized manner. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the sum-rate of the D2D-underlaid system with a reduced complexity, as compared to its alternative based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR).}

Then, for the upper bound, we provide a class of UCIs, termed \\eta\ncode, to achieve K_{C}=2.75\n. This approach improves the prior result K_{C}=3\nachieved by Elias \\gamma\ncoding. Next, we propose an asymptotically optimal UCI, termed \\theta\ncode, to achieve K_{C}=3.5\n. Finally, we compare the range of the minimum value of K_{C}\nof \\eta\ncode, \\theta\ncode and some other UCIs.}

	abstract = {A communication link aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is studied in which the transmitter can control the state of the RIS via a finite-rate control link. Channel state information (CSI) is acquired at the receiver based on pilot-assisted channel estimation, and it may or may not be shared with the transmitter. Considering quasi-static fading channels with imperfect CSI, capacity-achieving signalling is shown to implement joint encoding of the transmitted signal and of the response of the RIS. This demonstrates the information-theoretic optimality of RIS-based modulation, or “single-RF MIMO” systems. In addition, a novel signalling strategy based on separate layered encoding that enables practical successive cancellation-type decoding at the receiver is proposed. Numerical experiments show that the conventional scheme that fixes the reflection pattern of the RIS, irrespective of the transmitted information, as to maximize the achievable rate is strictly suboptimal, and is outperformed by the proposed adaptive coding strategies at all practical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.}

	abstract = {Recent information-theoretic studies have resulted in several interference management (IM) techniques that promise significant capacity improvements over interference avoidance techniques. However, in practice, the stable throughput region is a more relevant metric compared to the capacity region. In this work, we focus on the stable throughput region of a two-pair intermittent interference network with distributed transmitters and propose a queue-based transmission protocol in different regimes to handle the data between queues. In this context, we translate physical-layer IM protocols to accommodate stochastic message arrivals. To evaluate our proposed techniques, we compare the stable throughput region to the capacity region and show, through simulations, that the stable throughput region matches the capacity region when the latter is known. We show that in order to achieve the optimal stable throughput region, new ingredients are needed when compared to prior results. We quantify the trade-off between encoding/decoding complexity of the proposed scheme (in terms of number of required algebraic operations), and the achievable rates. Finally, we study the lifetime of messages (i.e. the duration from arrival to successful delivery) versus the total communication time, and we observe that the average lifetime scales as the square root of the total communication time.}

	abstract = {The robust principles of treating interference as noise (TIN) when it is sufficiently weak, and avoiding it when it is not, form the background of this work. Combining TIN with the topological interference management (TIM) framework that identifies optimal interference avoidance schemes, we formulate a TIM-TIN problem for multilevel topological interference management, wherein only a coarse knowledge of channel strengths and no knowledge of channel phases is available to transmitters. To address the TIM-TIN problem, we first propose an analytical baseline approach, which decomposes a network into TIN and TIM components, allocates the signal power levels to each user in the TIN component, allocates signal vector space dimensions to each user in the TIM component, and guarantees that the product of the two is an achievable number of signal dimensions available to each user in the original network. Next, a distributed numerical algorithm called ZEST is developed. The convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated, leading to the duality of the TIM-TIN problem in terms of generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). Numerical results are also provided to demonstrate the superior sum-rate performance and fast convergence of ZEST.}

	abstract = {Achievable data rates in wireless systems rely heavily on the available channel state information (CSI) throughout the network. However, feedback links, which provide this information, are scarce, unreliable, and subject to security threats. In this work, we study the impact of having intermittent feedback links on the capacity region of the canonical two-user erasure broadcast channels. In our model, at any time instant, each receiver broadcasts its CSI, and at any other node, this information either becomes available with unit delay or gets erased. For this setting, we develop a new set of outer bounds to capture the intermittent nature of the feedback links. These outer bounds depend on the probability that the CSI from both receivers are erased at the transmitter. In particular, if at any time, the CSI from at least one of the two receivers is available at the other two nodes, then the outer-bounds match the capacity with global delayed CSI. We also provide capacity-achieving transmission strategies under certain scenarios, and we establish a connection between this problem and Blind Index Coding with feedback.}

Each user has access to\nL\nneighbouring cache-nodes with a cyclic wrap-around topology. The coded caching scheme proposed by Hachem et al. suffers from the case that\nL\ndoes not divide\nK\n, where the needed number of transmissions (a.k.a. load) is at most four times the load expression for the case where\nL\ndivides\nK\n. Our main contribution is to propose a novel transformation approach to smartly extend the schemes satisfying some conditions for the well known shared-link caching systems to the multiaccess caching systems. Then we can get many coded caching schemes with different subpacketizations for multiaccess coded caching system. These resulting schemes have the maximum local caching gain (i.e., the cached contents stored at any\nL\nneighbouring cache-nodes are different such that the number of retrieval packets by each user from the connected cache-nodes is maximal) and the same coded caching gain as the original schemes. Applying the transformation approach to the well-known shared-link coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we obtain a new multiaccess coded caching scheme that achieves the same load as the scheme of Hachem et al. but for any system parameters. Under the constraint of the cache placement used in this new multiaccess coded caching scheme, our delivery strategy is approximately optimal when\nK\nis sufficiently large. Finally, we also show that the transmission load of the proposed scheme can be further reduced by compressing the multicast message.}

A master asks\nN\ndistributed workers to compute a linearly separable function of\nK\ndatasets, which is a set of\nK\nc\nlinear combinations of\nK\nequal-length messages (each message is a function of one dataset). We assign some datasets to each worker in an uncoded manner, who then computes the corresponding messages and returns some function of these messages, such that from the answers of any\nN\nr\nout of\nN\nworkers the master can recover the task function with high probability. In the literature, the specific case where\nK\nc\n=1\nor where the computation cost is minimum has been considered. In this paper, we focus on the general case (i.e., general\nK\nc\nand general computation cost) and aim to find the minimum communication cost. We first propose a novel converse bound on the communication cost under the constraint of the popular cyclic assignment (widely considered in the literature), which assigns the datasets to the workers in a cyclic way. Motivated by the observation that existing strategies for distributed computing fall short of achieving the converse bound, we propose a novel distributed computing scheme for some system parameters. The proposed computing scheme is optimal for any assignment when\nK\nc\nis large and is optimal under the cyclic assignment when the numbers of workers and datasets are equal or\nK\nc\nis small. In addition, it is order optimal within a factor of 2 under the cyclic assignment for the remaining cases.}

We formulate a long-term stochastic optimization problem that involves a joint optimization of NOMA user partitioning and RIS phase shifting, aiming at maximizing the sum data rate of the mobile users (MUs) in NOMA downlink networks. To solve the challenging joint optimization problem, we invoke a modified object migration automation (MOMA) algorithm to partition the users into equal-size clusters. To optimize the RIS phase shifting matrix, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to collaboratively control multiple reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS. Different from conventional training-then-testing processing, we consider a long-term self-adjusting learning model where the intelligent agent is capable of learning the optimal action for every given state through exploration and exploitation. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The proposed RIS-aided NOMA downlink framework achieves enhanced sum data rate compared with the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) framework. 2) The proposed DDPG algorithm is capable of learning a dynamic resource allocation policy in a long-term manner. 3) The performance of the proposed RIS-aided NOMA framework can be improved by increasing the granularity of the RIS phase shifts. The numerical results also show that increasing the number of reflecting elements (REs) is an efficient method to improve the sum data rate of the MUs.}

By exploiting channel estimates and statistical parameters of channel estimation error, we aim to design precoding vectors to maximize the utility function on the ergodic rates of users subject to a total transmit power constraint. By employing an upper bound of the ergodic rate, we leverage the corresponding Lagrangian formulation and identify the structural characteristics of the optimal precoder as the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem. The Lagrange multipliers play a crucial role in determining both precoding directions and power parameters, yet are challenging to be solved directly. To figure out the Lagrange multipliers, we develop a general framework underpinned by a properly designed neural network that learns directly from CSI. To further relieve the computational burden, we obtain a low-complexity framework by decomposing the original problem into computationally efficient subproblems with instantaneous and statistical CSI handled separately. With the offline pre-trained neural network, the online computational complexity of precoder is substantially reduced compared with the existing iterative algorithm while maintaining nearly the same performance.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel framework for guaranteeing ultra-reliable millimeter wave (mmW) communications using multiple artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed. The use of multiple AI-powered RISs allows changing the propagation direction of the signals transmitted from a mmW access point (AP) thereby improving coverage particularly for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. However, due to the possibility of highly stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an intelligent controller to jointly optimize the mmW AP beam and RIS phase shifts is a daunting task. In this regard, first, a parametric risk-sensitive episodic return is proposed to maximize the expected bitrate and mitigate the risk of mmW link blockage. Then, a closed-form approximation of the policy gradient of the risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. Next, the problem of joint beamforming for mmW AP and phase shift control for mmW RISs is modeled as an identical payoff stochastic game within a cooperative multi-agent environment, in which the agents are the mmW AP and the RISs. Two centralized and distributed controllers are proposed to control the policies of the mmW AP and RISs. To directly find a near optimal solution, the parametric functional-form policies for the controllers are modeled using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The deep RNN-based controllers are then trained based on the derived closed-form gradient of the risk-sensitive episodic return. It is proved that the gradient update algorithm converges to the same locally optimal parameters as the deep RNN-based centralized and distributed controllers. Simulation results show that the error between the policies of the optimal and the RNN-based controllers is less than 1.5%. Moreover, the variance of the achievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based controllers is 60% less than the variance of the risk-averse baseline.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based beam tracking method for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Beam tracking is employed for transmitting the known symbols using the sounding beams and tracking time-varying channels to maintain a reliable communication link. When the pose of a user equipment (UE) device varies rapidly, the mmWave channels also tend to vary fast, which hinders seamless communication. Thus, models that can capture temporal behavior of mmWave channels caused by the motion of the device are required, to cope with this problem. Accordingly, we employ a deep neural network to analyze the temporal structure and patterns underlying in the time-varying channels and the signals acquired by inertial sensors. We propose a model based on long short term memory (LSTM) that predicts the distribution of the future channel behavior based on a sequence of input signals available at the UE. This channel distribution is used to 1) control the sounding beams adaptively for the future channel state and 2) update the channel estimate through the measurement update step under a sequential Bayesian estimation framework. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant performance gain over the conventional beam tracking methods under various mobility scenarios.}

	abstract = {We investigate the coexistence of underlay spectrum sharing in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A primary system with geographically distributed primary access points (P-APs) serves a multitude of primary users (PUs), while a secondary system serves a large number of secondary users (SUs) in the same primary/licensed spectrum by exploiting the underlay spectrum sharing. To mitigate the secondary co-channel interference inflected at PUs, stringent secondary transmit power constraints are defined for the secondary access points (S-APs). A generalized pilots sharing scheme is used to locally estimate the uplink channels at P-APs/S-APs, and thereby, conjugate precoders are adopted to serve PUs/SUs in the same time-frequency resource element. Moreover, the effect of a user-centric AP clustering scheme is investigated by assigning a suitable set of APs to a particular user. The impact of estimated downlink (DL) channels at PUs/SUs via DL pilots beamformed by P-APs/S-APs is investigated. The achievable primary/secondary rates at PUs/SUs are derived for the statistical DL and estimated DL CSI cases. User-fairness for PUs/SUs is achieved by designing efficient transmit power control policies based on a multi-objective optimization problem formulation of joint underlay spectrum sharing and max-min criteria. The proposed orthogonal multiple-access based analytical framework is also extended to facilitate non-orthogonal multiple-access. Our analysis and numerical results manifest that the primary/secondary performance of underlay spectrum sharing can be boosted by virtue of the average reduction of transmit powers/path-losses, uniform coverage/service, and macro-diversity gains, which are inherent to distributed transmissions/receptions of cell-free massive MIMO.}

	abstract = {Semi-grant-free (SGF) transmission has recently received significant attention due to its capability to accommodate massive connectivity and reduce access delay by admitting grant-free users to channels which would otherwise be solely occupied by grant-based users. In this paper, a new SGF transmission scheme that exploits the flexibility in choosing the decoding order in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed. Compared to existing SGF schemes, this new scheme can ensure that admitting the grant-free users is completely transparent to the grant-based users, i.e., the grant-based users’ quality-of-service experience is guaranteed to be the same as for orthogonal multiple access. In addition, compared to existing SGF schemes, the proposed SGF scheme can significantly improve the robustness of the grant-free users’ transmissions and effectively avoid outage probability error floors. To facilitate the performance evaluation of the proposed SGF transmission scheme, an exact expression for the outage probability is obtained and an asymptotic analysis is conducted to show that the achievable multi-user diversity gain is proportional to the number of participating grant-free users. Computer simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed SGF transmission scheme and verify the accuracy of the developed analytical results.}

	abstract = {Multiple antenna technology and cooperative relaying are two efficient methods to improve the capacity and reliability of wireless networks. By marrying cooperative relaying with a Rate-Splitting (RS) approach, Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) shows certain benefits compared to several non-cooperative and cooperative schemes in multi-antenna Broadcast Channel (BC). In this paper, we further investigate the CRS with partial Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT), as partial CSIT is an inevitable issue in practical downlink Multi-user Multiple Input Single Output (MU-MISO) systems. The proposed CRS structure includes multiple users, and one user could be selected as a relay to help the other users. With the flexible design, CRS leverages the benefits of user cooperation and relay (or user) selection for cooperative network, and also retains the superiority of RS for multi-antenna BC. Considering the Weighted Average Sum Rate (WASR) performance, we aim to solve the stochastic optimization that jointly involves the precoder design, the time resource allocation, and the relay selection issue. To address the above non-convex problem, a dedicated algorithm for CRS that exploits the Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) approach and the Convex-Concave Procedure (CCP) is proposed, such that the WASR is maximized by jointly updating the precoding matrix and time allocation factor according to the incoming user channel state estimate. The proposed algorithm then enables us to solve the relay selection through an exhaustive search. Since the optimal relay selection algorithm has a high computational complexity when the number of users is large, we additionally provide a suboptimal heuristic algorithm to strike a balance between complexity and performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CRS scheme is capable of achieving a larger WASR than its non-cooperative counterpart and several existing beamforming schemes in a wide range of propagation conditions, and the heuristic algorithm achieves a performance close to the optimal one but with lower complexity.}

Massive access schemes have been studied for co-located massive MIMO arrays. In this paper, we investigate the activity detection in grant-free random access for mMTC in cell-free massive MIMO networks using distributed arrays. Each active device transmits a non-orthogonal pilot sequence to the access points (APs) and the APs send the received signals to a central processing unit (CPU) for joint activity detection. The maximum likelihood device activity detection problem is formulated and algorithms for activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO are provided to solve it. The simulation results show that the macro diversity gain provided by the cell-free architecture improves the activity detection performance compared to co-located architecture when the coverage area is large.}

	abstract = {The performance of grant-free random access (GF-RA) is limited by the number of accessible random access resources (RRs) due to the absence of collision resolution. Compressive sensing (CS)-based RA schemes scale up the RRs at the expense of increased non-orthogonality among transmitted signals. This paper presents the design of multi-sequence spreading random access (MSRA) which employs multiple spreading sequences to spread the different symbols of a user as opposed to the conventional schemes in which a user employs the same spreading sequence for each symbol. We show that MSRA provides code diversity, enabling the multi-user detection (MUD) to be modeled into a well-conditioned multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) CS problem. The code diversity is quantified by the decrease in the average Babel mutual coherence among the spreading sequences. Moreover, we present a two-stage active user detection (AUD) scheme for both wideband and narrowband implementations. Our theoretical analysis shows that with MSRA activity misdetection falls exponentially while the size of GF-RA frame is increased. Finally, the simulation results show that about 82% increase in utilization of RRs, i.e., more active users, is supported by MSRA than the conventional schemes while achieving the RA failure rate lower bound set by random access collision.}

The maximum throughput of S-ALOHA system is known as\ne\n−1\n≈0.3679\n(packets/slot) for a large number of users. This work proposes a novel S-ALOHA system, where the user with a successful (re)transmission of the packet at the head of queue is allowed to keep on transmitting his packet with some reservation probability if his queue is not empty. We call this system S-ALOHA system with successive transmission (ST) and show that the throughput of the proposed system becomes one packet per slot as the reservation probability is raised. We analyze the stability region of S-ALOHA systems with ST for two heterogeneous users and also investigate the stability condition of the system with\nN\nsymmetric users. Finally, we develop a Bayesian-learning backoff algorithm, with which users can control their (re)transmission with real-time estimation on the backlogged users. It is shown that the system with the proposed backoff algorithm can achieve the theoretical limit of the throughput.}

	abstract = {Non-cooperative cellular massive MIMO, combined with power control, is known to lead to significant improvements in per-user throughput compared with conventional LTE technology. In this paper, we investigate further refinements to massive MIMO, first, in the form of three-fold sectorization, and second, coordinated multi-point operation (with and without sectorization), in which the three base stations cooperate in the joint service of their users. For these scenarios, we analyze the downlink performance for both maximum-ratio and zero-forcing precoding and derive closed-form lower-bound expressions on the achievable rate of the users. These expressions are then used to formulate power optimization problems with two throughput fairness criteria:\ni\n) network-wide max-min fairness, and ii ) per-cell max-min fairness. Furthermore, we provide centralized and decentralized power control strategies to optimize the transmit powers in the network. We demonstrate that employing sectorized antenna elements mitigates the detrimental effects of pilot contamination by rejecting a portion of interfering pilots in the spatial domain during channel estimation phase. Simulation results with practical sectorized antennas reveal that sectorization and multi-point coordination combined with sectorization lead to more than\n1.7×\nand\n2.6×\nimprovements in the 95%-likely per-user throughput, respectively.}

Unlike conventional grant-free random access in which preambles are time-multiplexed with data, the proposed approach enables CoPD transmissions by different groups of devices, which leverages favourable propagation of massive MIMO and successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. To fully understand the performance behavior of the proposed approach, the error characteristics of channel estimation (CE) due to SIC error propagation are investigated. To avoid the CE error variance growing arbitrarily with time that leads to data transmission failure, key conditions, with respect to preamble length L\n, traffic intensity \\lambda\n, and average number of data packets per active device \\bar b\n, are derived. Under the conditions, we demonstrate that the throughput of the proposed CoPD approach cannot be arbitrarily high by increasing \\bar b\nand \\lambda\neven though the antenna array size, denoted by M\n, grows arbitrarily in massive MIMO. Accordingly, its maximum throughput and success probability are theoretically obtained. Simulation results verify our analysis results and confirm that the maximum throughput of the proposed CoPD approach can be at least 4 times than that of the conventional one. Furthermore, its success probability approaches 1 when M \\to \\infty\nas long as the derived conditions are met.}

The spectrum shortage occurs in huge number of devices which access with small-cell and macro-cell networks. To tackle these challenges, we develop a tractable framework relying on prominent techniques such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), antenna selection and energy harvesting. In this paper, we aim at practical scenarios of small cell networks by jointly evaluating capable of interference management and EH. We benefit from transmission approaches including full duplex (FD) and bi-directional transmission to improve the main performance system metrics such as outage probability and throughput. Three useful schemes are explored by considering EH and inter-cell interference. We derive the closed-form and asymptotic expressions for system metrics. We then perform extensive simulations with different system configurations to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed small-cell NOMA systems.}

By leveraging time diversity brought by the data storage buffer, and multiple relays’ beamforming gains, the source node broadcasts data in the first hop and all relays perform distributed beamforming to transmit information to users with NOMA in the second hop. Our focus is on maximizing the average network throughput (ANT) by jointly optimizing the mode selection, power and rate allocation at the source node, as well as the rate allocation and distributed beamforming coefficients at the relays along the time. As a solution to this complex problem, we propose an online scheduling scheme, which first adopts the Lyapunov optimization methodology to convert the ANT maximization problem into the drift-plus-penalty function minimization problem at each time slot. Secondly, focusing on the non-convexity of the transformed problem at each time slot, a novel two-loop algorithm is proposed as an effective solution. Extensive performance evaluation results have revealed the superiority of the proposed scheme as compared to other benchmark access schemes, namely, buffer-aided single relay NOMA, maximum ratio transmission based NOMA and buffer-aided time division multiple access schemes.}

We proceed to propose a novel approach for the design of the D2D caching policy. It directly models the number of D2D neighbours, instead of characterizing the locations of users as the PPP models. We show that the number of D2D neighbours can be well modeled by a discrete Gamma distribution. Given the model, we develop an iterative algorithm to optimize the D2D caching policy, and also provide a method to optimize the cache update time in order to balance the caching gain and overhead.

Because of narrow beamwidth inherent to an optical signal, acquisition and tracking form an important component of any FSO communication system. In this study, we have analyzed the optimization of received power allocation between tracking and data channels in an FSO receiver. In this regard, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the error statistics of the centroid estimator that is used for tracking the beam with the help of an array. The objective function that is optimized (minimized) are the probability of error and the probability of outage, and the optimization of power allocation is carried out as a function of parameters such as noise power, pointing error variance, pointing error correlation coefficient, and the threshold of outage. We have analyzed the optimization concerning the lognormal and exponentiated Weibull fading scenarios as well. We learn that the optimal power allocation is a function of the received signal-to-noise ratio: a lower signal-to-noise ratio dictates that a higher fraction of received power should be diverted to the tracking channel and vice versa.}

The evolution model of POV beams is proposed on the basis of Rytov approximation and the mutual coherence function to explore the impact of wave parameters on the orbital angular momentum (OAM) detection probability spectrum. The instantaneous crosstalk coefficients describing the POV-based UWOC systems are simulated by the multiple phase screen method with the signal coefficient modeled by a mixture Gamma-Gamma and normal distribution. A discrete and memoryless channel and a set of noncollaborative channels are modeled to obtain the capacity performances of the spatial-mode modulating and multiplexing systems, respectively. Results show the transmission quality of POV beams in oceanic turbulence is most related to the beam radius, while it is nearly free from the wavelength, TC, and radius-thickness ratio. Enjoying the advantage of the TC-independence beam radius, POV beams-based UWOC systems could achieve better bit error rate and capacity performances than the widely used Laguerre-Gauss beams when the higher-order TCs are adopted to modulate and multiplex information, which also confirms the superiority of POV beams in spatial-mode-based UWOC systems.}

	abstract = {Owing to the ever increasing of information privacy requirement, covert communication has gained more and more attention, whose effective range is limited by the trade-off between the covertness and the transmit power. Benefiting from the high mobility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized to expand the range of covert networks. Thus, we propose a UAV-relayed covert communication scheme with finite blocklength to maximize the effective transmission bits from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver against a flying warden. The transmitter adopts the maximum ratio transmission and the relay performs Gaussian signalling transmission to cause uncertainty at the warden. First, the optimal detection thresholds are derived at the warden towards the transmitter and the relay, respectively. Then, the hovering location of the warden is optimized to maximize the summation of relative entropies from the transmitter and the relay, which can greatly threaten the covertness. With this worst covert situation, the blocklength and transmit power at the transmitter and the relay are jointly optimized under the constraint of the end-to-end error detection probability to maximize the effective transmission rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UAV-relayed covert communication scheme.}

The matrices \\mathbf {A}\n(resp. \\mathbf {B}\n) must be kept secure from any subset of up to X_{\\mathbf {A}}\n(resp.

A novel computation strategy for single secure matrix multiplication problem (i.e., the case M=1\n) is first proposed, and then is generalized to the strategy for SMBMM by means of cross subspace alignment. The SMBMM strategy focuses on the tradeoff between recovery threshold (the number of successful computing servers that the user needs to wait for), system cost (upload cost, the amount of common randomness, and download cost) and system complexity (encoding, computing, and decoding complexities). Notably, compared with the known result by Chen et al. , the strategy for the degraded case X= X_{\\mathbf {A}}=X_{\\mathbf {B}}\nachieves better recovery threshold, amount of common randomness, download cost and decoding complexity when X\nis less than some parameter threshold, while the performance with respect to other measures remain identical.}

	abstract = {In this study, we propose a flexible construction of complementary sequences (CSs) that can contain zero-valued elements. To derive the construction, we use Boolean functions to represent a polynomial generated with a recursion. By applying this representation to recursive CS constructions, we show the impact of construction parameters such as sign, amplitude, phase rotation used in the recursion on the elements of the synthesized CS. As a result, we extend Davis and Jedwab’s CS construction by obtaining independent functions for the amplitude and phase of each element of the CS, and the seed sequence positions in the CS. The proposed construction shows that a set of distinct CSs compatible with non-contiguous resource allocations for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and various constellations can be synthesized systematically. It also leads to a low peak-to-mean-envelope-power ratio (PMEPR) multiple accessing scheme in the uplink and a low-complexity recursive decoder. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed encoder and decoder through comprehensive simulations.}

	abstract = {The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a widely used modulation scheme in modern digital communication systems. An OFDM signal can be susceptible to channel nonlinearities due to its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). This makes estimation and compensation of nonlinear channels particularly vital for OFDM systems. In this paper, we consider identifying cubically nonlinear channels in baseband OFDM systems using minimally sampled input and output signals. Unlike nonlinear channels in bandpass OFDM systems, which can be modeled by a complex baseband equivalent Volterra series with only odd order terms, the nonlinear channel in a baseband OFDM system requires a real Volterra series with both even and odd order terms. The minimally sampled input and output signals of the baseband OFDM system are used to estimate the frequency-domain Volterra kernels of the nonlinear channel. Due to the possible spectral regrowth caused by the channel nonlinearities, the minimally sampled output signal could be aliased. Nevertheless, by conducting higher-order statistical analyses on the OFDM signals, we show that closed form expressions of the Volterra kernels can still be derived. As a result of the closed form expressions, a simple estimate for the Volterra kernels is attained. Furthermore, the derived Volterra kernel estimate is shown to achieve the minimum mean square error (MMSE). Therefore, the proposed approach indeed provides an efficient yet accurate way to estimate nonlinear channels in baseband OFDM systems.}

	abstract = {Novel sparse reconstruction algorithms are proposed for beamspace channel estimation in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. The proposed algorithms minimize a least-squares objective having a nonconvex regularizer. This regularizer removes the penalties on a few large-magnitude elements from the conventional \\ell _{1}\n-norm regularizer, and thus it only forces penalties on the remaining elements that are expected to be zeros. Accurate and fast reconstructions can be achieved by performing gradient projection updates within the framework of difference of convex functions (DC) programming. A double-loop algorithm and a single-loop algorithm are proposed via different DC decompositions, and these two algorithms have distinct computational complexities and convergence rates. An extension algorithm is further proposed by designing new step sizes for the single-loop algorithm. The extension algorithm has a faster convergence rate and can achieve approximately the same level of accuracy as the proposed double-loop algorithm. Numerical results show significant advantages of the proposed algorithms over existing reconstruction algorithms in terms of reconstruction accuracies and runtimes. Compared with the benchmark channel estimation approaches, the proposed algorithms can achieve smaller channel reconstruction error and higher achievable spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is challenging for the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communications. Since the number of coefficients of the cascaded channel among the base station (BS), the RIS, and the user equipment (UE), is the product of the number of BS antennas, the number of RIS elements, and the number of UEs, the pilot overhead can be prohibitively high. In this paper, we propose a two-timescale channel estimation framework to exploit the property that the BS-RIS channel is high-dimensional but quasi-static, while the RIS-UE channel is mobile but low-dimensional. Specifically, to estimate the quasi-static BS-RIS channel, we propose a dual-link pilot transmission scheme, where the BS transmits downlink pilots and receives uplink pilots reflected by the RIS. Then, we propose a coordinate descent-based algorithm to recover the BS-RIS channel. Since the quasi-static BS-RIS channel is estimated less frequently than the mobile channel is, the average pilot overhead can be reduced from a long-term perspective. Although the mobile RIS-UE channel has to be frequently estimated in a small timescale, the associated pilot overhead is low thanks to its low dimension. Simulation results show that the proposed two-timescale channel estimation framework can achieve accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently received extensive research interest due to its capability to intelligently change the wireless propagation environment. For RIS-aided wireless communications in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, channel feedback at the user equipment (UE) is essential for the base station (BS) to acquire the downlink channel state information (CSI). In this paper, a dimension reduced channel feedback scheme is proposed to reduce the channel feedback overhead by exploiting the single-structured sparsity of BS-RIS-UE cascaded channel. Since different UEs share the same sparse BS-RIS channel but have their respective RIS-UE channels, there are only limited non-zero column vectors in the BS-RIS-UE cascaded channel matrix, and different UEs share the same indexes of the non-zero columns. Thus, the downlink CSI can be decomposed into user-independent channel information (i.e., the indexes of non-zero columns) and user-specific channel information (i.e., the non-zero column vectors), where the former for all UEs can be fed back by only one UE, while the latter can be fed back with a fairly low overhead by different UEs, respectively. Simulation results show that, compared with the conventional method, the proposed scheme can reduce channel feedback overhead by more than 80% for RIS-aided wireless communications.}

	abstract = {A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication system with non-linear energy harvesting (EH) and ultra-reliable low-latency constraints is considered for its possible applications in industrial automation. A distant data-center (DC) communicates with the multiple destination machines with the help of a full-duplex (FD) server machine (SM) and RIS. Assuming the deficiency of enough transmission power at the FD-SM, the SM is considered in the near vicinity of the destinations in the industry to forward the data received from the distant DC. The reception at SM is assisted by the RIS and a non-linear hybrid power-time splitting (PTS) based EH receiver architecture is adopted to extend the lifespan of SM, thus increasing network lifetime. The scheduling of multiple destinations is done by SM based on the considered selection criteria namely, random (RND) scheduling, absolute (ABS) channel-power-based (CPB) scheduling and normalized (NRM) CPB scheduling. The end-to-end performance of the considered FD RIS-assisted network is analyzed, and the expressions for the block error rate (BLER) for all scheduling schemes are derived. Moreover, the effects of number of RIS elements, packet size, channel uses on the system performance are analyzed for the considered ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) network. The scheduling fairness of all the scheduling schemes is also analyzed to study the performance-fairness trade-off. The derived analytical results are verified through Monte-Carlo simulations.}

The main working principle of cell-free mMIMO is that many distributed access points (APs) cooperate simultaneously to serve all the users within the network without creating cell boundaries. This paper considers the uplink of a cell-free mMIMO system utilizing the radio stripe network architecture with a sequential fronthaul between the APs. A novel uplink sequential processing algorithm is developed, which is proved to be optimal in both the maximum spectral efficiency (SE) and the minimum mean square error (MSE) sense. A detailed quantitative analysis of the fronthaul requirement or signaling of the proposed algorithm and its comparison with competing sub-optimal algorithms is provided. Key conclusions and implications are summarized in the form of corollaries. Based on the analytical and numerical simulation results, we conclude that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the fronthaul signaling, without compromising the communication performance.}

This paper studies the resource allocation for RIS-empowered device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying a cellular network, in which an RIS is employed to enhance desired signals and suppress interference between paired D2D and cellular links. We maximize the overall network’s spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), respectively, by jointly optimizing the spectrum reuse indicators, the transmit power, the RIS’s passive beamforming and the BS’s receive beamforming. To solve both mixed-integer non-linear programming problems, we first propose an efficient and low-complexity user-pairing scheme based on relative channel strength to determine the spectrum reuse indicators. Other variables are then optimized to maximize the SE by an iterative algorithm, based on the techniques of alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, Lagrangian dual transform and quadratic transform. The EE-maximization problem is solved by an alternating algorithm integrated with Dinkelbach’s method. Numerical results show that the proposed design achieves significant SE and EE enhancements compared to traditional underlay D2D network without RIS, relay-assisted D2D network and other benchmarks.}

In this paper, we consider uplink grant-free massive access for an IoT network with multiple channels. To be specific, the IoT devices generate short packets and have grant-free non-orthogonal access to a channel to transmit the generated packets to a base station (BS). With the aim of keeping the information fresh at the BS, we first derive the age of information (AoI) for grant-free short-packet communications, and then formulate the AoI minimization problem. However, the problem is challenging as the number of users involved is large, and to tackle this problem efficiently, we propose a mean-field evolutionary game-based approach. In this approach, the average behavior of the IoT devices is considered rather than their individual behaviors, and the dynamics of the strategies of the IoT devices are modeled by an evolutionary process. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed mean-field evolutionary game-based approach.}

In this paper, we study the problem of power control at the BS and RIS optimization for application to physical-layer broadcasting. Our goal is to minimize the transmit power at the BS by jointly designing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the phase shifts of the passive elements at the RIS. Furthermore, to help validate the proposed optimization methods, we derive lower bounds to quantify the average transmit power at the BS as a function of the number of MEs, the number of RIS elements, and the number of antennas at the BS. The simulation results demonstrate that the average transmit power at the BS is close to the lower bound in an RIS-aided system, and is significantly lower than the average transmit power in conventional schemes without an RIS.}

To address this, we investigate the practicability of utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for assisting such O2I communication. We propose a new notion of prefabricated RIS-empowered wall consisting of a large number of chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors. Each sensor maintains its own bank of delay lines. These sensors which are built within the building walls can potentially be controlled by a main integrated circuit (IC) to regulate the phase of impinging signals. To evaluate our idea, we develop a thorough performance analysis of the RIS-based O2I communication in the mmWave network using stochastic-geometry tools for blockage models. Our analysis facilitates two closed-form approximations of the downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coverage probability for RIS-based O2I communication. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the accuracy of the derived expressions, thus providing new observations and findings.}

On the other hand, it is vital to guarantee the timeliness of information for UAV-assisted data collection. In this paper, we propose a time-efficient data collection scheme, in which multiple ground devices upload their data to the UAV via uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The total flight time of the UAV is equally divided into\nN\ntime slots. The duration of each time slot is minimized by jointly optimizing the straight-line trajectory, device scheduling, and transmit power. To solve this mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, we decompose it into two steps. In the first step, we study the device scheduling strategy based on the UAV trajectory and the channel gains between the UAV and ground devices, through which the original problem can be greatly simplified. In the second step, the duration of each time slot is minimized by optimizing the transmit power and the UAV trajectory. An iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization is proposed, where each subproblem can be alternatively solved by applying successive convex approximation with the device scheduling updated at the end of each iteration. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Directional antennas and beamforming techniques that bring promising transmission gain to the wireless links are widely incorporated in the system-level analysis of wireless networks. In many existing studies, the beamforming gain model to calculate the beamforming gain considers beamforming pattern and aligned as well as misaligned cases. However, the channel properties, e.g., the\nK\nfactor and the spatial distribution of multi-paths, are neglected, which could significantly influence the beamforming gain. In this paper, a general beamforming gain model is appropriately defined, while the traditional beamforming gain model is proved to be only a special case in the proposed general model by considering an oversimplified channel with no angular spread. In light of this, expressions of the received signal amplitude and the beamforming gain are rigorously derived for narrowband fading and wideband statistical mmWave channels, respectively. Thorough comparison between the proposed beamforming gain model and the traditional beamforming gain is provided, which demonstrates and validates that the traditional model incorrectly captures the beamforming gain and thereby, leads to inaccurate system-level network analysis. To this end, the effectiveness and importance of the proposed general beamforming gain model are revealed, particularly for millimeter-wave wideband systems.}

The source is equipped with multiple antennas and employs conjugate beamforming while the destination consists of multiple apertures with selection combining. The system also consists of a relay operating at amplify-and-forward mode. The RF channels are subject to Nakagami-m fading while the optical links experience the Málaga distribution. In addition, we introduce the impairments to the relay and receiver. In fact, the relay is impaired by the High Power Amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities while the receiver suffers from the In phase and Quadrature Imbalance. Moreover, we assume two types of HPA nonlinearities impairments called Soft Envelope Limiter (SEL) and Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA). Closed-forms of the outage probability, the bit error probability, and the ergodic capacity are derived. Capitalizing on these performances, we derive the high SNR asymptotes to unpack insightful metrics such as the diversity gain. We also address the impacts of some key factors on the system performance such as the impairments, the interferers, the number of antennas and apertures and the pointing errors, etc. Finally, the analytical expressions are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation.}

This work departs from conventional energy source placement problems by considering the performance of the additional backscatter link on top of the energy transfer link. We adopt and optimize a symmetric PB placement scheme to maximize the GCD. The optimal PB placement under this scheme is obtained using either analytically tractable expressions or an efficient algorithm. Numerical results provide useful insights into the impacts of various system parameters on the PB placement and the resulting GCD, plus the advantages of the adopted symmetric placement scheme over other benchmark schemes.}

With the proposed metric function, the PAC codes’ decoding computational complexity is comparable to the computational complexity of sequential decoding of conventional convolutional codes (CCs). Moreover, simulation results show an improvement in the error-correction performance of low rate PAC codes when using the proposed metric function. Simulation results also show that using the proposed metric, the upper bound on the PAC codes’ computational complexity has a Pareto distribution. To reduce the worst-case latency of PAC sequential decoder, we limit the number of searches performed by sequential decoder. The results show that for PAC codes of length 128, search-limited sequential decoding can achieve an error-correction performance close to the error-correction performance of polar codes with successive cancellation list decoding with list size 64 and CRC length 11 with considerably less computational complexity.}

We associate the design problem of shaping codes with the classical covering problem, suggesting the use of good covering codes for shaping. From simulation results, it is demonstrated that by selecting perfect binary codes as our shaping codes, the proposed scheme offers a shaping gain of around 0.3–1.0 dB. By comparing with the enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) of the same block length, we verify that the proposed scheme achieves significantly lower storage complexity and computational complexity at the receiver even with comparable block error rate performance.}

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with a special class of unit memory convolutional codes (UMCCs), called block oriented UMCCs (BOUMCCs). Distinguished from conventional UMCCs, which usually have small constraint lengths, the BOUMCCs have relatively large constraint lengths. We conduct the performance analysis by assuming a first-order Markov model, which indicates that the performance of the BOUMCCs depends critically on both the error propagation and the sub-frame error rate of the first layer. The error propagation can be alleviated by the use of partial superposition, which is specified by a superposition matrix with a fraction of columns being nulled. Given a superposition fraction, we propose a tree growing and pruning algorithm (TGPA) with a tunable sliding window, which provides a convenient way to trade off the decoding delay and the performance. We also present a structured construction and show by simulation that there is no performance degradation compared with random construction. Numerical results also show that, by taking the TBCCs as basic codes, the performance of BOUMCCs with TGPA is comparable to that of other short codes but with a more flexible construction or a lower complexity.}

	abstract = {A novel method to recursively construct a set of precoded polar codes of various rates and short-to-moderate lengths is presented. The proposed code design method minimizes the successive cancellation (SC) decoding error probability estimate under three constraints. The first constraint is the minimum distance requirement to improve the maximum-likelihood (ML) performance of the resulting code and therefore the performance under the SC list (SCL) decoding. The other two constraints introduce preselected supercode and subcode, where the supercode ensures fast computation of the minimum distance and the subcode ensures reduction of the search space size. The supercode is given by the Plotkin sum of shorter codes, which are nested to simplify computation of low-weight codewords. These low-weight codewords are needed to satisfy the minimum distance constraint. The simulation results indicate that the proposed precoded polar codes of lengths 128 and 256 provide a better frame error rate (FER) than polar codes with CRC and e-BCH polar subcodes under the SCL decoding algorithm with the list size 8-128\n.}

However, low-complexity receivers generally have limited buffer size to store coded symbols that have not been fully decoded yet, as well as limited power budget for feedback transmissions. In this paper, we propose improved transmission schemes for online fountain codes to reduce the buffer occupancy and feedback transmissions. Firstly, we analyze the relationship between buffer occupancy and overhead as well as the relationship between recovery rate and overhead for online fountain codes. Motivated by the analysis, we propose the weighted online fountain codes (WOFC) which can adapt to various buffer sizes by adjusting the weight to control the probability that a coded symbol can be fully processed immediately, and analyze its performance. Then we further propose weighted online fountain codes with low feedback (WOFC-LF), which utilize the proposed analysis to estimate the recovery rate, and reduce feedback transmissions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the analysis for both OFC and WOFC, and demonstrate the superior performance of WOFC-LF with limited buffer size and feedback transmissions.}

However, the low data rate of NFC limits its application in high rate demanded scenarios, such as high-resolution fingerprint identification and streaming media transmission as well as the future promising high rate indoor communications among pads, phones, and laptops. In this paper, we model and analyze the performance of the orbital angular momentum based NFC (OAM-NFC) system, which can significantly increase the capacity of NFC. We first give the OAM system model. With coils circularly equipped at the transmitter and receiver, OAM-NFC signals can be transmitted, received, and detected. Then, we develop the OAM-NFC generation and detection schemes for NFC multiplexing transmission. We also analyze the OAM-NFC channel capacity and compare it with those of single-input-single-output (SISO) as well as multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) NFC. Simulation results validate the feasibility and capacity enhancement of our proposed OAM-NFC system. How different variables, such as the transceiver misalignment, the numbers of transceiver coils, and transceiver distance, impact the OAM-NFC capacity are also analyzed.}

Wirtinger calculus, which provides a framework for complex-valued signal processing, is used to simplify the derivations of CRBs and maximum likelihood estimation. Unlike linear modulation, the training waveform is optimized not only with respect to the modulated training sequence but also the sampling delay and sampling rate due to the continuous phase of CPM waveforms. In order to reduce the computation complexity of the optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for efficient computation of the objective function. The numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the optimized waveforms compared to the training sequences of previous works. Based on that, we propose two schemes for CFO estimation. The first scheme is a suboptimal maximum likelihood estimation of the CFO and it achieves a better trade-off between the estimation accuracy and complexity compared to optimal maximum likelihood estimation. The second scheme is based on the channel estimation, which leads to much lower implementation complexity than the other estimators. Finally, the measured bit error rate reveals the considerable gain of the estimation algorithm with the optimized training waveform.}

The issue becomes more challenging in face of an intelligent transmitter. To address the above-stated issue, a full-duplex (FD) technique is utilized to enable simultaneous jamming and eavesdropping (SJE) at a friendly jammer node. In particular, the “Two Birds with One Stone” strategy is utilized at the jammer node to realize effective rate degradation and information eavesdropping. A confrontation game between an intelligence-empowered FD jammer and its opponent is investigated. Specifically, to capture their adversarial relationship in an environment with incomplete information, a power-domain Bayesian-Stackelberg game is proposed. The existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) power solution is proved. The semi-closed-form solutions of SE are derived, which are proved to be asymptotically optimal (have a gap of less than 1% with the exact utility), and improves the jammer node 10% utility compared with the Nash equilibrium. Additionally, the SJE strategy outperforms the half-duplex (HD) and other benchmark schemes.}

In this work, we consider a system in three-dimensional (3-D) space with two coexisting communication links, each between a point transmitter and a spherical fully-absorbing receiver (FAR), where one link (termed primary) has priority over the second link (termed secondary). The system implements the underlay cognitive-communication strategy for the co-existence of both links, which use the same type of molecules for information transfer. The mutual influence of FARs existing in the same communication medium results in competition for capturing the information-carrying molecules. In this work, first, we derive an approximate hitting probability equation for a diffusion-limited molecular communication system with two spherical FARs of different sizes, considering the effect of molecular degradation. The derived equation is then used for the performance analysis of primary and secondary links in a cognitive molecular communication scenario. We show that the simple transmit control strategy at the secondary transmitter can improve the overall system’s performance. We study the influence of molecular degradation and decision threshold on the system performance. We also show that the parameters of the system need to be carefully set to improve the performance.}

	abstract = {One of the main challenges in diffusion-based molecular communication is dealing with the non-linearity of reaction-diffusion chemical equations. While numerical methods can be used to solve these equations, a change in the input signals or the parameters of the medium requires one to redo the simulations. This makes it difficult to design modulation schemes and practically impossible to prove the optimality of a given transmission strategy. In this paper, we provide an analytical technique for modeling the non-linearity of chemical reaction equations based on the perturbation method. The perturbation method expresses the solution in terms of an infinite power series. An approximate solution can be found by keeping the leading terms of the power series. The approximate solution is shown to track the true solution if either the simulation time interval or the reaction rate is sufficiently small. Approximate solutions for long time intervals are also discussed. An illustrative example is given. For this example, it is shown that when the reaction rate (or the total time interval) is low, instead of using a continuous release waveform, it is optimal for the transmitters to release molecules at two time instances.}

	abstract = {We propose new transmission schemes and receiver algorithms for unsourced multiple access (UMA) in MIMO and massive MIMO channels. Each active transmitter’s information bits are first channel encoded. The coded bits are divided into sub-blocks and each sub-block is modulated and transmitted. For both MIMO and massive MIMO channels, the conventional nonlinear modulation can be employed where each sub-block of coded bits is mapped to a transmitted signal vector. For the massive MIMO channel, we propose a new hybrid modulation scheme to reduce the receiver complexity, where the first sub-block is nonlinearly modulated, and the subsequent sub-blocks are linearly modulated and spread by the first sub-block signal. We also propose sparsity-exploiting blind receiver algorithms. Specifically, for the MIMO case, we exploit the codeword sparsity inherent in the UMA system, and a channel clustering technique, to estimate the channel and the transmitted signal of each transmitter. For the massive MIMO, in addition to the codeword sparsity, we further exploit the channel sparsity and user sparsity in estimating the channel and transmitted signal of each transmitter. The proposed receiver algorithms for both MIMO and massive MIMO channels output either hard or soft estimates of the coded bits, and therefore single-user channel decoding of the information bits can be performed for each transmitter. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {Heterogenous networks are mainly limited by interference. Nowadays, the advances in reconfigurable antennas allow us to implement blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes, which avoid the need for channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) while providing an increasing multiplexing gain, i.e., the achievable DoF, as the number of users increases. In this work, we propose a downlink transmission scheme based on BIA for managing the inter-tier interference in\nK\n-tier networks, referred to as tier BIA (tBIA). The tBIA scheme can be implemented considering that each tier employs any BIA scheme for managing the intracell and intercell interference. In this sense, considering proper BIA schemes applied to each tier, tBIA fully cancels all the sources of interference. After that, the DoF outer-bound for\nK\n-tier networks without CSIT is derived. It is shown that tBIA reaches this outer-bound. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that fully managing the inter-tier interference provides larger DoF in the whole network than turning off any tier with the aim of improving the achievable DoF in the remaining tiers. Simulation results show that the proposed tBIA scheme provides greater DoF and improves the user rates in comparison with other schemes without CSIT in multi-tier networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the concept of opportunistic bits (OBs) is developed in short-packet communications and investigated from a finite blocklength perspective. In the OB-based transmission, the data unit of a packet is divided into two parts: OBs and conventional bits (CBs). The OBs are not physically transmitted but used to indicate the index of the time slot (TS) when the packet containing CBs is transmitted. The loading of a bulk of OB-based packets into multiple TSs can be modelled as a Repeated Balls-into-Bins process with a multi-queue storage. If the bulk is not large enough, certain combination(s) of OBs will not appear, which leaves certain TS(s) empty and hence reduces the TS load efficiency. To evaluate the OB-based transmission performance, we formulate its maximal payload rate and TS load efficiency. With the aid of these two formulations, the energy gain, the goodput, and the latency of OB-based short-packet communications are derived and obtained in analytical forms. For achieving further insights, illustrative numerical results on the resource utilisation efficiency and the performance not only substantiate the advantages of the OB-based transmission over the conventional but also provide useful tools and specifications for its design in massive short-packet communications.}

This paper considers a USV-enabled maritime wireless network, where a USV is employed to assist the communication between the terrestrial base station and ships. Considering the maritime environment characteristics and earth curvature, we establish the systematic USV kinetics and information transmission models. To guarantee fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum expected throughput overall ships by jointly optimizing the trajectory and communication resource allocation, subject to the constraints of the USV kinetics, safe sailing, breakpoint distances, line-of-sight links, resource allocation, and information-causality. Due to the complexity of the maritime two-ray signal propagation model, we propose a channel approximation method to find an upper bound of the throughput for the original problem. By the problem decomposition, two sub-problems are derived and solved iteratively using successive convex approximation and interior-point methods. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that USV can significantly improve transmission performance in maritime wireless networks.}

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the multiplexing gains (MG) for simultaneous transmission of delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant data over interference networks. In the considered model, only delay-tolerant data can profit from coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission or reception techniques, because delay-sensitive data has to be transmitted without further delay. Transmission of delay-tolerant data is also subject to a delay constraint, which is however less stringent than the one on delay-sensitive data. Different coding schemes are proposed, and the corresponding MG pairs for delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant data characterized for Wyner’s linear symmetric network and for Wyner’s two-dimensional hexagonal network with and without sectorization. Information-theoretic converses are established for these models. For Wyner’s linear symmetric network the bounds match whenever the cooperation rates are sufficiently large or the delay-sensitive MG is small or moderate. These results show that on Wyner’s symmetric linear network and for sufficiently large cooperation rates, the largest MG for delay-sensitive data can be achieved without penalizing the maximum sum-MG of both delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant data. Our achievable schemes show that a similar conclusion holds for Wyner’s hexagonal network only for the model with sectorization. In the model without sectorization, a penalty in sum-MG is incurred whenever one insists on a positive delay-sensitive MG}

To this end, a novel random linear combination (RLC)-based PIR scheme that can solve the basic PIR problem and its variation is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on random coding approach and achieves the capacity of the basic PIR asymptotically. Then, we investigate PIR with unknown cache prefetching (PIRC) problem at different cache-to-file size ratio. Specifically, we propose RLC-based PIRC method, which prefetches RLC-based side information and leverages them to retrieve desired information at small download cost. Furthermore, by applying time and memory sharing on the proposed RLC-based PIRC, RLC-based basic PIR and some other known approach in literature, we derive the achievable normalized download cost bound of PIRC. The derived achievable bound outperforms the existing bound in literature and the case study provides numerical results that verifies it.}

In this paper, a novel framework of the deep learning (DL) based CCM estimation is proposed that exploits the perception of the transmission environment without any channel sample or the pilot signals. Specifically, as CCM is affected by the user’s movement, we design a deep neural network (DNN) to predict CCM from user location and user speed, and the corresponding estimation method is named as ULCCME. A location denoising method is further developed to reduce the positioning error and improve the robustness of ULCCME. For cases when user location information is not available, we propose an interesting way that uses the environmental 3D images to predict the CCM, and the corresponding estimation method is named as SICCME. Simulation results show that both the proposed methods are effective and will benefit the subsequent channel estimation.}

In the secondary network, a source communicates with a near user via direct link and with a far user through the assistance of multiple relays subject to transmit power constraints. Four relay selection schemes are proposed to enhance the performance of NOMA users and the overall system throughput. In our analysis, exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) of NOMA users and for the overall system throughput are derived. To provide further insights, a performance floor analysis is carried out considering two power-setting scenarios: (i) the transmit powers at the secondary source and relays go to infinity and (ii) the peak interference constraint goes to infinity. Towards real-time configurations, we also design a deep learning (DL) framework for the OP and system throughput prediction. Our results show that the deep neural network exhibits the lowest run-time prediction and root-mean-square error among the proposed DL models. Furthermore, the predicted results based on DL framework match with those of the analysis and simulation.}

However, the ultra-wide bandwidth of THz communications requires high-speed, high-resolution analog-to-digital converters, which are hard to implement due to their high complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a deep learning-assisted THz receiver is designed, which relies on single-bit quantization. Specifically, the imperfections of THz devices, including their in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance, phase noise and nonlinearity are investigated. The deflection ratio of the maximum-likelihood detector used by our single-bit-quantization THz receiver is derived, which reveals the effect of phase offset on the demodulation performance, guiding the architecture design of our proposed receiver. To combat the performance loss caused by the above-mentioned distortions, a twin-phase training strategy and a neural network based demodulator are proposed, where the phase offset of the received signal is compensated before sampling. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-assisted receiver is capable of achieving a satisfactory bit error rate performance, despite the grave distortions encountered.}

	abstract = {By orchestrating resources of edge and core network, the delays of edge-assisted computing can decrease. Offloading scheduling is challenging though, especially in the presence of many edge devices with randomly varying link and computing conditions. This paper presents a new online learning-based approach to the offloading scheduling, where multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) learning is designed to exploit the randomly varying conditions and asymptotically minimize the computing delay. We first propose a combinatorial bandit upper confidence bound (CB-UCB) algorithm, where users collectively feed back the observed delays of all edge devices and links. The optimistic bound of the delay is derived to facilitate centralized offloading scheduling for all users. In addition, we put forth a distributed bandit upper confidence bound (DB-UCB) algorithm, where users take random turns to make conflict-free, distributed selections of edge devices. The optimistic confidence bound of each user is developed to allow the user’s selection only based on its own observations and decisions. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithms by proving the sublinearity of their regrets, and that the random turns the users take to make decisions do not compromise the asymptotic optimality of the DB-UCB algorithm, as corroborated by numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel scalable reinforcement learning approach for simultaneous routing and spectrum access in wireless ad-hoc networks. In most previous works on reinforcement learning for network optimization, the network topology is assumed to be fixed, and a different agent is trained for each transmission node—this limits scalability and generalizability. Further, routing and spectrum access are typically treated as separate tasks. Moreover, the optimization objective is usually a cumulative metric along the route, e.g., number of hops or delay. In this paper, we account for the physical-layer signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a wireless network and further show that bottleneck objective such as the minimum SINR along the route can also be optimized effectively using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we propose a scalable approach in which a single agent is associated with each flow and makes routing and spectrum access decisions as it moves along the frontier nodes. The agent is trained according to the physical-layer characteristics of the environment using a novel rewarding scheme based on the Monte Carlo estimation of the future bottleneck SINR. It learns to avoid interference by intelligently making joint routing and spectrum allocation decisions based on the geographical location information of the neighbouring nodes.}

	abstract = {Following the great success of Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), in many research domains in 2010s, several ML-based approaches were proposed for detection in large inverse linear problems, e.g., massive MIMO systems. The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions. Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly different approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of disCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft decoding in today’s communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO systems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off compared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet’s soft outputs to be reliable for decoders.}

In this paper, we focus on the ergodic sum-rate analysis and maximization of the RIS-assisted uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access channel (MAC) under Rician fading by exploiting full statistical channel state information (CSI). The spatial correlations at the base station, the users, and the RIS are also considered. By using the replica method originated in statistical physics, the closed-form asymptotic ergodic sum-rate of the system is first derived in the large-system regime on the account of the unique channel structure of the RIS-assisted MIMO-MAC system. Then, based on the derived asymptotic ergodic sum-rate, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly design the transmit covariance matrix of users and the phase-shifting matrix of RIS with full statistical CSI. Simulation results are also demonstrated to verify the accuracy of the derived asymptotic ergodic sum-rate and the superiority of the proposed AO algorithm. The results reveal that the derived closed-form asymptotic ergodic sum-rate matches very well with the Monte Carlo results even for a small number of antennas, and the proposed AO algorithm can achieve up to 10 bps/Hz gain at high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, which is therefore valuable for future RIS-assisted MIMO-MAC system designs.}

We choose average uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) spectral efficiencies (SEs) as performance metrics for the massive MIMO system, and derive closed form expressions for them in terms of the additional pilot overhead.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the influences caused by the differentiated and dynamic traffic is vital for the design of the next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for meta-distribution analysis by utilizing queueing theory and stochastic geometry to capture the spatial (geographical location) and temporal randomness (queue status) of traffic. We derive the\nk\n-th moment of the conditional successful transmission probability (STP) and the closed-form expressions of the meta distribution for the cell-center users (CCUs) and the cell-edge users (CEUs), respectively. The results are further extended to obtain the analytical expression of the meta distribution by taking the temporal random arrival of traffic into consideration. Moreover, the mean local delays for the CCUs and CEUs are derived. Finally, the impact of key network parameters on the meta distribution and the corresponding mean local delay is investigated.}

	abstract = {The internet of satellites (IoS), containing multiple low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, can support tremendous traffic, massive connectivity, and vast coverage. But it also puts forward higher demands for resource management due to the high dynamics of the IoS networks, especially in the malicious jamming environment, where the jammers launch jamming attacks to reduce the efficiency and reliability. Thus, this paper investigates the problem of resource management in malicious jamming environment for IoS, which is divided into three sub-problems: traffic prediction problem, anti-jamming decision problem and resource matching problem. To solve these problems, we proposed a distributed resource management framework (DRMF), which consists of three sub-algorithms. Firstly, the traffic prediction algorithm (TPA) is proposed to deeply mine and accurately predict the traffic rule. Meanwhile, the dynamic anti-jamming algorithm (DAA) is developed to make anti-jamming decision autonomously. Then, based on the outputs obtained by TPA and DAA, the distributed resource matching algorithm (DRMA) is proposed for IoS, and the satellites with insufficient resource can apply for assistance from neighboring satellites with excess resource, thereby improving the safety and efficiency of the entire IoS network. Finally, experiment results and algorithm analysis verify the proposed scheme has better performance than the existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is one of the three generic services for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications system. To utilize fully the high rate transmission feature of the 5G system to support massive MTC devices (MTCDs), we propose a group-based random access and data transmission scheme, where the data packets of MTCDs are first aggregated by the MTC gateways (MTCGs) and then forwarded to the base station. The access process of the MTC network is divided into two phases, namely the intra-group transmission phase and MTCG forwarding phase. The entire resources are also partitioned for the two phases. We employ the discrete-time nonhomogenous Markov model to characterize the joint queue-length evolution of multiple MTCGs, which cannot be analyzed directly due to the exponential complexity and time-nonhomogeneity. To facilitate the analysis, we approximately decompose the joint nonhomogenous queue-length evolution process into multiple independent nonhomogenous queue-length evolution processes with the same state transition probabilities. Then, we establish an equivalent single queue-length evolution based homogenous Markov chain by constructing a virtual queue and determine the corresponding stationary distribution by using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average network throughput subject to the constraints on the resource partition for the two phases and the MTCG forwarding threshold. By developing a modified differential evolution algorithm, we provide an efficient solution to the formulated problem, which can be arbitrarily close to the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently improve the network performance over the existing schemes.}

The nature of millimeter waves renders the communication quality susceptible due to blockage caused by obstacles. Hence, multi-hop relaying is likely to play a significant role in improving the performance of mmWave networks. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two appropriate routing techniques for mmWave networks, namely minimum hop count (MHC) and nearest LoS relay to the destination with MHC (NLR-MHC). Analytical models are provided to evaluate the performance of the two routing techniques using tools from stochastic geometry. We model the distribution of hop count using phase-type distribution, and then we use this distribution to derive analytical results for the coverage probability and spectral efficiency. Results reveal the significant impact of densities of relays and blockages on the performance of the aforementioned routing techniques in-terms of spectral efficiency, connectivity probability, and average hop count. It is also demonstrated that NLR-MHC achieves a superior coverage probability and spectral efficiency compared to MHC. However, MHC provides better performance in-terms of connectivity probability and average hop count.}

	abstract = {Proactive caching has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the content access latency in radio access networks (RANs), thereby attracting considerable attention in the era of 6G research. It allows base stations to push popular content items to mobile users’ devices proactively. Therefore, a cached-enabled RAN may serve a user by either on-demand transmission or proactive content placement, which share a common radio spectrum. How to efficiently schedule proactive caching and on-demand transmission then becomes a challenging issue that remains open. In this paper, we present a unified framework for joint scheduling of caching and on-demand transmission. In particular, we formulate a Markovian queueing model to analyze the average delay and power consumption of the proposed scheduling policy, which are then jointly minimized via linear programming (LP). Furthermore, a low-complexity heuristic scheduling policy is conceived to strike a sub-optimal tradeoff between delay and power based on greedy algorithms. Simulation results shall demonstrate that the overall service latency of a RAN can be substantially reduced by judiciously designing joint scheduling of caching and on-demand transmission.}

	abstract = {Information freshness is crucial for time-critical IoT applications, e.g., monitoring and control. We consider an IoT status update system with users, energy harvesting sensors, and a cache-enabled edge node. The users receive time-sensitive information about physical quantities, each measured by a sensor. Users demand for the information from the edge node whose cache stores the most recently received measurements from each sensor. To serve a request, the edge node either commands the sensor to send an update or retrieves the aged measurement from the cache. We aim at finding the best actions of the edge node to minimize the average AoI of the served measurements at the users, termed on-demand AoI. We model this problem as a Markov decision process and develop reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: model-based value iteration and model-free Q-learning. We also propose a Q-learning method for the realistic case where the edge node is informed about the sensors’ battery levels only via the status updates. The case under transmission limitations is also addressed. Furthermore, properties of an optimal policy are characterized. Simulation results show that an optimal policy is a threshold-based policy and that the proposed RL methods significantly reduce the average cost compared to several baselines.}

In particular, the proposed JUDRA approach allows DUs to reuse either uplink or downlink CUs’ resources. Besides, an optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) which is generally NP-hard. The problem is solved in two stages: sub-channel (SC) assignment stage and power allocation stage by utilizing the characteristics of sequential geometric programming. Moreover, a low computational complexity approach is suggested that converges to the near-optimal solution in polynomial time.

	abstract = {Data center networks typically adopt multi-rooted tree topologies to provide high bisection bandwidth. Various fine-grained load balancing schemes have been proposed to split flows across multiple paths. However, data center networks suffer from many uncertainties such as highly dynamic traffic. These uncertainties easily make network become asymmetric, resulting in significant packet reordering. Unfortunately, existing solutions passively deal with packet reordering based on a threshold and hardly adapt to asymmetric networks because of lacking the explicit reordering feedback. These solutions either fail to quickly respond to packet loss or cause unnecessary fast retransmission, which reduces link utilization and increases flow completion time. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained load balancing scheme RMC to eliminate the impact of packet reordering and handle uncertainties in asymmetric networks. To avoid unnecessary fast retransmission, the switch proactively identifies reordered packet according to local queue length and global path latency. Furthermore, we employ a coding technique with redundancy optimization to reduce long-tailed flow completion time under network asymmetry. Through a series of large-scale NS2 simulations and testbed experiments, we demonstrate that RMC effectively avoids unnecessary fast retransmission under different network scenarios and reduces flow completion time by up to 72% compared with state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Free space optical (FSO) channel provides a significantly large transmission capacity. However, in the presence of random jamming attacks, the efficacy of FSO communication channel can be affected critically. In this paper, the discrete-input continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity of a single-input single-output FSO communication system is investigated under the random jamming effects. The ergodic channel capacity analysis is performed over additive non-Gaussian noise channel (jamming noise channel). The derived closed-form expression of DCMC capacity for the considered FSO system and also, the effects of partial-band jamming and broadband jamming over the FSO channel capacity are verified through simulation results. It is observed that the FSO channel capacity is very sensitive to the degree of jamming and the ergodic channel capacity alters crucially even for small change in jamming probability. The derived results are utilized to study the considered network in the presence of a rational jammer whose ability to jam is limited by its battery capacity. The presence of a rational jammer is addressed by modelling the interaction between the FSO transmitter and the jammer as a non-cooperative game. The closed-form expressions of the equilibrium of the proposed game are derived and verified through simulation. The game-theoretic solution provides a performance improvement of 74% in comparison to uniform power allocation.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is of low-cost and energy-efficiency and will be a promising technology for the future wireless communications like sixth generation. To address the problem of conventional directional modulation (DM) that Alice only transmits single confidential bit stream (CBS) to Bob with multiple antennas in a line-of-sight channel, IRS is proposed to create friendly multipaths for DM such that two CBSs can be transmitted from Alice to Bob. This will significantly enhance the secrecy rate (SR) of DM. To maximize the SR (Max-SR), a general non-convex optimization problem is formulated with the unit-modulus constraint of IRS phase-shift matrix (PSM), and the general alternating iterative (GAI) algorithm is proposed to jointly obtain the transmit beamforming vectors (TBVs) and PSM by alternately optimizing one and fixing another. To reduce its high complexity, a low-complexity iterative algorithm for Max-SR is proposed by placing the constraint of null-space (NS) on the TBVs, called NS projection (NSP). Here, each CBS is transmitted separately in the NSs of other CBS and AN channels. Simulation results show that the SRs of the proposed GAI and NSP can approximately double that of IRS-based DM with single CBS for massive IRS in the high signal-to-noise ratio region.}

	abstract = {Covert wireless communications aim to hide the existence of transmission behavior from watchful adversaries to enhance security. In this paper, we propose a spectrum mask based covert communication strategy in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where the overt channels are leveraged to enhance the covertness. Specifically, the legitimate IoT transmitter superimposes its own message on the overt channel to avoid being detected by the warden. We assume that proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) is adopted at the overt channel, and improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) is adopted at the legitimate transmitter to improve the covert transmission performance. To maximize the covert rate of the legitimate IoT system, a joint transmit power and IGS factor optimization problem is formulated under the constraints of covertness requirement. The metric of minimum error detection probability, that represents the worst-case for the legitimate transmitter, is utilized to measure the covertness. By exploiting the piece-wise monotonic properties of the objective function and the constraints, we derive the optimal transmit power and IGS factor pairs in both the IGS and PGS schemes. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate that the IGS scheme can improve the covert rate compared to the PGS scheme under a given covertness constraint.}

In this paper, source localization with unknown transmit power is considered based on received signal strength difference (RSSD) measurements. An efficient three stage estimator is presented. First, a nonlinear RSSD-based model is formulated and the corresponding Fisher information for Gaussian distributed noise is derived. Next, a mean squared error (MSE) estimator is developed based on an unknown linear bias and Fisher information minimization. This results in a nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the MSE directly considering the linear bias. Finally, semidefinite relaxation is employed to transform this nonconvex problem into a convex minimization problem. This can be solved efficiently to obtain the optimal solution of the corresponding semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the proposed RSSD based linear biased MSE SDP method (RLBM-SDP) are derived. Further, the corresponding bias sensitivity is formulated which yields an extension of the proposed method to a bounded RLBM-SDP (BRLBM-SDP) algorithm that includes a new constraint on the norm of the bias sensitivity. The computational complexity of the proposed methods is evaluated. Performance results are presented which confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods for sufficiently large signal to noise ratios.}

	abstract = {We propose an efficient method for designing broad beams with spatially flat array factor and efficient power utilization for cell-specific coverage in communication systems equipped with large antenna arrays. To ensure full power efficiency, the method is restricted to phase-only weight manipulations. Our framework is based on the discovered connection between dual-polarized beamforming and polyphase Golay sequences. Exploiting this connection, we propose several methods for array expansion from smaller to larger sizes, while preserving the radiation pattern. In addition, to fill the gaps in the feasible array sizes, we introduce the concept of\nϵ\n-complementarity that relaxes the requirement on zero side lobes of the sum aperiodic autocorrelation function of a sequence pair. Furthermore, we develop a modified Great Deluge algorithm (MGDA) that finds\nϵ\n-complementary pairs of arbitrary length, and hence enables broad beamforming for arbitrarily-sized uniform linear arrays. We also discuss the extension of this approach to two-dimensional uniform rectangular arrays. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach with respect to existing beam-broadening methods.}

	abstract = {A low-complexity parametric bilinear generalized approximate message passing (PBiGAMP)-based receiver is conceived for multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MFTN) signaling over frequency-selective fading channels. To mitigate the inherent ill-conditioning problem of MFTN signaling, we construct a segment-based frequency-domain received signal model in the form of a block circulant linear transition matrix, which can be efficiently calculated by applying a two dimensional fast Fourier transform. Based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the block circulant matrices, we can diagonalize the covariance matrix of the complex-valued colored noise process imposed by the associated two dimensional non-orthogonal matched filtering. Building on this model, a PBiGAMP-based parametric joint channel estimation and equalization (JCEE) algorithm is proposed for MFTN systems. In this algorithm, we introduce a pair of additive terms for characterizing the interferences arising from adjacent segments and employ the exact discrete a priori probabilities of the transmitted symbols for improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. To further enhance the system’s robustness in the presence of ill-conditioned matrices, we develop a refined PBiGAMP-based JCEE algorithm by introducing a series of scaled identity matrices. Moreover, the proposed PBiGAMP-based JCEE algorithms may be readily decomposed into GAMP-based equalization algorithms, when the channel state information is perfectly known. The overall complexity of the proposed algorithms only increases logarithmically with the total number of transmitted symbols. Our simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed PBiGAMP-based iterative message passing receiver conceived for MFTN signaling.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) provides more uniform spectral efficiency (SE) for users (UEs) than cellular technology. The main challenge to achieve the benefits of cell-free massive MIMO is to realize signal processing in a scalable way. In this paper, we consider scalable full-pilot zero-forcing (FZF), partial FZF (PFZF), protective weak PFZF (PWPFZF), and local regularized ZF (LRZF) combining by exploiting channel statistics. We derive closed-form expressions of the uplink SE for FZF, PFZF, and PWPFZF combining with large-scale fading decoding over independent Rayleigh fading channels, taking channel estimation errors and pilot contamination into account. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the number of pilot sequences, antennas per AP, and APs on the performance. Numerical results show that LRZF provides the highest SE. However, PWPFZF is preferable when the number of pilot sequences is large and the number of antennas per AP is small. The reason is that PWPFZF has lower computational complexity and the SE expression can be computed in closed-form. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of PWPFZF combining with fractional power control and the numerical results show that it improves the performance of weak UEs and realizes uniformly good service for all UEs in a scalable fashion.}

Here, UAV is utilized to partially relay uplink data and achieve channel differentiation. Successive interference cancellation algorithm is used to eliminate the interference from different directions in FD-NOMA systems. Firstly, a joint optimization problem is formulated for the uplink and downlink resource allocation of transceivers and UAV relay. The receiver determination is performed using an access-priority method. Based on the results of the receiver determination, the initial power of ground users (GUs), UAV, and base station is calculated. According to the minimum sum of the uplink transmission power, the Hungarian algorithm is utilized to pair the users. Secondly, the subchannels are assigned to the paired GUs and the UAV by a message-passing algorithm. Finally, the transmission power of the GUs and the UAV is jointly fine-tuned using the proposed access control methods. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art orthogonal frequency division multiple-access method in terms of spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency, and access ratio of the ground users.}

Specifically, we design a novel dual-input neural network architecture, called FusionNet, to merge the sub-6GHz channel and the channel of a few active mmWave antennas. The proposed fusion model could intelligently adjust the attention paid (by the neural network) for sub-6GHz channel and mmWave channel by an attention mechanism. The output of the FusionNet represents the probability for each beam being the optimal one. We also propose an antenna selection model that can choose better active antennas to send the downlink pilots, in which the gradient of antenna selection vector is approximated by that of an antenna probability vector.

	abstract = {Multiband operation in millimeter wave (mmWave) will obtain lots of performance gain by offering larger bandwidth. However, the prerequisite is the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI), which is a knotty task with hybrid analog/digital architecture. This study devotes to efficiently reconstruct and track the time drifting multiband channel to keep CSI precise in time division duplex (TDD) mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output system with hybrid analog/digital architecture. Utilizing spatial reciprocity, an efficient multiband channel reconstruction scheme is introduced, which elaborately estimates the central sub-band channel and then reconstructs side sub-band channels from the central one. To this end, a beam training-based Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (BT-NOMP) algorithm is proposed to estimate the central sub-band channel. With the help of frequency-independent parameters extracted from BT-NOMP, side sub-bands channel can be well reconstructed with additional low-complexity path gains estimation process. Furthermore, to avoid frequent channel reconstruction in a slightly drifting channel meanwhile keep the CSI accurate, a rotated beam-based channel tracking algorithm is developed using historical observations of channel parameters. Numerical results prove the efficiency of the proposed multiband channel reconstruction scheme and the accuracy of the channel tracking algorithm.}

	abstract = {This paper presents an estimation approach within the framework of uplink massive machine-type-communications (mMTC) that considers the energy limitations of the devices. We focus on a scenario where a group of sensors observe a set of parameters and send the measured information to a collector node (CN). The CN is responsible for estimating the original observations, which are spatially correlated and corrupted by measurement and quantization noise. Given the use of Gaussian sources, the minimum mean squared error (MSE) estimation is employed and, when considering temporal evolution, the use of Kalman filters is studied. Based on that, we propose a device selection strategy to reduce the number of active sensors and a quantization scheme with adjustable number of bits to minimize the overall payload. The set of selected sensors and quantization levels are, thus, designed to minimize the MSE. For a more realistic analysis, communication errors are also included by averaging the MSE over the error decoding probabilities. We evaluate the performance of our strategy in a practical mMTC system with synthetic and real databases. Simulation results show that the optimization of the payload and the set of active devices can reduce the power consumption without compromising the estimation accuracy.}

However, the huge size of the multi-domain channel brings great challenges to the acquisition of channel state information (CSI), especially in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain channel extrapolation scheme that can reconstruct the huge multi-domain channel with low pilot overhead. Specifically, information on the environment shared by multiple domains is utilized for the design of a low-complexity channel extrapolation algorithm. Moreover, we investigate the patterns of sparse pilots and antenna selection by establishing a theoretical framework for the performance analysis of the patterns. We further propose a sparse random pattern design, which can legitimately obtain a set of patterns that are suitable for channel extrapolations.

In such systems, the UAVs may experience high jitter, making the estimation and compensation of the end-to-end phase for each propagation path prone to errors. Consequently, the imperfect phase knowledge at the IRS should be considered. The phase error is modeled using the von Mises distribution and the analysis is performed using the Sinusoidal Addition Theorem (SAT) to provide accurate results when the number of reflectors L\\leq 3\n, and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) when L\\geq 4\n. The achieved results show that accurate phase estimation is critical for IRS based systems, particularly for a small number of reflecting elements. For example, the SER at 10 −3 degrades by about 5 dB when the von Mises concentration parameter \\kappa =2\nand L=30\n, but the degradation for the same \\kappa\nsurges to 25 dB when L=2\n. The air-to-air (A2A) channel for each propagation path is modeled as a single dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component, and the results are compared to the Rician channel. The obtained results reveal that the considered A2A model can be used to accurately represent the A2A channel with Rician fading.}

	abstract = {The proof-of-work (PoW) mining process requires a large amount of intensive computing, which leads to some plights such as heavy equipment and fixed access nodes in traditional blockchain networks. A novel mobile blockchain network with the help of a mobile edge computing (MEC) server is presented, where all mobile users participate in the PoW mining process. The traditional Bitcoin network adjusts the target difficulty value to ensure a stable block time. However, for MEC-assisted mobile blockchain networks, the adjusted difficulty value needs to be broadcast to all mobile users, which results in expensive communication costs. To maintain a stable block time of mobile blockchain networks, we formulate the delay-limited computation offloading strategy of the PoW-based mining task as a non-cooperative game that maximizes an individual revenue in the MEC-assisted mobile blockchain network. Specifically, the non-cooperative game problem can be divided into multiple sub-game optimization problems to obtain final solutions for all users. We analyze the sub-game optimization problem and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) of the non-cooperative game. Moreover, we design an alternating iterative algorithm based on the continuous relaxation and greedy rounding (CRGR) to achieve the NE of this game. Given the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading results, we also derive the optimal transmit power for an individual user within the maximum mining delay range. From the analytical results, we can see that the proposed CRGR-based alternating iterative algorithm can efficiently attain the sub-optimal delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all mobile users in the polynomial time. The individual transmit power increases accordingly with the delay-limited computation offloading strategies of all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CRGR-based alternating iterative algorithm has fast convergence and good stability.}

These advantages and the ultra-wide spectrum availability in the Terahertz (THz) band enable profound potentials for inter-satellite links (ISLs) to achieve ultra-high throughput in both near-Earth and deep-space orbits. In this paper, the ISL channels at THz band are characterized and their link capacity is analyzed. First, the propagation channel effects in both Earth’s upper atmosphere and deep space are investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of THz band for ISLs. Second, an orbital perturbation model for satellite formation flying is proposed and analyzed with actual ephemeris information. Finally, a channel model is developed to investigate the diversity in both polarization and frequency domain for THz band inter-small-satellite communications. Our numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the ionospheric plasma does not affect the THz band signal propagation in near-Earth orbits; 2) the beam misalignment loss can be characterized by orbital perturbation factors; and 3) the ISLs in THz band can utilize the diversity techniques to achieve high throughput in both near-Earth and deep-space links.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a disruptive technique for fast wireless data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks via exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple-access channels. However, the performance of AirComp is bottlenecked by the worst channel condition among all links between the IoT devices and the access point. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted AirComp system is proposed to boost the received signal power and thus mitigate the performance bottleneck by reconfiguring the propagation channels. With an objective to minimize the AirComp distortion, we propose a joint design of AirComp transceivers and RIS phase-shifts, which however turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex programming problem. To this end, we develop a novel alternating minimization framework in conjunction with the successive convex approximation technique, which is proved to converge monotonically. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform the subproblem in each alternation as a smooth convex-concave saddle point problem, which is then tackled by proposing a Mirror-Prox method that only involves a sequence of closed-form updates. Simulations show that the computation time of the proposed algorithm can be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving a similar distortion performance.}

	abstract = {The prospects of using a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to aid wireless communication systems have recently received much attention from academia and industry. Most papers make theoretical studies based on elementary models, while the prototyping of RIS-aided wireless communication and real-world field trials are scarce. In this paper, we describe a new RIS prototype consisting of 1100 controllable elements working at 5.8 GHz band. We propose an efficient algorithm for configuring the RIS over the air by exploiting the geometrical array properties and a practical receiver-RIS feedback link. In our indoor test, where the transmitter and receiver are separated by a 30 cm thick concrete wall, our RIS prototype provides a 26 dB power gain compared to the baseline case where the RIS is replaced by a copper plate. A 27 dB power gain was observed in the short-distance outdoor measurement. We also carried out long-distance measurements and successfully transmitted a 32 Mbps data stream over 500 m. A 1080p video was live-streamed and it only played smoothly when the RIS was utilized. The power consumption of the RIS is around 1 W. Our paper is vivid proof that the RIS is a very promising technology for future wireless communications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the statistical characterization and modeling of distributed multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless systems. Specifically, we consider a practical system model where the RISs with different geometric sizes are distributively deployed, and wireless channels associated to different RISs are assumed to be independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.). We propose two purpose-oriented multi-RIS-aided schemes, namely, the exhaustive RIS-aided (ERA) and opportunistic RIS-aided (ORA) schemes. A mathematical framework, which relies on the method of moments, is proposed to statistically characterize the end-to-end (e2e) channels of these schemes. It is shown that either a Gamma distribution or a Log-Normal distribution can be used to approximate the distribution of the magnitude of the e2e channel coefficients in both schemes. With these findings, we evaluate the performance of the two schemes in terms of outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC), where tight approximate closed-form expressions for the OP and EC are derived. Representative results show that the ERA scheme outperforms the ORA scheme in terms of OP and EC. In addition, under i.n.i.d. fading channels, the reflecting element settings and location settings of RISs have a significant impact on the system performance of both the ERA or ORA schemes.}
