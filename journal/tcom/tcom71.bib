	abstract = {The problem of reconstructing strings from substring information has found many applications due to its importance in genomic data sequencing and DNA- and polymer-based data storage. One important paradigm requires reconstructing mixtures of strings based on the union of compositions of their prefixes and suffixes, generated by mass spectrometry devices. We describe new coding methods that allow for unique joint reconstruction of subsets of strings selected from a code and provide upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic rate of the underlying codebooks. Our code constructions combine properties of binary\nB\nh\nand Dyck strings that can be extended to accommodate missing substrings in the pool. As auxiliary results, we present simple entropy upper bounds for binary\nB\nh\ncodes and an improved bound for\nh=4\n, and also describe errors that arise during mass spectrometry.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new transmission scheme for the scenario where two nodes attempt to exchange messages and the conventional low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are implemented for error correction. In the proposed scheme, the ACK/NACK feedback information is transmitted along with the payload data by free-ride codes, while the re-transmitted codewords are superimposed (XORed) on the current codewords, both of which cost neither extra bandwidth nor transmission power. Firstly, we present a syndrome channel model and derive its capacity (referred to as accessible capacity) with a lower bound, implying that the reliable transmission of extra bits (feedback information) is possible. Then, the performance of the extra bits is analyzed by the dependency testing (DT) bound for the syndrome channels. Moreover, motivated by the DT bound, we present a low-complexity DT-like decoder for the free-ride codes. For the superposition retransmission, we present a practical implementation, where those unsuccessfully decoded codewords are sparsely interleaved and superimposed onto the current codewords. In addition, the presented transmission scheme is combined with the conventional hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol, resulting in a throughput-enhanced conjunction HARQ scheme. Numerical results show that the word error rate (WER) of the LDPC codes can be significantly reduced by using the presented transmission scheme, but without any extra bandwidth or transmission power. They also show that the presented conjunction HARQ schemes can achieve a throughput improvement up to 80% over fading channels in comparison with the original 5G HARQ scheme.}

This paper studies polar-coded modulation in the short-block length regime for decode-forward, amplify-forward and compress-forward relays. Our work seamlessly combines multi-level signaling, polar coding/decoding, and the requirements of relaying, into encoders and decoders that exhibit excellent performance. Compared with the state of the art in decode-forward, our work demonstrates 2.5 dB improvement (at block length 512). For shorter block lengths 256 and 128, this work is the first reported implementation for any coded modulation and any relaying protocol. In the category of polar-coded full-duplex relaying, this work presents the first implementation at any block length and for any relaying protocol. For decode-forward, we propose and analyze joint iterative belief propagation decoding with polar codes, and successive list decoding with polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes. For amplify-forward, we utilize PAC codes and successive list decoding. For the three relaying protocols, the respective dispersion bounds are presented for comparison, and the error exponent of the multi-level relaying coded modulations are analyzed to shed light on the results. Extensive simulations verify the performance of the proposed coding schemes.}

	abstract = {We consider the design of low-delay joint source-channel coding (JSCC) schemes for the transmission of discrete-time analog sources over noisy channels based on deep neural networks. The design problem is addressed as optimization of an autoencoder model, and several scenarios are discussed. For point-to-point communication of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian sources and Gauss-Markov sources over additive-white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, the encoder and decoder are constructed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). With minimum prior knowledge used for design, the performance of these RNNs-based models is optimized using fine tuning techniques during training. Sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs)-based models are proposed and optimized for three JSCC problems namely, transmitting multivariate Gaussian sources over AWGN channels, transmitting i.i.d Gaussian sources with side information at the decoder, and for communicating correlated sources over orthogonal Gaussian channels. We show that these deep learning-based JSCC schemes perform comparably or better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) traditional schemes. The proposed scheme can extend flexibly to different pairs of source and channel dimensions. Moreover, the spontaneously learned encoder mappings exhibit structured patterns that are interpretable.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate two important issues of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, namely, reduced-complexity detection and code design. Different from previous works, we consider these two issues jointly by designing a scheme that increases the minimum squared Euclidean distance of FTN signaling via repetition coding at a cost of an increased complexity. Furthermore, to reduce the rate loss of the repetition, we adopt the idea of spatially-coupling from coding theory to FTN signaling, and the resultant signaling scheme is therefore referred to as spatially-coupled faster-than-Nyquist (SC-FTN) signaling. The signal of SC-FTN signaling is generated in a continuous manner by interleaving and repeating the coded FTN signals and a graph-based iterative sliding-window detector is applied for signal detection. Both bounding and extrinsic information transfer chart analysis are provided to study the error-floor and convergence performances of SC-FTN signaling. These analyses unveil the intrinsic relationship between error floor, decoding threshold, and detection/decoding complexity, which provides guidelines for the designs of practical systems. Simulation results show that the promising error performance can be achieved with a simple FTN detection, where the bit error rate performance of coded SC-FTN signaling outperforms that of state-of-the-art coded FTN systems and the capacity of Nyquist signaling.}

In such an architecture, all ADCs equipping at any access point (AP) can use arbitrary bit resolution to realize adaptive quantization and reduce power consumption. Under this circumstance, we first introduce a quantization-aware channel estimator based on linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) theory. On this basis, intra-AP and inter-AP bit allocation problems are investigated to maximize channel estimation quality subject to the total number of quantization bits. By leveraging the statistical characteristics of the estimated channels and estimation errors, we then derive the theoretical expressions of the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for maximal ratio combining (MRC) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) combining, respectively. Furthermore, to maximize the sum SE under the constraint of total ADC quantization bits, we also investigate intra-AP and inter-AP bit allocation problems for both single-user and multi-user scenarios. Finally, simulation results confirm that our theoretical analyses are correct and accurate. In addition, we resort to numerical results to achieve some new insights and verify the advantages and conclusions pertinent to the proposed bit allocation techniques.}

	abstract = {Due to the flexible deployment, unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have attracted much interest recently. To solve the resource scarcity problem at sea, USV needs to leverage existing terrestrial and satellite systems for efficient backhaul and spectrum sharing. In this case, the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology can be applied for diversity gain improvement and interference coordination. However, how to adopt MIMO technology into maritime networks with a sparse scattering environment is still an open issue. In this paper, we employ a multi-antenna USV to support on-demand communications. Utilizing the two-ray channel, we aim to maximize the sum throughput over all USV intended users, by jointly optimizing the cooperative beamforming and trajectory, subject to several practical constraints, including the USV kinetics, quality of service requirement and backhaul capacity. Different from existing whole period designs, we decompose the problem into sequential one-slot problems. Within each slot, the non-convex problem is solved iteratively by using problem decomposition and successive convex optimization methods. Then, channel estimation errors are considered to investigate a robust beamforming scheme. Numerical simulations validate that the USV coexists well with the satellite network and show that the beamforming scheme and trajectory design complement each other for performance improvement.}

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a widely investigated intelligent algorithm and proved to be useful in the wireless communication area. However, for optimization problems in large-scale multi-cell networks whose dimension increases exponentially, it is unrealistic to employ a conventional centralized RL algorithm and make decisions for the entire network. Multi-agent RL, which allows distribute decision-making, is expected to solve the scalability problem but with performance issues due to the unknown global information, i.e., non-stationary environment. In this paper, we propose a parameter-sharing multi-agent RL for grouping decisions of coordinated multi-point in a large-scale network, where agents jointly serve users to enhance the cell-edge service. By sharing information via parameters, our theoretical and simulation results show that parameter sharing can largely benefit the multi-agent algorithm with convergence proof and convergence speed analysis. To reduce the effect of biased local heterogeneous experience, we also propose a transfer learning method for the parameter sharing process, whose performance of transfer learning algorithms is verified by the simulation results.}

	abstract = {In this paper, motivated by the inter-base station (BS) channel dependence due to the shared wireless environment, we propose to fuse sub-6 GHz channel information and mmWave low-overhead measurement to predict the optimal mmWave beam in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and reduce the overhead of both mmWave BS selection and beam training. Moreover, deep learning is adopted to extract the complex dependence between sub-6 GHz and mmWave channels for achieving high prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose to leverage a few user equipment (UE)-specific high-quality mmWave wide beams predicted by the sub-6 GHz channel state information (CSI) as the mmWave low-overhead measurement. In order to adapt to different confidences of the mmWave wide beam prediction for diverse UE, the sum-probability criterion is proposed to flexibly adjust the number of measured wide beams. Besides, to fully fuse the diversified features extracted from the sub-6 GHz CSI and mmWave wide beams, the attention mechanism is further exploited to adaptively weight the features for improving the prediction accuracy. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves higher beamforming gain while imposing smaller mmWave measurement overhead over the conventional deep learning based schemes.}

To further improve spectral efficiency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is adopted in this network. Considering the delay-sensitive quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, a joint trajectory and power optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total transmission latency over a long-term task period.

	abstract = {Large antenna arrays and beamforming are necessary for the mmWave communication system, resulting in heavy time and energy consumption in the beam training stage. Therefore, dual-band operations are expected to be deployed in future communication systems, where low-frequency channels are used to meet basic communication needs, and millimeter wave (mmWave) channels are exploited when the high-rate transmission is required. Existing works utilize deep learning methods to extract low-frequency channel state information (CSI) to reduce the mmWave beam training overheads. However, an important limitation of deep learning approaches is that the model is usually trained in a given environment. When employed in an unseen environment, it usually requires a large amount of data to retrain. In this paper, a model-agnostic optimization algorithm based on meta-learning is proposed to provide a general mmWave beam prediction model. This model can be deployed to edge base stations and effectively adapted to the environment without the need for a heavy collection of data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach could reduce the model adaptation overheads. The meta-learning-based beam prediction model is robust and achieves high prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency in different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.}

In this paper, we consider a JRC-enabled multi-UAV cooperative detection scenario, in which each UAV equipped with a JRC unit simultaneously performs the detection function to sense multiple targets and the communication function to transmit the detected data to a fusion center. To strike a trade-off between radar sensory and communication performance for all UAVs, we optimize the transmit power, resource allocation and navigation for each UAV to maximize their sensing scores and the geographical fairness of the targets on the condition of the quality requirements of communication and radar sensing. This problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization that is challenging to be solved in practice. Considering the complexity of the optimization and dynamics of the UAV environment, we design a l earning based t rajectory p lanning and r esource a llocation (LTPRA) algorithm that leverages multiple learning agents to find effective policies from experiences while guaranteeing communication and sensing performance. To improve the environmental exploration of agents, we design an incentive mechanism for their detection behavior and introduce a policy regularization method to mitigate policy overfitting in multi-agent cooperation. Numerical results reveal the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm and show the improvement on detection and communication performance in JRC-enabled multi-UAV detection systems compared with state-of-the-art approaches.}

Several model compression methods, such as gradient quantization and sparsification, have been proposed to improve the communication efficiency of model aggregation. However, the information-theoretic minimum communication cost for a given distortion of gradient estimators is still unknown. In this paper, we study the fundamental limit of communication cost of model aggregation in distributed learning from a rate-distortion perspective. By formulating the model aggregation as a vector Gaussian CEO problem, we derive the rate region bound and sum-rate-distortion function for the model aggregation problem, which reveals the minimum communication rate at a particular gradient distortion upper bound. We also analyze the communication cost at each iteration and total communication cost based on the sum-rate-distortion function with the gradient statistics of real-world datasets. It is found that the communication gain by exploiting the correlation between worker nodes is significant for SignSGD, and a high distortion of gradient estimator can achieve low total communication cost in gradient compression.}

	abstract = {Exploiting the advantages of both non-orthogonal multiple access technique and millimeter-wave communications requires joint efficient resource allocation techniques toward satisfying the stringent requirements of future mobile communication systems. This paper focuses on a multi-band (i.e., millimeter-wave band and sub-6 GHz band) wireless network where both orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access techniques coexist. A joint optimization of user association, transmit power allocation, sub-channel assignment, and multiple access technique selection is investigated to maximize the down-link sum-rate under a minimum rate requirement per user and power constraints. The problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem; then, it is proved to be \\mathcal {NP}\n-hard. First, simple greedy and meta-heuristic solutions are proposed. Then, since model-based approaches have generally a high computational complexity, model-free centralized and distributed approaches based on deep reinforcement learning technique are proposed. The latter are based on multiple parallel deep neural networks to generate resource allocation solutions. The proposed approaches are evaluated and compared. Simulation results corroborate the high performance offered by the proposed solutions for stationary and mobile users. They also highlight the benefits of employing hybrid orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access scheme in multi-band systems in terms of down-link sum-rate and user fairness.}

	abstract = {Full duplex (FD) relaying can provide double spectral efficiency. Despite advanced self-interference cancellation techniques, residual self-interference (RSI) limits the performance significantly. We present an autoencoder (AE)-based block coded modulation (BCM) and differential BCM (d-BCM) for an FD amplify-and-forward (FD-AF) relay network that can tackle the deteriorating impacts of RSI. Existing works treat AE frameworks as black-box with minimal/no focus on training convergence, limiting AE’s practical deployment. Focussing on training convergence, firstly, we show that training of AE converges above minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and below maximum RSI level, and CSI helps in faster convergence. Secondly, we establish a relationship between training hyper-parameters and AE-based BCM/d-BCM design, by showing that, for any given hyper-parameters, training of the AE has converged to its maximum potential of decoding if AE’s encoder has designed\n2\nk\ncodewords, with an emphasis on the minimum required training samples. To open the black-box AE, we reveal five observations in the AE-based designed codewords concerning Euclidean distance, packing density, hamming distance, and kurtosis, that resemble the desired observations of theoretical random coded modulations. By extensive simulations, we show that the proposed AE outperforms the conventional methods considerably for varying SNR, RSI, transmission rate, channel estimation errors, and small/practical block lengths.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the application of downlink beamforming along with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The joint optimization framework for user clustering, downlink beamforming and power allocation scheme is formulated as a novel mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP), where the aim is to minimize the total transmission power while satisfying quality-of-service (QoS), user clustering and power constraints. Owing to the non-convexity and combinatorial nature of the problem, obtaining an optimal solution is challenging. To tackle this issue, we first develop an algorithm based on branch-and-bound (BB), whereby the feasible space is successively partitioned and searched by means of lower and upper bounds on the objective function. While this algorithm is shown to return an\nϵ\n-optimal solution within a finite number of iterations, it entails high computational complexity. Considering this limitation, we then reformulate the original problem into a more tractable form and conceive a low-complexity algorithm for its solution based on the penalty dual-decomposition technique. The proposed joint design algorithms for MIMO NOMA are evaluated by means of simulations over mmWave channels. Results show significant improvements in terms of total transmit power and spectral efficiency compared to benchmark approaches.}

	abstract = {Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is promising to be developed as a key enabling technology for 6G. This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in a downlink multi-user and multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) RSMA system with successive interference cancellation (SIC) errors for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). The single-carrier RSMA (SC-RSMA) resource allocation scheme with URLLC is first given, where the beamforming vector and the transmission rate are optimized to maximize the effective throughput (ET). To solve the non-convex optimization problem formulated in the SC-RSMA scheme, an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed to alternately optimize the beamforming factor and the transmission rate. Furthermore, the multicarrier RSMA (MC-RSMA) scheme is developed for the URLLC access of large-scale users. Based on the results of the SC-RSMA scheme, a low-complexity three-step optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resource allocation problem formulated in the MC-RSMA scheme. Finally, the simulation results show that the RSMA scheme and MC-RSMA scheme can respectively achieve higher ET than the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme and multi-carrier NOMA (MC-NOMA) scheme in the URLLC scenario, and verify that RSMA can reduce the latency and improve the reliability of the system.}

To effectively mitigate the influences of these unfavorable uncertainties and guarantee user fairness, a task-driven robust design algorithm for integrated communication and computation with the objective of minimizing the maximum system delay among all UEs is put forward by jointly optimizing transmit power at the UEs, receive beamforming at the BS and computing resources at the MEC server based on task types.

	abstract = {Emerging distributed cloud architectures, e.g., fog and mobile edge computing, are playing an increasingly important role in the efficient delivery of real-time stream-processing applications (also referred to as augmented information services), such as industrial automation and metaverse experiences (e.g., extended reality, immersive gaming). While such applications require processed streams to be shared and simultaneously consumed by multiple users/devices, existing technologies lack efficient mechanisms to deal with their inherent multicast nature, leading to unnecessary traffic redundancy and network congestion. In this paper, we establish a unified framework for distributed cloud network control with generalized (mixed-cast) traffic flows that allows optimizing the distributed execution of the required packet processing, forwarding, and replication operations. We first characterize the enlarged multicast network stability region under the new control framework (with respect to its unicast counterpart). We then design a novel queuing system that allows scheduling data packets according to their current destination sets, and leverage Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty control theory to develop the first fully decentralized, throughput- and cost-optimal algorithm for multicast flow control. Numerical experiments validate analytical results and demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed design over existing network control policies.}

	abstract = {Future 6G is deemed to provide Simultaneous Wireless cOmputing and Power Transfer (SWOPT) services for addressing the shortage of local computation and that of energy at terminal devices in the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE). In this paper, we study a fog radio access network (F-RAN) consisting of enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) with multiple antennas and edge computing capabilities. The F-RAN simultaneously supports task offloading of computing users (CUs) and energy harvesting of energy users (EUs). Thanks to the global coordination of a central server, full cooperation among eRRHs in both computing and communication domains can substantially improve the SWOPT performance. Specifically, the energy harvesting performance of EUs is maximised by jointly optimising the bandwidth and the beam resources in the communication domain as well as the computing frequency and the offloading strategy in the computing domain. The original non-convex problem with mixed integer and continuous variables is then solved by sequential convex optimisations in the framework of a greedy algorithm with low complexity. Thorough simulation results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed resource scheduling scheme over the existing state-of-the-art counterparts.}

	abstract = {Due to the non-uniform distribution of the ground traffic demand and the high mobility of non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites, how to make full use of the limited beam resources to serve users flexibly and efficiently is a brand-new challenge for NGSO communication systems. In order to achieve efficient spectrum utilization, the combination of full frequency multiplexing and beam hopping is a major trend in future satellite communication systems. However, conventional beam hopping methods are mainly based on geostationary satellites, which do not take into account the interference between satellites. This paper proposes a multi-satellite beam hopping algorithm based on load balancing and interference avoidance, which takes advantage of the multiple coverage features in the NGSO constellation and avoids intra-satellite interference and inter-satellite interference by designing beam-hopping patterns with spatial isolation characteristics. In particular, we decompose the multi-satellite beam hopping problem into three sub-problems, which are the multi-satellite load balancing problem, the single-satellite beam hopping pattern design problem, and the multi-satellite interference avoidance problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the load gap among satellites by about 72.5% and the average traffic satisfaction rate can reach 81.4%. Besides, our method has the lowest unmet capacity compared with other benchmarks, achieving better offered-requested data match.}

Different from existing works, this paper considers a multi-UAV-aided uplink communication scenario and investigates a resource allocation problem of minimizing the total system latency and the energy consumption, subject to constraints on transmit power of mobile users (MUs), system latency caused by transmission and computation. The problem is confirmed to be a challenging time-series mixed-integer non-convex programming problem, and we propose a joint UAV Movement control, MU Association and MU Power control (UMAP) algorithm to solve it effectively, where three sub-problems are optimized iteratively. Specifically, UAV movement and MU association are optimized utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to decrease the energy consumption and system latency. Next, a closed-form solution of the MU transmit power is derived.

Yet, their effectiveness remains unclear and controversial. This work aims to figure out which one between the Hammerstein and Wiener models is more suitable for characterizing the VLC channel. We first design a single-tone test for qualitative analysis and further conduct an experiment based on multi-level pseudorandom sequences for quantitative evaluation. From the two well-designed experiments, we obtain a consistent conclusion that the Hammerstein model is more proper for describing the VLC nonlinearity and also more effective for post-distortion in VLC systems.}

	abstract = {Machine learning is regarded as an attractive solution for soft failure management in optical networks; however, the performance of trained models working on unseen data is of growing concern, due to scarce historical data and high training costs. Hence, the issues of reducing training data and improving generalization have received considerable attention. In this paper, a soft failure detection (SFD) and identification scheme is proposed based on digital residual spectrum that leverages auto-encoder (AE) and support vector machine. The digital residual spectrum acquired by the coherent receiver is computed by subtracting the averaged spectrum of multiple normal digital spectra from the digital spectrum. The scheme features: (i) high generalization, i.e., a model trained for a specific transmission setup performs well in other setups with different fiber lengths; (ii) low cost, i.e., the digital residual spectrum is easily obtained from a coherent receiver without additional hardware; and (iii) easy training, i.e., only normal samples are needed to train the SFD model (less pressure on the collection of rare soft-failure data). Using the model trained for any specific setup, we demonstrated an area under the curve and identification accuracy above 99.24% and 96.45%, respectively, for five experimental setups.}

Specifically, the jammers first harvest energy from M in phase I and then interfere with the SD in phase II. Considering the fairness issue, M aims to maximize the minimum eavesdropping success probability of these suspicious signals, by jointly optimizing its transmit power in phase I and the jammers’ power allocations in phase II. To solve the problem, first we strictly prove that M should exhaust its maximum power for the energy transfer, even the additional energy can be harvested by the STs to enhance their transmit power and rate. Then, the general successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and one low-complexity solution are respectively proposed to optimize the jammers’ power allocations. Further, the closed-form jamming power allocations are derived in the high signal-to-noise ratio range to reveal some interesting insights. The joint deployments of M and the jammers are also investigated to enhance the eavesdropping performance. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes compared to competitive benchmarks.}

	abstract = {With the benefits of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), they can be combined to further enhance the communication performance. However, the high-quality air-ground channel is more vulnerable to the adversarial eavesdropping. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a covert communication scheme assisted by the UAV-IRS to maximize the covert transmission rate. Specifically, the ground transmitter, Alice, secretly delivers the private message to a legitimate receiver, Bob, via the UAV-IRS, wishing that the transmission will not be observable by the warden, Willie. In addition, Willie is adversarial to Alice and the UAV-IRS, which makes his accurate location difficult to obtain. Given this fact, we first determine an optimal detection threshold and derive the error detection probability at Willie, which is the worst-case situation for the legitimate transmission. Then, we maximize the covert transmission rate by alternatively optimizing the transmit power of Alice, the IRS phase shift and the horizontal location of UAV-IRS subject to the covert requirements. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed covert communication scheme assisted by UAV-IRS.}

	abstract = {Due to the openness of wireless communication, information transmitted in the multiple access channel is vulnerable to eavesdropping by illegitimate users. Classic artificial noise-assisted schemes can improve security but are not suitable for power-constrained users. To address this problem, we propose a cross-time interference injection scheme in this paper, which improves security by introducing cross-time self-interference and inter-user interference, and does not require artificial noise. The proposed scheme exploits the properties of the Hadamard matrix and the wireless channels, so that the eavesdropping channel suffers from stronger interference than the legitimate channel. We analyze the security performance when both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper exploit the successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme, including the secrecy sum rate, the secrecy capacity, and the secrecy outage probability. We further investigate the effect of the number of eavesdropper’s antennas, the number of legitimate users, and the number of time slots used by the scheme on the security performance, and obtain the corresponding relationship between these parameters when achieving a positive secrecy rate. Finally, simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis.}

The physical-layer network coding (PNC) and the NOMA schemes are combined to improve spectrum efficiency. Furthermore, inter-user interference and friendly jamming signals are utilized to suppress the eavesdropping ability of the untrusted relay without compromising the acceptance quality of legitimate users. Specifically, the far user in the first slot and the near user in the second slot act as jammers that generate jamming signals to ensure secure transmissions of confidential messages. We investigate the secrecy performance of the NOMA-based CDRT systems with the PNC scheme and derive the closed-form expression for the ergodic secrecy sum rate. The asymptotic analysis at a high signal-to-noise ratio is performed to obtain more insights.

A maximum likelihood (ML) position estimator is derived based on the knowledge of probabilities that LED transmitters can be malicious. In addition, in the presence of training measurements, decision rules are designed for detection of malicious LED transmitters, and based on detection results, various ML based location estimators are proposed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators, Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) are derived for position estimation in scenarios with and without a training phase.

The performances of all the proposed estimators are evaluated via numerical examples and compared against the CRLBs.}

	abstract = {The reception performance of a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) system suffers from not only the channel fading but also the phase noise. Accurate and efficient estimation algorithms of channel responses and phase noises that enable high-speed wireless communications in MIMO systems are of broad interest. The prior joint estimation schemes of channel responses and phase noises are designed for synchronous MIMO systems, where symbols transmitted from different transmit antennas are strictly synchronized. However, the estimation performance of the prior schemes suffers from the Inter Antenna Interference (IAI), which further limits the reception performance of a MIMO system. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous MIMO system with intentional timing offset. Based on the proposed asynchronous MIMO system, we further design the Joint Estimation of Channel responses and Phase noises using Intentional Timing Offset (JECP-ITO) scheme. We derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of the JECP-ITO scheme in closed form. We provide rigorous theoretical comparisons between the JECP-ITO and the prior scheme in terms of IAI and CRLB. Moreover, we implement the proposed scheme and conduct extensive performance comparisons through simulations.}

	abstract = {In future wireless networks, device-to-device (D2D) communications are expected to play an important role to support a plethora of applications. To meet the target quality of service while ensuring high reliability, and high spectral and energy efficiencies, manipulation of the radio waves by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) will be critical. In this context, leveraging concepts of polarization, this paper proposes a framework for bidirectional D2D communications, where the data exchange between a central node and devices operating in distinct polarization states, is multiple-input multiple-output in nature and takes place via a dual-polarized RIS, in the presence of hardware impairments and imperfect interference cancellation, as well as impairments caused by the spatial correlation and cross-polarization. Performance evaluation of such a framework is conducted in terms of key metrics, namely, bit error rate, outage probability, channel capacity, and energy efficiency, for which closed-form expressions are obtained considering transmissions over Nakagami fading channels. An asymptotic analysis is also conducted to evaluate the achievable diversity gains, by approximating the Nakagami model with a tractable Gamma model. Further, the impact of imperfect channel estimation on performance is also investigated. Comparative numerical results are provided, and the effects of the main system parameters on performance are analyzed. The proposed framework is shown to provide significant performance improvements as compared to D2D communications via non-polarized RIS.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter (AB) communications and radio frequency (RF)-powered cognitive radio networks (CRNs) address the concerns of energy and spectrum scarcities from different perspectives, and the integration of them has potential benefits for throughput. Motivated by this fact, we study the RF-powered AB-assisted hybrid underlay CRN (ABHU-CRN), and optimize the long-term secondary throughput. Based on the channel states, secondary users choose to perform different actions, and two action spaces are accordingly designed. Due to dynamic and unpredictable environment states, we jointly control the time scheduling and energy management of secondary users, and propose two algorithms, i.e., adjusted-deep deterministic policy gradient (A-DDPG) and combination of A-DDPG and convex optimization (C-ADCO), for the long-term secondary throughput. A-DDPG, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with continuous spaces, is extended from DDPG to adapt to the design of two action spaces. C-ADCO utilizes the convex optimization that can find the optimal solution to assist A-DDPG to accelerate the convergence. In simulations, the ABHU-CRN under A-DDPG and C-ADCO achieves higher throughput than the optimal throughput of AB-assisted overlay CRN and AB-assisted underlay CRN, which indicates the advantage of the hybrid transmission mode in the ABHU-CRN.}

	abstract = {This paper exploits an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted wireless powered mobile edge computing and caching (WP-MECC) network. In particular, an IRS is utilized to reflect energy signals from a power station (PS) to various IoT devices for energy harvesting during uplink wireless energy transfer (WET). These devices collect energy to support their own partially local computing for computational tasks and their offloading capabilities to an access point (AP), with the help of IRS via time or frequency division multiple access (TDMA or FDMA). The AP is equipped with a local cache connected with a MEC server via a backhaul link, which prefetches the data to facilitate edge computing capabilities. The maximization of a utility function is formulated to evaluate the overall network performance, which is defined as the difference between the sum of computational bits (offloading bits and local computing bits) and total backhaul cost. Due to multiple coupled variables, we first design the optimal caching strategy. Then, an auxiliary vector is introduced to coordinate the energy consumption of local computing and offloading, where its optimal solution can be achieved by an exhaustive search. Moreover, we utilize the Lagrange dual method and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to derive the optimal time scheduling for the TDMA scheme or the optimal bandwidth allocation for the FDMA counterpart in closed form. The IRS phase shifts are iteratively designed by employing the quadratic transformation (QT) and the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO). Finally, simulation results are demonstrated to validate the network utility performance and confirm the advantage of the employment of IRS, the optimal IRS phase shift design and caching strategy, in comparison to the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Continuous and remote health monitoring medical applications with heterogeneous requirements can be realized through wireless body area networks (WBANs). Energy harvesting is adopted to enable low-power health applications and long-term monitoring without battery replacement, which have drawn significant interest recently. Because energy harvesting WBANs are obviously different from battery-powered ones, network protocols should be designed accordingly to improve network performance. In this article, an efficient cross-layer media access control protocol is proposed for radio frequency powered energy harvesting WBANs. We redesigned the superframe structure, which can be rescheduled by the coordinator dynamically. A time switching (TS) strategy is used when sensors harvest energy from radio frequency signals broadcast by the coordinator, and a transmission power adjustment scheme is proposed for sensors based on the energy harvesting efficiency and the network environment. Energy efficiency can be effectively improved that more packets can be uploaded using limited energy. The length of the energy harvesting period is determined by the coordinator to balance the channel resources and energy requirements of sensors and further improve the network performance. Numerical simulation results show that our protocol can provide superior system performance for long-term periodic health monitoring applications.}

	abstract = {As a new degree of freedom (DOF), orbital angular momentum (OAM) has the potential of greatly enhancing the channel capacity of wireless communication systems. However, the OAM beams diverge with the increase of transmission distance and OAM mode, which makes the OAM beams modulated with information difficult to be received with a limited aperture array. Therefore, there is still a big challenge for achieving the expected extremely high data rate with orthogonal multiplexed OAM beams in a long-distance communication link. To reduce the divergence of OAM beams, the spherical Luneberg lens is proposed for the uniform circular array (UCA)-based OAM communication system to realize OAM beam convergence. However, due to the non-negligible UCA aperture relative to the Luneberg lens, we find through electromagnetism (EM) simulation that the 0-mode OAM beam becomes more divergent after passing through Luneberg lens. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid circular array with a center element (CAC) and spherical Luneberg lens (HCCL) structure. When the HCCL structure is applied in the OAM wireless communication system, the divergence angles of generated OAM beams are significantly reduced, and the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is expected to be significantly improved. Besides, the multiplexed OAM modes in the proposed HCCL-based OAM communication system keep orthogonal. Therefore, the channel capacities of the proposed HCCL-based OAM communication systems are obviously better than that of the existing UCA-based OAM system in the long-distance transmission. Furthermore, both numerical analysis and simulation results validate that the performance of the OAM system equipped with the HCCL structure both at transmitter and receiver is significantly better than that of the system equipped with the HCCL structure at one side}

This paper exploits the energy efficient potential of STAR-RIS in a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. Specifically, we mainly focus on energy-efficient resource allocation with MIMO technology in the STAR-RIS assisted NOMA network. To maximize the system energy efficiency, we propose an algorithm to optimize the transmit beamforming and the phases of the low-cost passive elements on the STAR-RIS alternatively until the convergence. Specifically, we first decompose the formulated energy efficiency problem into beamforming and phase shift optimization problems. To efficiently address the non-convex beamforming optimization problem, we exploit signal alignment and zero-forcing precoding methods in each user pair to decompose MIMO-NOMA channels into single-antenna NOMA channels. Then, the Dinkelbach approach and dual decomposition are utilized to optimize the beamforming vectors. In order to solve non-convex phase shift optimization problem, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) based method to efficiently obtain the optimized phase shift of STAR-RIS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm with NOMA technology can yield superior energy efficiency performance over the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and the random phase shift scheme.}

However, the reader operates in the full-duplex (FD) mode and experiences self-interference (SI) levels much higher (e.g., 160 dB) than the desired signal. However, hardware-based SI cancellation (SIC) techniques can remove SI partially only. Therefore, residual SI (RSI) dramatically degrades system performance. To remedy this problem, we develop a sum-rate maximization algorithm that suppresses the RSI and ensures that the tags harvest sufficient energy. It jointly optimizes the reader precoder and combiners and the tags reflection coefficients. Because of the non-convexity of this problem, we utilize alternating optimization (AO) to split it into three parts. They are then solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to yield the precoder, a generalized Rayleigh quotient-based closed-form solution for the combiners, and geometric programming (GP) to get the reflection coefficients. Simulation results validate the fast convergence of the algorithm and show significant sum rate improvements (more than 21%) over the baselines.}

By frequency-modulating an OFDM signal and further defining a suitable cutoff subcarrier, the resulting constant-envelope waveform (ensuring a low Peak to Average Power Ratio) exhibits strong robustness not only to Doppler, but also to phase noise and carrier frequency offsets. These impairments introduce an additive error term at the information-bearing subcarriers that is mostly concentrated at the lowest part of the spectrum. No inter-carrier interference is thus present, and impairments can be easily overcome by mapping the information above a cutoff subcarrier.

	abstract = {Smart factories need to support the simultaneous communication of multiple industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) devices with ultra-reliability and low-latency communication (URLLC). Meanwhile, short packet transmission for IIoT applications incurs performance loss compared to traditional long packet transmission for human-to-human communications. On the other hand, cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF mMIMO) technology can provide uniform services for all devices by deploying distributed access points (APs). In this paper, we adopt CF mMIMO to support URLLC in a smart factory. Specifically, we first derive the lower bound (LB) on achievable uplink data rate under the finite blocklength (FBL) with imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and full-pilot zero-forcing (FZF) decoders. The derived LB rates based on the MRC case have the same trends as the ergodic rate, while LB rates using the FZF decoder tightly match the ergodic rates, which means that resource allocation can be performed based on the LB data rate rather the exact ergodic data rate under FBL. The log-function method and successive convex approximation (SCA) are then used to approximately transform the non-convex weighted sum rate problem into a series of geometric program (GP) problems, and an iterative algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the pilot and payload power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that CF mMIMO significantly improves the average weighted sum rate (AWSR) compared to centralized mMIMO. An interesting observation is that increasing the number of devices improves the AWSR for CF mMIMO whilst the AWSR remains relatively constant for centralized mMIMO.}

	abstract = {A multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication system is analytically studied, which operates with the aid of a large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (LRIS). LRIS is equipped with multiple passive elements with discrete phase adjustment capabilities, and independent Rician fading conditions are assumed for both the transmitter-to-LRIS and LRIS-to-receiver links. A direct transceiver link is also considered which is modeled by Rayleigh fading distribution. The system performance is analytically studied when the linear yet efficient zero-forcing detection is implemented at the receiver. In particular, the outage performance is derived in closed-form expression for different system configuration setups with regards to the available channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. In fact, the case of both perfect and imperfect CSI is analyzed. Also, an efficient phase shift design approach at LRIS is introduced, which is linear on the number of passive elements and receive antennas. The proposed phase shift design can be applied on two different modes of operation; namely, when the system strives to adapt either on the instantaneous or statistical CSI. Finally, some impactful engineering insights are provided, such as how the channel fading conditions, CSI, discrete phase shift resolution, and volume of antenna/LRIS element arrays impact on the overall system performance.}

Due to the limitation of energy consumption, a novel UAV architecture with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) is proposed firstly. Leveraging the additive quantization noise model, the exact closed-form expressions of both ergodic capacity and ergodic achievable secrecy rate are derived for UAV-assisted satellite-terrestrial communication systems using large-scale antenna array with one-bit ADCs/DACs. To enhance the transmission capacity and combat the eavesdropper simultaneously, maximum-ratio combining (MRC) is used by UAV to receive signals from satellite and location-based beamforming (LBB) is adopted by UAV to forward signals to destination, where the beamformer is optimized based on the derived expression of the ergodic achievable secrecy rate. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analytical ergodic achievable secrecy rate, and demonstrate that our proposed MRC/LBB scheme has better secrecy rate than its conventional location-based counterpart.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communications are envisioned as a key technology of next-generation wireless systems due to its ultra-broad bandwidth. One step forward, THz integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system can realize both unprecedented data rates and millimeter-level accurate sensing. However, THz ISAC meets stringent challenges on waveform and receiver design to fully exploit the peculiarities of THz channel and transceivers. In this work, a sensing integrated discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SI-DFT-s-OFDM) system is proposed for THz ISAC, which can provide lower peak-to-average power ratio than OFDM and is adaptive to flexible delay spread of the THz channel. Without compromising communication capabilities, the proposed SI-DFT-s-OFDM realizes millimeter-level range estimation and decimeter-per-second-level velocity estimation accuracy. In addition, the bit error rate (BER) performance is improved by 5 dB gain at the 10°3 BER level compared with OFDM. At the receiver, a deep learning based ISAC receiver with two neural networks is developed to recover transmitted data and estimate target range and velocity, while mitigating the imperfections and non-linearities of THz systems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning methods can realize mutually enhanced performance for communication and sensing, and is robust against Doppler effects, phase noise and multi-target estimation.}

We investigate status prediction and data aggregation with prediction error awareness, to enhance the AoI performance for short-packet transmission (SPT) in time-critical IIoT. A predict-compare (PredComp) transmission scheme is proposed, where proactive transmission termination is employed in case of prediction error, by comparing the predicted and real updates at source. It is proved to achieve a significant average AoI performance gain over the case without prediction, even under high prediction error probability. In addition, a predict-aggregate-compare (PredAggComp) transmission scheme is proposed, where two status updates are predicted with different prediction horizons and aggregated by utilizing their time correlation. That allows a good tradeoff between the prediction accuracy and the transmission error probability. A closed-form threshold that the PredAggComp scheme outperforms the PredComp scheme is derived. Moreover, prediction horizon adaptation is conducted to minimize the average AoI of the proposed transmission schemes. Simulation results verify the analytical results and show the superiority of the proposed PredComp and PredAggComp schemes, with an average AoI reduction of up to 64% over the case without prediction.}

We focus on the so-called reciprocal channel approximation (RCA), which is often adopted in the design of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Implementation of RCA requires the computation of the mutual information of BPSK signaling as well as a corresponding function known as the reciprocal channel mapping, and thus we develop rigorous closed-form approximations of these that are easy to calculate numerically and also valid over a wide range of SNR. Through numerical evaluation we find that, compared to approaches based on the popular Gaussian approximation (GA) as well as the so-called improved GA (IGA), the proposed RCA approach offers better estimates of the bit error rate of polarized channels with no additional computational cost. As a result, polar codes designed by the proposed RCA can achieve further improvement in terms of block error rate (BLER) performance. The gain achieved by the new approach becomes significant as the codeword length increases.}

Unlike the conventional framework which requires the master node to recover the sum of the gradients over all the data subsets in the presence of straggler workers, we relax the goal to computing the sum of at least some\nα\nfraction of the gradients. We begin by deriving a lower bound on the computation load of any scheme and also propose two strategies which achieve this lower bound, albeit at the cost of high communication load and a number of data partitions which can be polynomial in\nn\n. We then propose schemes based on cyclic assignment which utilize\nn\ndata partitions and have a lower communication load. When each worker transmits a single linear combination, we prove lower bounds on the computation load of any scheme using\nn\ndata partitions. Finally, we describe a class of schemes which achieve different intermediate operating points for the computation and communication load and provide simulation results to demonstrate the empirical performance of our schemes.}

Utilizing the special selection of components, we propose hybrid soft- and hard-decision iterative decoding (ID) algorithms for these codes, during which many RS component decoders can be early terminated. The proposed hybrid ID only exchanges ternary messages between component decoders and early stops the RS component decoders satisfying a proposed stopping criterion, thus low hardware and computational complexities are guaranteed. The hybrid ID of RS-SPC product codes not only performs comparable to the soft-decision decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and block turbo codes (BTCs), but also takes much lower computational complexity and smaller decoder data flow. We also propose semi-analytical methods to estimate the waterfall and error-floor performances of the proposed scheme, which yield relatively accurate estimated results. The simulation results and error-floor estimations indicate that some good RS-SPC product codes have very low error floors that satisfy the requirements of optical systems.}

Furthermore, to practically acquire the CSI of the active and passive channels, we propose an efficient channel estimation method based on two-phase uplink-training, and the achievable rate-region taking into account CSI estimation errors is further characterized.

The proposed NOFDM-SIM scheme is constituted by a filterbank multicarrier system under reduced subcarrier spacing, where precoded index modulated symbols are mapped onto the subcarriers. The detrimental effects of inter-carrier interference (ICI) resulting from the non-orthogonality between subcarriers are efficiently mitigated with the aid of eigenvalue-decomposition-based precoding. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoded NOFDM-SIM system exhibits a similar peak-to-average power ratio to OFDM and OFDM-SIM counterparts while achieving the bit error rate limit of zero-ICI OFDM in a channel-uncoded setting. We analyze the power spectral density of the proposed scheme to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is strictly bandlimited, unlike its orthogonal counterpart. Furthermore, we present detailed investigations of the effects on ICI in the proposed scheme with and without precoding as well as power allocation. Finally, we introduce a three-stage iterative decoding architecture for our proposed scheme and show near-capacity error performance.}

	abstract = {Molecular communication (MC) can enable the transfer of information between nanomachines using molecules as the information carrier. In MC systems, multiple receiver nanomachines often co-exist in the same communication channel to serve common or different purposes. However, the analytical channel model for a system with multiple fully absorbing receivers (FARs), which is significantly different from the single FAR system due to the mutual influence of FARs, does not exist in the literature. The analytical channel model is essential in analyzing systems with multiple FARs, including MIMO, SIMO, and cognitive molecular communication systems. In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the hitting probability of a molecule emitted from a point source on each FAR in a diffusion-based MC system with\nN\nFARs. Using these expressions, we derive the channel model for a SIMO system with a single transmitter and multiple FARs arranged in a uniform circular array (UCA). We then analyze the communication performance of this SIMO system under different cooperative detection schemes and develop several interesting insights.}

A Golay-ZCZ sequence set is not only a Golay complementary set (GCS) but also a zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence set. Golay-ZCZ sequence sets have been employed in OFDM systems due to their low peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) which are upper bounded by the set sizes. Although several constructions of Golay-ZCZ sequence sets have been proposed in the literature, the known Golay-ZCZ sets cannot attain the theoretical upper bound on the ZCZ width for non-binary cases. Also, for the Golay-ZCZ sets constructed by generalized Boolean functions, parameters are limited to powers of two, such as set sizes, sequence lengths, and ZCZ widths. In this paper, constructions of Golay-ZCZ sequence sets based on the extended generalized Boolean functions are proposed, where set sizes, sequence lengths, and ZCZ widths are all flexible and not necessary to be power-of-two. Since the constructed Golay-ZCZ sets have various set sizes, their PAPR upper bounds can be tighter. In addition, the proposed Golay-ZCZ sequence sets can achieve the upper bound on the ZCZ width. Therefore, optimal and almost-optimal Golay-ZCZ sequence sets can be obtained by the proposed methods.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided communications is a promising emerging technology that will be adopted in the next generation communication networks. In this paper, a number of advanced cooperative UAV-aided communication solutions is proposed and evaluated, which considerably improve the performance of traditional terrestrial networks. Specifically, two generalized multi-UAV-selection schemes are introduced, depending on whether a direct link between the source and the destination is available or not. Once the UAVs have been selected, they may retransmit the source message to the destination using distributed space-time coding, or, in the presence of channel state information, distributed beamforming. A number of metrics to evaluate the performance on a realistic channel model was adopted, including the end-to-end outage probability (OP), the so-called goodput, and the average number of path estimations, as well as the total UAV communications power consumption. Exact expressions for the OP were obtained in terms of finite sums. Moreover, convenient closed-form expressions for the asymptotic OP were derived, valid for large numbers of UAVs, which are also very accurate for few UAVs. All results were compared with numerical simulations, which clearly depict the performance improvement induced by the proposed schemes as well as the impact of various system and channel parameters to the performance.}

	abstract = {Multiplexing or transmission diversity via dual links enables the reduction in age of information (AoI). We address the open issue of selection between the two transmission modes for AoI-oriented short-packet system over fading channels, with a comprehensive analysis. Closed-form expressions for the average AoI and peak AoI (PAoI) are derived based on the discrete-time Markov-chain process. Then, to obtain the explicit region of preference (RoP) and quantitative PAoI gains of multiplexing/diversity over the single-queue case, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold for transmission mode selection, which is shown to be a decreasing function of the arrival rate and saturates at high arrival rate. Also, the monotonicity of the PAoI gains by multiplexing and diversity, and their achievable gains, are analyzed in a comprehensive manner. It is shown that diversity is able to achieve a PAoI gain of more than 3 dB over the single-queue case at low SNR, while multiplexing has a larger RoP than diversity and is selected at high SNR and high arrival rate. Furthermore, both throughput and PAoI violation probability are considered alongside the average PAoI for a wide range of tradeoff in system design.}

	abstract = {A whole suite of innovative technologies and architectures have emerged in response to the rapid growth of wireless traffic. This paper studies an integrated network design that boosts system capacity through cooperation between wireless access points (APs) and a satellite for enhancing the network’s spectral efficiency. As for our analytical contributions , upon coherently combing the signals received by the central processing unit (CPU) from the users through the space and terrestrial links, we first mathematically derive an achievable throughput expression for the uplink (UL) data transmission over spatially correlated Rician channels. Our generic achievable throughput expression is applicable for arbitrary received signal detection techniques employed at the APs and the satellite under realistic imperfect channel estimates. A closed-form expression is then obtained for the ergodic UL data throughput, when maximum ratio combining is utilized for detecting the desired signals. As for our resource allocation contributions , we formulate the max-min fairness and total transmit power optimization problems relying on the channel statistics for performing power allocation. The solution of each optimization problem is derived in form of a low-complexity iterative design, in which each data power variable is updated relying on a closed-form expression. Our integrated hybrid network concept allows users to be served that may not otherwise be accommodated due to the excessive data demands. The algorithms proposed allow us to address the congestion issues appearing when at least one user is served at a rate below his/her target. The mathematical analysis is also illustrated with the aid of our numerical results that show the added benefits of considering the space links in terms of improving the ergodic data throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms smoothly circumvent any potential congestion, especially in face of high rate requirements and weak channel conditions.}

	abstract = {User scheduling and beamforming design are two crucial yet coupled topics for multiuser wireless communication systems. They are usually addressed separately with conventional optimization methods. In this paper, cross-layer optimization problem is considered, namely, the user scheduling and beamforming are jointly discussed, subjecting to the requirement of per-user quality of service and the maximum allowable transmit power for multicell multiuser joint transmission networks. To achieve the goal, a mixed discrete-continuous variables combinational optimization problem is investigated with aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the communication system. To circumvent the original non-convex problem with dynamic solution space, we first transform it into a 0–1 integer and continuous variables optimization problem, and then obtain a tractable form with continuous variables by exploiting the characteristics of the 0–1 integer constraints. Finally, the scheduled users and the optimized beamforming vectors are simultaneously calculated by an alternating optimization algorithm. We also theoretically prove that the base stations allocate zero power to the unscheduled users. Furthermore, two heuristic optimization algorithms are proposed respectively based on brute-force search and greedy search. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the optimization approach gets relatively balanced results compared with the other two approaches.}

	abstract = {We consider straggler-resilient learning. In many previous works, e.g., in the coded computing literature, straggling is modeled as random delays that are independent and identically distributed between workers. However, in many practical scenarios, a given worker may straggle over an extended period of time. We propose a latency model that captures this behavior and is substantiated by traces collected on Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a small local cluster. Building on this model, we propose DSAG, a mixed synchronous-asynchronous iterative optimization method, based on the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method, that combines timely and stale results. We also propose a dynamic load-balancing strategy to further reduce the impact of straggling workers. We evaluate DSAG for principal component analysis, cast as a finite-sum optimization problem, of a large genomics dataset, and for logistic regression on a cluster composed of 100 workers on AWS, and find that DSAG is up to about 50% faster than SAG, and more than twice as fast as coded computing methods, for the particular scenario that we consider.}

	abstract = {This paper optimizes predictive power allocation to minimize the average transmit power for video streaming subject to the constraint on stalling time, one of the most important factors affecting the experience of users requesting video-on-demand service. Different from the widely used first-predict-then-optimize strategy that regards the predicted channels as the real future channels, we integrate the prediction of large-scale channels into the optimization of power allocation, such that the quality of service constraint can be controlled. Due to the channel prediction errors, stalling is unavoidable and the stalling duration is random. This motivates us to consider an average stalling fraction constraint conditioned on the observed large-scale channel gains, which can be transformed into a conditional probabilistic constraint. The resultant optimization problem is difficult to solve since the probabilistic constraint lacks a closed-form expression. We resort to end-to-end deep learning to optimize the future powers from the past channels. In particular, we propose a method to learn the conditional probabilities in multiple steps with a single neural network. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed method in reducing average power consumption and in ensuring the probabilistic constraint.}

For this, we extend the recently proposed serial Turbo-autoencoder neural network (NN) architecture and train it to find short messages that can be, all “at once”, detected, synchronized, equalized and decoded when sent over an unsynchronized channel with memory. The conceptional advantage of the proposed system stems from a holistic message structure with superimposed pilots for joint detection and decoding without the need of relying on a dedicated preamble. This results not only in a higher spectral efficiency, but also translates into the possibility of shorter messages compared to using a dedicated preamble. We compare the detection error rate (DER), bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed system with a hand-crafted state-of-the-art conventional baseline and our simulations show a significant advantage of the proposed autoencoder-based system over the conventional baseline in every scenario up to messages conveying\nk=96\ninformation bits. Finally, we practically evaluate and confirm the improved performance of the proposed system over-the-air (OTA) using a software-defined radio (SDR)-based measurement testbed.}

	abstract = {In dense small cell networks, the coordinated multi-point noncoherent joint transmission (JT) is a key technique to mitigate inter-cell interference and enhance network capacity. However, the capacity-maximizing power control and beamforming problem subject to a total transmit power constraint at each individual small cell base station (BS) is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard. To solve this problem, most existing algorithms require global channel state information (CSI) and a lot of computations, which are infeasible and impractical in dynamic wireless networks with limited computing power and link capacity. In this paper, we characterize a low-dimensional solution structure for the power control of the sum-rate maximization problem in time division duplex (TDD) dense small cell networks. Taking advantage of this low-dimensional structure, a distributed noncoherent JT scheme based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is proposed to maximize the sum-rate of the dense small cell networks with reduced information overhead. In the proposed scheme, each BS acts as an agent and makes decisions locally. It is proved that the optimal sum-rate can be achieved for single-transmit-antenna BSs by using the proposed scheme. Compared to the best method presently known, the proposed scheme achieves a similar sum-rate with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead, which makes it more appealing for practical implementations.}

	abstract = {Collaborative inference in mobile edge computing (MEC) enables mobile devices to offload the computation tasks for the computation-intensive perception services, and the inference policy determines the inference latency and energy consumption. The optimal inference policy depends on the inference performance model of deep learning, the data generation model and the network model that are rarely known by mobile devices in time. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) based energy-efficient MEC collaborative inference scheme, which enables each mobile device to choose both the partition point of deep learning and the collaborative edge of each mobile device based on the image quantity, the channel conditions and the previous inference performance. A learning experience exchange mechanism exploits the Q-values of the neighboring mobile devices to accelerate the inference policy optimization with less energy consumption. We also provide a deep multi-agent RL based inference scheme to accelerate learning for large-scale MEC networks, in which an actor network yields the collaborative inference policy probability distribution and a critic network guides the weight update of the actor network to enhance sample efficiency. We provide the inference performance bound and analyze the computational complexity. Both simulation and experimental results show that our proposed schemes reduce the inference latency and save the MEC energy consumption.}

	abstract = {Deep neural network-based learning methods have been considered promising techniques used in beam selection problems. However, existing research ignores the peculiar vulnerabilities of neural networks. The adversaries can use data poisoning to embed predefined triggers into a model during training time such that the neural network-based beam model may make an incorrect output decision of a test example when patched with the trigger. Data poisoning offers attackers the possibility to build backdoors. The goal of backdoors is often unethical, such as giving users a poor experience by manipulating infected models to output inappropriate beams. In this paper, first, we introduce a simple backdoor attack method by using data poisoning in a mmWave beam selection system. By numerical simulations, we verify that this poisoning attack is effective for neural networks with different structures. In addition, we explore the effect of poisoned data volume on the effect of backdoor attacks. The results show that the backdoor can be successfully implanted into the beam selection neural network. Besides, we fine-tune the trained model for a new wireless communication environment, and the results show that backdoors still exist even when the model is tuned with data from new scenarios. Then, we propose a machine unlearning solution to mitigate the backdoor of the trained beam selection model. The problem of eliminating backdoors is modeled as a minimax optimization problem. We propose a novel adversarial unlearning method along with label smoothing to solve the backdoor removal problem. We compared the proposed backdoor elimination method with the classical fine-tuning elimination method and the neural network pruning method through numerical simulations. The results show that the fine-tuning and the pruning methods cannot effectively remove the backdoor. The proposed machine unlearning method can make the trained model forget about the backdoor under the condition that the performance of the benign task (beam selection tasks when the trigger does not appear) is guaranteed to be slightly degraded. In summary, our work illustrates that data poisoning-based backdoor attacks may exist in wireless networks, and we propose a scheme to eliminate backdoors.}

In order to predict the content popularity with high accuracy and low complexity, we propose a Gaussian process based regressor to model the content request pattern. Firstly, the relationship between content features and popularity is captured by our proposed model. Then, we utilize Bayesian learning to train the model parameters, which is robust to overfitting. However, Bayesian methods are usually unable to find a closed-form expression of the posterior distribution. To tackle this issue, we apply a stochastic variance reduced gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SVRG-HMC) method to approximate the posterior distribution. To utilize the computing resource of fog access points (F-APs) and also reduce the communication overhead, we propose a quantized federated learning (FL) framework combining with Bayesian learning. The proposed quantized federated Bayesian learning framework allows each F-AP to send gradients to the cloud server after quantizing and encoding. It can achieve a tradeoff between prediction accuracy and communication overhead effectively. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed policy outperforms the considered baseline policies.}

We propose low-resolution multiuser MIMO receivers where the signals are simultaneously processed by 1-bit ADCs and a comparator network, which can be interpreted as additional virtual channels with binary outputs. We distinguish the proposed comparator networks in fully and partially connected. For such receivers, we develop the low-resolution aware linear minimum mean-squared error (LRA-LMMSE) channel estimator and detector according to the Bussgang theorem. We also develop a robust detector which takes into account the channel state information (CSI) mismatch statistics. By exploiting knowledge of the channel coefficients we devise a mean-square error (MSE) greedy search and a sequential signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) search for optimization of partially connected networks. Numerical results show that a system with extra virtual channels can outperform a system with additional receive antennas, in terms of bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, by employing the proposed channel estimation with its error statistics, we construct a lower bound on the ergodic sum rate for a linear receiver. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional 1-bit MIMO system in terms of BER, MSE and sum rate.}

	abstract = {Placing selected content at the edge of the network close to the users, known as caching, can lower network latency and congestion in the fronthaul link. Unlike most works that assume a fixed or limited variation in file popularities, to better address user requests, we consider a time-varying popularity resulting in hidden-mode Markov decision processes. In fact, each mode captures environmental changes, and we optimize the fetching and dropping (of files) decisions to minimize a long-term network cost in a cloud radio access network. Importantly, the primary fronthaul link is a millimeter (mmWave) link with large capacity supported by a microwave backup link in case of blockage. Since caching decisions are coupled over time and can affect the future, we introduce a dynamic programming approach to solve the caching problem. We approximate the future cost of each cache state in each mode. To reduce the complexity of calculating the future cost, we introduce two approximation approaches and illustrate the accuracy of the approximations under different environmental conditions. Finally, our simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in finding effective caching and fetching decisions to lower the total network cost while dealing with time-varying popularities.}

	abstract = {Edge computing is a commonly used paradigm for providing low-latency computation services by locally deploying computation and storage resources close to the user equipments (UEs). Since the computation resource demand of the offloaded tasks of a UE is naturally a random variable, it is possible that the real-time computation capacity demand of a resource-limited hosting virtual machine (VM) or edge computing server (ECS) is larger than its computation capacity, causing unexpected delay or delay-jitter to the services, which should be avoided if possible, for delay-sensitive applications. We consider an edge computing scenario wherein the transmission links are unmanageable and computation resource demands of VM servers are stochastic. We propose a novel Logistic function-based service reliability probability (SRP) estimation model without specifying the distributions of the resource demands. We study the average SRP maximization problem (ASRPMP) in a VM-based edge computing server (ECS) by jointly optimizing the service quality ratios (SQRs) and the computation resource allocations, and we propose an alternative optimization algorithm (AOA) by decomposing the problem into a resource allocation problem (RAP) and a service quality control problem (SQCP). Based on the derived analytical solutions of the two subproblems, we propose an effective and low-complexity heuristic AOA (HAOA) to solve the ASRPMP. The simulation results obtained from both synthetic Gaussian workload data and PlanetLab trace data demonstrate that, given the same target SQR or computation resource, the proposed method can achieve similar performance compared with the convex AOA (CAOA) method with much higher complexity, and can improve the reliability of the services compared with the baseline weighted allocation method (WAM) in both high and low SRP regimes.}

	abstract = {Developing non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in future wireless networks has been widely recognized to bring advanced communication services to remote and unserved areas. The Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) constellation has emerged as a promising component for NTN to provide seamless and fast global connectivity. However, since natural dynamic features, the mobility management, in particular the handover (HO) between satellites, plays an important role in ensuring a stable and continuous data service for NTN. Motivated by this fact, this paper proposes a HO optimization strategy based on conditional handover (CHO) mechanism to enhance service continuity in LEO-based NTN. A reward function, related to link service time and service capability, is firstly designed to modify the monitoring conditions of target satellite candidates. The optimal target selection algorithm is proposed to obtain the maximum reward for each CHO. Then, a service continuity performance graph (SCG) model is constructed to predict different potential CHO combinations in service duration. On the basis of SCG, the HO sequence supporting a high-quality and stable data service is predictively calculated for each accessing user. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HO optimization scheme can obviously reduce handover rate under different NTN conditions and can better enhance NTN service continuity.}

	abstract = {The design of a compact high-speed and wide field of view (FOV) receiver is challenging due to the presence of two well-known trade-offs. The first one is the area-bandwidth trade-off of photodetectors (PDs) and the second one is the gain-FOV trade-off due to the use of optics. The combined effects of these two trade-offs imply that the achievable data rate of an imaging optical receiver is limited by its FOV, i.e., a rate-FOV trade-off. In this paper, we propose an imaging receiver design in the form of an array of (PD) arrays. To control the area-bandwidth trade-off, small PDs are used in an array of arrays structure instead of a single large PD. Moreover, to achieve a reasonable receiver FOV, we use an array of focusing lenses that focus the light individually on each inner PD array. The proposed array of arrays structure provides an effective method to control both gain-FOV trade-off (via an array of lenses) and area-bandwidth trade-off (via arrays of small PDs). We first derive a tractable analytical model for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an array of PDs that is equipped with a focusing lens assuming maximum ratio combining (MRC). Then, we extend the model to the proposed array of arrays structure and the accuracy of the analytical model is verified based on several Optic Studio-based simulations. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable data rate of the imaging receiver subject to a minimum required FOV. The optimization problem is solved for two commonly used modulation techniques, namely, on-off keying (OOK) and direct current (DC) biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) with variable rate quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Our results show the limits of high speed wide-FOV imaging receivers that can support mobility. For example, it is demonstrated that a data rate of\n∼24\nGbps with a FOV of 15° is achievable using OOK with a total receiver size of 2 cm\n×2\ncm.}

	abstract = {Densely deployed light emitting diodes (LEDs) typically lead to high spatial correlation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. Although precoding can effectively alleviate the spatial correlation issue, most existing precoding algorithms require a dedicated baseband chain for each LED, leading to high energy consumption and hardware complexity when a large number of LEDs are used. In this paper, a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme with sub-connected architecture (SIC-SA) is proposed. In the considered model, each baseband chain is connected to an LED sub-array containing multiple LEDs to reduce the complexity. Since, in this case, SIC-based precoding can only determine the signal of each baseband chain for an LED sub-array, while its target is to mitigate the spatial correlation between individual LEDs, the electrical/optical power of each LED must also be jointly optimized to accomplish the target. This joint SIC-based precoding, power allocation, and direct current offset design problem is formulated as an achievable sum rate maximization problem under dimming control and electrical power constraints. A two-step iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. In the first step, the SIC-based precoding is designed to alleviate the multi-user interference. In the second step, the power allocation of LEDs is optimized by matrix decomposition and convex optimization, and a closed-form solution of DC offset is derived. Furthermore, considering the dynamic scenarios, a SIC-based precoding scheme with dynamic sub-connected architecture (SIC-DSA) is proposed, in which a switch network is used to adaptively adjust the LED sub-array structure based on the channel state information. Simulation results show that the proposed SIC-SA and SIC-DSA respectively achieve 0.1340 bps/Hz/W and 0.1305 bps/Hz/W energy efficiency gains over the zero-forcing precoding scheme with SA, when the signal-to-noise ratio is 30 dB.}

	abstract = {The integrated sensing and communication is emerging as a crucial technology due to reduced hardware costs and broad application scenarios. However, there is a contradiction between ranging and communication in phase-shift light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for the utilization of the subcarrier’s phase. A scheme called phase-shift laser ranging with communication (PLRC) is proposed to enable both ranging and communication using the same transmitted signal in this paper. The message encoded with pseudo-random noise code is modulated into the phase of the subcarrier for laser emission, and thus the received signal carries the data and the phase difference due to the distance. The received signal is subject to correlation, waveform recovery, and phase-shift measurement with the local signal at the LiDAR transceiver, and the distance is derived from the complete phase to avoid range ambiguity. The data is extracted from the spread spectrum signal at the communication receiver. The performance in terms of the measured distance and precision of LiDAR, the bit error rate of communication is obtained for the proposed solution. Meanwhile, the optimized light ratio for ranging and communication is derived. The experimental demonstration is carried out, the range precision is\n3.54×\n10\n−3\nm, and the communication capability meets 1.43 Mbit/s.}

	abstract = {Variable-rate coding schemes that support a variety of different rates while maintaining the same fundamental encoder/decoder architectures are of great interest in practical communication systems. Similar error-correcting code schemes are also in demand in quantum settings. However, generally, it is difficult to introduce the variable-rate coding schemes into the quantum coding domain attributed to two challenges: Obtaining new quantum codes from old ones systematically and sharing encoder-decoder components among the newly obtained quantum codes. In this correspondence, a multiple-rate coding scheme is introduced into the quantum coding domain, we achieve this goal by providing a systematic method to construct new non-homogeneous quantum LDPC codes of CSS type from an old one (named as the mother code) whose classical parity-check matrix (PCM) is row-circulant. The basic idea is to split rows of the highest-rate stabilizer elaborately to produce the stabilizer for lower rates, which ensures that the generated code family owns the same code length. More importantly, thanks to the nested stabilizer structures possessed by the resulting quantum codes, our method also enables a scalable stabilizer circuit to be shared among them.}

To achieve the passive beamforming gain of IRS, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential but practically challenging since its massive passive reflecting elements have no transmitting/receiving capability. This paper presents a new channel estimation problem formulation for IRS-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where the channel sparsity is exploited in the time-domain. Considering the surfaces are physically close to each other, we further utilize the common sparsity among the different sub-surfaces and automatically cluster them into several groups by introducing a Dirichlet process (DP)-based clustering model. Then, a DP-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework is proposed to jointly estimate the channel and cluster the sub-surfaces, which is expected to significantly improve the channel estimation performance. Moreover, a novel decoupling trick is combined into the VBI framework to efficiently handle the coupling effect brought by the reflection coefficients, as well as facilitate the Bayesian inference. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and show its significant performance improvement over various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes two novel schemes of wideband compressive spectrum sensing (CSS) via block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm, for achieving high sensing accuracy in real time. These schemes aim to reliably recover the spectrum by adaptively adjusting the number of required measurements without inducing unnecessary sampling redundancy. To this end, the minimum number of required measurements for successful recovery is first derived in terms of its probabilistic lower bound. Then, a CSS scheme is proposed by tightening the derived lower bound, where the key is the design of a nonlinear exponential indicator through a general-purpose sampling-controlled algorithm (SCA). In particular, a sampling-controlled BOMP (SC-BOMP) is developed through a holistic integration of the existing BOMP and the proposed SCA. For fast implementation, a modified version of SC-BOMP is further developed by exploring the block orthogonality in the form of sub-coherence of measurement matrices, which allows more compressive sampling in terms of smaller lower bound of the number of measurements. Such a fast SC-BOMP scheme achieves a desired tradeoff between the complexity and the performance. Simulations demonstrate that the two SC-BOMP schemes outperform the other benchmark algorithms.}

Despite their many advantages, FA-enabled communications have limitations as they require an enormous amount of spectral resources in order to select the most desirable position of the radiating element from a large number of prescribed locations. In this paper, we present an analytical framework for the outage performance of large-scale FA-enabled communications, where all user equipments (UEs) employ circular multi-FA array. In contrast to existing studies, which assume perfect channel state information, the developed framework accurately captures the channel estimation errors on the performance of the considered network deployments. In particular, we focus on the limited coherence interval scenario, where a novel sequential linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation method is performed for only a very small number of FA ports. Next, for the communication of each BS with its associated UE, a low-complexity port-selection technique is employed, where the port that provides the highest signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is selected among the ports that are estimated to provide the strongest channel from each FA. By using stochastic geometry tools, we derive both analytical and closed-form expressions for the outage probability, highlighting the impact of channel estimation on the performance of FA-based UEs. Our results reveal the trade-off imposed between improving the network’s performance and reducing the channel estimation quality, indicating new insights for the design of FA-enabled communications.}

We study power control in both the downlink and the uplink when partial zero-forcing (PZF) transmit/receive beamforming and maximum ratio transmission/combining are utilized. We consider optimization problems where the objective is to maximize either the users’ sum URLLC rate or the minimum user’s URLLC rate. The URLLC rate function is both complicated and nonconvex rendering the considered optimization problems nonconvex. Thus, we propose two approximations for the complicated URLLC rate function and employ successive convex optimization (SCO) to tackle the considered optimization problems. Specifically, we propose the SCO with iterative concave lower bound approximation (SCO-ICBA) and the SCO with iterative interference approximation (SCO-IIA). We provide extensive simulations to evaluate SCO-ICBA and SCO-IIA and compare UC CFmMIMO deployment with traditional colocated massive MIMO (COmMIMO) systems. The obtained results reveal that employing the SCO-IIA scheme to optimize the minimum user’s rate for CFmMIMO with MRT in the downlink, and PZF reception in the uplink can provide the best corresponding URLLC rate performances.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), low earth orbit (LEO) satellite IoT is expected to provide low power, massive connectivity and wide coverage IoT applications. In this context, this paper provides a massive grant-free random access (GF-RA) scheme for LEO satellite IoT. This scheme does not need to change the transceiver, but transforms the received signal to a tensor decomposition form. By exploiting the characteristics of the tensor structure, a Bayesian learning algorithm for joint active device detection and channel estimation during massive GF-RA is designed. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm has fast convergence and low complexity. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm its better performance in terms of error probability for active device detection and normalized mean square error for channel estimation over baseline algorithms in LEO satellite IoT. Especially, it is found that the proposed algorithm requires short preamble sequences and support massive connectivity with a low power, which is appealing to LEO satellite IoT.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to provide line-of-sight (LOS) links for blocked paths, especially in millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks. However, in practice, it is difficult for IRSs to arbitrarily adjust the reflection angle to align served users. A promising solution is to deploy distributed IRSs to increase the probability that the users lie in the reflection directions. This paper develops a stochastic geometry-based approach for studying the coverage enhancement in mmWave cellular networks via distributed IRSs. Specifically, the locations of IRSs are modeled through a binomial point process centered at a base station, and the reflection beam of each IRS is pointed to a certain direction. Considering the difference between LOS and non-LOS mmWave transmissions, we propose a received signal strength indicator based association strategy to guarantee that the users receive the strongest average power. After characterizing the association probabilities and distance distributions, we derive the coverage probability for an arbitrary user and perform simplifications for enhancing the computation efficiency. The results are validated by simulations and reveal that distributed deployment of IRSs can achieve a better coverage probability than that of the centralized deployment, which validates the feasibility of enhancing system performance through distributed IRSs.}

	abstract = {Data collection in massive Internet of Things networks requires novel and flexible methods. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are foreseen as a means to collect data rapidly even in remote areas without static telecommunication infrastructure. In this direction, UAV-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) aid in reducing the hardware requirements and signal processing complexity at the UAV side, while increasing the network’s energy efficiency and coverage. Hence, in this paper, we propose the utilization of a UAV-mounted RIS for data collection and study the coverage probability in such networks. Additionally, we propose a novel medium access control protocol based on slotted ALOHA and Code Combining to handle the communication of multiple sensors. To account for the crucial energy issue in UAVs, we devise an energy model that considers both the UAV and the RIS weight, as well as the environmental conditions and the UAV’s velocity. Finally, we characterize the performance of the proposed data collection scheme by analyzing the average throughput and the average collected data per flight, while providing useful insights for the design of such networks.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is regarded as a promising technology in achieving high capacity and massive connectivity. In this paper, the reliable transmission scheme of downlink NOMA systems is investigated. In particular, we divide the disc covered by the base station into several annular areas, where the receivers are randomly located following a uniform distribution. In this way, NOMA pairing is performed by randomly selecting receivers from two different areas. Firstly, we derive the closed-form expressions of bit error rate (BER) with quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, where the channel is modeled as small-scale Rayleigh fading and large-scale path loss. To achieve reliable communications, then, the BER performance of the receiver with the worst channel gain in each area is studied. Finally, an optimal power allocation algorithm is proposed, which obtains the minimum transmission power and optimal power allocation factor with a given BER constraint of all receivers. Extensive simulations demonstrate the accuracy of obtained BER expressions and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. These results provide valuable insight into realizing on reliable transmission of NOMA with randomly deployed receivers.}

	abstract = {Mounting compact and lightweight base stations on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a cost-effective and flexible solution to provide seamless coverage on the existing terrestrial networks. While the coverage probability in UAV-assisted cellular networks has been widely investigated, it provides only the first-order statistic of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In this paper, to analyze high-order statistics of SINR and characterize the disparity among individual links, we provide a meta distribution (MD)-based analytical framework for UAV-assisted cellular networks, in which the probabilistic line-of-sight channel and realistic antenna pattern are taken into account for air-to-ground transmissions. To accurately characterize the interference from UAVs, we relax the widely applied uniform off-boresight angle (OBA) assumption and derive the exact distribution of OBA. Using stochastic geometry, for both steerable and vertical antenna scenarios, we obtain mathematical expressions for the moments of condition success probability, the SINR MD, and the mean local delay. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior of the moments as network density approaches infinity. Numerical results validate the tightness of the theoretical results and show that the uniform OBA assumption underestimates the network performance, especially in the regime of moderate altitude of UAV. We also show that when UAVs are equipped with steerable antennas, the network coverage and user fairness can be optimized simultaneously by carefully adjusting the UAV parameters.}

However, bandwidth limited and congested sub-6GHz bands are incapable of fulfilling this coexistence. In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wideband terahertz (THz) communication system to this end. In specific, we formulate a resource management problem, aiming at jointly optimizing the reflection coefficient of the RIS elements and the transmit power of the base station, as well as the wideband THz resource block allocation. To solve this problem, we adopt a supervised learning approach relying on optimization, deep learning and ensemble learning methods. Simulation results show that for an RIS of size\n11×11\n, up to 49% spectral efficiency gain is achieved for the eMBB service compared to the counterparts, while ensuring the reliability and latency requirements of the URLLC service. Further, the ensemble learning model can perform real-time resource management at the expense of up to 1% performance loss, compared to the optimization approach.}

	abstract = {For mission-critical massive machine-type communications (mMTC) applications, the messages are required to be delivered in real-time. However, due to the weak security protection capabilities of the low-cost and low-complexity machine-type devices, active jamming attack in the uplink access is a serious threat. Uplink access jamming (UAJ) can increase the number of dropped/retransmitted packets and restrict or prevent the normal device access. To tackle this vital and challenging problem, we propose a novel UAJ detection method based on the joint space-time sparsity (JSTS). Our key insight is that the JSTS-based feature will be significantly impacted if UAJ happens, since only a small fraction of the devices are active and the traffic pattern for each device is sporadic in the normal state. Unlike the existing detection methods under batch mode (i.e., all sample observations are collected before making a decision), the JSTS-based detection is performed in a sequential manner by processing the received signals one by one, which can detect UAJ as quickly as possible. Moreover, the proposed JSTS-based method does not rely on the prior knowledge of the attackers, since it only cares the abrupt change in the JSTS-based feature on each frame. Numerical results evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of our method.}

Inspired by the turbo processing principle, we incorporate the fundamentals of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) into the proposed receiver design. The resulting system is called bit-interleaved coded energy-based modulation with iterative decoding (BICEM-ID) and its error performance is analytically studied. Specifically, we derive upper bounds on the average pairwise error probability (PEP) of the non-coherent BICEM-ID system in the feedback-free (FF) and error-free feedback (EFF) scenarios. It is revealed that the definition of the nearest neighbors, which is important in the performance analysis in the FF scenario, is very different from that in the coherent BICM-ID counterpart. The analysis also reveals how the mapping from coded bits to energy levels influences the diversity order and coding gain of the BICEM-ID systems. A design criterion for good mappings is then formulated, and an algorithm is proposed to find a set of best mappings for BICEM-ID. Finally, simulation results corroborate the main analytical findings.}

Firstly, we present a syndrome channel model and derive the lower and upper bounds on its capacity (referred to as accessible capacity), indicating the feasibility of the reliable transmission of extra bits. Secondly, we present the performance evaluation on both the word error rate (WER) and the bit error rate (BER) for the free-ride codes with simple lower and upper bounds. Then we propose three applications of free-ride coding to construct coupled LDPC codes, including implicit globally-coupled LDPC (GC-LDPC) codes, partial product-LDPC codes, and terminated spatially-coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes, all of which have the figure of merits that they share the same code rates with the basic component LDPC codes. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed GC-LDPC codes can outperform the component LDPC codes, yielding a coding gain of up to 0.8 dB; 2) the proposed product codes with\n(3,6)\n-regular LDPC component codes of length 1024 can lower the WER from\n10\n−2\ndown to\n10\n−6\nat the SNR around 2 dB; 3) the proposed terminated SC-LDPC codes can perform as well as the conventional terminated SC-LDPC codes but without any rate loss.}

CRC-TCM-PAS produces practical codes for short block lengths on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In the transmitter, equally likely message bits are encoded by a distribution matcher (DM) generating amplitude symbols with a desired distribution. A CRC is appended to the sequence of amplitude symbols, and this sequence is then encoded and modulated by TCM to produce real-valued channel input signals. This paper proves that the sign values produced by the TCM are asymptotically equally likely to be positive or negative. The CRC-TCM-PAS scheme can thus generate channel input symbols with a symmetric capacity-approaching probability mass function. The paper provides an analytical upper bound on the frame error rate of the CRC-TCM-PAS system over the AWGN channel. This FER upper bound is the objective function used for jointly optimizing the CRC and convolutional code. Additionally, this paper proposes a multi-composition DM, which is a collection of multiple constant-composition DMs. The optimized CRC-TCM-PAS systems achieve frame error rates below the random coding union (RCU) bound in AWGN and outperform the short-blocklength PAS systems with various other forward error correction codes studied in Coşkun et al.

While the binary UPA modulation achieves a power gain, it also results in unequal error protection on the coded bits in systematic codewords during transmission. For irregular codes, it is possible to best protect the information bits by optimizing the classification of variable nodes (VNs). Those VNs represent the coded bits in protograph that allows exploiting jointly the degree irregularity and the power differentiation. An algorithm for UPA-based protograph extrinsic information transfer (UPA-PEXIT) analysis on the Rayleigh channel is proposed with the concept of surrogate channel which circumvents the channel asymmetry problem with UPA. With the RJA code as example, it is shown that classification optimization does improve the decoding threshold when the source entropy is small. To design optimal codes, a UPA-based differential evolution (UPA-DE) algorithm is proposed in conjunction with the UPA-PEXIT analysis. A family of optimized codes are illustrated for three typical nonuniform source distributions and compared with the RJA and NND codes by simulations in error rate performance.}

In this paper, a new structured design of the DP-LDPC code pair is proposed based on Graph theory to reduce the searching complexity, namely mesh model-based merging (M3) method. Firstly, four basic mesh models are designed to merge the protographs at any dimension. According to the different structures of the source and channel codes, the merging boundary constraint is statistically established to limit the using number of basic models. Then, a prior sorting algorithm is proposed to arrange the selection priorities of basic models for source and channel codes, respectively, which greatly refines the merging accuracy. Since most of the degrees are symmetric and predetermined in the merged protographs, the searching complexity is significantly reduced when the merged protographs are used as the initial input. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the merging DP-LDPC code pairs show better performances compared to the existing code pairs. Furthermore, the proposed M3 method is hardware-friendly in Internet of Things because of its simple structure.}

	abstract = {The performance of over-the-air computation (AirComp) systems degrades due to the hostile channel conditions of wireless devices (WDs), which can be significantly improved by the employment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, the conventional RISs require that the WDs have to be located in the half-plane of the reflection space, which restricts their potential benefits. To address this issue, the novel family of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) is considered in AirComp systems to improve the computation accuracy across a wide coverage area. To minimize the computation mean-squared-error (MSE) in STAR-RIS assisted AirComp systems, we propose a joint beamforming design for optimizing both the transmit power at the WDs, as well as the passive reflect and transmit beamforming matrices at the STAR-RIS, and the receive beamforming vector at the fusion center (FC). Specifically, in the updates of the passive reflect and transmit beamforming matrices, closed-form solutions are derived by introducing an auxiliary variable and exploiting the coupled binary phase-shift conditions. Moreover, by assuming that the number of antennas at the FC and that of elements at the STAR-RIS/RIS are sufficiently high, we theoretically prove that the STAR-RIS assisted AirComp systems provide higher computation accuracy than the conventional RIS assisted systems. Our numerical results show that the proposed beamforming design outperforms the benchmark schemes relying on random phase-shift constraints and the deployment of conventional RIS. Moreover, its performance is close to the lower bound achieved by the beamforming design based on the STAR-RIS dispensing with coupled phase-shift constraints.}

	abstract = {To improve both sensing and communication performances, this paper proposes a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission design for a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system. In the proposed CoMP-DFRC system, the central processor (CP) coordinates multiple base stations (BSs) to transmit both the communication signal and the dedicated probing signal. The communication performance and the sensing performance are both evaluated by the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Given the limited backhaul capacity, we study the waveform and clustering design from both the radar-centric perspective and the communication-centric perspective. Dinkelbach’s transform is adopted to handle the single-ratio fractional objective for the radar-centric problem. For the communication-centric problem, we adopt quadratic transform to convexitify the multi-ratio fractional objective. Then, the rank-one constraint of communication beamforming vector is relaxed by semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and the tightness of SDR is further proved to guarantee the optimal waveform design with fixed clustering. For dynamic clustering, equivalent continuous functions are used to represent the non-continuous clustering variables. Successive convex approximation (SCA) is further utilized to convexitify the equivalent functions. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of all proposed designs.}

This paper proposes a doubly-iterative sparsified minimum mean square error (DI-S-MMSE) turbo equalizer, which iteratively exchanges the extrinsic information between a soft-input-soft-input (SISO) MMSE estimator and a SISO decoder. Our proposed equalizer does not suffer from short loops and approaches the performance of the near-optimal symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. To exploit the inherent sparsity of OTFS system, we resort to graph theory to investigate the sparsity pattern of the channel matrix, and propose two sparsification guidelines to reduce the complexity of calculating the matrix inverse at the MMSE estimator. Then, we apply two iterative algorithms to MMSE estimation, i.e., the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) and Factorized Sparse Approximate Inverse (FSPAI) algorithms. The former is used at the initial turbo iteration, whose global convergence is proven in our equalizer, while the latter is used at the subsequent turbo iterations with the help of our proposed guidelines. Simulation results demonstrate that our equalizer can achieve a good bit-error-rate (BER) performance regardless of the fractional Doppler, and only has a linear order of complexity.}

	abstract = {Golay complementary pairs (GCPs) and complete complementary codes (CCCs) have found a wide range of practical applications in coding, signal processing and wireless communication due to their ideal correlation properties. The binary CCCs have special advantages in spread spectrum communication for their simple modulo-2 arithmetic operation, modulation, and correlation simplicity; however, they are limited in length. In this paper, we present a direct construction of GCPs, mutually orthogonal Golay complementary sets (MOGCSs) and q\n-ary, including binary CCCs of non-power of two lengths to widen their application in the recent communication field. First, a generalised Boolean function (GBF) based truncation technique is used to construct GCPs of non-power of two lengths which has never been reported before. Then Golay complementary sets (GCSs) and MOGCSs of lengths of the form 2^{m-1}+2^{m-3}\n( m \\geq 5\n) and 2^{m-1}+2^{m-2}+2^{m-4}\n( m \\geq 6\n) are generated by higher order GBFs. The later length of MOGCSs with direct construction is not available in the literature. Finally, q\n-ary sequences including binary CCCs with non-power of two lengths are constructed using the union of MOGCSs. There is no such direct construction of binary CCC of non-power of two lengths available in the literature. The column sequence peak to mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) have been investigated for GCSs and CCCs respectively, and compared with existing works. The column sequence PMEPR of resultant CCCs is effectively upper bounded by 2, which is much lower than that of paraunitary based CCC construction. The proposed construction is also compared with existing works.}

However, the excessive overhead during data exchange still remains an open challenge, especially for large-scale data processing tasks. This paper considers a master-aided distributed computing system with multiple edge computing nodes and a master node, where the master node helps edge nodes compute output functions. We propose a coded scheme to reduce the communication latency by exploiting computation and communication capabilities of all nodes and creating coded multicast opportunities. More importantly, we prove that the proposed scheme is always optimal, i.e., achieving the minimum communication latency, for arbitrary computing and storage abilities at the master. This extends the previous optimality results in the extreme cases (either the master could compute all input files or compute nothing) to the general case. Finally, numerical results and TeraSort experiments demonstrate that our schemes can greatly reduce the communication latency compared with the existing schemes.}

Both transmit and receive cases are considered. In general, resonant antennas handle different data rates on receive than transmit because receive antennas filter out some of the external noise, but they also add their own loss related noise. It is also shown how adding loss, an impedance mismatch, or a matching network can increase the channel capacity by widening the resonant bandwidth at the expense of a reduced signal strength. A baseband simulation of communication between a narrowband transmitter and wideband receiver employing single-carrier quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is developed. The simulated data rates closely approach the derived theoretical limit. Finally, the simulation is experimentally validated by transmitting a quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) modulated signal through a single-resonant narrowband filter.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising candidate aiming to enhance the system performance in the fifth generation of wireless communication. However, most existing studies on the resource allocation of NOMA systems only consider the short-term performance improvement but ignore the problems caused by the imperfect time-varying channels and the dynamic traffic arrivals, which will result in unsuccessful transmission issues. Different from the existing approaches, we propose a long-term cross-layer resource allocation model with dynamic traffic arrivals and limited channel information. With the low-overhead one-bit feedback, the optimal decoding order, user scheduling, and power allocation are analyzed. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization framework to minimize long-term power consumption. By applying the Lyapunov optimization framework, the problem can be transformed into a joint traffic rate control and mixed-integer programming resource allocation problem. This NP-hard problem is difficult to be solved directly. Therefore, we devise an efficient sub-optimal algorithm with the dynamic penalty factor. In our theoretical analysis, we prove that the delay-power tradeoff can be achieved by tuning a control parameter. The simulation results confirm that our proposed algorithms can efficiently reduce the power consumption compared with the baseline algorithms while satisfying the QoS requirements.}

In particular, a three-party communication system is considered, where a transmitter aims simultaneously conveying information to an information receiver and delivering energy to an energy harvesting receiver. For the special case of static PP constraints, we study the information-energy capacity region and the associated input distribution under: a) average-power and PP constraints at the transmitter, b) an HPA nonlinearity at the transmitter, and c) nonlinearity of the energy harvesting circuit at the energy receiver. By extending Smith’s mathematical framework, we show that the optimal input distribution under those constraints is discrete with a finite number of mass points. We show that HPA significantly reduces the information energy capacity region. In addition, we derive a closed-form expression of the capacity-achieving distribution for the low PP regime, where there is no trade-off between information and energy transfer. For the case with time-varying PP constraints, we characterize the optimal input distribution of this channel by using Shannon’s coding scheme. Specifically, we numerically study a particular scenario for the time-varing PP constraints, where the PP constraint probabilistically is either zero or equal to a non-zero constant.}

	abstract = {Goal-oriented semantic communication will be a pillar of next-generation wireless networks. Despite significant recent efforts in this area, most prior works are focused on specific data types (e.g., image or audio), and they ignore the goal and effectiveness aspects of semantic transmissions. In contrast, in this paper, a holistic goal-oriented semantic communication framework is proposed to enable a speaker and a listener to cooperatively execute a set of sequential tasks in a dynamic environment. A common language based on a hierarchical belief set is proposed to enable semantic communications between speaker and listener. The speaker, acting as an observer of the environment, utilizes the beliefs to transmit an initial description of its observation (called event) to the listener. The listener is then able to infer on the transmitted description and complete it by adding related beliefs to the transmitted beliefs of the speaker. As such, the listener reconstructs the observed event based on the completed description, and it then takes appropriate action in the environment based on the reconstructed event. An optimization problem is defined to determine the perfect and abstract description of the events while minimizing the various communication costs with constraints on the task execution time and belief efficiency. Then, a novel bottom-up curriculum learning (CL) framework based on reinforcement learning is proposed to solve the optimization problem and enable the speaker and listener to gradually identify the structure of the belief set and the perfect and abstract description of the events. Simulation results show that the proposed CL method outperforms classical RL and CL without inference scheme in terms of convergence time, task execution cost and time, reliability, and belief efficiency.}

In this paper, we propose a framework of integrating the Shannon formula with DNNs, and derive a data rate-based DNN (DRNN), for learning resource allocation by taking power allocation as an example. The DRNN is with an iterative structure with multiple update layers, each consisting of a pre-determined model function, an update network, and a dimension reduction network. To justify the iterative structure, we prove the existence of an iteration function that converges to the optimal policy for the update layer to learn. To justify the structure of each update layer, we provide the conditions for the iteration function to be a composite function of the model function. We further incorporate permutation equivariance properties into the DRNN. Simulation results show that the numbers of training samples and free parameters, and the training time to achieve a desired system performance can be reduced remarkably by harnessing the data rate model and PE prior.}

Our approach consists in decoupling the reliability and secrecy constraints in our code design. Specifically, we handle the reliability constraint via an autoencoder, and handle the secrecy constraint with hash functions. For blocklengths smaller than or equal to 128, we evaluate through simulations the probability of error at the legitimate receiver and the leakage at the eavesdropper for our code construction. This leakage is defined as the mutual information between the confidential message and the eavesdropper’s channel observations, and is empirically measured via a neural network-based mutual information estimator. Our simulation results provide examples of codes with positive secrecy rates that outperform the best known achievable secrecy rates obtained non-constructively for the Gaussian wiretap channel. Additionally, we show that our code design is suitable for the compound and arbitrarily varying Gaussian wiretap channels, for which the channel statistics are not perfectly known but only known to belong to a pre-specified uncertainty set. These models not only capture uncertainty related to channel statistics estimation, but also scenarios where the eavesdropper jams the legitimate transmission or influences its own channel statistics by changing its location.}

However, the dynamic resource configuration in GF-NOMA systems is challenging due to random traffics and collisions, that are unknown at the base station (BS). Meanwhile, joint consideration of the latency and reliability requirements makes the resource configuration of GF-NOMA for mURLLC more complex. To address this problem, we develop a novel learning framework for signature-based GF-NOMA in mURLLC service taking into account the multiple access signature collision, the UE detection, as well as the data decoding procedures for the K-repetition GF and the Proactive GF schemes. The goal of our learning framework is to maximize the long-term average number of successfully served users (UEs) under the latency constraint. We first perform a real-time repetition value configuration based on a double deep Q-Network (DDQN) and then propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent learning technique based DQN (CMA-DQN) to optimize the configuration of both the repetition values and the contention-transmission unit (CTU) numbers. Our results show the superior performance of CMA-DQN over the conventional load estimation-based uplink resource configuration approach (LE-URC) in heavy traffic and demonstrate its capability in dynamically configuring in long term for mURLLC service. In addition, with our learning optimization, the Proactive scheme always outperforms the K-repetition scheme in terms of the number of successfully served UEs, especially under the high backlog traffic scenario.}

Channel estimation is an essential task in realizing the RIS-aided communication system. A RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system involves cascaded channels with high dimensions and sophisticated statistics. Thus, implementing the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) with the integration computation is infeasible in practice. To accurately estimate channels with high accuracy in a RIS-aided multi-user MIMO-OFDM system, we model the channel state information (CSI) estimation as an image super-resolution (SR) problem to recover and denoise the channel matrix. Particularly, a convolutional neural network based on a super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), named SRDnNet, is then proposed. By taking estimated channels at pilot positions as a low-resolution image, the enhanced SRCNN can fully exploit the features of inputs to learn a suitable interpolation method and generate the coarse estimation of the channel matrix. The denoising model DnCNN with an element-wise subtraction structure can exploit features of the additive noise and recover channel coefficients from the coarse channel matrix.

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry, providing multi-gigabits per second rates due to the substantial bandwidth. Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is an effective technology that provides a generalized multiple access framework. Regarding the new propagation characteristics of the mmWave, we investigate the outage performance of the mmWave RSMA multiple-input-single-output system with a fixed-located user and a randomly-located user. Based on the spatial correlation of the paired users, the user’s paths are divided into overlapped and non-overlapped paths. Two beamforming schemes are proposed to improve the reliability of the mmWave RSMA system. The common stream is transmitted on the overlapped paths or all the paths. By utilizing stochastic geometry theory, the closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) with proposed schemes are derived. To obtain more insights, the expressions for the asymptotic OP are derived. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to validate the analysis and the effects of the system parameters, such as power allocation coefficients and the number of resolvable paths, on the outage performance are investigated.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the joint beamforming design for access and fronthaul links in a user-centric network with full-duplex fronthaul. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the network energy efficiency while guaranteeing fronthaul rate requirements. Particularly, the power consumed by self-interference cancellation at full-duplex access points (APs) is taken into consideration to comprehensively reflect the effect of full-duplex technology. Due to the non-convexity and the nonlinear fractional form of the formulated problem, we resort to the successive convex approximation method. The original problem is approximated as a convex second-order cone program. We then extend the study to the scenario of imperfect and partial channel state information (CSI). To avoid the intractable expression of the achievable rate in this case, we derive its lower bound for further beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy efficiency and power consumption under both CSI scenarios. For our considered full-duplex fronthaul networks, moderate maximum transmit power of macro base station (MBS) and APs is sufficient to obtain desired energy efficiency performance. Moreover, the lower bound is verified to be tight at the low-maximum power region.}

	abstract = {The three-dimensional deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has attracted extensive attention, especially for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in an emergency or to help the overloaded edge servers in traffic peaks. However, most existing works assume a two-dimensional road to simplify the design and modeling, while ignoring the interchange bridges scenario. In this scenario, UAVs deployment will face new challenges: the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission between the vehicles and UAVs is weakened due to the occlusion of the bridge body and vehicle movement. Meanwhile, energy consumption and the quantity of UAVs also need to be considered. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware 3D-deployment of UAVs, named 3D-UAV, to guarantee a high uplink rate with a minimized number of UAVs in IoV with Highway Interchange. First, considering the channel gain over bridges, 3D-UAV divides vehicles into several clusters. In each time slot, the number of clusters is iteratively optimized. Based on the clustering result, the flight altitude of the UAV is optimized in a stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) way aiming at maximizing the average uplink rate of transmission. Numerical results show that the proposed 3D-UAV can cover all vehicles on the highway interchange with the number of UAVs close to the theoretical lower bound. Meanwhile, it outperforms SOA, DRL, and HOLD methods in terms of the uplink rate and energy.}

	abstract = {The software-defined network (SDN) enabled mobile edge network greatly facilitates network resource management and promotes many emerging applications. However, user mobility may cause the SDN controller to set flow rules frequently, introduce additional flow setup latency, cause delay jitter, and undermine latency-sensitive services. Proactive flow setup is an effective way to eliminate flow setup latency, but existing work fails to maximize the flow setup hit ratio, a metric for evaluating the quality of proactive flow setup decisions, which is critical for latency-sensitive services. In this paper, we study how to proactively set flow rules to maximize the flow setup hit ratio under limited available network resources to eliminate the flow setup latency as much as possible. Then, we formalize the proactive flow setup problem as two integer linear programming problems under two typical routing strategies, default routing and dynamic routing. Both problems are proved to be NP-hard. To tackle these two problems, we propose a linear programming-based polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the default routing case and a greedy-based heuristic algorithm for the dynamic routing case. Extensive trace-driven experimental and simulation results verify that our algorithms can improve the flow setup hit ratio by up to 30.99% compared to existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Secure precoding superimposed with artificial noise (AN) is a promising transmission technique to improve security by harnessing the superposition nature of the wireless medium. However, finding a jointly optimal precoding and AN structure is very challenging in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channels with multiple eavesdroppers. The major challenge in maximizing the secrecy rate arises from the non-convexity and non-smoothness of the rate function. Traditionally, an alternating optimization framework that identifies beamforming vectors and AN covariance matrix has been adopted; yet this alternating approach has limitations in maximizing the secrecy rate. In this paper, we put forth a novel secure precoding algorithm that jointly and simultaneously optimizes the beams and AN covariance matrix for maximizing the secrecy rate when a transmitter has either perfect or partial channel knowledge of eavesdroppers. To this end, we first establish an approximate secrecy rate in a smooth function. Then, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the form of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP). We present a computationally efficient algorithm to identify the principal eigenvector of the NEP as a suboptimal solution for secure precoding. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods improve secrecy rate significantly compared to the existing methods.}

We assume that the stragglers’ computation results can be leveraged at the master by assigning multiple sub-tasks to the workers. We propose a new coded computation scheme, namely Chebyshev coded fully private matrix multiplication (CFP), to preserve the privacy of a master in a scenario where a master wants to obtain a matrix multiplication result from the libraries which are shared by the workers, while concealing both of the two indices of the desired matrices from each worker. The key idea of CFP is to introduce Chebyshev polynomials, which have commutative property, in queries sent to workers to allocate sub-tasks. We also extend CFP to keep the privacy of a master from colluding workers. In conclusion, we show that CFP can preserve the privacy of a master from each worker and efficiently mitigate straggler effects compared to existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an important role in wireless communication systems, due to the additional degree of freedom realized from its flexible deployment. Driven by this advantage and considering the security issue, this paper aims to investigate UAV-enabled proactive eavesdropping over distributed transmit beamforming-based suspicious communications. Specifically, for the suspicious system, there are multiple suspicious clusters aiming to communicate with the suspicious destination (D) using mutually orthogonal frequency bands, and distributed transmit beamforming is exploited by each cluster to strengthen the signal receiving quality at D. For the legitimate party, the full-duplex UAV exploits one antenna to jam D and uses the other antenna to overhear the signals of the suspicious clusters concurrently. By resorting to the Laguerre series approximation and the central limit theorem, we first characterize, in closed form, the approximated distributions of the receiving signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) at D and the UAV, which are shown to be very tight. Based on this analysis and considering that the suspicious system works in the delay-limited transmission mode or the delay-sensitive transmission mode, we aim to maximize the minimum eavesdropping success probability of the UAV for those suspicious communications links, by jointly adjusting the UAV’s deployment and jamming power allocations over different frequency bands. The problem is highly non-convex. To tackle this, we develop an alternative optimization framework and further a novel and low-complexity solution in the high SNR regime to the optimization problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes compared to competitive benchmarks.}

Motivated by the strong need of security links of the next generation communication systems, we study covert communication with millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) hybrid beamforming. Consistent with existing studies on covert communication, we use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the total variation (TV) distance as the covertness measure. Under both covertness measures, for block fading channels, we derive the covert transmission rate with and without artificial noise. These results are obtained by optimizing the transmit power and the jamming power to satisfy the covertness constraints and to maximize the transmission rate. Specifically, when artificial noise is allowed, we show that there exists an optimal jamming power to achieve the covert transmission rate given the transmit signal power. Furthermore, we propose a metric to measure the inherent sparsity of the mmWave massive MIMO channel in the spatial domain, and study its effect on the covertness measures and the corresponding covert transmission rates. Our results provide insights and benchmarks for the design of practical covert communication systems with mmWave massive MIMO.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can potentially combat jamming. It is non-trivial to perform holistic selections of users, data streams, and modulation-coding modes for all subchannels, and RIS configuration in a downlink multiuser OFDMA system under jamming attacks, because of a mixed-integer program nature and difficulties in acquiring the channel state information (CSI) of the channels to and from the RIS and from an uncooperative jammer. We propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach that learns through changes in the data rates of the users to reject jamming and maximize the sum rate. The key idea is to decouple the continuous RIS configuration from the discrete selections of users, data streams, subchannels, and modulation-coding modes. Another critical aspect is that we show the optimal selections almost surely follow a winner-takes-all strategy. Accordingly, the new DRL framework learns the RIS configuration with a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient and takes the winner-takes-all strategy to evaluate the reward, thereby reducing the action space and accelerating learning. Simulations show the framework converges fast and fulfills the benefit of the RIS. With no need for the CSI of the channels to and from the RIS and from the jammer, the framework offers practical value.}

Great performances were achieved by the learned representations. However, this kind of learning models were highly dependent on large amounts of signals with label information. In the realistic scenarios, it is very difficult and costly to collect the modulated signals with label information. Given small training samples, the fitting power of deep models were limited. To solve the problems, a new family of signal augmentation strategies, segment-wise generation and signal-wise generation are proposed. The former builds new signal by tuning a single signal, while the latter combines several different modulated signals together to produce new signal. Four kinds of techniques, segment shift in cyclic, segment correlation in random, pairwise signals combination, and multiple signals concatenation are presented. The aim is to simulate the unforeseen disturbances during signal sampling. The recognition performance under the realistic scenarios can be then improved. Multiple comparative studies were performed. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed strategy in comparisons to the classical methods, as well as the deep learning algorithms.}

	abstract = {The provision of accurate localization is an increasingly important feature of wireless networks. To this end, a reliable distinction between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) radio links is necessary to avoid degenerative localization estimation biases. Interestingly, LOS and NLOS transmissions affect the polarization of the received signals differently. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon to propose a threshold-based LOS/NLOS classifier exploiting weighted differential carrier phase measurements over a single link with different polarization configurations. Operation in either full or limited polarization diversity systems is possible. We develop a framework for assessing the performance of the proposed classifier, and show through simulations the performance impact of the reflecting materials in NLOS scenarios. For instance, the classifier is far more efficient in NLOS scenarios with wooden reflectors than in those with metallic reflectors. Numerical results evince the potential performance gains from exploiting full polarization diversity, properly weighting the differential carrier phase measurements, and using multi-carrier/tone transmissions. Finally, we show that the optimum decision threshold is inversely proportional to the path power gain in dB, while it does not depend significantly on the material of potential NLOS reflectors.}

Relying on partial CSI obtained from training between the selected antennas and the users, at the beginning of each frame, the BS assigns each user to a time slot in the frame and selects a subset of antennas to serve the users scheduled in each time slot. Assuming that the channels evolve according to a Markov process and relying on zero-forcing beamforming, we formulate our JASUS problem using a POMDP framework to devise a real-time decision-making policy that maximizes the expected long-term sum-rate. We rigorously prove that for positively correlated two-state channel models, the myopic policy provides the optimal solution to our POMDP-based JASUS problem for any number of RF chains and for any number of users. Based on this, we model the Rayleigh fading channels as first-order Gauss-Markov processes and devise a low-complexity myopic policy-based JASUS algorithm for massive MU-MIMO systems that only relies on partial CSI.}

	abstract = {As a revolutionary paradigm for controlling wireless channels, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a candidate technology for future 6G networks. However, due to the “multiplicative fading” effect, the existing passive RISs only achieve limited capacity gains in many scenarios with strong direct links. In this paper, the concept of active RISs is proposed to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike passive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals via amplifiers integrated into their elements. To characterize the signal amplification and incorporate the noise introduced by the active components, we develop and verify the signal model of active RISs through the experimental measurements based on a fabricated active RIS element. Based on the verified signal model, we further analyze the asymptotic performance of active RISs to reveal the substantial capacity gain they provide for wireless communications. Finally, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a joint transmit beamforming and reflect precoding scheme is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that, in a typical wireless system, passive RISs can realize only a limited sum-rate gain of 22%, while active RISs can achieve a significant sum-rate gain of 130%, thus overcoming the “multiplicative fading” effect.}

In such system, the source node first harvests and stores radio-frequency energy from the AP in the downlink, then uses the stored energy to transmit information to the AP in the uplink. A simple time-switching scheme for the proposed system is designed. Two different energy management policies at the source node are considered, i.e., best-effort policy (BEP) and on-off policy (OOP). The bit-error-rate (BER) expressions of the proposed system with BEP and OOP are derived over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Results demonstrate that the proposed system is able to achieve better BER performance than the conventional DCSK-WPC system and the RIS aided DCSK-WPC buffer-less system, while keeping the non-coherent feature of the DCSK system.}

	abstract = {In this paper, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) are amalgamated to lower power expenditure, shorten latency and strengthen reliability of the internet of things (IoT) communications. By considering Rician fading channels and multiple RISs, the outage probability of single-input single-output (SISO) HARQ-IR-RIS aided IoT networks is derived in closed-form, with which the asymptotic outage analysis is carried out. The asymptotic results are further extended to single-input multiple-output (SIMO)/multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) HARQ-IR-RIS aided IoT networks by using random matrix theory. Thereafter, the asymptotic expressions are invoked to reduce the design complexity of the phase shifts, transmit powers, and rate, which aims at minimizing the age of information (AoI) while ensuring the power and outage constraints. Particularly, the optimal phase shifts are firstly determined. The alternating optimization technique is then applied to solve the transmit rate and powers, which are iteratively updated based on majorization-minimization (MM) principle and geometric programming (GP) approximation, respectively. The numerical results consequently corroborate our theoretical analysis. More interestingly, the HARQ-IR-aided scheme with fixed power is found to provide a comparable performance as the proposed scheme with variable power especially for numerous reflecting elements at RIS.}

	abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) and edge computing have been validated as effective ways to solve the energy-limited problem and computation-capacity-limited problem of wireless devices (WDs), respectively. This paper studies the wireless-powered multi-access edge computing (WP-MEC) network, where WDs conduct either local computing or task offloading for their individable computation tasks. We aim to minimize total computation delay (TCD) when each WD has a computation task to execute, referred to as the total computation delay minimization (TCDM) problem, by jointly optimizing the offloading-decision, WPT duration, and transmission durations of offloading WDs. The TCDM problem is a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that is challenging to efficiently obtain the optimal or near-optimal solution. To tackle this challenge, we decompose the TCDM problem into the sub-problem of optimizing the WPT duration and transmission durations, and the top-problem of optimizing the offloading decision. For the nonconvex sub-problem, we design a worst-WD-adjusting (WDA) algorithm to efficiently obtain its optimal solution. For the top-problem, under the time-varying channel conditions, traditional optimization methods are hard to determine the optimal or near-optimal offloading decision within the channel coherence duration. To fast obtain the near-optimal offloading decision, we propose a deep neural networks (DNN)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, which takes the sub-problem solving as one component for utility evaluation. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed online DRL-based offloading algorithm achieves the near-minimal TCD with low computational complexity, and is suitable for the fast-fading WP-MEC network.}

	abstract = {This work considers a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which wireless nodes store the energy from an energy access point in their batteries for subsequent data transmission. An online energy consumption optimization strategy is proposed for adaptively determining the beamforming vector, data routing, network operation mode and transmitted power based only on the current state of WPCN. In most existing results, the energy/data transmission of WPCNs is based on the ideal battery models and the energy storage efficiencies therein are always assumed to be non-zero constants. Since the energy storage efficiency of batteries may be affected by the ambient environment or aging in real-time, this work considers a WPCN with a time-varying energy storage efficiencies sequence and correspondingly develops an improved Lyapunov optimization strategy to offset the impact of the time-varying energy storage efficiencies. More importantly, a distributed strategy is proposed to optimize the cooperation of wireless nodes over unrestricted numbers of hops, and thus the energy access point does not require channel state information of all data links and the data backlog queues of all nodes during the solving process. Accordingly, the computational burden at the energy access point is greatly reduced due to the use of this distributed strategy. Under this strategy, the time-averaged expected energy consumption of WPCN can be within a bounded gap of the minimum energy required to maintain stability of the network. Finally, the theoretical analysis is further corroborated by simulation results.}

However, their user and beam selection problem has not been efficiently addressed yet. Inspired by this challenge, we develop low-complexity solutions explicitly. In contrast to the zero forcing in the prior art, we introduce the dirty paper coding (DPC) into the joint user and beam selection problem. We unveil the compelling properties of the DPC sum rate in beamspace massive MIMO, showing its monotonic evolution against the number of users and beams selected. We then exploit its beneficial properties for substantially simplifying the joint user and beam selection problem. Furthermore, we develop a set of algorithms striking unique trade-offs for solving the simplified problem, facilitating simultaneous user and beam selection based on partial beamspace channels for the first time. Additionally, we derive the sum rate bound of the algorithms and analyze their complexity. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and analysis, confirming their superiority over prior solutions.}

We first derive new closed-form expressions to accurately approximate the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the channel gains in MIMO systems under the\nκ\n-\nμ\nshadowed fading. Then, we derive the post-processing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its closed-form PDFs and CDFs in the NGMA system, under both perfect and imperfect channel state information of the\nκ\n-\nμ\nshadowed fading channel. Given the post-processing SNRs and their PDFs, the general expressions are established for the error probability (EP) to analyze the mURLLC of NGMA by applying finite blocklength information theory. Corroborated by extensive simulations, our analysis reveals that with the increasing reliability requirements of the users, the relative gaps in EPs enlarge between users experiencing different fading channels, and the feasible system configurations (i.e., the transmit powers of the users, and the numbers of antennas, active users, and subcarriers) also increasingly differ between the users. The impact of different fading on mURLLC implementations cannot be overlooked, and the research of mURLLC under the\nκ\n-\nμ\nshadowed fading model is indispensable. The NGMA system considered in this paper is capable of achieving mURLLC under non-uniform small-scale and shadow fading.}

It compensates for the Doppler shift brought by high mobility and reduces signal degradation due to train carriages. Specifically, the elements of the TMS panel attached to train windows manipulate the links between the base station (BS) and the onboard users. One fundamental problem with it is: does the channel introduced by TMS outperform the traditional direct channel? To answer this, we compare the gains of direct and cascaded channels and introduce the cascaded-outperform-direct probability (CODP), which is the probability that the latter exceeds the former. We then derive two simplified closed-form CODP expressions by approximating the cascaded channel gain as mixed Gaussian and Gamma distributions. Moreover, BS-related parameters impact the CODP; we show that the CODP has (i) global maximum points concerning the azimuth angle of the path from the BS to the TMS, the distance from the BS to the railway, and the BS height, respectively, and (ii) a minimum point in terms of the azimuth angle of the path from the BS to the TMS. Finally, we provide numerical results to verify our analysis and derivations.}

In particular, the proposed scheme is developed under a non-linear energy-harvesting (EH) model which can accurately characterize the practical situation. The proposed RIS-FM-DCSK-SWIPT scheme has an appealing feature that it does not require channel state information, thus avoiding the complex channel estimation. We further derive the closed-form theoretical expressions for the energy shortage probability and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme over the multipath Rayleigh fading channel. In addition, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the performance of the proposed transmission scheme in two different scenarios, i.e., RIS-assisted access point (RIS-AP) and dual-hop communication (RIS-DH). Finally, we carry out various Monte-Carlo experiments to verify the accuracy of the theoretical derivation, illustrate the performance advantage of the proposed scheme, and give some design insights for future study.}

	abstract = {The new concept of semi-integrated-sensing-and-communication (Semi-ISaC) is proposed for next-generation cellular networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art, where the total bandwidth is used for integrated sensing and communication (ISaC), the proposed Semi-ISaC framework provides more freedom as it allows that a portion of the bandwidth is exclusively used for either wireless communication or radar detection, while the rest is for ISaC transmission. To enhance the bandwidth efficiency (BE), we investigate the evolution of Semi-ISaC networks from orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). First, we evaluate the performance of an OMA-based Semi-ISaC network. As for the communication signals, we investigate both the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate. As for the radar echoes, we characterize the ergodic radar estimation information rate (REIR). Then, we investigate the performance of a NOMA-based Semi-ISaC network, including the OP and the ergodic rate for communication signals and the ergodic REIR for radar echoes. The diversity gains of OP and the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slopes of the ergodic REIR are also evaluated as insights. The analytical results indicate that: 1) Under a two-user NOMA-based Semi-ISaC scenario, the diversity order of the near-user is equal to the coefficient of the Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels (\nm\n), while that of the far-user is zero; and 2) The high-SNR slope for the ergodic REIR is based on the ratio of the radar signal’s duty cycle to the pulse duration. Our simulation results show that: 1) Semi-ISaC has better channel capacity than the conventional ISaC; and 2) The NOMA-based Semi-ISaC has better channel capacity than the OMA-based Semi-ISaC.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel concept for engineered molecular communication (MC) systems inspired by animal olfaction. We focus on a multi-user scenario where several transmitters wish to communicate with a central receiver. We assume that each transmitter employs a unique mixture of different types of signaling molecules to represent its message and the receiver is equipped with an array comprising $R$ different types of receptors in order to detect the emitted molecule mixtures. The design of an MC system based on orthogonal molecule-receptor pairs implies that the hardware complexity of the receiver linearly scales with the number of signaling molecule types $Q$ (i.e., $R=Q$ ). Natural olfaction systems avoid such high complexity by employing arrays of cross-reactive receptors, where each type of molecule activates multiple types of receptors and each type of receptor is predominantly activated by multiple types of molecules albeit with different activation strengths. For instance, the human olfactory system is believed to discriminate several thousands of chemicals using only a few hundred receptor types, i.e., $Q\\gg R$ . Motivated by this observation, we first develop an end-to-end MC channel model that accounts for the key properties of olfaction. Subsequently, we present the proposed transmitter and receiver designs. In particular, given a set of signaling molecules, we develop algorithms that allocate molecules to different transmitters and optimize the mixture alphabet for communication. Moreover, we formulate the molecule mixture recovery as a convex compressive sensing problem which can be efficiently solved via available numerical solvers. Finally, we present a comprehensive set of simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed MC designs revealing interesting insights regarding the design parameters. For instance, we show that mixtures comprising few types of molecules are best suited for communication since they can be more reliably detected by the cross-reactive array than one type of molecule or mixtures of many molecule types.}

	abstract = {Multiple-antenna backscatter is emerging as a promising approach to combat the cascaded backscatter channel fading to offer a high data rate for ambient backscatter communication (AmBC). However, related designs in AmBC fail to provide both diversity and multiplexing gains to backscatter tags. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a unified generalized space-time shift keying (GSTSK)-Backscatter architecture for AmBC to strike a flexible tradeoff between the attainable diversity and multiplexing gains in an efficient but low-complexity manner. Moreover, taking the non-identically distributed characteristics of the backscatter channel into account, we first derive asymptotic BER bounds for both the source and backscatter signals, which are verified by simulation results. Furthermore, we propose a residual- and threshold-based joint error correction mechanism (JECM) and design the near-optimal and low-complexity detector for GSTSK-Backscatter systems. Simulation results validate the analysis and show that our proposed JECM-based detector approaches the optimal detector and balances the BER and complexity performance.}

This algorithm is based on the Grover adaptive search that originally supported HUBO with integer coefficients. Next, as an application example, we formulate multiple-input multiple-output maximum likelihood detection as a HUBO problem with real-valued coefficients, where we use the Gray-coded bit-to-symbol mapping specified in the 5G standard. The proposed approach allows us to construct an efficient quantum circuit for the detection problem and to analyze specific numbers of required qubits and quantum gates, whereas other conventional studies have assumed that such a circuit is feasible as a quantum oracle. To further accelerate the quantum algorithm, we also derive a probability distribution of the objective function value and determine a unique threshold to sample better states. Assuming a future fault-tolerant quantum computing, our proposed algorithm has the potential for significantly reducing query complexity in the classical domain and providing a quadratic speedup in the quantum domain.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm for designing unstructured Grassmannian constellations for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications over Rayleigh block-fading channels. Unlike the majority of existing unitary space-time or Grassmannian constellations, which are typically designed to maximize the minimum distance between codewords, in this work we employ the asymptotic pairwise error probability (PEP) union bound (UB) of the constellation as the design criterion. In addition, the proposed criterion allows the design of MIMO Grassmannian constellations specifically optimized for a given number of receiving antennas. A rigorous derivation of the gradient of the asymptotic UB on a Cartesian product of Grassmann manifolds, is the main technical ingredient of the proposed gradient descent algorithm. A simple modification of the proposed cost function, which weighs each pairwise error term in the UB according to the Hamming distance between the binary labels assigned to the respective codewords, allows us to jointly solve the constellation design and the bit labeling problem. Our simulation results show that the constellations designed with the proposed method outperform other structured and unstructured Grassmannian designs in terms of symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER), for a wide range of scenarios.}

	abstract = {Real-time monitoring plays a pivotal role in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with potential applications in factory automation, automated driving, and telesurgery, thereby attracting considerable recent attention in anticipation of the development of the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks. In this paper, we present a paradigm-shift data compression method that makes use of timing side information (TSI) obtained by observing two synchronized clocks at a remote sensor and a monitor. In particular, the TSI is found to allow the transmitter to send fewer bits consumed in characterizing the changing or holding time of a piecewise-constant stochastic process. We borrow the idea of source coding with side information to reveal the performance limits of both TSI-based lossless and lossy compression, and to develop practical low-complexity source coding schemes. To further reduce the implementation complexity and the hardware cost, we also present a real-time monitoring scheme where the sensor does not necessarily measure the state transition time. A statistical signal processing algorithm is adopted to estimate the changing time accurately. Our theoretical and numerical results show that the compression gain owing to the TSI is quite substantial, especially when the communication latency and the delay jitter are limited.}

In the proposed system, the conventional belief propagation (BP) algorithm is modified to be a concatenated BP-inverse BP (BP-\ni\nBP) for encoding and decoding, where the\ni\nBP is constructed by a fully-connected layer of a neural network. Compared to the existing approximate message passing algorithm, the proposed BP-\ni\nBP realizes a float-to-bit compression with low complexity for arbitrary Gaussian sources. The BP-\ni\nBP is implemented based on the linking relation of the protograph; therefore, it is necessary to optimally design the protograph to obtain better rate-distortion function (RDF) performance. Regarding the coding optimal procedure, a mutual information iteration convergence (MIIC) algorithm is designed as the optimal criterion to determine the source P-LDPC code with minimum distortion. Inspired by the plane construction of quantum stabilizer code, a lattice topological splicing (LTS) algorithm is proposed for regularly building the protograph to reduce the code searching complexity. By using the MIIC and the LTS algorithms, the BP-\ni\nBP based on the designed P-LDPC code maintains good distortion performance close to the RDF limit.}

	abstract = {Traditional channel capacity based on the discrete spatial dimensions mismatches the continuous electromagnetic fields. For the wireless communication system in a limited region, the spatial discretization may results in information loss because the continuous field can not be perfectly recovered from the sampling points. Therefore, electromagnetic information theory based on spatially continuous electromagnetic fields becomes necessary to reveal the fundamental theoretical capacity bound of communication systems. In this paper, we propose analyzing schemes for the performance limit between continuous transceivers. Specifically, we model the communication process between two continuous regions by random fields. Then, for the white noise model, we use Mercer expansion to derive the mutual information between the source and the destination. For the close-form expression, an analytic method is introduced based on autocorrelation functions with rational spectrum. Moreover, the Fredholm determinant is used for the general autocorrelation functions to provide the numerical calculation scheme. Further works extend the white noise model to colored noise and discuss the mutual information under it. Finally, we build an ideal model with infinite-length source and destination which shows a strong correpsondence with the time-domain model in classical information theory. The mutual information and the capacity are derived through the spatial spectral density.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) can provide abundant spectrum resource in vehicular communication networks. Nevertheless, due to the high path-loss and blocking effects in mmWave propagation, and high mobility of vehicles, downlink services for vehicles would be seriously degraded. In this paper, we firstly propose a deep reinforcement learning-based joint beam allocation and relay selection (JoBARS) scheme to mitigate blocking effects and optimize the total transmission rate of the vehicular network, where the mmWave base station (mmBS) provides multi-user services. When downlinks are blocked, the mmBS can select appropriate idle vehicles as relay nodes to enhance service quality from a global perspective. We set the rate punishment restriction in JoBARS scheme to guarantee each vehicle can obtain high-quality service. Besides, a relaying incentive mechanism (RIM) is proposed to avoid vehicles being overly selected for relaying and ensure that relay vehicles have a higher chance of being served in the next round. We demonstrate that JoBARS scheme can effectively enhance the total transmission rate while alleviating transmission outages caused by severe propagation attenuation of mmWave signals. Compared with Greedy Selection scheme, the total rate and average connection probability of vehicles under JoBARS scheme are nearly 17% and 14% higher when blocking effects are severe.}

Compared to other schemes in the literature, which deal with stragglers or device dropouts by ignoring their contribution, the proposed schemes do not suffer from the client drift problem. The first scheme, CodedPaddedFL, mitigates the effect of stragglers while retaining the privacy level of conventional FL. It combines one-time padding for user data privacy with gradient codes to yield straggler resiliency. The second scheme, CodedSecAgg, provides straggler resiliency and robustness against model inversion attacks and is based on Shamir’s secret sharing. We apply CodedPaddedFL and CodedSecAgg to a classification problem. For a scenario with 120 devices, CodedPaddedFL achieves a speed-up factor of 18 for an accuracy of 95% on the MNIST dataset compared to conventional FL. Furthermore, it yields similar performance in terms of latency compared to a recently proposed scheme by Prakash et al. without the shortcoming of additional leakage of private data. CodedSecAgg outperforms the state-of-the-art secure aggregation scheme LightSecAgg by a speed-up factor of 6.6–18.7 for the MNIST dataset for an accuracy of 95%.}

	abstract = {In downlink, a base station (BS) with multiple transmit antennas applies zeroforcing beamforming to transmit to single-antenna mobile users in a cell. We propose the schemes that optimize transmit power and the number of bits for channel direction information (CDI) for all users to achieve the max-min signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) fairness. The optimal allocation can be obtained by a geometric program for both non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). For NOMA, 2 users with highly correlated channels are paired and share the same transmit beamforming. In some small total-CDI rate regimes, we show that NOMA can outperform OMA by as much as 3 dB. The performance gain over OMA increases when the correlation-coefficient threshold for user pairing is set higher. To reduce computational complexity, we propose to allocate transmit power and CDI rate to groups of multiple users instead of individual users. The user grouping scheme is based on K-means over the user SINR. We also propose a progressive filling scheme that performs close to the optimum, but can reduce the computation time by almost 3 orders of magnitude in some numerical examples.}

	abstract = {This work presents a novel nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) cognitive radio (CR) system where the base station (BS) opportunistically multiplexes the secondary user (SU) with the primary user (PU) using power-domain NOMA. As the PU has the priority to transmit and SU is satisfied on best-effort basis, four different transmission-modes (TMs) are produced at the BS, which are PU orthogonal multiple access (PU-OMA), SU-OMA, PU/SU-NOMA, and silent mode. Consequently, the considered protocol can be classified as a hybrid underlay-interweave CR-NOMA. The TM adaptation should be seamless for the PU where its detector configuration remains unchanged regardless of the active TM. In contrast, the SU has to identify the active TM blindly, i.e. without side information, to select the appropriate detector. The identification process is performed using a classifier that is designed based on the maximum likelihood criterion. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed in terms of throughput, packet error rate (PER), and classification error. The Binomial and Multinomial theorems are utilized to simplify and allow a tractable analysis. The derived closed-form expressions, corroborated by Monte-Carlo simulation results, show that the hybrid CR-NOMA can provide substantial throughput improvement over conventional NOMA, which is about a 100%.}

In particular, prior to the implementation of NOMA, it is assumed that there exists a legacy THz system, where spatial beams have already been configured to serve legacy primary users. The aim of this paper is to study how these pre-configured spatial beams can be used as a type of bandwidth resources, on which additional secondary users are served without degrading the performance of the legacy primary users. A joint beam management and power allocation problem is first formulated as a mixed combinatorial non-convex optimization problem, and then solved by two methods with different performance-complexity tradeoffs, one based on the branch and bound method and the other based on successive convex approximation. Both analytical and simulation results are presented to illustrate the new features of beam-based resource allocation in THz-NOMA networks and also demonstrate that those pre-configured spatial beams can be employed to improve the system throughput and connectivity in a spectrally efficient manner.}

	abstract = {The time-reversal division multiple access (TRDMA) system employs multipath channels to realize multi-user transmission via time-reversal filtering. The performance of TRDMA is affected by the correlation among users’ channels. When the correlation is high, inter-user interference (IUI) in the TRDMA system will be serious and the system capacity will be severely restricted. In this paper, we propose an uplink multiple access scheme time-reversal non-orthogonal multiple access (TR-NOMA), wherein TRDMA and power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access are combined. The base station employs a TR filter for each user to suppress IUI and applies successive interference cancellations in the detection process of users’ signals. Users’ transmit power and TR filters are jointly optimized to promote system capacity. The original optimization problem is non-convex. We decompose the optimization problem into two sub-problems: the design of TR filters and the allocation of users’ transmit power, which is solved by utilizing generalized eigenvalue decomposition and successive lower bound convex approximation, respectively. The solution to the original optimization problem is obtained by the iterative solution between the two sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the sum rate of the optimized TR-NOMA system is significantly higher than that of the TRDMA system.}

Although many beamformer designs with the PAPC need to solve complex optimization problems, the proposed complete power reallocation (CPR) method can generate beamformers with excellent performance only with linear operations. CPR is designed to have a simple structure, making it highly flexible and practical. In this paper, three CPR variations considering algorithm convergence speed, sum-rate maximization, and robustness to the channel uncertainty are developed. Simulation results verify that CPR and its variations satisfy their design criteria, and, hence, CPR can be readily utilized for various purposes.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) assisted grant-free access is a compelling approach to support uplink ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLCs). It is a natural idea to combine massive MIMO and repetition transmission to further improve the reliability. However, excessive repetitions may increase the collision probability in multiuser scenarios and thus limit the reliability improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-probabilistic repetition (SPRe) scheme for the massive multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems with grant-free access. By introducing a transmission probability for the replicas, the SPRe is more flexible than the popular repetition scheme, i.e.,\nK\n-repetition, and covers the\nK\n-repetition as a special case. Considering practical MU-MIMO systems with finite block-length coding, channel estimation errors, pilot collisions and the sporadic arrivals of URLLC traffic, the reliability of the proposed SPRe is thoroughly analyzed and derived in closed form. Through further asymptotic analysis, the optimal transmission probability to maximize the reliability of MU-MIMO is derived for the high-SNR regime and low-load scenarios. Moreover, the diversity gain of the proposed SPRe is also analyzed and it is proved that the optimal SPRe is superior to the\nK\n-repetition in terms of reliability. The analysis and superiority of the SPRe are finally verified through computer simulations.}

	abstract = {Frame slotted Aloha (FSA) is the de facto MAC layer standard protocol in many ultra-low-power IoT applications, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. As the age of information (AoI) is an emerging and critical metric for quantifying the freshness of the status update information collected in time-sensitive IoT applications, systematic analysis of AoI for FSA is called for. However, very limited work has been done on this topic despite its both theoretical and practical implications for the operation and optimization of FSA. To fill this void, this paper delivers a comprehensive analysis of AoI for four versions of FSA, namely synchronous and asynchronous FSA with and without retransmission. The core technique of our analysis is to model the AoI for FSA as Markov chains to derive statistics on the delay and inter-delivery time. Our central results consist of the lower bounds of AoI, the exact AoI expressions in the four FSA protocols and the optimum frame length for the AoI of FSA. Our analysis reveals the impact of the arrival rate and the protocol parameters on AoI, and also shows that the retransmission would improve AoI when the arrival rate is small.}

The base station (BS) in this mMTC system is equipped with massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO) technology, and the channels across its antennas are correlated, an aspect ignored by most of the existing mMTC works. We propose three Bayesian learning algorithms which exploit channel spatial correlation, and comprehensively outperform several existing state-of-the-art algorithms, which do not exploit it. The proposed algorithms perform better in terms of the normalized mean squared error, activity error rate, and spectral efficiency (SE). The first correlated vector approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm has the best performance, but fails when the BS does not have knowledge of channel large scale fading and device activity probability. The second block sparse Bayesian learning (B-SBL) algorithm overcomes these limitations, but has a high complexity. The third combined AMP-BSBL algorithm retains the advantages of B-SBL, but with a much reduced complexity. We show that all three channel estimators can be represented as plug-in linear minimum mean squared estimators. This crucially helps us in deriving a common lower bound on the SE of mMIMO mMTC systems.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a recently proposed delay-Doppler (DD) domain communication scheme, which has shown promising performance in general wireless communications, especially over high-mobility channels. In this paper, we investigate DD domain Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for downlink multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output OTFS (MU-MIMO-OTFS) transmissions. Instead of directly applying THP based on the huge equivalent channel matrix, we propose a simple implementation of THP that does not require any matrix decomposition or inversion. Such a simple implementation is enabled by the DD domain channel property, i.e., different resolvable paths do not share the same delay and Doppler shifts, which makes it possible to pre-cancel all the DD domain interference in a symbol-by-symbol manner. We also study the achievable rate performance for the proposed scheme by leveraging the information-theoretical equivalent models. In particular, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve a near optimal performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. More importantly, scaling laws for achievable rates with respect to number of antennas and users are derived, which indicate that the achievable rate increases logarithmically with the number of antennas and linearly with the number of users. Our numerical results align well with our findings and also demonstrate a significant improvement compared to existing MU-MIMO schemes on OTFS and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).}

The power level pool is crucial for NOMA to bring performance gains. The existing related literatures rarely consider the power level pool design problem, or only resolve it in the single-cell scenario. However, this problem in multi-cell scenario is more complex and difficult to solve due to the presence of inter-cell interference. Towards this end, we propose a Non-Orthogonal Random Access (NORA) scheme to enable the coexistence of Human-Type Communications (HTC) and MTC for 5G and beyond UDN, where the power level pool design problem in multi-cell scenario is our focus. In order to deal with the complexity caused by multiple optimization objectives and inter-cell interference, we present a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based solution to solve this problem, where each small base station acts as an agent to learn a suitable gap between adjacent power levels. Extensive numerical comparisons demonstrate the superior performances of our proposed scheme in multiple perspectives.}

	abstract = {A generalized downlink multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission framework is proposed with the novel concept of cluster-free successive interference cancellation (SIC). In contrast to conventional NOMA approaches, where SIC is successively carried out within the same cluster, the key idea is that the SIC can be flexibly implemented between any arbitrary users to achieve efficient interference elimination. Based on the proposed framework, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the SIC operations between users, subject to the SIC decoding conditions and users’ minimal data rate requirements. To tackle this highly-coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating direction method of multipliers-successive convex approximation (ADMM-SCA) algorithm is developed. The original problem is first reformulated into a tractable biconvex augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem by handling the non-convex terms via SCA. Then, this AL problem is decomposed into two subproblems that are iteratively solved by the ADMM to obtain the stationary solution. Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity and alleviate the parameter initialization sensitivity of ADMM-SCA, a Matching-SCA algorithm is proposed. The intractable binary SIC operations are solved through an extended many-to-many matching, which is jointly combined with an SCA process to optimize the transmit beamforming. The proposed Matching-SCA can converge to an enhanced exchange-stable matching that guarantees the local optimality. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed Matching-SCA algorithm achieves comparable performance and a faster convergence compared to ADMM-SCA; ii) the proposed generalized framework realizes scenario-adaptive communications and outperforms traditional multi-antenna NOMA approaches in various communication regimes.}

	abstract = {The expansion of satellite applications induces the formation of the multi-domain satellite system (MDSS) containing multiple domains with specific applications such as earth resource remote sensing and the Internet of remote things. Resource management is pivotal in enhancing the scheduling capability of the MDSS. However, this is challenging since the dynamic buffer space and communication opportunity, as well as the uncertain data traffic, exacerbate the difficulty of matching satellite resources with data traffic. Moreover, the coexistence of resource competition and collaboration across domains aggravates the dilemma of cross-domain collaboration. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cross-domain collaborative resource management framework that can flexibly allocate the mission data through local intra-domain and global cross-domain scheduling. Then, to match the uncertain demands of missions with dynamic and limited resources, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based resource management method to guide collaboration for multi-satellite data carry-forward in a domain. Further, considering resource competition and collaboration in MDSS, we propose a domain-satellite nested matching game data scheduling algorithm to achieve pair-wise stable collaboration of cross-domain satellites. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the amount of offloaded data by 64.4% and 12.7% compared to the non-collaborative and the non-cross-domain schemes, respectively.}

	abstract = {Recently, there has been an interest from the automotive industry in a novel single-pair, half-duplex Ethernet multidrop provision (i.e., 10BASE-T1S), which relies on a coordinated channel access method provided by Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA). PLCA avoids frame collisions and provides bounded latency, while guaranteeing fairness among nodes and optimal bandwidth utilization. However, despite these advantageous features, PLCA is not aware of flow priorities and, consequently, does not provide priority-based Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, there is an opportunity for integrating QoS-aware schemes, such as the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)-based Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) algorithm, into PLCA. In this paper, we present modeling and analysis strategies using Network Calculus for integrating TAS with PLCA to support scheduled traffic, and we compare our modeling and analysis with a baseline work which previously modeled TAS for full-duplex point-to-point Ethernet only. We show that replacing full-duplex point-to-point links with half-duplex PLCA multidrop links still complies with end-to-end delay deadlines, while leading to a reduction of system costs due to the fewer number of Ethernet transceivers in a PLCA multidrop. Moreover, we also show that our results for TAS, when applied only on full-duplex point-to-point links, outperform the results of the baseline work in most use cases.}

This paper presents a new approach to the optimal power allocation of a multiuser photon-counting UOWC system, where we first derive the asymptotic achievable rate as the background radiation is large under the signal-dependent Poisson shot noises. With the tractability of the asymptotic achievable rate, we formulate a new power allocation problem to maximize the weighted sum-rate of the multiuser photon-counting UOWC system. A new algorithm is developed to decompose the problem into subproblems with deterministic convexity or concavity and accordingly convexified and solved using successive convex approximation. We also propose to pre-select the subproblems, thereby reducing the complexity significantly with negligible loss of the weighted sum-rate. Simulations validate our asymptotic achievable rate, and show that the proposed algorithms can improve the weighted sum-rates of the UOWC systems by orders of magnitude, compared to the existing approaches.}

We begin with a standard Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC) model to get a good bound on the mutual information lost due to the timing jitter, then introduce a novel Markov Chain (MC) based model to characterize the effect of detector downtime and show how it introduces memory to the key generation process. Finally, we propose a new method of including dark counts in the analysis that shows how dark counts can be especially detrimental when using the common Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) for key generation.

	abstract = {Existing device authentication techniques may suffer from heavy communication, computation, and storage overhead for identifying a growing number of devices in collaborations. This paper proposes a novel group authentication (GA) method for decentralized edge collaboration by exploiting the historical collaboration process information, i.e., the distributed learning parameters and results from the previous round of collaboration. Two strategies are developed to generate tokens locally at the edge devices’ side for mutual authentication, named random token generation (R-TG) and privacy-preserving token generation (PP-TG). Specifically, the R-TG strategy randomly selects several historical learning parameters as tokens, while the PP-TG strategy designs a one-way function to defend against privacy leakage by concealing the historical information. A GA protocol is proposed, where each device simultaneously authenticates the others in the same group by repeating the learning process using their tokens. If the process converges to an expected result, all the devices are authenticated as legitimate group members at once. The proposed scheme provides a lightweight flexible solution without pre-generating and distributing any keys/secrets operating on top of a standardized security protocol, and protects the collaboration continuously. The simulation results demonstrate the viability of our scheme and its superior performance compared to several benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to enhance the transmission rate for multiple access networks. Unlike conventional multiple access schemes, RSMA requires splitting and transmitting messages at different rates. The joint optimization of the power allocation and rate control at the transmitter is challenging given the uncertainty and dynamics of the environment. Furthermore, securing transmissions in RSMA networks is a crucial problem because the messages transmitted can be easily exposed to adversaries. This work first proposes a stochastic optimization framework that allows the transmitter to adaptively adjust its power and transmission rates allocated to users, and thereby maximizing the sum-rate and fairness of the system under the presence of an adversary. We then develop a highly effective learning algorithm that can help the transmitter to find the optimal policy without requiring complete information about the environment in advance. Extensive simulations show that our proposed scheme can achieve non-saturated transmission rates at high SNR values with infinite blocklength. More significantly, our proposed scheme can achieve positive covert transmission rates in the finite blocklength regime, compared with zero-valued covert rates of a conventional multiple access scheme.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are two promising technologies for the future wireless communication networks owing to their high energy and spectral efficiencies. The AmBC-aided NOMA symbiotic radio is a promising technology because of possessing advantages of AmBC and NOMA. Nonetheless, when a number of devices with limited power and computation capability access to the AmBC-based NOMA symbiotic networks, communication security becomes a critical issue. In this paper, we investigate physical-layer authentication (PLA) to identify the users and prevent illegal access and malicious activities for AmBC-based NOMA symbiotic networks. Moreover, channel estimation errors are considered when calculating the probability of false alarm (PFA) and probability of detection (PD) of the far user and near user. To enhance the authentication performance, three PLA schemes for the considered networks are designed according to the multiplexing form of the authentication tags: i) PLA with shared authentication tag (PLA-SAT); ii) PLA with space division multiplexing authentication tags; iii) PLA with time-division multiplexing authentication tags. To characterize the proposed PLA schemes, we first derive the PFA and the PD of the considered AmBC-based NOMA symbiotic networks. Then, the covertness is studied in terms of outage probability and asymptotic behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Extensive analytical and computer simulated results show that: i) The PLA-SAT scheme has better performance than the other two authentication schemes with the same threshold; ii) The outage performance of systems employing authentication schemes is worse than those without authentication; iii) There exists a trade-off between robustness and covertness.}

	abstract = {The spectrally efficient multicarrier faster-than-Nyquist (MFTN) signaling provides an efficient and robust solution for enhancing transmission rate and resisting channel impairments. In this paper, an evolutionary non-orthogonal physical waveform is proposed for simultaneously achieving high spectral and energy efficiency via combining MFTN signaling with index modulation (IM). Exploiting the implicit transmission of IM, the inactivated subcarriers alleviate the inherent two-dimensional interferences imposed by time-frequency packing in MFTN. Then, we develop a pair of iterative equalization algorithms based on vector approximate message passing (VAMP). For the first time-domain equalization (TDE), an extended constellation set is constructed for uniformly characterizing the activated and inactivated subcarriers. To further reducing the computational complexity, we establish a subcarrier-based segment-wise frequency-domain received signal model and accordingly develop low-complexity VAMP-based frequency-domain equalization (FDE) combined with interference elimination. Corroborated by simulations, the novel MFTN-IM waveform achieves superior bit error rate (BER) performance over benchmark waveforms in the high signal noise ratio (SNR) regions. Interestingly, while the proposed VAMP-TDE outperforms the proposed VAMP-FDE in BER performance, the latter is more competitive in balancing demodulation performance and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as an innovative technology to assist millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Thanks to both advantages of low hardware cost and low power consumption, the hybrid transceiver structure also becomes an integral component of mmWave systems. However, due to practical limitations of hardware components, the RIS-assisted mmWave communications usually suffer unavoidable hardware impairments (HWIs). In this paper, we aim to minimize the (sum) MSE and maximize the average rate of the hardware-impaired RIS-assisted point-to-point mmWave MIMO system, respectively, by jointly optimizing the hybrid transceiver and RIS reflection coefficients under the realistic discrete phase shift constraints. We firstly consider the single-antenna user case and propose efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithms to solve the two intractable problems. A binary-oriented exact penalty (BEP) method is developed for the involved discrete optimization, which is able to strike a good trade-off between performance and complexity. Moreover, we analyze the optimality of AO algorithms under the cascaded line-of-sight (LoS) channel condition, and reveal both the MSE floor effect and average rate saturation effect in the high-SNR regime. The above studies are then extended to the general multi-antenna user case, where a low-complexity two-phase scheme with the aim of creating the favorable RIS-cascaded channel in the first phase and enhancing system performance in the second phase is proposed. This two-phase scheme is also demonstrated to attain the optimal performance in the LoS scenario. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate superior performance of the proposed algorithms over various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless powered Internet of Things (WP-IoT) network that operates in multiple resource blocks (RBs). Particularly, the IRS helps in both downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) and uplink wireless information transfer (WIT), in a way that it improves energy reflection in WET from a power station (PS) to various IoT devices and boosts information delivery in WIT from the IoT devices to an access point (AP). Those IoT devices are capable of utilizing the collected energy, and adopting the time-division multiple access (TDMA) or non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme in the uplink WIT. Aiming to maximize the average throughput as the overall performance indicator of the considered network, we jointly optimize the transmit power allocation of the PS, the time scheduling, and the IRS phase shifts. These coupled variables lead to the non-convexity of this optimization problem, which cannot be solved directly. To address this problem, we first design the optimal PS’s transmit power allocation for each RB. For the TDMA-based scheme, we design the closed-form IRS beam pattern of the uplink WIT. Then, the closed-form downlink and uplink time allocations are derived by the Lagrange dual method and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In addition, the quadratic transformation (QT)-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach is proposed to iteratively derive the sub-optimal IRS beam pattern of the downlink WET in an alternated fashion. For the NOMA-based scheme, we propose to apply an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to iteratively optimize the IRS phase shifts, where the uplink IRS beam pattern is iteratively designed by the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO) approach, and the QT-based ADMM method is adopted to alternately derive the sub-optimal downlink IRS phase shifts. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed solution approaches compared to the benchmark schemes, also highlight advantages of the application of IRS in multiple RB scenarios.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals with rectangular pulses exhibit low spectral confinement. Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. However, since the available spectrum is non-contiguous and its occupancy changes with time, the spectral shaping solution has to be dynamically adapted. This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) are promising technologies in 5G/6G wireless communications, while there are several challenges about UAV power allocation and scheduling to enhance the energy utilization efficiency, considering the existence of obstacles. In this work, we consider a UAV-enabled WPCN scenario that a UAV needs to cover the ground wireless devices (WDs). During the coverage process, the UAV needs to collect data from the WDs and charge them simultaneously. To this end, we formulate a joint-UAV power and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory optimization problem (JUPTTOP) to simultaneously increase the total number of the covered WDs, increase the time efficiency, and reduce the total flying distance of UAV so as to improve the energy utilization efficiency in the network. Due to the difficulties and complexities, we decompose it into two sub optimization problems, which are the UAV power allocation optimization problem (UPAOP) and UAV 3D trajectory optimization problem (UTTOP), respectively. Then, we propose an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with\nK\n-means initialization operator and Variable dimension mechanism (NSGA-II-KV) for solving the UPAOP. For UTTOP, we first introduce a pretreatment method, and then use an improved particle swarm optimization with Normal distribution initialization, Genetic mechanism, Differential mechanism and Pursuit operator (PSO-NGDP) to deal with this sub optimization problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies under different scales and settings of the networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel concept called simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) is introduced into the wireless-powered mobile edge computing (MEC) systems to improve the efficiency of energy transfer and task offloading. Compared with traditional reflecting-only RIS, STAR-RIS extends the half-space coverage to full-space coverage by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting incident signals, and also provides new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for manipulating signal propagation. We aim to maximize the total computation rate of all users, where the energy transfer time, transmit power and CPU frequencies of users, and the configuration design of STAR-RIS are jointly optimized. Considering the characteristics of STAR-RIS, three operating protocols, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time splitting (TS) are studied, respectively. For the ES protocol, based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and the linear search method, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex problem. Then, the proposed algorithm for ES protocol is extended to solve the MS and TS problems. Simulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS outperforms traditional reflecting/transmitting-only RIS. More importantly, the TS protocol can achieve the largest computation rate among the three operating protocols of STAR-RIS.}

	abstract = {The high mobility, density and multi-path evident in modern wireless systems makes the channel highly non-stationary. This causes temporal variation in the channel distribution that leads to the existence of time-varying joint interference across multiple degrees of freedom (DoF, e.g., users, antennas, frequency and symbols), which renders conventional precoding sub-optimal in practice. In this work, we derive a High-Order Generalization of Mercer’s Theorem (HOGMT), which decomposes the multi-user non-stationary channel into two (dual) sets of jointly orthogonal subchannels (eigenfunctions), that result in the other set when one set is transmitted through the channel. This duality and joint orthogonality of eigenfuntions ensure transmission over independently flat-fading subchannels. Consequently, transmitting these eigenfunctions with optimally derived coefficients eventually mitigates any interference across its degrees of freedoms and forms the foundation of the proposed joint spatio-temporal precoding. The transferred dual eigenfuntions and coefficients directly reconstruct the data symbols at the receiver upon demodulation, thereby significantly reducing its computational burden, by alleviating the need for any complementary post-coding. Additionally, the eigenfunctions decomposed from the time-frequency delay-Doppler channel kernel are paramount to extracting the second-order channel statistics, and therefore completely characterize the underlying channel. We evaluate this using a realistic non-stationary channel framework built in Matlab and show that our precoding achieves {\\geqslant }4\norders of reduction in BER at SNR {\\geqslant }15\ndB in OFDM systems for higher-order modulations and less complexity compared to the state-of-the-art precoding.}

The users in blockage and cell edge areas can utilize this technology for data transfer purpose. In this paper, a machine learning-based policy optimization for downlink communication in distributed IRS aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems is proposed. Three categories of users are considered, namely, users who can utilize only the direct links, blockage area users who can utilize only the IRS links, and cell edge or poor link quality of users who can utilize both the direct and IRS links. The sum rate maximization problem is formulated to derive the optimal policy (i.e. communication link, IRS selection, power allocation and reflection coefficients) for those users, considering the IRS selection, link quality, power allocation and IRS reflection constraints. The proposed methods to achieve the optimal policy include reinforcement learning-based model with binary decision tree-based user categories, maximum posterior probability-based IRS selection, fractional programming method-based power and IRS coefficient allocation, and value function-based policy optimization. Through simulations, the sum data rate and energy efficiency performances of different categories of users are obtained and discussed.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role in future wireless communications, enabling programmable radio propagation environments. They are usually considered as almost passive planar structures that operate as adjustable reflectors, giving rise to a multitude of implementation challenges, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the underlying wireless channels. In this paper, we focus on the recently conceived concept of Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs), which do not solely reflect the impinging waveform in a controllable fashion, but are also capable of sensing and processing an adjustable portion of it. We first present implementation details for this metasurface architecture and propose a convenient mathematical model for characterizing its dual operation. As an indicative application of HRISs in wireless communications, we formulate the individual channel estimation problem for the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system. Considering first a noise-free setting, we theoretically quantify the advantage of HRISs in notably reducing the amount of pilots needed for channel estimation, as compared to the case of purely reflective RISs. We then present closed-form expressions for the Mean-Squared Error (MSE) performance in estimating the individual channels at the HRISs and the base station for the noisy model. Based on these derivations, we propose an automatic differentiation-based first-order optimization approach to efficiently determine the HRIS phase and power splitting configurations for minimizing the weighted sum-MSE performance. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that HRISs do not only enable the estimation of the individual channels in HRIS-empowered communication systems, but also improve the ability to recover the cascaded channel, as compared to existing methods using passive and reflective RISs.}

	abstract = {To exploit the potential of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in supporting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), this paper proposes a novel joint active and passive beamforming design for RIS-enabled ISAC system in consideration of the target size. First, the detection probability for target sensing is derived in closed-form based on the illumination power on an approximated scattering surface area of the target, and a new concept of ultimate detection resolution (UDR) is defined for the first time to measure the target detection capability. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user-equipment (UE) under a minimum detection probability constraint. To solve this non-convex problem, a novel alternative optimization approach is developed. In this approach, the solutions of the communication and sensing beamformers are obtained by our proposed bisection-search based method. The optimal receive combining vector is derived from an equivalent Rayleigh-quotient problem. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, the Charnes-Cooper transformation is conducted to cope with the fractional objective, and a novel convexification process is proposed to convexify the detection probability constraint with matrix operations and a real-valued first-order Taylor expansion. After the convexification, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm is designed to yield a suboptimal phase-shift solution. Finally, the overall optimization algorithm is built, followed by detailed analyses on its computational complexity, convergence behavior and problem feasibility condition. Extensive simulations are carried out to testify the analytical properties of the proposed beamforming design, and to reveal two important trade-offs, namely, communication vs. sensing trade-off and UDR vs. sensing-duration trade-off. In comparison with several existing benchmarks, our proposed approach is validated to be superior when detecting targets with practical sizes.}

	abstract = {Benefiting from the deployment flexibility and the line-of-sight (LoS) channel conditions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has gained tremendous attention in data collection for wireless sensor networks. However, the high-quality air-ground channels also pose significant threats to the security of UAV-aided wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a short-packet secure UAV-aided data collection and transmission scheme to guarantee the freshness and security of the transmission from the sensors to the remote ground base station (BS). First, during the data collection phase, the trajectory, the flight duration, and the user scheduling are jointly optimized with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE). To solve the non-convex EE maximization problem, we adopt the first-order Taylor expansion to convert it into two convex subproblems, which are then solved via successive convex approximation. Furthermore, we consider the maximum rate of transmission in the UAV data transmission phase to achieve a maximum secrecy rate. The transmit power and the blocklength of UAV-to-BS transmission are jointly optimized subject to the constraints of eavesdropping rate and outage probability. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we first propose a 3-dimensional (3-D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for maritime massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with the uniform circular array (UCA) configuration. To reduce the model complexity and improve the mathematical tractability, a novel beam domain channel model (BDCM) is then proposed based on the transformation of the corresponding GBSM from the array domain to the beam domain for maritime communications. In the proposed BDCM, the beamforming matrices suitable for UCA structures are constructed and their invertibility is demonstrated to ensure the practicability of the BDCM. Two methods are used to characterize the array non-stationarity in maritime massive MIMO channels. First, the evolution of clusters over the large UCA is modeled by the visibility regions (VRs) attached to individual multipath components (MPCs). Second, the sphere wavefront (SWF) effect is captured by dividing the UCAs into several sub-arrays. Based on the proposed GBSM and BDCM, some important channel statistical properties are studied and compared, including channel power, power leakage, space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), and root-mean-square (RMS) Doppler/beam spreads. Also, the importance of considering the array non-stationarity in maritime communication channels is revealed.}

Firstly, a beamspace multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for mmWave wideband channels is proposed to simultaneously estimate the angles of arrival (AOAs), angles of departure (AODs) and transmission delays. Since the traditional spectral peak search method has high complexity, a multi-spectral peak search method is skillfully designed to search for multiple spectral peaks on the MUSIC spatial spectrum more quickly and accurately. Then, the proposed channel estimator is extended to more actual systems equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Finally, the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) results of these channel parameters are derived for evaluating the performance of the proposed channel parameter estimator. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimator has greatly high channel estimation accuracy.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently been considered as a promising approach to save spectrum resources and reduce hardware cost. Meanwhile, as information security becomes increasingly more critical issue, government agencies urgently need to legitimately monitor suspicious communications via proactive eavesdropping. Thus, in this paper, we investigate a wireless legitimate surveillance system with radar function. We seek to jointly optimize the receive and transmit beamforming vectors to maximize the eavesdropping success probability which is transformed into the difference of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) subject to the performance requirements of radar and surveillance. The formulated problem is challenging to solve. By employing the Rayleigh quotient and fully exploiting the structure of the problem, we apply the divide-and-conquer principle to divide the formulated problem into two subproblems for two different cases. For the first case, we aim at minimizing the total transmit power, and for the second case we focus on maximizing the jamming power. For both subproblems, with the aid of orthogonal decomposition, we obtain the optimal solution of the receive and transmit beamforming vectors in closed-form. Performance analysis and discussion of some insightful results are also carried out. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of eavesdropping success probability.}

Both beamformer-based NOMA and cluster-based NOMA schemes are employed at the multi-antenna base station (BS). For each scheme, the STAR-RIS deployment location, the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming (BF) of the STAR-RIS, and the active BF at the BS are jointly optimized for maximizing the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of users. To solve the resultant non-convex problems, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, where successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite programming (SDP) methods are invoked for iteratively addressing the non-convexity of each sub-problem. Numerical results reveal that 1) the WSR performance can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the specific deployment location of the STAR-RIS; 2) both beamformer-based and cluster-based NOMA prefer asymmetric STAR-RIS deployment.}

	abstract = {Coded caching is an effective technique to decongest the amount of traffic in the backhaul link. In such a scheme, each file hosted in the server is divided into a number of packets to pursue a low broadcasting rate based on the designed placements at each user’s cache. However, the implementation complexity of this scheme increases with the number of packets. It is important to design a scheme with a small subpacketization level and a relatively low transmission rate. Recently, placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed to address the subpacketization bottleneck of coded caching. This paper investigates the design of PDA from a new perspective, i.e., the injective arc coloring of regular digraphs. It is shown that the injective arc coloring of a regular digraph can yield a PDA with the same number of rows and columns. Based on this, a new class of regular digraphs are defined and the upper bounds on the injective chromatic index of such digraphs are derived. Consequently, four new coded caching schemes with a linear subpacketization level and a relatively small transmission rate are proposed, one of which generalizes the existing scheme for the scenario with a more flexible number of users.}

	abstract = {Sorting operation is one of the main bottlenecks for the successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding. This paper introduces an improvement to the SCL decoding for polar and pre-transformed polar codes that reduces the number of sorting operations without visible degradation in the code’s error-correction performance. In an SCL decoding with an optimum metric function we show that, on average, the correct branch’s bit-metric value must be equal to the bit-channel capacity, and on the other hand, the average bit-metric value of a wrong branch can be at most zero. This implies that a wrong path’s partial path metric value deviates from the bit-channel capacity’s partial summation. For relatively reliable bit-channels, the bit metric for a wrong branch becomes very large negative number, which enables us to detect and prune such paths. We prove that, for a threshold lower than the bit-channel cutoff rate, the probability of pruning the correct path decreases exponentially by the given threshold. Based on these findings, we presented a pruning technique, and the experimental results demonstrate a substantial decrease in the amount of sorting procedures required for SCL decoding. In the stack algorithm, a similar technique is used to significantly reduce the average number of paths in the stack.}

	abstract = {The performance of a code under the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder highly depends on the weight enumerating function (WEF). However, how to compute efficiently the WEF of a polar code or a polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) code is still an open problem. For the design of stand-alone polar codes, we consider enumerating the number of minimum-weight non-zero codewords of the polar code. The block error rate (BLER) under the ML decoder can be approximated as a function of the minimum weight of non-zero codewords and its multiplicity. On the other hand, for the design of PAC codes, we consider enumerating the WEF averaged over the ensemble of random PAC codes. The ML-BLER upper bound can be represented as a function of the WEF. The bit-channel selection algorithms for polar codes and PAC codes are proposed, which take both utilization of the polarization effect and the ML decoding performance as selection criteria. Simulation results show that the proposed stand-alone polar codes are competitive when the block length gets larger. Also, simulation results show that the proposed PAC codes yield excellent performance for a wide range of code rates and block lengths and outperform the 5G polar codes.}

	abstract = {In many core problems of signal processing and wireless communications, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions based optimization plays a fundamental role. Hence we investigate the KKT conditions in the context of optimizing positive semidefinite matrix variables under nonconvex rank constraints. More explicitly, based on the properties of KKT conditions, we optimize a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) network. Specifically, we consider the capacity maximization and sum mean square error (MSE) minimization problems of both the RIS-aided MU-MIMO uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) under multiple weighted power constraints and rank constraints. As for the RIS-aided MU-MIMO UL, the optimal structures of the signal covariance matrices are derived based on the KKT conditions. Furthermore, an efficient procedure is designed for solving the capacity maximization and sum mean square error (MSE) minimization problems. Then the UL-DL dualities are exploited for solving the capacity maximization and MSE minimization problems of the RIS-aided MU-MIMO DL based on the results of the UL optimization. Hence in the proposed framework, the phase shifting matrix of the RIS is jointly optimized with the signal covariance matrices for both the UL and DL. Our simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Molecular communication is attractive to the emerging nano-scale communication systems. Traditionally, a detector recovers the information from only the concentration of single messenger molecule, while ignoring the variation of multiple participants in biochemical reaction. In this paper, we propose a non-coherent signal detector, by fully exploiting this ubiquitous biochemical diversity property of multiple reacting molecules. After extracting the channel state information (CSI) independent non-coherent features of received signals, the dynamical transient characteristics of messenger, reactant and product molecules are all utilized to implement the diversity detection, thus formulating a functional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system via reaction-diffusion communication that has been barely considered before. We design both hard and soft combination strategies to attain the potential diversity gain arise from the dynamical co-variation of participants. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our detector. Compared with conventional detectors that use only single messenger molecule, the bit error rate (BER) of is substantially reduced. Moreover, the BER performances of our non-coherent detector are even better than coherent maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector that requires accurate CSI estimation, which confirms the dramatic diversity gain provided by our detector. It would have great potentials in reliable nano-scale communications.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the downlink (DL) performance of cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems under a wireless mMIMO-based fronthaul network operation. Particularly, we consider multiple edge-cloud processors (ECP)s serving access points (AP)s using one of three possible fronthaul network operations, namely, microwave, millimeter wave (mmWave), or hybrid microwave/mmWave. Under each fronthaul network operation, we analyze the achievable DL data rates for two different microwave-based operations of the access link (APs-users), namely, distributed and centralized operations, while assuming APs with/without decoding capabilities. In the distributed operation, APs are responsible for performing both channel estimation and DL data precoding tasks, whereas ECPs are the responsible entities for carrying out such tasks in the centralized counterpart. Our results show that the integration between the centralized access link operation and the hybrid-based fronthaul network provides the highest DL data rates when APs are empowered with decoding capabilities. However, integrating the distributed access link operation with the microwave-based fronthaul network achieves ultimate performance when APs are not supported with decoding capabilities. Interestingly, we reveal that APs with low fronthaul capacities dominantly control the preferred network configuration in-terms of the densities and the number of deployed antennas for both APs and ECPs.}

	abstract = {Recently, several methods have been proposed for estimating the mutual information from sample data using deep neural networks. This approach is referred to as (). s differ from other approaches in the literature as they are data-driven estimators. As such, they have the potential to perform well on a large class of capacity problems. To test the performance across various s, it is desirable to establish a benchmark encompassing the different challenges of capacity estimation. This is the objective of this paper. We consider three scenarios for benchmarking: (i) the classic AWGN channel, (ii) channels continuous inputs– the optical intensity and peak-power constrained AWGN channel (iii) channels with a discrete output– i.e., the Poisson channel. We also consider the extension to the multi-terminal case with (iv) the AWGN and optical MAC models. We argue that benchmarking a certain across these four scenarios provides a substantive test of performance. We study the performance of mutual information neural estimator (MINE), smoothed mutual information lower-bound estimator (SMILE), and directed information neural estimator (DINE) and provide insights into the performance of other methods as well. To summarize our benchmarking results, MINE provides the most reliable performance.}

	abstract = {The paper provides a new perspective on peak- and average-constrained Gaussian channels. Such channels model optical wireless communication (OWC) systems which employ intensity-modulation with direct detection (IM/DD). First, the paper proposes a new, capacity-preserving vector binary channel (VBC) model, consisting of dependent binary noisy bit-pipes. Then, to simplify coding over this VBC, the paper proposes coding schemes with varying levels of complexity, building on the capacity of binary-symmetric channels (BSC) and channels with state. The achievable rates are compared to capacity and capacity bounds, showing that coding for the BSC with state over the VBC achieves rates close to capacity at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), whereas simpler schemes achieve lower rates at lower complexity. The presented coding schemes are realizable using capacity-achieving codes for binary-input channels, such as polar codes. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {A high-performance communication receiver desires a sufficient and accurate recognition of transmitted sources. In this paper, we propose a sequential decoding algorithm for the robust reception of sources with natural redundancy (NR) over the AWGN channel. To fully exploit the abundant NR in the exemplified English text sources, a causal language modeling (CLM) with a powerful Transformer decoder neural network (NN) structure is adopted for modeling the joint probability distribution. For versatility of byte-level tokenization, the UTF-8 encoding scheme is considered for the Wikipedia corpus, namely the English edition of the Wiki-40B dataset. The tree search-based M-algorithm (MA) is integrated with CLM, denoted as CLM-MA algorithm, to synthesize the a priori probability of information sequence and likelihood values of polluted symbols. Both simulation experiments and hardware platform evaluations are conducted to analyze the performance of the CLM-MA algorithm. With an adequately large M value, tremendous performance profit is achievable, especially for high-efficiency modulation levels and extremely noisy conditions. This mechanism of adopting the pre-trained NN model merely desires self-supervised learning architecture and eliminates the requirement of high-cost and accurate labels, which paves a new way for communication receiver design.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers an opportunity for devices relying on wireless power transfer (WPT), to accomplish computationally demanding tasks. Such WPT-powered MEC systems have yet to be optimized for long-term efficiency, due to random and changing task demands and wireless channel states of the devices. This paper presents an augmented two-staged deep Q-network (DQN), referred to as “TS-DQN,” for online optimization of WPT-powered MEC systems, where the WPT, offloading schedule, channel allocation, and the CPU configurations of the edge server and devices are jointly optimized to minimize the long-term average energy requirement of the systems. The key idea is to design a DQN for learning the channel allocation and task admission, while the WPT, offloading time and CPU configurations are efficiently optimized to precisely evaluate the reward of the DQN and substantially reduce its action space. Another important aspect is that a new action generation method is developed to expand and diversify the actions of the DQN, further accelerating its convergence. As validated by simulations, the proposed TS-DQN is much more energy efficient and converges much faster, than its potential alternative directly using the state-of-the-art Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to learn all decision variables.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile Internet, the demand for multicast is growing rapidly, such as content pushing and video streaming. The multicast service is usually offered to users without interrupting their on-going unicast transmission, and thus the multicast and unicast beamformers needs to be jointly designed, which generally requires perfect channel state information (CSI). However, perfect CSI is usually unavailable due to the channel estimation error. In this paper, we propose a learning based approach to jointly design the multicast and unicast beamformers with imperfect CSI. To learn the beamforming strategy, a new graph neural network (GNN) based architecture named unicast-multicast GNN (UMGNN) is proposed, which only requires the estimated channel. UMGNN can guarantee the permutation invariance/equivalence and model the special property in the multicast transmission, i.e., the multicast rate is determined by the worst user. Moreover, by sharing the parameters across different users, UMGNN exhibits a pretty good scalability to different number of users. Numerical results show that UMGNN outperforms a fully connected neural network and a widely used sampling-based algorithm. To highlight its performance in the multicast transmission, we also show that UMGNN can find the correct worst user that determines the multicast rate.}

	abstract = {With digitization and globalization in the era of 5G and beyond, research on high-throughput satellites (HTS) to increase communication capacity and improve flexibility is becoming essential. To achieve efficient resource utilization and dynamic traffic demand matching, the multi-dimensional resource management (MDRM) problem of the HTS communication system has been studied in this paper. Since the MDRM problem is a non-convex mixed integer problem, we decompose it into two tractable sub-problems. First, the beam-domain resource configuration problem is formed to enable on-demand coverage. Next, the user-domain resource allocation problem is modeled to enable on-demand communication. Considering the two-domain optimization problem, a two-stage framework is developed based on the combination of self-supervised learning and deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, in the first stage, a maximum co-channel interference based self-supervised learning method is proposed to perform traffic demand matching through demand awareness. In the second stage, a soft frequency reuse based proximal policy optimization approach is presented to further increase the system capacity through interference coordination. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed two-stage algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of spectrum efficiency and demand satisfaction.}

	abstract = {Maintaining the freshness of information in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a critical yet challenging problem. In this paper, we study cooperative data collection using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with the objective of minimizing the total average Age of Information (AoI). We consider various constraints of the UAVs, including kinematic, energy, trajectory, and collision avoidance, in order to optimize the data collection process. Specifically, each UAV, which has limited on-board energy, takes off from its initial location and flies over sensor nodes to collect update packets in cooperation with the other UAVs. The UAVs must land at their final destinations with non-negative residual energy after the specified time duration to ensure they have enough energy to complete their missions. It is crucial to design the trajectories of the UAVs and the transmission scheduling of the sensor nodes to enhance information freshness. We model the multi-UAV data collection problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), as each UAV is unaware of the dynamics of the environment and can only observe a part of the sensors. To address the challenges of this problem, we propose a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm with centralized learning and decentralized execution. In addition to the reward shaping, we use action masks to filter out invalid actions and ensure that the constraints are met. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total average AoI compared to the baseline algorithms, and the use of the action mask method can improve the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm.}

However, communication bottleneck still constitutes an issue, that needs to be resolved for an efficient deployment of FL over wireless networks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the total convergence time of FL, by quantizing the local model parameters prior to uplink transmission. More specifically, the convergence analysis of the FL algorithm with stochastic quantization is firstly presented, which reveals the impact of the quantization error on the convergence rate. Following that, we jointly optimize the computing and communication resources as well as the number of quantization bits, in order to guarantee minimized convergence time, subject to energy and quantization error requirements. The impact of the quantization error on the convergence time is evaluated and the trade-off among model accuracy and timely execution is revealed. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to result in faster convergence compared with baseline schemes. Finally, useful insights for the selection of the quantization error tolerance are provided.}

	abstract = {This paper studies packet repetition strategies over erasure channels with memory and a long feedback delay. The problem is initially formulated as a communications problem where a source wishes to transmit one message packet to a destination while minimizing both the delay and the number of transmissions. At each time instant, the sender is provided a delayed acknowledgement feedback about past attempts, and must decide whether to attempt a new transmission or not. This problem is then re-formulated as an episodic reinforcement learning problem, where an agent attempts to learn the optimal transmission policy, provided delayed feedback about past transmission attempts. The agent is helped by a channel estimator, which attempts to capture the channel memory and use that to predict probabilities of erasures in a future window. This channel estimator is also data-driven and learns the channel model without any a priori channel knowledge. The paper presents a lower bound on the achievable trade-off between delay and number of transmissions for any channel modeled as a Markov process. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed channel estimator and the agent can noticeably outperform naive strategies for channels with memory, and achieves results close to the lower bound.}

	abstract = {Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into existing cellular networks encounters lots of challenges, among which one of the most striking concerns is how to achieve harmonious coexistence of aerial transceivers, inter alia, UAVs, and terrestrial user equipments (UEs). In this paper, a cellular-connected UAV network is focused, where multiple UAVs receive messages from base stations (BSs) in the down-link, while BSs are serving ground UEs in their cells. For effectively managing inter-cell interferences (ICIs) among UEs due to intense reuse of time-frequency resource block (RB) resource, a first p\n-tier based RB coordination criterion is proposed and adopted. Then, to enhance wireless transmission quality for UAVs while protecting terrestrial UEs from being interfered by ground-to-air (G2A) transmissions, a radio resource management (RRM) problem of joint dynamic RB coordination and time-varying beamforming design minimizing UAV’s ergodic outage duration (EOD) is investigated. To cope with conventional optimization techniques’ inefficiency in solving the formulated RRM problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is initiated, where deep double duelling Q network (D3QN) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) are invoked to deal with RB coordination in discrete action domain and beamforming design in continuous action regime, respectively. The hybrid D3QN-TD3 solution is trained via interacting with the considered outer and inner environments in an online centralized manner so that it can then help achieve the suboptimal EOD minimization performance during its offline decentralized exploitation. Simulation results have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid D3QN-TD3 algorithm, compared to several representative baselines.}

The former brings benefits to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), while the latter enables a mechanism of symbiotic radio (SR). Inspired by these unique advantages, we consider a general SR-NOMA system model where an RIS is deployed to assist both the NOMA in an uplink multi-channel system and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) data transmission. This general model also allows for different performance objectives from the NOMA users. In particular, the users can be either energy-efficiency oriented or spectrum-efficiency oriented. To strike the performance trade-off between these two types of users, a performance metric called resource efficiency (RE) is leveraged to formulate the optimization problem. We jointly design the time-frequency resource allocation, multi-user power control and RIS phase shifts to maximize the weighted sum-RE of the system, subject to the quality-of-service constraints of the SR-NOMA system. An efficient alternating optimization framework with a series of algorithms, including matching theory, fractional programming method, and inner majorization-minimization method, is developed to solve this highly complex and non-convex problem.}

We further improve the SE by conceiving a cell-free system in SGINs, where the full-duplex (FD) multi-antenna APs simultaneously provide downlink and uplink services at the same time and within the same frequency band. Furthermore, power domain (PD) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is employed as the multiple access (MA) technique in the cell-free system. To achieve a performance enhancement, the sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the power allocation factors (PAFs) of the NOMA downlink (DL), the uplink transmit power, and both the beamformer of the satellite and of the APs. Successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite programming (SDP) are adopted to transform the resultant non-convex problem into an equivalent convex one. Our simulation results reveal that 1) our proposed system outperforms the well-known approaches (i.e., frequency division duplex (FDD) and small cell systems) in terms of its SE; 2) our proposed optimization algorithm significantly improves the networking performance; 3) the conceived SIC order design outperforms the fixed-order design at the same complexity.}

	abstract = {Fluid antennas offer a novel way to achieve massive connectivity by enabling each user to find a ‘port’ in space where the instantaneous interference undergoes a deep null for multiple access. While this unprecedented capability permits hundreds of users to share the same radio channel, each user needs to switch its best port on a symbol-by-symbol basis, which is impractical. Motivated by this, this paper considers the scenario in which the fluid antenna of each user updates its best port only if the fading channel changes. We refer to this approach as slow fluid antenna multiple access (\ns\n-FAMA). In this paper, we first investigate the interference immunity of\ns\n-FAMA through analyzing the outage probability. Then an outage probability upper bound is obtained, from which we shed light on the achievable multiplexing gain of the system and unpack the impacts of various system parameters on the performance. Numerical results reveal that despite having a weaker multiplexing power than the symbol-based, fast FAMA (i.e.,\nf\n-FAMA), spatial multiplexing of 4 users or more is possible if the users’ fluid antennas have large numbers of ports.}

	abstract = {Topology impacts important network performance metrics, including link utilization, throughput and latency, and is of central importance to network operators. However, due to the combinatorial nature of network topology, it is extremely difficult to obtain an optimal solution, especially since topology planning in networks also often comes with management-specific constraints. As a result, local optimization with hand-tuned heuristic methods from human experts is often adopted in practice. Yet, heuristic methods cannot cover the global topology design space while taking into account constraints, and cannot guarantee to find good solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for graph searching, called DRL-GS, for network topology optimization. DRL-GS consists of three novel components, including a verifier to validate the correctness of a generated network topology, a graph neural network (GNN) to efficiently approximate topology rating, and a DRL agent to conduct a topology search. DRL-GS can efficiently search over relatively large topology space and output topology with satisfactory performance. We conduct a case study based on a real-world network scenario, and our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DRL-GS in terms of both efficiency and performance.}

	abstract = {Widespread deployment of Small Satellite Networks (SSN) fosters the foreseen integration of space-air-ground networks to provide worldwide Internet access to oceanic and remote airspace. However, the dynamic topology of SSN, the lossy wireless link, and the limited transmission resources induce unprecedented challenges to Deterministic Satellite Network Transmission (DSNT) for the sake of improving the utility of the SSN facility. Motivated by these challenges, this work aims to develop a Deterministic Satellite Network Transmission approach with deterministic Spatio-temporal routing, Redundant coding and Multipath scheduling (DSNT-SRM) for bolstering superior communications of SSN. DSNT-SRM uses the ephemeris information and dynamic resource update mechanism to predict all upcoming communication opportunities and construct the deterministic spatio-temporal routing paths. By combining sparse and redundant network coding mechanisms, DSNT-SRM no longer cares about the arrival of each packet, but the number of coded packets it receives, since the lost packets can be compensated with deterministic redundant traffic. Moreover, the adaptive traffic balance between multiple spatio-temporal paths is designed to provide a deterministic delay guarantee when facing limited node resources and multi-user competition. Extensive experiments show that DSNT-SRM can achieve satisfactory performance improvement in reducing delay and improving delivery rate.}

	abstract = {Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) in wireless systems has drawn much attention because it can provide information-theoretic security. However, the performance of the prior PLA schemes significantly declines under a frequency selective fading channel and the theoretical analysis of a PLA scheme becomes extremely challenging under a frequency selective fading channel as compared to that under a frequency flat fading channel. This paper addresses the problem of authenticating transmitters at the physical layer under a frequency selective fading channel. We propose two tag-based PLA schemes under a frequency selective fading channel. The first scheme is the Generalized Tag-based PLA (GT-PLA) scheme, where the negative effect caused by a frequency selective fading channel is compensated for. If the channel reciprocity holds, we will propose the second scheme to further improve the performance of the GT-PLA scheme, named the Adaptive Generalized Tag-based PLA (AGT-PLA) scheme. We provide the theoretical analysis of both proposed schemes over wireless fading channels in terms of robustness, security, and compatibility, and derive their closed-form expressions. Moreover, we implement the proposed schemes and conduct extensive performance comparisons. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GT-PLA scheme achieves higher robustness over the prior PLA schemes while the AGT-PLA scheme can further improve the performance of the GT-PLA scheme in terms of robustness, security, and compatibility.}

	abstract = {Proactive eavesdropping is an effective approach to improve the performance of wireless information surveillance, where suspicious users are legitimately eavesdropped by authorized monitors. For the situation when no monitor is available, we propose to authorize unsuspicious users to surveil suspicious users provided that the quality-of-service (QoS) of unsuspicious users is guaranteed. This paper considers an interference network consisting of a suspicious-transmitter (STx)/suspicious-receiver (SRx) pair and an unsuspicious-transmitter (UTx)/unsuspicious-receiver (URx) pair. We assume that URx acts as a monitor to eavesdrop the suspicious communication, and UTx adopts improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) for flexibly managing the interference to SRx. The QoS of the unsuspicious communication is guaranteed by enforcing its outage performance to be higher than a desirable level. The problem of optimizing the transmit power and the IGS circularity coefficient of UTx to maximize the average eavesdropping rate is optimally solved by the Lagrange duality method. Theoretical results show that IGS is effective when the eavesdropping is successful and the unsuspicious communication is in non-outage status. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design works well even when no additional outage of the unsuspicious communication is allowed, and show that IGS can greatly outperform proper Gaussian signaling in most cases.}

	abstract = {Conventional centralized authentication techniques based on both digital cryptography and physical-layer attributes are prone to single-point failure due to either compromised digital security keys or an abrupt change in the physical communication environment. Although these particular challenges could be mitigated by the joint use of decentralized authentication and physical-layer attributes, such schemes often exhibit unpredictable performance. Simultaneously, the necessary involvement of multiple parties and the imperfect observation of the physical communication environment can also significantly increase the latency and computational complexity. As a remedy, a decentralized authentication scheme is proposed in this paper to achieve Guaranteed Authentication Level at Minimized Complexity (GALAMC) based on the intelligent use of distributed collaboration and available distributive physical-layer attributes. Specifically, we aim for minimizing the complexity of the proposed collaborative authentication process by harnessing the minimum number of collaborative nodes and the selected authentication attributes at each node across the different environments while guaranteeing the required authentication level. The related physical-layer authentication scheme is implemented at each collaborative node where different physical-layer attributes can be selected based on their usefulness which is time-varying. The simulation results demonstrate that our scheme maintains the target level of authentication and it is more immune to sudden environmental changes than the conventional centralized physical-layer authentication scheme. It can also be observed that our proposed scheme can adaptively select the minimum number of collaborative nodes for adaptively minimizing the computational cost.}

In this paper, we propose finite blocklength (FBL) coding schemes for RIS aided SISO/SIMO/MIMO systems in the presence of an eavesdropper (no direct link between the transceiver), which are based on an existing coding scheme for the point-to-point white Gaussian channel with noiseless feedback. Then, we show that the proposed schemes are self-secure when the blocklengths are larger than certain thresholds. Finally, numerical results show that for given decoding error probability and secrecy level, the required coding blocklengths of our proposed schemes are extremely short, and the secrecy capacities of the RIS-aided systems without channel feedback are significantly enhanced by our feedback schemes.}

In this paper, we address the problem of authenticating the transmitter device in the SM. We propose an authentication approach for an SM system by using Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) mechanisms because the PLA has the following advantages: high security and low complexity. Based on the features of an SM system, we propose two PLA schemes: PLA with Superimposed Authentication Tag (PLA-SAT) and PLA with Superimposed Imaginary authentication Tag (PLA-SIT). We provide performance analyses of our schemes over fading channels in terms of robustness, compatibility, and security. Moreover, we derive their closed-form expressions under both perfect and imperfect channel estimates, including the Probability of Detection (PD), Probability of False Alarm (PFA), and Average Error Probability (AEP). Although the two proposed schemes have the same robustness and security, the PLA-SIT scheme has better compatibility than the PLA-SAT scheme. Our schemes were implemented and extensive performance comparisons through simulations were conducted. We observe that the simulation results of the two proposed schemes perfectly match their corresponding theoretical analyses. The authentication accuracy of the two proposed schemes is close to one when the received SNR is greater than 20 dB and the security performances of the two proposed schemes improve as the variance of estimation errors increases.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has attracted tremendous attention for the future 6G wireless communications systems. To improve the transmission rates and sensing accuracy, massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique is leveraged with large transmission bandwidth in millimeter wave (mmWave)/terahertz (THz) band. However, the growing size of antenna array and transmission bandwidth results in the beam-squint effect, which hampers the performance of communications. Moreover, the time overhead of the traditional sensing algorithm is prohibitively high for practical systems. In this paper, instead of alleviating the beam-squint effect, we take advantage of joint beam-squint and beam-split effect and propose a novel integrated sensing and communications scheme for massive MIMO system. Specifically, with the beam-squint effect, the base station (BS) utilizes the true-time-delay (TTD) lines to steer the beams of different OFDM subcarriers towards distributive directions simultaneously. Different users then feedback their respective subcarrier frequency with the maximum array gain to BS, based on which BS could calculate the directions of the users. Moreover, by selecting sub-array with the inter-antenna spacing larger than half-wavelength, the beam-split effect can be introduced and exploited to expand the sensing range. The proposed sensing method operates over frequency-domain, and the intended sensing range is covered by all the subcarriers simultaneously, which significantly reduces the time overhead compared to the conventional sensing scheme. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness as well as the superior performance of the proposed ISAC scheme.}

In this signaling technique, each network node individually follows a transmission strategy based on the locally sensed occupied and unused physical-layer network resources to minimize the induced interference onto other coexisting networks, taking into account the impact of the sensing errors and the locality of the sensing information. The paper identifies and characterizes critical invariance properties of the transmitted pulse shaping waveforms that guarantee the detectability of the feedforward transmitted signal by the uncoordinated receiving nodes, irrespective of the sensing signal space basis. The paper also shows that, under mild operating conditions, the proposed transmission scheme asymptotically defines efficient alternatives in the frequency domain, such as the circulant-shaping TDMA (CS-TDMA) modulation, and all of them admit a direct adaptation to frequency-selective channels. Numerical evaluation of the proposed schemes validates the provided theoretical models.}

	abstract = {Approximate Message Passing (AMP) is an efficient iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions, such as sparse systems. In AMP, a so-called Onsager term is added to keep estimation errors approximately Gaussian. Orthogonal AMP (OAMP) does not require this Onsager term, relying instead on an orthogonalization procedure to keep the current errors uncorrelated with (i.e., orthogonal to) past errors. In this paper, we show the generality and significance of the orthogonality in ensuring that errors are “asymptotically independently and identically distributed Gaussian” (AIIDG). This AIIDG property, which is essential for the attractive performance of OAMP, holds for separable functions. We present a simple and versatile procedure to establish the orthogonality through Gram-Schmidt (GS) orthogonalization, which is applicable to any prototype. We show that different AMP-type algorithms, such as expectation propagation (EP), turbo, AMP and OAMP, can be unified under the orthogonal principle. The simplicity and generality of OAMP provide efficient solutions for estimation problems beyond the classical linear models. As an example, we study the optimization of OAMP via the GS model and GS orthogonalization. More related applications will be discussed in a companion paper where new algorithms are developed for problems with multiple constraints and multiple measurement variables.}

	abstract = {Beam training and tracking (BTT) are key technologies for millimeter wave communications. However, since the effectiveness of BTT methods heavily depends on wireless environments, complexity and randomness of practical environments severely limit the application scope of many BTT algorithms and even invalidate them. To tackle this issue, from the perspective of stochastic process (SP), in this paper we propose to model beam directions as a SP and address the problem of BTT via process inference. The benefit of the SP design methodology is that environment priors and uncertainties can be naturally taken into account (e.g., to encode them into SP distribution) to improve prediction efficiencies (e.g., accuracy and robustness). We take the Gaussian process (GP) as an example to elaborate on the design methodology and propose novel learning methods to optimize the prediction models. In particular, beam training subset is optimized based on derived posterior distribution. The GP-based SP methodology enjoys two advantages. First, good performance can be achieved even for small data, which is very appealing in dynamic communication scenarios. Second, in contrast to most BTT algorithms that only predict a single beam, our algorithms output an optimizable beam subset, which enables a flexible tradeoff between training overhead and desired performance. Simulation results show the superiority of our approach.}

	abstract = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is promising in assisting user localization and wireless communication in the future wireless networks. In this paper, a novel IRS-aided joint localization and communication (L&C) scheme is designed in a millimeter-wave transmission system. For the proposed scheme, the user position/orientation estimation error bound (POEB) and the effective achievable data rate (EADR) are derived in closed-form as L&C performance metrics, which reveal the inherent trade-off between L&C capabilities. To achieve the joint optimal point of the POEB and EADR in consideration of the localization errors, a worst-case robust beamforming and time allocation optimization problem is formulated. To solve the original non-convex problem, a novel joint optimization approach is developed. Specifically, from an equivalent minimax problem, the local optimal solutions of the transceiver beamformers, the IRS phase-shift matrix, and the time allocation ratio between user localization stage (ULS) and effective data transmission stage (EDTS), are obtained in closed-form with respect to the localization errors. Then, the worst-case localization error is iteratively found by a dedicated majorize-minimization (MM) based algorithm. Subsequently, potential extensions to general wireless channels and discrete phase-shift models are discussed in detail. Finally, simulations are carried out to show the optimization results and the L&C performance trade-off. In comparison with the conventional non-robust method, the proposed approach is validated to be robust against the user localization uncertainty.}

The proposed method achieves a low iteration convergence with low complexity. Two practical structures, namely fully-connected and partially-connected structures are considered for hybrid precoding. Furthermore, the effect of high and low-resolution quantization in the digital-to-analog converter, phase shifter, and imperfect channel state information are discussed. The performance results of the proposed technique and alternating minimization methods beside fully digital techniques are compared and discussed in the terms of the spectral efficiency (SE), bit error rate (BER), normalized mean square error (NMSE), energy efficiency (EE) for phase-shifter (PS) with low bit quantization, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). To address the applicability of the proposed method, experimental results are obtained from a real mmWave hardware setup compliant with 3GPP standards, and verify the simulated ones for the proposed\nϵ\n-FPAL hybrid precoding scheme. The reduced complexity, higher performance and EE make the proposed method suitable for 5G and beyond communication systems.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is a highly promising technology that enables the ubiquitous deployment of low-cost, low-power devices to support the next generation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. This paper addresses channel estimation for full-duplex multi-antenna AmBC systems. This is highly challenging due to the large number of channel parameters resulting from the use of multiple antennas, the presence of self-interference, and the dependence of the backscattering channel on the state of the backscattering device. Considering both pilot-based and semi-blind estimation strategies, we propose three solutions for this problem. The first is the pilot-based maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator. The second is a semi-blind estimator based on the expectation maximization (EM) framework, which provides higher accuracy than the ML, at the cost of higher computational complexity. The third is a semi-blind estimator based on the decision-directed (DD) strategy, which provides a tradeoff between the ML and the EM. Additionally, we derive the exact Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for pilot-based estimation and the modified CRB for semi-blind estimation. Simulations show that the ML and the EM perform very close to their respective CRBs, and that the semi-blind estimators offer significantly higher estimation accuracy, as well as superior symbol-error-rate performance, compared to the ML estimator.}

	abstract = {We deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a large-scale uniform planar array (UPA) to serve multiple ground users in millimeter-wave band. Particularly, the practical UAV jitter is carefully considered, which may affect the beam gains and impact the communication quality. To provide a stable service, we first model the attitude change of the UPA caused by UAV jitter. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate of the users by optimizing the position and robust hybrid beamforming of the UAV. To solve the non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, a two-stage optimization strategy is developed. The first stage aims to decouple the beamforming from the original problem and design the UAV deployment under the assumption of an ideal beam pattern. The second stage aims to design robust hybrid beamforming with the obtained UAV position. Specifically, we first design analog beamforming for wide beams to cover the potential jitter angle range for each user via a chirp sequence-inspired method. Then, with equivalent channel estimation, we design digital beamforming by combining zero-forcing and water-filling power allocation algorithms. Extensive simulation results show the performance superiority of the proposed solution compared to the benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {A dense satellite-terrestrial integrated mobile-edge computing network (SATIMECN) architecture is developed to meet the computing demands for next generation networks. We formulate an average weighted sum energy consumption minimization problem by jointly considering task ratio allocation of computing or offloading at local and the gateway (GW), ground user terminal (GUT)-satellite association relation, GUT multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) precoding, and computation resource allocation at local and the GW. Due to the stochastic property of the optimization problem, we adopt Lyapunov optimization theory to transform it into a deterministic one. Then, we decompose the optimization problem into four subproblems and solve each one iteratively. Specifically, task ratio allocation of computing or offloading at local and the GW is obtained in a closed-form expression using the delay constraint. Then, the binary GUT-satellite association subproblem is solved by the weighted minimum mean-squared error and quadratic transform based fractional programming (QTFP) methods. Moreover, the MIMO precoding subproblem is solved by QTFP and interior point methods. Finally, the computation resource allocation subproblem for local and edge computing is derived in closed-form expressions. Simulation results demonstrate that the tradeoff between the average weighted sum energy consumption and the average queue length can be realized by adjusting the Lyapunov control parameter. Moreover, the proposed MIMO communication and frequency reuse schemes for dense satellite network can realize efficient computation offloading with relative low cost.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-ground (U2G) channel models play a pivotal role in reliable communications between UAV and ground terminal. This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary hybrid model including large-scale and small-scale fading for U2G multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Distinctive channel characteristics under U2G scenarios, i.e., 3D trajectory and posture of UAV, fuselage scattering effect (FSE), and posture variation fading (PVF) are incorporated into the proposed model. The channel parameters, i.e., path loss (PL), shadow fading (SF), path delay, and path angle, are generated incorporating machine learning (ML) and ray tracing (RT) techniques to capture the structure-related characteristics. In order to guarantee the physical continuity of channel parameters such as Doppler phase and path power, the time evolution methods of inter- and intra- stationary intervals are proposed. Key statistical properties, including temporal auto-correction function (ACF), power delay profile (PDP), level crossing rate (LCR), average fading duration (AFD), and stationary interval (SI), are analyzed with the impact of the change of fuselage and posture variation. It is demonstrated that both posture variation and fuselage scattering have crucial effects on channel characteristics. The validity and practicability of the proposed model are verified by comparing the simulation results with the measured ones.}

This paper is on the phase estimation of individual channels in IRS-assisted communication systems with single-antenna transceivers under the correlated Rayleigh fading. We consider both the fully-active-IRS where all IRS elements are active and the hybrid-IRS where partially IRS elements are active, where an active IRS element is equipped with a sensing device for pilot signal reception. We derive the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for channel phases of all IRS elements based on the observations on active IRS elements. This estimator is also proved to be the minimum mean square error (MMSE), maximum a posterior (MAP) and minimum mean absolute error (MMAE) estimators. Then we conduct performance analysis in terms of the gain and the capacity of the cascaded transmitter-IRS-receiver channel with perfectly known and estimated individual channel phases. Numerical results are provided to show that the performance of IRS-assisted communication systems with our proposed phase estimator is close to that with perfect CSI and validate our theoretical analysis.}

The proposed A-IRS-JSRM engages an active IRS with sub-connected architecture in which several reflecting elements are grouped into panels, and the elements within a panel have the same amplification factor but different reflection angles. Transmit and receive spatial modulation are employed at the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) by activating a set of transmit antennas and selecting a receiver antenna. Further, only a subset of panels is switched to the ON state in the active IRS, which is determined by the information bits and thus invokes reflecting modulation. The active IRS panels in the ON state also aid in maximizing the received energy in the chosen receiver antenna at the UE. We present the theoretical analysis of the performance of the proposed A-IRS-JSRM system and validate them with simulation results. Further, we have discussed a low-complexity approach for receiver processing in the compressive sensing framework. We compare the proposed A-IRS-JSRM with closely related IRS-assisted spatial modulation schemes in the literature and demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed approach in terms of achievable rate, bit error rate, and outage probability.}

	abstract = {The inability of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to signal processing has become a critical bottleneck in terms of the precise capture of cascaded channels. There exists a pair of critical issues: 1) the high-dimensional cascaded channel to be estimated, which always entails substantial pilot overhead typically proportional to RIS elements and 2) the high possibilities of false alarms and unfaithful angle detection during cascaded channel estimates, referred to as the angular distortion, particularly in the case of conventional fully-passive RIS systems. To circumvent these issues, we investigate in this paper a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by a wireless beacon (WB) enabled RIS over millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency. Specifically, WB is a functionally independent hardware that attaches parasitically to the RIS using only one radio frequency chain for broadcasting pilots, allowing for the accurate acquisition of partial cascaded channel information, e.g., some of angles of arrival/departure (AoA/AoDs) and complex gains. This efficiently eliminates the angular distortion effect and thus facilitates high precision recovery of sparse cascaded mmWave channels. Then, a hybrid structured sparsity (HSS) model is presented to capture hybrid sparse priors and approximate exact posterior distributions associated with RIS-aided twin-hop channels. We conceive of channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem in contrast to its conventional copy due to the presence of an unknown sensing matrix. To tackle this problem, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm, i.e., HSS-EM, is developed in order to fully employ the sparse priors encapsulated by the proposed HSS model for a robust and accurate recovery of the cascaded channels. Numerical results validate our analytical claims and demonstrate the significant improvement in terms of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance over conventional designs.}

Thus, the proposed\nN\n-fold MGC-LDPC code naturally has rate-compatible feature. Based on the superposition (SP) construction, we present truncating and masking methods to construct the base matrices (BMs) of MGC-LDPC codes. More importantly, we introduce the double lower triangular (DLT) form of parity-check matrix for further developing a recursive encoding scheme for MGC-LDPC codes.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider how to partition the parity-check matrices (PCMs) to reduce the hardware complexity and increase decoding throughput for the row layered decoding of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes. First, we formulate the PCM partitioning as an optimization problem, which targets to minimize the maximum column weight of each layer while maintaining a block cyclic shift property among different layers. As a result, we derive all the feasible solutions for the problem and propose a tight lower bound\nω\nLB\non the minimum possible maximum column weight to evaluate a solution. Second, we define a metric called layer distance to measure the data dependency between consecutive layers and further illustrate how to identify the solutions with desired layer distance from those achieving the minimum value of\nω\nLB\n=1\n, which is preferred to reduce computation delay. Next, we demonstrate that up-to-now, finding an optimal solution for the optimization problem with polynomial time complexity is unachievable. Therefore, both enumerative and greedy partition algorithms are proposed instead. After that, we modify the quasi-cyclic progressive edge-growth (QC-PEG) algorithm to directly construct PCMs that have a straightforward partition scheme to achieve\nω\nLB\nor the desired layer distance. Simulation results showed that the constructed codes have better error correction performance and achieve less average number of iterations than the underlying 5G LDPC codes.}

A heterogeneous network is assumed, in which cache-aided relays are connected through a backhaul link to a primary node while no connection exits between users and the primary node. The first caching scheme considers to fill the cache with encoded content while the second scheme considers to encode the content during the delivery phase. We compare the schemes by characterizing the average transmission load when users ask for downloading content to the network. We provide an approximation of the expression of the average load which allows a fast evaluation of the network behavior for each scheme considered. We further assume a constraint on the capacity of the backhaul link and derive the expression of the outage probability, i.e. the probability that the system is not able to serve the entire set of users demands. Finally, we examine and discuss how the derived analysis of a two relays scenario can be scaled to study the performance of a network with a generic number of relays.}

In this paper, a spectral and energy-efficient carrier index keying-aided\nM\n-ary differential chaos cyclic shift keying (CIK-MDCCSK) system is proposed for D2D communications, where multiple cyclic-shifted\nM\n-ary information-bearing signals are superimposed and transmitted by a subcarrier, and extra keying bits are transmitted by indices of the selected subcarriers. Furthermore, a carrier keying detection and\nM\n-ary de-mapping algorithm is proposed to retrieve the information bits transmitted by\nM\n-ary symbols and indices of carrier keying. The bit error rate (BER) expressions of the proposed CIK-MDCCSK system are derived over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and D2D channels, and the optimal power coefficient is deduced for performance enhancement. Then, the spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and complexity of CIK-MDCCSK are analyzed and compared to benchmark systems to show its superiority. Next, the proposed CIK-MDCCSK system is expanded into its enhanced version for more effective transmission without degrading the BER performance. It is demonstrated by performance comparisons that the proposed CIK-MDCCSK system can achieve more than twice energy efficiency and up to 3 dB gain in BER performance compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.}

The former part, referred to as permutation-conveyed data unit (PCDU), improves the goodput and reduces the latency. From a finite blocklength perspective, the maximal payload rate of permutation-based transmissions is formulated, based on which the goodput and latency are derived and obtained in analytical forms. Moreover, the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency are analysed. Illustrative numerical results on the performance and resource utilisation comparisons not only substantiate the advantages of our permutation-based transmissions over conventional transport-layer encapsulation schemes, but also provide useful tools and specifications for the PCDU design in short-packet communications.}

	abstract = {A set of low-cost sensors is deployed to infer the network topology of a self-organizing wireless network. The sensors operate in a non-invasive fashion, extracting only the timings of data packets and acknowledgment (ACK) packets from all nodes in a network. The meta-data also reports the source node of each packet, but not the destination nodes or the contents of the packets. A central processor collects the meta-data from the sensors, and the goal is for the processor to infer the network topology based solely on such information. Prior work leveraged causality metrics to identify which links are active. If the data timings and ACK timings of two nodes– say node 1 and node 2, respectively– are causally related, this may be taken as evidence that node 1 is communicating to node 2 (which sends back ACK packets to node 1). This paper starts with the observation that packet losses can weaken the causality relationship between data and ACK timing streams. To obviate this problem, a new Expectation Maximization (EM)-based algorithm is introduced– EM-causality discovery algorithm (EM-CDA)– which treats packet losses as latent variables. EM-CDA iterates between the estimation of packet losses and the evaluation of causality metrics. The method is validated through extensive experiments in wireless sensor networks on the NS-3 simulation platform.}

In this work, we consider a SIET problem where the harvesting function is accessible only at experimentally-taken sample points and study how close we can design SIET to the optimal system with such sampled knowledge. Assuming that the harvesting function is of bounded variation that may have discontinuities, we separately consider two settings where samples are taken without and with additive noise. For these settings, we propose to design a SIET system as if a wavelet-reconstructed harvesting function is the true one and study its asymptotic performance loss of energy and information delivery from the true optimal one. Specifically, for noiseless samples, it is shown that designing SIET as if the wavelet-reconstructed harvesting function is the truth incurs asymptotically vanishing energy and information delivery loss with the number of samples. For noisy samples, we propose to reconstruct wavelet coefficients via soft-thresholding estimation. Then, we not only obtain similar asymptotic losses to the noiseless case but also show that the energy loss by wavelets is asymptotically optimal up to a logarithmic factor.}

In this paper, we provide a tighter upper bound on the redundancy of the ternary Huffman codes when the greatest probability of the source\np\nmax\nis known. As a result, the redundancy of the optimal ternary AIFV codes is bounded by Huffman codes, since the ternary Huffman codes can be seen as the special AIFV codes.

In addition, the redundancy of the proposed AIFV codes is analyzed and compared with Huffman codes.

In particular, we first derive an achievable secure rate for ISI-WTCs without imposing any constraints on the input distribution. Afterwards, we focus on the setup where the input distribution of the ISI-WTC is constrained to be a time-invariant finite-order Markov chain. Optimizing the parameters of this Markov chain toward maximizing the achievable secure rates is a computationally intractable problem in general, and so, toward finding a local maximum, we propose an iterative algorithm that at every iteration replaces the secure rate function with a suitable surrogate function whose maximum can be found efficiently. Although the secure rates achieved in the unconstrained setup are potentially larger than the secure rates achieved in the constrained setup, the latter setup has the advantage of leading to efficient algorithms for estimating and optimizing the achievable secure rates, and also has the benefit of being the basis of efficient coding schemes.}

	abstract = {Distributed implementations are crucial in speeding up large scale machine learning applications. Distributed gradient descent (GD) is widely employed to parallelize the learning task by distributing the dataset across multiple workers. A significant performance bottleneck for the per-iteration completion time in distributed synchronous GD is straggling workers. Coded distributed computation techniques have been introduced recently to mitigate stragglers and to speed up GD iterations by assigning redundant computations to workers. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of dynamic coded computation, which assigns redundant data to workers to acquire the flexibility to dynamically choose from among a set of possible codes depending on the past straggling behavior. In particular, we propose gradient coding (GC) with dynamic clustering, called GC-DC, and regulate the number of stragglers in each cluster by dynamically forming the clusters at each iteration. With time-correlated straggling behavior, GC-DC adapts to the straggling behavior over time; in particular, at each iteration, GC-DC aims at distributing the stragglers across clusters as uniformly as possible based on the past straggler behavior. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous worker models, we numerically show that GC-DC provides significant improvements in the average per-iteration completion time without an increase in the communication load compared to the original GC scheme.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed machine learning (ML) technique to train models without sharing users’ private data. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized FL scheme that is called federated learning empowered overlapped clustering for decentralized aggregation (FL-EOCD). The introduced FL-EOCD leverages device-to-device (D2D) communications and overlapped clustering to enable decentralized aggregation, where a cluster is defined as a coverage zone of a typical device. The devices located on the overlapped clusters are called bridge devices (BDs). In the proposed FL-EOCD scheme, a clustering topology is envisioned where clusters are connected through BDs, so as the aggregated models of each cluster is disseminated to the other clusters in a decentralized manner without the need for a global aggregator or an additional hop of transmission. To evaluate our proposed FL-EOCD scheme as opposed to baseline FL schemes, we consider minimizing the overall energy-consumption of devices while maintaining the convergence rate of FL subject to its time constraint. To this end, a joint optimization problem, considering scheduling the local devices/BDs to the CHs and computation frequency allocation, is formulated, where an iterative solution to this joint problem is devised. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FL-EOCD algorithm over FL conventional schemes in terms of energy consumption, latency, and convergence rate.}

	abstract = {Today, numerous machine learning (ML) applications offer continuous data processing and real-time data analytics at the edge of wireless networks. Distributed real-time ML solutions are highly susceptible to the so-called straggler effect caused by resource heterogeneity, which can be mitigated by various computation offloading mechanisms that severely impact communication efficiency, especially in large-scale scenarios. To reduce the communication overhead, we leverage device-to-device (D2D) connectivity, which enhances spectrum utilization and allows for efficient data exchange between proximate devices. In particular, we design a novel D2D-aided coded distributed learning method named D2D-CDL for efficient load balancing across devices. The proposed solution captures system dynamics, including data (time-varying learning model, irregular intensity of data arrivals), device (diverse computational resources and volume of training data), and deployment (different locations and D2D graph connectivity). To decrease the number of communication rounds, we derive an optimal compression rate, which minimizes the processing time. The resulting optimization problem provides suboptimal compression parameters that improve the total training time. Our proposed method is particularly beneficial for real-time collaborative applications, where users continuously generate training data.}

	abstract = {The conventional model aggregation-based federated learning (FL) approach requires all local models to have the same architecture, which fails to support practical scenarios with heterogeneous local models. Moreover, the frequent model exchange is costly for resource-limited wireless networks since modern deep neural networks usually have over a million parameters. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel knowledge-aided FL (KFL) framework, which aggregates light high-level data features, namely knowledge, in the per-round learning process. This framework allows devices to design their machine-learning models independently and reduces the communication overhead in the training process. We then theoretically analyze the convergence bound of the proposed framework under a non-convex loss function setting, revealing that scheduling more data volume in each round helps to improve the learning performance. In addition, large data volume should be scheduled in early rounds if the total scheduled data volume during the entire learning course is fixed. Inspired by this, we define a new objective function, i.e., the weighted scheduled data sample volume, to transform the inexplicit global loss minimization problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, bandwidth allocation, and power control. To deal with unknown time-varying wireless channels, we transform the considered problem into a deterministic problem for each round with the assistance of the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, we derive the optimal bandwidth allocation and power control solution by convex optimization techniques. We also develop an efficient online device scheduling algorithm to achieve an energy-learning trade-off in the learning process. Experimental results on two typical datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10) under highly heterogeneous local data distributions show that the proposed KFL is capable of reducing over 99% communication overhead while achieving better learning performance than the conventional model aggregation-based algorithms. In addition, the proposed device scheduling algorithm converges faster than the benchmark scheduling schemes.}

Simulations show the advantages of the proposed BA schemes over other benchmarks, regarding the accuracy and convergence rate of the considered relay-assisted FEEL network.}

	abstract = {The optimal energy signal design for wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) enabling energy-sustainable communication for a large number of low-power devices is still an open problem in practical systems. In this work, we study a multi-user WPCN, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends an energy signal to multiple single-antenna users, which, in turn, harvest energy from the received signal and utilize it for information transmission in the uplink. In contrast to the existing works on multiple-input single-output (MISO) WPCN design, in this paper, we jointly optimize the energy signal waveform and downlink beamforming at the BS for energy harvesting (EH) devices described by non-linear circuit-based models. To this end, we assume that the BS broadcasts a pulse-modulated signal employing multiple energy signal vectors and we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the downlink transmit energy signal vectors, their number, the durations of the transmit pulses, and the time allocation policy for minimization of the average transmit power at the BS. We show that for single-user WPCNs, a single energy signal vector, which is collinear with the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) vector and drives the EH circuit at the user device into saturation, is optimal. Next, for the general multi-user case, we show that the optimal signal design requires a maximum number of energy signal vectors that exceeds the number of users by one and propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal energy signal vectors. Since the complexity of the optimal design is high, we also propose two suboptimal schemes for WPCN design. First, for asymptotic massive WPCNs, where the ratio of the number of users to the number of BS antennas, i.e., the system load, tends to zero, we show that the optimal downlink transmit signal can be obtained in closed-form and comprises a sequence of weighted sums of MRT vectors. Next, based on this result, for general WPCNs with finite system loads, we propose a suboptimal closed-form MRT-based design and a suboptimal semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based scheme. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed optimal scheme and suboptimal SDR-based design achieve nearly identical performance and outperform two baseline schemes, which are based on linear and sigmoidal EH models. Furthermore, we show that, if the system load of the WPCN is low, the performance gap between the proposed suboptimal solutions is small and becomes negligible as the number of BS antennas tends to infinity.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates computing task offloading from an Internet-of-Thing (IoT) device with limited transmit power to a mobile-edge computing (MEC) server located beyond the communication range of the IoT device. We propose an opportunistic cooperative offloading (OCO) strategy that recruits the IoT device’s nearby spatially random idle-state users as helpers and opportunistically schedules one of them to partially execute the latency-critical task, and forwards the rest portion of the task to the MEC server. For the OCO strategy, we investigate the helper scheduling under three cases of system information availability, i.e., the global, partial, and distance information cases, and develop an offloading-outage optimal scheduling scheme for each case. For each scheduling scheme, an approximate expression is derived for the offloading-outage probability, with which the achieved diversity order is also theoretically evaluated. Simulation results verify our performance analysis for the OCO strategy using helper scheduling and show its achieved offloading-outage/energy consumption reduction over multi-helper cooperative offloading that fully uses all helpers for cooperation. In addition, the advantages of the proposed helper scheduling schemes over existing scheduling schemes are also demonstrated by simulations.}

	abstract = {The fog-radio-access-network (F-RAN) has been proposed to address the strict latency requirements, which offloads computation tasks generated in the user equipment (UE) to the edge to reduce the processing latency. However, it incorporates the task transmission latency, which may become the bottleneck of latency requirements. Data compression (DC) has been considered as one of the promising techniques to reduce the transmission latency. By compressing the computation tasks before transmitting, the transmission delay is reduced due to the shrink transmitted data size, and the original computing task can be retrieved by employing data decompressing (DD) at the edge nodes or the centre cloud. Nevertheless, the DC and DD incorporate extra processing latency. For the F-RAN system, the latency performance has not been investigated considering the DC and DD processes. Therefore, in this work, the successful data compression probability (SDCP), i.e., the probability of the task execution latency being smaller than a target latency and the signal to interference ratio (SIR) of the received signal being higher than a threshold, is defined to analyse the latency performance of the DC-enabled F-RAN. Moreover, to analyse the impact of compression offloading ratio (COR), which determines the proportion of tasks being compressed at the edge, on the SDCP of the F-RAN, a novel hybrid compression mode is proposed based on the queueing theory. Based on this, the closed-form result of SDCP in the large-scale DC-enabled F-RAN is derived by combining the Matern cluster process and M/G/1 queueing model, and validated by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Based on the derived SDCP results, the effects of COR on the SDCP is analysed numerically. The results show that the SDCP with the optimal COR can be enhanced with a maximum value of 0.3 and 0.55 as compared with the cases of compressing all computing tasks at the edge and at the UE, respectively. Moreover, for the system requiring the minimal latency, the proposed hybrid compression mode can alleviate the requirement on the backhaul capacity.}

These enable the cloud-RAN vision in full, where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) can install their proprietary or open RUs, but lease on-demand computational resources for DU-CU functions from commonly available open-clouds via open x-haul interfaces. In this paper, we propose and compare the performances of min-max fairness and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction -based x-haul and DU-CU resource allocation mechanisms to create a multi-tenant O-RAN ecosystem that is sustainable for small, medium, and large MNOs. The min-max fair approach minimizes the maximum OPEX of RUs through cost-sharing proportional to their demands, whereas the VCG auction-based approach minimizes the total OPEX for all resources utilized while extracting truthful demands from RUs. We consider time-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) passive optical network (PON)-based x-haul interfaces where PON virtualization technique is used to flexibly provide optical connections among RUs and edge-clouds at macro-cell RU locations as well as open-clouds at the central office locations. Moreover, we design efficient heuristics that yield significantly better economic efficiency and network resource utilization than conventional greedy resource allocation algorithms and reinforcement learning-based algorithms.}

	abstract = {A low-complexity and high-performance clipping-free multilayer optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scheme is proposed for optical wireless communication (OWC). At the transmitter, the symbols of multi-layer quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) are first arranged according to a specific rule in the frequency domain to generate a bipolar time-domain signal using a single inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Then the bipolar signal is superimposed with an adaptive periodic DC bias to meet the real and positive requirements in intensity modulation / direct detection (IM/DD) systems. At the receiver, a zero-value regression (Re0) -based demodulation is proposed to optimize the bit error rate (BER). As the signal generation and demodulation are realized by single IFFT and fast Fourier transform (FFT) respectively, the proposed scheme has nearly the same system complexity as the single-layer modulations and similar spectral efficiency with those advanced multilayer modulations. In addition, the proposed periodic DC improves the power efficiency and avoids the interlayer interference. Numerical simulation results show that, compared with LACO-OFDM with 3 layers, the proposed scheme can attain a PAPR gain of 2.4 dB and BER gain of 1.4 dB and 3 dB for the linear and nonlinear channel, respectively.}

	abstract = {This work addresses a reactive jamming attack on the low-latency messages of a victim, wherein the jammer deploys countermeasure detection mechanisms to change its strategy. We highlight that the existing schemes against reactive jammers use relays with instantaneous full-duplex (FD) radios to evade the attack. However, due to the limitation of the radio architecture of the FD helper, instantaneous forwarding may not be possible in practice, thereby leading to increased decoding complexity at the destination and a high detection probability at the adversary. Pointing at this drawback, we propose a delay-aware cooperative framework wherein the victim seeks assistance from a delay-aware FD helper to forward its messages to the destination within the latency constraints. In particular, we first model the processing delay at the helper based on its hardware architecture, and then propose two low-complexity mitigation schemes, wherein the victim and the helper share their uplink frequencies using appropriate energy-splitting factors. For both the schemes, we solve the optimization problems of computing the near-optimal energy-splitting factors that minimize the joint error rates at the destination. Finally, through analytical and simulation results, we show that the proposed schemes facilitate the victim in evading the jamming attack whilst deceiving the reactive adversary.}

	abstract = {Although the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is envisioned promising to enhance communication from all aspects, including physical-layer security, increasing concerns have lately been cast onto its defects—the severe “double-fading” loss and its confined-to-half-space coverage. Diverse novel RIS architectures have recently emerged to partially overcome these shortcomings, yet perfect solution is still absent. This paper proposes a novel double-faced active (DFA)-RIS structure to surmount the above two prominent defects simultaneously. Furthermore, we utilize the DFA-RIS to promote secrecy performance via jointly designing access point (AP)’s beamforming and DFA-RIS configuration towards maximizing sum secrecy rate (SR). The optimization problem is highly challenging due to the constraints deriving from the DFA-RIS architecture, especially the presence of power splitting parameters. By leveraging majorization–minimization (MM) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) methods, we develop an efficient solution that updates all variables via convex optimization techniques. Our proposed solution is significant and general as it is applicable to all other cutting-the-edge RIS architectures to maximize sum SR, which has not yet been thoroughly worked out. Numerical results verify the convergence and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that our proposed DFA-RIS architecture outperforms all other state-of-the-art RIS techniques to enhance communication security.}

For improving the ability of anti-eavesdropping, we aim to maximize the achievable sum secrecy capacity (SC) by jointly optimize the MTCDs’ transmission power, RIS phase coefficient and receive beamforming design. To handle the nonconvexity of the proposed optimization problem, we decouple it into three sub-problems, where the first two are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA) method. A minimum mean squared error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme is proposed to tackle the receive beamforming problem for uplink NOMA networks. Furthermore, an alternating optimization based joint power, phase, and beamforming allocation (AO-JPPBA) algorithm is developed to implement joint optimization. Simulation results show that: 1) the security performance of the proposed AO-JPPBA is improved by 612.26% than the baseline scheme; 2) the proposed MMSE-SIC beamforming scheme is more effective in improving sum-SC of uplink NOMA networks; 3) RIS’s location has an obvious impact on sum-SC when considering eavesdroppers with strong wiretapping ability.}

However, it is more challenging to secure the air-ground transmission, due to the line-of-sight (LoS) links established by UAV. Since IRS is a promising solution for wireless environment reconfiguration, in this paper, we propose an aerial IRS-assisted secure transmission design in wireless networks. In particular, an access point (AP) equipped with a uniform planar array serves several single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multiple single-antenna eavesdroppers, whose precise positions are unknown. An IRS is mounted on the UAV to help establish desired virtual LoS links between the AP and legitimate users, while ensuring their security. We aim to maximize the worst-case sum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the hovering position of UAV, the transmit beamforming of AP and the phase shifts of IRS, subject to the requirement of minimum rate for legitimate users. To tackle this non-convex problem, we first decompose it into three subproblems, which are transformed into convex ones via successive convex approximation. An alternating algorithm is then proposed to solve them iteratively. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the security improvement by the joint optimization.}

	abstract = {6G operators may use millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands to meet the ever-increasing demand for wireless access. Sub-THz communication comes with many existing challenges of mmWave communication and adds new challenges associated with the wider bandwidths, more antennas, and harsher propagations. Notably, the frequency- and spatial-wideband (dual-wideband) effects are significant at sub-THz. This paper presents a compressed training framework to estimate the time-varying sub-THz MIMO-OFDM channels. A set of frequency-dependent array response matrices are constructed, enabling channel recovery from multiple observations across subcarriers via multiple measurement vectors (MMV). Using the temporal correlation, MMV least squares (LS) is designed to estimate the channel based on the previous beam support, and MMV compressed sensing (CS) is applied to the residual signal. We refer to this as the MMV-LS-CS framework. Two-stage (TS) and MMV FISTA-based (M-FISTA) algorithms are proposed for the MMV-LS-CS framework. Leveraging the spreading loss structure, a channel refinement algorithm is proposed to estimate the path coefficients and time delays of the dominant paths. To reduce the computational complexity and enhance the beam resolution, a sequential search method using hierarchical codebooks is developed. Numerical results demonstrate the improved channel estimation accuracy of MMV-LS-CS over state-of-the-art techniques.}

By leveraging the hybrid generalized approximate message passing (HyGAMP) framework, we design a computationally efficient algorithm, HyGAMP-DCS, to solve this problem. In contrast to only exploiting the historical estimations, the proposed algorithm performs bidirectional message passing between the neighboring frames for activity likelihood update to fully exploit the temporally-correlated user activities. Furthermore, we develop an expectation maximization HyGAMP-DCS (EM-HyGAMP-DCS) algorithm to adaptively learn the hyperparameters during the estimation procedure when the system statistics are unknown. In particular, we propose to utilize the analysis tool of state evolution to find the appropriate hyperparameter initialization of EM-HyGAMP-DCS. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can significantly improve the user activity detection accuracy and reduce the channel estimation error.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz) communication has been considered as a promising technology for enabling future sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems. Due to the exploitation of extremely large bandwidth and large scale of RIS, RIS-aided THz communications would suffer from the beam split effect, where the generated beams cannot be aligned with the target physical direction in the whole bandwidth, so a severe array gain loss will be introduced. In this paper, the beam split effect is first analyzed in the existence of RIS. Then, a novel sub-connected RIS architecture is proposed to mitigate the beam split effect. The crux is to introduce additional time-delay (TD) modules and phase shifters into RIS elements so as to convert the classical phase-only precoding to the joint phase and delay precoding. Accordingly, a wideband precoding design is proposed to compensate for the severe array gain loss, and the performance analysis on the array gain is also provided. After that, we extend our discussions to the emerging scenarios with massive antennas equipped at the base station (BS), where the effect of “double beam split”, i.e., the coupling of beam split at the BS and the RIS, occurs. We prove the decomposability of the array gain, based on which the double beam split effect can be addressed by separately optimizing the wideband precoding at the BS and the RIS. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sub-connected RIS significantly alleviates the beam split effect with a small number of TD modules, and it is capable of achieving sub-optimal achievable rate performance with acceptable hardware cost and power consumption.}

	abstract = {Double-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique, achieving a substantial gain improvement compared to single-RIS techniques. However, in double-RIS-aided systems, accurate channel estimation is more challenging than in single-RIS-aided systems. This work solves the problem of double-RIS-based channel estimation based on active RIS architectures with only one radio frequency (RF) chain. Since the slow time-varying channels, i.e., the BS-RIS 1, BS-RIS 2, and RIS 1-RIS 2 channels, can be obtained with active RIS architectures, a novel multi-user two-timescale channel estimation protocol is proposed to minimize the pilot overhead. First, we propose an uplink training scheme for slow time-varying channel estimation, which can effectively address the double-reflection channel estimation problem. With channels’ sparisty, a low-complexity Singular Value Decomposition Multiple Measurement Vector-Based Compressive Sensing (SVD-MMV-CS) framework with the line-of-sight (LoS)-aided off-grid MMV expectation maximization-based generalized approximate message passing (M-EM-GAMP) algorithm is proposed for channel parameter recovery. For fast time-varying channel estimation, based on the estimated large-timescale channels, a measurements-augmentation-estimate (MAE) framework is developed to decrease the pilot overhead. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of pilot overhead and computing complexity is conducted. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed multi-user two-timescale estimation strategy and the low-complexity Bayesian CS framework.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) offers tremendous spectrum-and-energy efficiency in wireless networks. With the agility and mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), RIS can be mounted on a UAV to enable three-dimensional (3D) signal reflections, reliable air-ground connections, and higher configuration flexibility. However, the scalability of the aperture gain and the spatial multiplexing could not be guaranteed in a single UAV-enabled aerial RIS due to UAV’s limited payload and line-of-sight-dominated air-ground connection. In this paper, we study a UAV swarm-enabled aerial RIS (SARIS)-assisted downlink communication system. The objective of the considered SARIS system is to maximize the weighted sum-rate of ground users by designing the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS), the phase shifts of SARIS reflecting elements, and SARIS 3D placement. For joint BS and SARIS beamforming design, we introduce two beamforming schemes with low computational complexity. For SARIS placement design, the optimal SARIS 3D position is obtained by leveraging the tools from stochastic geometry and considering the distributions of ground users. Simulation results confirm the validity of the analytical derivations. In particular, the SARIS placement plays a vital role in the system performance when the distances between users and the BS increase.}

	abstract = {Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) provides a promising solution to support large-scale secure communications. However, reducing the impact of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI) on the performance of RIS-aided NOMA secure networks remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a robust transmission scheme for RIS-aided NOMA secure networks with transceiver HWI under two proposed eavesdropping scenarios and two artificial noise methods. A closed-form expression for the distortion noise power caused by transceiver HWI in NOMA networks is derived to quantify transceiver HWI. The sum secrecy rate of NOMA users with imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) is maximized under distortion noise for more robust security. Further, to tackle the resulting non-convex problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems. Both of them are converted into convex problems using the multi-dimensional quadratic transform (MDQT) method, semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique, and the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm, and then employing the alternate optimization (AO) algorithm solve them. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has superior security performance over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) networks, and traditional NOMA networks, achieving more robust performance than the conventional scheme that ignores HWI and imperfect SIC.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a competitive solution to the blocking problem in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, obtaining channel state information (CSI) for RIS-assisted mmWave communication systems is rather difficult. Considering that the currently available RIS hardware cannot arbitrarily switch between the active (reflection with configurable phase response) and deactivate (absorption) modes, we suggest a new beam training method for RIS-assisted mmWave communication systems in this study. First, a predefined hierarchical codebook is created using the pattern synthesis method. Then, we provide a novel hierarchical beam training method using two multi-mainlobe codewords in each layer of the hierarchical codebook for beam sweeping. Combining the results of the beam identification in all the layers will yield the ultimate ideal beam direction. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that the suggested approach can effectively reduce training overhead while ensuring successful beam alignment. Simulation results show that the practical codebook can be created successfully, and the suggested method can achieve accurate beam alignment with reduced training overhead.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for computing the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the downlink transmission in a wireless network with Rayleigh fading. The novel approach relies on an approximation mix of exact and mean-field analysis of interference (dominant interferer-based approximation) to reduce the complexity of analysis and enhance tractability. In particular, the proposed approximation omits the need to compute the first or the second moment of the SINR that is used in the beta approximation typically adopted in the literature but requires of computing the joint distance distributions. We first derive the proposed approximation based on a Poisson point process (PPP) network with a standard path-loss and Rayleigh fading and then illustrate its accuracy and operability in another four widely used point processes: Poisson bipolar network, Matérn cluster process (MCP),\nK\n-tier PPP and Poisson line Cox process (PLCP). Specifically, we obtain the SINR meta distribution for PLCP networks for the first time. Even though the proposed approximation looks simple but it shows good matching in comparison to the popular beta approximation as well as the Monte-Carlo simulations, which opens the door to adopting this approximation in more advanced network architectures.}

	abstract = {Hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture is widely adopted in practical millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to reduce hardware cost and energy consumption. However, channel estimation in the context of HAD is challenging due to only limited radio frequency (RF) chains at transceivers. Although various compressive sensing (CS) algorithms have been developed to solve this problem by exploiting inherent channel sparsity and sparsity structures, practical effects, such as power leakage and beam squint, can still make the real channel features deviate from the assumed models and result in performance degradation. Besides, the high complexity of CS algorithms caused by a large number of iterations hinders their applications in practice. To tackle these issues, we develop a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation approach where the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is unfolded into a deep neural network (DNN). In each SBL layer, Gaussian variance parameters of the sparse angular domain channel are updated by a tailored DNN, which is able to capture complicated channel sparsity structures in various domains effectively and efficiently. The measurement matrix is jointly optimized for performance improvement. Then, the proposed approach is extended to the multi-block case where channel correlation in time is further exploited to adaptively predict the measurement matrix and facilitate the update of variance parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches outperform existing approaches in terms of both performance and complexity.}

	abstract = {Accurate channel model and channel estimation are essential to empower extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) in 6G networks with ultra-high spectral efficiency. With the sharp increase in the antenna array aperture of the XL-MIMO scenario, the electromagnetic propagation field will change from far-field to near-field. Unfortunately, due to the near-field effect, most of the existing XL-MIMO channel models fail to describe mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path components simultaneously. In this paper, a mixed LoS/NLoS near-field XL-MIMO channel model is proposed to match the practical near-field XL-MIMO scenario, where the LoS path component is modeled by the geometric free space propagation assumption while NLoS path components are modeled by the near-field array response vectors. Then, to define the range of near-field for XL-MIMO, the MIMO Rayleigh distance (MIMO-RD) and MIMO advanced RD (MIMO-ARD) is derived. Next, a two stage channel estimation algorithm is proposed, where the LoS path component and NLoS path components are estimated separately. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed algorithm is derived in this paper. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed two stage scheme is able to outperform the existing methods in both the theoretical channel model and the QuaDRiGa channel emulation platform.}

	abstract = {In the uplink of multiuser multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) systems operating over aging channels, pilot spacing is crucial for acquiring channel state information and achieving high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Somewhat surprisingly, very few works examine the impact of pilot spacing on the correlation structure of subsequent channel estimates and the resulting quality of channel state information considering channel aging. In this paper, we consider a fast-fading environment characterized by its exponentially decaying autocorrelation function, and model pilot spacing as a sampling problem to capture the inherent trade-off between the quality of channel state information and the number of symbols available for information carrying data symbols. We first establish a quasi-closed form for the achievable deterministic equivalent SINR when the channel estimation algorithm utilizes multiple pilot signals. Next, we establish upper bounds on the achievable SINR and spectral efficiency, as a function of pilot spacing, which helps to find the optimum pilot spacing within a limited search space. Our key insight is that to maximize the achievable SINR and the spectral efficiency of MU-MIMO systems, proper pilot spacing must be applied to control the impact of the aging channel and to tune the trade-off between pilot and data symbols.}

	abstract = {A distributed phased array is comprised of separate, smaller antenna systems (nodes) that coordinate with each other to support coherent beamforming. However, due to the frequency drift and phase jitter of the oscillators on the nodes, as well as the frequency and phase estimation errors induced in the synchronization process, there exists a decoherence between the nodes that degrades their beamforming gain. A decentralized frequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm was proposed in a prior work for undirected array networks in which the nodes locally share their frequencies and phases with their neighboring nodes to reach a synchronized state. Kalman filtering (KF) was also integrated with DFPC, and the resulting KF-DFPC showed significant reduction in the total residual phase error upon convergence. One limitation of the DFPC-based algorithms is that, due to relying on the average consensus protocol which assumes undirected networks, they do not generally converge for directed array networks with column stochastic weighting matrix. For directed networks, a push-sum protocol based frequency alignment algorithm was recently proposed, but it does not take into account both frequency and phase variations in-between the update intervals. In this paper, we model the variations using a first-order Markov process and propose a push-sum based frequency and phase consensus (PsFPC) algorithm which is accordingly a modified version of the push-sum protocol. The residual phase error of PsFPC upon convergence is theoretically derived as well. Kalman filtering is also integrated with PsFPC and the resulting KF-PsFPC algorithm shows significant reduction in the residual error of the array. A limitation of KF-PsFPC is that the model parameters, i.e., the measurement noise and the process noise covariance matrices, are assumed to be known a priori. Since they may not be known in practice, we develop an online expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm that iteratively computes the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of these matrices in an online manner. EM is integrated with KF-PsFPC and the resulting algorithm is referred to as the EM-KF-PsFPC algorithm. Simulation results are included where the performances of the PsFPC-based algorithms are analyzed for different distributed array networks, and are compared to the DFPC-based algorithms as well as to the earlier proposed hybrid consensus on measurement and consensus on information (HCMCI) algorithm.}

However, deploying a large number of HAPs will lead to severe congestion of existing frequency bands. Spectrum sharing improves spectrum utilization. The coverage performance improvement and interference caused by spectrum sharing need to be investigated. To this end, this paper analyzes the performance of spectrum sharing between HAP network and terrestrial network. We firstly generalize the Poisson Point Process (PPP) to curves, surfaces and manifolds to model the distribution of terrestrial Base Stations (BSs) and HAPs. Then, the closed-form expressions for coverage probability of HAP network and terrestrial network are derived based on differential geometry and stochastic geometry. We verify the accuracy of closed-form expressions by Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that HAP network has less interference to terrestrial network. Low height and suitable deployment density can improve the coverage probability and transmission capacity of HAP network.}

To compensate for this deficiency, we derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) for the IPAC system by exploiting the a priori delay information extracted from both the time delay parameter and the channel amplitude attenuation. Further, we derive the expected CRB (ECRB) and the weighted CRB (WCRB) of the system for comparisons. Second, we analyze the trade-off between positioning and communication for this IPAC system based on the derived ZZB. Specifically, we aim to optimize the power allocation to maximize the achievable data rate subject to the ZZB and total transmit power constraints. Numerical results show that the ZZB provides a tighter and more reasonable bound for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator over the wide range of SNRs compared to the ECRB and WCRB. Moreover, the trade-off between positioning and communication is revealed via changing critical parameters by simulations.}

	abstract = {The various requirements in terms of data rates and latency in beyond 5G and 6G networks have motivated the integration of a variety of communications schemes and technologies to meet these requirements in such networks. Among these schemes are Terahertz (THz) communications, cooperative non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA)-enabled schemes, and mobile edge computing (MEC). THz communications offer abundant bandwidth for high-data-rate short-distance applications and NOMA-enabled schemes are promising schemes to realize the target spectral efficiencies and low latency requirements in future networks, while MEC would allow distributed processing and data offloading for the emerging applications in these networks. In this paper, an energy-efficient scheme of multi-user NOMA-assisted cooperative THz single-input multiple-output (SIMO) MEC systems is proposed to allow the uplink transmission of offloaded data from the far cell-edge users to the more computing resources in the base station (BS) through the cell-center users. To reinforce the performance of the proposed scheme, two optimization problems are formulated and solved, namely, the first problem minimizes the total users’ energy consumption while the second problem maximizes the total users’ computation energy efficiency (CEE) for the proposed scheme. In both problems, the NOMA user pairing, the BS receive beamforming, the transmission time allocation, and the NOMA transmission power allocation coefficients are optimized, while taking into account the full-offloading requirements of each user as well as the predefined latency constraint of the system. The obtained results reveal new insights into the performance and design of multi-user NOMA-assisted cooperative THz-SIMO MEC systems. Particularly, with relatively high offloading rate demands (several Gbits/user), we show that (i) the proposed scheme can handle such demands while satisfying the predefined latency constraint, and (ii) the full-offloading model can be considered the most effective solution in conserving mobile devices’ resources as compared to the system with the partial-offloading model or the system without offloading.}

	abstract = {Constructions of high-performance hard-decision decodable error correction codes are important for high-speed communication systems. In this paper, we present the generalized integrated interleaved (GII) zipper codes, in which multiple zipper codes are coupled together by the constraint of the GII code. The resulting codes are referred to as GII-zipper codes. Firstly, since the performances of GII-zipper codes are sensible to miscorrections, we propose an enhanced anchor decoder (AD) which uses the hard-decision results during the GII decoding to assign anchor reliability to reduce miscorrections. We then analyze the size and multiplicity of the minimum-sized stall patterns (MSSPs) of the GII-zipper codes. The analytical results show that the size of the MSSPs of the GII-zipper codes is larger that of the zipper codes. Finally, we present extensive simulation results to show the performance advantages of the GII-zipper codes. The results show that, when decoded with the original AD, the GII-zipper codes perform better than the comparable zipper codes and we can obtain further performance gain by the enhanced AD. Particularly, a GII-staircase code with a rate of 0.846 can achieve 0.74 dB from capacity at a bit error rate (BER) of 10 −15 .}

	abstract = {Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is an important feature brought by 5G New Radio (NR). By using a block code, the low-latency requirement in general requires a short block length in order to reduce the latency of transmitting the entire code block. The ultra-reliable communication requires a low-rate code to achieve high decoding reliability even under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This paper proposes a new class of coding and modulation schemes, termed permutation-coded modulations, for low-rate and short-block-length applications, such as URLLC. We show that permutation-coded modulations under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding have remarkable performance levels that achieve the dispersion bounds with normal approximation (NA) for short block lengths. However, their encoding and ML-decoding complexities are prohibitive if the number of message bits transmitted per code block increases. To reduce the encoding and decoding complexities, we propose a trapezoidal permutation-coded modulation scheme which can be decoded efficiently by successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders. We also show that the trapezoidal permutation-coded modulations under SCL decoding can achieve the dispersion bounds with NA for short block lengths.}

	abstract = {The low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding problem can be expressed as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. One efficient method to solve the ILP problem is to relax the integer constraints and add penalty terms to the objective function, and the revised problem can be solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. These penalty terms can punish the non-integral solutions and improve the decoding performance of the decoder. However, ADMM decoders are easily trapped in a local solution, which limits the frame error rate (FER) performance of the decoders at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In this paper, we propose a restartable ADMM-based decoder using a negative proximal regularization. The negative proximal term will be updated whenever the decoder finds a new local solution. Therefore, the decoder can be restarted several times and the candidate solution which satisfies the parity-check equations and has the lowest objective function value can be selected as the decoder’s output. Some properties, together with several choices of penalty terms are discussed. We also investigate the convergence of our proposed decoder, and prove that the possibility of decoding errors is independent of the codeword that is transmitted. Simulation results show that our proposed decoder outperforms other ADMM-based decoders in most cases, while the decoding complexity maintains the same.}

	abstract = {In large-scale parallel computing systems, machines and the network suffer from non-negligible faults, often leading to system crashes. The traditional method to increase reliability is to restart the failed jobs. To avoid unnecessary time wasted on reboots, we propose an optimal scheduling strategy to enable fault-tolerant reliable computation to protect the integrity of computation. Specifically, we determine the optimal redundancy-failure rate tradeoff to incorporate redundancy into parallel computing units running multiple-precision arithmetics, like the Chinese Remainder Theorem, that are useful for applications such as asymmetric cryptography and fast integer multiplication. Inspired by network coding in distributed storage for disk failures, we propose coding matrices to strategically map partial computation to available computing units, so that the central unit can reliably reconstruct the results of any failed machine without recalculations to yield the final correct computation output. We propose optimization-based algorithms to efficiently construct the optimal coding matrices subject to fault tolerance specifications. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the optimal scheduling effectively reduces the overall running time of parallel computing while resisting wide-ranging failure rates.}

	abstract = {Distributed multi-task learning (MTL) can jointly learn multiple models and achieve better generalization performance by exploiting relevant information between the tasks. However, distributed MTL suffers from communication bottlenecks, in particular for large-scale learning with a massive number of tasks. This paper considers distributed MTL systems where distributed workers wish to learn different models orchestrated by a central server. To mitigate communication bottlenecks both in the uplink and downlink, we propose coded computing schemes for flexible and fixed data placements, respectively. Our schemes can significantly reduce communication loads by exploiting workers’ local information and creating multicast opportunities for both the server and workers. Moreover, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds on the optimal downlink and uplink communication loads, and prove the approximate optimality of the proposed schemes. For flexible data placement, our scheme achieves the optimal downlink communication load, and the order optimal uplink communication load that is smaller than 2 times of the information-theoretic optimum. For fixed data placement, the gaps between our communication load and the optimum are within the minimum computation load among all workers, regardless of the number of workers. Experiments demonstrate that our schemes can significantly speed up the training process compared to the traditional approach.}

We build on this work by incorporating convolutional codes as a new variable-symbol-length digital communication scheme using instantaneous feedback. In the proposed system, called Opportunistic Symbol Length Adaptation (OSLA), the symbol length opportunistically adapts to the noise realization observed within a sub-symbol interval to minimize the packet/codeword error rate. It is shown that the proposed OSLA scheme combined with tail-biting convolutional codes or turbo codes outperforms state-of-the-art non-feedback codes as well as a deep learning-based feedback scheme with up to 1.5 dB gain in noiseless and noisy feedback channels.}

For this problem of noisy index coding with\nM\n-ary modulated transmission, the ML decoder at any receiver does not involve demodulation to the complex signal point and then index code decoding to the requested message bit. Instead, it decodes directly to the requested message bit, raising the question of whether the central server’s encoding scheme is required to correspond to an index code or if any set of transmissions encoding across the entire library of messages is sufficient. This paper proves that index codes are necessary for solving noisy BWSI problems even with\nM\n-ary modulated transmission. Further, we look at index-coded QAM for prioritized receivers. An algorithm for mapping index-coded vectors to signal points on a square QAM constellation is presented, which gives mappings that achieve the best ML decoding performance for the prioritized receivers. Expressions for the ML metric seen by the highest priority receiver while using\nM\n-PSK and\nM\n-QAM for transmission are derived. For the highest priority receiver,\nM\n-PSK is shown to outperform\nM\n-QAM.}

	abstract = {In 5G and beyond communication systems, the notion of latency gets great momentum in wireless connectivity as a metric for serving real-time communications requirements. However, in many applications, research has pointed out that latency could be inefficient to handle applications with data freshness requirements. Recently, Age of Information (AoI) metric, which can capture the freshness of the data, has attracted a lot of attention. In this work, we consider mixed traffic with time-sensitive users; a deadline-constrained user, and an AoI-oriented user. To develop an efficient scheduling policy, we cast a novel optimization problem formulation for minimizing the average AoI while satisfying the timely throughput constraints. The formulated problem is cast as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We relax the constrained problem to an unconstrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem by utilizing the Lyapunov optimization theory and it can be proved that it is solved per frame by applying backward dynamic programming algorithms with optimality guarantees. In addition, we provide a low-complexity algorithm guaranteeing that the timely-throughput constraint is satisfied. Simulation results show that the timely throughput constraints are satisfied while minimizing the average AoI. Simulation results show the convergence of the algorithms for different values of the weighted factor and the trade-off between the AoI and the timely throughput.}

Considering two individual single-letter separable distortion constraints and input and output data acting as the intrinsic and extrinsic message, respectively, we first derive a lower bound on the optimal rates of the problem, as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for this bound to be tight. Subsequently, we prove a general result that provides in parametric form the optimal solution of the characterization of this problem. Capitalizing on these results, we examine the structure of the solution for one case study of general binary alphabets under Hamming distortions and solve in closed form a special case. We also solve another general binary alphabet case where a Hamming and an erasure distortion coexist, as a means to highlight the importance of selecting the type of the distortion constraint in goal-oriented semantic communication. Furthermore, we develop a goal-oriented Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, which can be used for the computation of any finite alphabet intrinsic or extrinsic message under individual distortion criteria. Finally, we revisit the problem for multidimensional independent and identically distributed (\ni.i.d.\n) jointly Gaussian processes with individual mean-square error (MSE) distortion constraints, providing new insights that have previously been overlooked.

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) applied to a device’s radio-frequency fingerprint (RFF) has attracted significant attention in physical-layer authentication due to its extraordinary classification performance. Conventional DL-RFF techniques are trained by adopting maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Although their discriminability has recently been extended to unknown devices in open-set scenarios, they still tend to overfit the channel statistics embedded in the training dataset. This restricts their practical applications as it is challenging to collect sufficient training data capturing the characteristics of all possible wireless channel environments. To address this challenge, we propose a DL framework of disentangled representation (DR) learning that first learns to factor the signals into a device-relevant component and a device-irrelevant component via adversarial learning. Then, it shuffles these two parts within a dataset for implicit data augmentation, which imposes a strong regularization on RFF extractor learning to avoid the possible overfitting of device-irrelevant channel statistics, without collecting additional data from unknown channels. Experiments validate that the proposed approach, referred to as DR-based RFF, outperforms conventional methods in terms of generalizability to unknown devices under unknown complicated propagation environments, e.g., dispersive multipath fading channels, even though all the training data are collected in a simple environment with dominated direct line-of-sight (LoS) propagation paths.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the downlink robust precoding with imperfect channel state information (CSI) for massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications. With the estimated channel and channel error statistics, the general design of the robust precoder is to maximize the ergodic sum rate subject to the total transmit power constraint. To make the problem more tractable, we find a lower bound of the ergodic sum rate and propose the robust weighted minimum mean-squared-error (WMMSE) precoder to maximize the bound. We characterize the structure of the precoding vectors by low-dimensional parameters, which are learned directly from the available CSI through a neural network. As such, the precoding vectors can be immediately computed without iterations. To extend the deep learning design to multi-antennas users, we present a flexible approach that allows the various antenna configurations at the user side to be handled. Simulation results show that the deep learning design can significantly reduce the computational complexity compared with the existing precoder designs while achieving near optimal performance.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication has been regarded as a promising technology to serve upcoming intelligent applications. However, few studies have addressed the problem of resource allocation in semantic communication networks. Most resource allocation mechanisms act fairly to all original data, ignoring the meaning behind the transmitted bits. In this paper, a dynamic resource allocation scheme for the task-oriented semantic communication network (TOSCN) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed, which allows data with richer semantic information to preferentially occupy limited communication resources. This paper aims to design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent at the micro base station to maximize the long-term transmission efficiency of tasks. Firstly, the relationship between semantic information and task performance is investigated. Subsequently, a novel wireless resource allocation model for TOSCN is proposed by taking the image classification task as an example. Then, a joint optimization problem of the semantic compression ratio, transmit power, and bandwidth of each user is formulated. The agent is trained in an interactive learning environment to obtain a decent trade-off between the amount of data delivered to the receiver and the accuracy of intelligent tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant advantages in relieving communication pressure and improving task performance in resource-constrained wireless networks.}

This paper considers an AGIN-PIoT, where computing tasks generated by ground PIoT devices are offloaded to aerial UAVs that perform edge computing. Jointly optimizing task offloading and UAV trajectory poses challenges such as many decision variables, information uncertainty, and long-term queue delay constraints. Due to the limited battery capacity of PIoT devices and UAVs, our objective is to minimize system energy consumption under long-term queue delay constraints by jointly optimizing task offloading, trajectory planning, and computing resource assignment. In light of Lyapunov optimization, we decompose the original challenging optimization problem into two sub-problems: (1) task offloading and UAV trajectory planning and (2) aerial edge resource allocation. Accordingly, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm called AGIN-MADDPG for the former to achieve the maximum accumulative reward and propose a greedy solution for the latter. Extensive experiments and numerical results demonstrate that our approach can avoid the problem of gradient vanishing and outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of power consumption, task backlog, queue delay, and system throughput.}

	abstract = {To alleviate the local computation demands from the ever-increasing computation-intensive mobile applications, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has proved promising. Especially, by opportunistically offloading these computation tasks to the MEC server, the delay of computing could be significantly improved through communication. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for joint communication and computation resources allocation for multi-user MEC systems. Specifically, to retrieve the combined effect of communication and computation capabilities, we establish a dual queue system, including a data queue sub-system and a computation queue sub-system. To address the associated stochastic resource optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity resource allocation algorithm by Lyapunov optimization to stabilize all the sub-queue systems. As the practical buffers are finite, the conventional delay analysis of Lyapunov optimization becomes inaccurate. Alternatively, we model the stochastic queue lengthes as discrete time controlled random walk processes, which are transformed to continuous time Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with reflections by strong approximation. According to the steady state analysis on the SDEs, we derive closed-form steady state distributions of the queue lengths, and then obtain the average delay performance with finite buffers. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed delay analysis is verified through simulation.}

	abstract = {The popularization of smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices has facilitated the development of fog/edge computing. However, these infrastructure-based service paradigms may fail to complete tasks successfully due to computation and communication overload, or damage in challenging scenarios such as disasters or traffic jams. Noticing that a crowd of devices with considerable idle resources could be available, we investigate the problems of addressing the computation and communication unavailability with peer assistance in this work. To this end, we propose a dispersed service framework for resource-exhausted scenarios that adaptively offloads users’ data to available network computation points. However, the users may not be able to achieve the offloading due to geographical hindrances. Consequently, the relay is introduced as a bridge for data offloading between the users and the network computation points. Furthermore, a game-based incentive-driven offloading mechanism is designed by analyzing and balancing the cost and gain factors of three main entities (users, relays, and network computation points). Considering the interactions among the entities, a two-level Stackelberg game is established for efficiently allocating potential computation resource, as well as balancing the utility conflicts due to the data offloading. Given the hierarchical interaction structure, the upper level game involves network computation points as followers and the relay as a leader, while the lower level game includes the relay as a follower and users as leaders. Moreover, to facilitate applicability in large-scale scenarios with multiple relays, we decompose multiple relays into multiple single relay problems using a tripartite matching strategy that assigns appropriate relays to users and network computation points. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed game-based incentive-driven mechanism and show that it outperforms the baselines in terms of the overall utilities of the involved entities and the average energy consumption of users.}

	abstract = {We investigate signaling and linear precoding designs for secure downlink communications in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) network. The network is tapped by an external eavesdropper (Eve) who is equipped with a large number of antennas. In addition to the transmission of several (unicast) information signals to downlink users (Bobs), the transmitter (Alice) generates friendly jamming (FJ), aiming to prevent Eve from decoding Alice’s signals. To mitigate both multiuser interference (MUI) and FJ on Bobs, MU-MIMO systems often rely on zero-forcing (ZF) precoders. A condition for the application of such precoders is that the network must be underloaded , i.e., Alice has more antennas than all Bobs combined. For overloaded scenarios, ZF-based precoding cannot guarantee nullification of both MUI and FJ at legitimate receivers. Accordingly, we propose a combined signaling-and-precoding scheme that can also be applied to an overloaded MU-MIMO network. In an underloaded scenario, our technique is shown to impose a more stringent antenna requirement on Eve than a classical ZF-based precoding, i.e., Eve must utilize more antennas if she is to successfully eavesdrop on Alice’s transmissions. Although our scheme is comparable to antenna selection (AS) approaches in terms of Eve’s antenna requirement, it incurs much less delay and complexity by avoiding frequent on/off switching of the RF chains at Bobs. For underloaded scenarios, we provide security analysis that establishes the conditions under which our scheme is superior to the ZF scheme. Using computer simulations, we validate the advantages of our design and contrast it with ZF and AS schemes in terms of the symbol error rate, the EVM, and the achievable rate in both underloaded and overloaded scenarios.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective and energy-efficient technique for 6G. By adjusting the phase shifts of passive reflecting elements, RIS is capable of suppressing the interference and combining the desired signals constructively at receivers, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of communication system. In this paper, we consider a green multi-user multi-antenna cellular network, where multiple RISs are deployed to provide energy-efficient communication service to end users. We jointly optimize the phase shifts of RISs, beamforming of the base stations, and the active RIS set with the aim of minimizing the power consumption of the base station (BS) and RISs subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints of users and the transmit power constraint of the BS. However, the problem is mixed combinatorial and non-convex, and there is a potential infeasibility issue when the QoS constraints cannot be guaranteed by all users. To deal with the infeasibility issue, we further investigate a user admission control problem to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, RIS phase shifts, and the admitted user set. A unified alternating optimization (AO) framework is then proposed to solve both the power minimization and user admission control problems. Specifically, we first decompose the original non-convex problem into several rank-one constrained optimization subproblems via matrix lifting. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is then developed to solve each decomposed subproblem. The proposed AO framework efficiently minimizes the power consumption of wireless networks as well as user admission control when the QoS constraints cannot be guaranteed by all users. To further address the complexity-sensitive issue for practical implementation, we propose an alternative low-complexity beamforming and RISs phase shifts design algorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) to enable the green cellular networks.}

In this paper, we study DPC-based hybrid precoding to maximize the sum-rate of a massive MIMO (mMIMO) downlink broadcast channel, subject to the constant modulus constraint of the analog phase shifter network (PSN). Using the duality between a massive MIMO broadcast channel (mMIMO-BC) and a massive MIMO multiple access channel (mMIMO-MAC), we propose to first optimize the transmitters and the hybrid receiver for the mMIMO-MAC, before obtaining the hybrid precoder of mMIMO-BC according to the MAC-BC duality. The algorithm is also extended for mMIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over broadband frequency-selectivity channels. Numerical results show that the proposed DPC-based hybrid precoding can significantly outperform the existing linear counterpart, especially in the case of numerous users. In simulations based on the 5G new radio (5G-NR) standard, the relative gain of the proposed scheme appears prominent, which suggests that the DPC can be a worthy candidate for the future generation of wireless communications.}

Hierarchical streams that transmit a subset of possible streams of encoded messages are proposed for rate splitting and analyzed. To reduce precoding complexity, RSMA with interference nulling (RSMA-IN), that nulls the portion of interference that is not decoded is investigated by formulating a sum rate maximization problem subject to a total power constraint. To solve this non-convex problem, a method that combines interference nulling and stream SNR maximization is proposed. A convex upper bound problem is formulated for the sum rate to compare existing algorithms, and conditions under which the upper bound problem is tight are determined. Taking advantage of the tight cases, we propose an upper bound aided (UBA) enhancement of existing precoding designs by exploiting optimal solutions in the tight cases. It is also shown that the existing augmented weighted mean square error (AWMSE) algorithms cannot converge to a local optimum in sum rate maximization.

	abstract = {This paper considers a wireless uplink network consisting of multiple end devices and an access point (AP). Each device monitors a physical process with randomly generated status updates and sends these update packets to the AP in the uplink. The AP aims to schedule the transmissions of these devices to optimize the network-wide information freshness, quantified by the age of information (AoI) metric. Due to the stochastic arrival of the status updates at end devices, the AP only has partial observations of system times of the latest status update packets at end devices when making scheduling decisions. Such a decision-making problem can be naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We reformulate the POMDP into an equivalent belief Markov decision process (belief-MDP), by defining fully observable belief states of the POMDP as the states of the belief-MDP. The belief-MDP in its original form is difficult to solve as the dimension of its states can go to infinity and its belief space is uncountable. Fortunately, by carefully leveraging the properties of the status update arrival processes (i.e., Bernoulli processes), we manage to simplify the belief-MDP substantially, where every feasible state is characterized by a two-dimensional vector. Based on the simplified belief-MDP, we devise a low-complexity scheduling policy, termed Partially Observing Max-Weight (POMW) policy, for the formulated AoI-oriented scheduling problem. We derive upper bounds for the time-average AoI performance of the proposed POMW policy. We analyze the performance guarantee for the POMW policy by comparing its performance with a universal lower bound available in the literature. Numerical results validate our analyses and demonstrate that the performance gap between the POMW policy and its fully observable counterpart is proportional to the inverse of the lowest arrival rate of all end devices.}

	abstract = {Most IoT systems use random access protocols for wireless communication. This paper considers an IoT node that generates periodic traffic to be delivered to a destination over a random access network; each packet of the node is expected to be delivered before its deadline. We say that the node is in a stressed period if, within a time interval, its successive packets miss their deadlines. In many systems, the worst-case performance is significantly affected by stressed periods. Characterizing the stochastic properties of stressed periods is thus of fundamental importance. In this paper, we use a fluid flow model to approximate the evolution of the buffer occupancy (i.e., backlog) at the transmitting node. We derive a relationship between buffer occupancy and delay and formally define a stressed period via a time interval in which the buffer occupancy exceeds a certain threshold. With this model, we analyze the dynamics of the buffer occupancy evolution and obtain the probability distributions of stressed period duration and delay. Real network experiments show that our model can well approximate the distributions of stressed period duration and delay in practical WiFi networks. The theoretical results of this paper can be used to analyze the robustness and worst-case performance of IoT monitoring and control systems built on random access networks.}

	abstract = {With explosively escalating service demands, beyond fifth generation (B5G) aims to realize various requirements for multi-service networks, i.e., higher performance of mixed enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services than 5G. To flexibly serve diverse traffic, various functional split options (FSOs) are specified by 5G protocols enabling different network functions. In order to improve signal qualities for edge users, we consider flexible FSO (FFS) based coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission as a prominent technique capable of supporting high traffic demands. However, due to conventional confined hardware processing capability, a processor sharing (PS) model is introduced to deal with high latency for multi-service FSO-based networks. Therefore, it becomes essential to assign CoMP-enhanced functional split modes under PS model. A more tractable FSO-based network in terms of ergodic rate and reliability is derived by stochastic geometry approach. Moreover, we have proposed CoMP-enhanced functional split mode allocation (CFSMA) scheme to adaptively assign FSOs to provide enhanced mixed throughput and latency-aware services. The simulation results have validated analytical derivation and demonstrated that the proposed CFSMA scheme optimizes system spectrum efficiency while guaranteeing stringent latency requirement. The proposed CFSMA scheme with the designed PS FFS-CoMP system outperforms the benchmarks of conventional FCFS scheduling, non-FSO network, fixed FSOs, and limited available FSO selections in open literature.}

	abstract = {Emerging Internet of Things applications pursue both data timeliness and fidelity at the fusion center (FC), raising challenges for network design. This work investigates the optimal node number achieving the best timeliness-fidelity tradeoff. Specifically, we consider a wireless network where homogeneous sensors observe one source simultaneously and deliver their observations to the FC over orthogonal block fading channels. Two scenarios are considered: The FC waits for observations from all nodes and the FC waits for observations from partial nodes. We evaluate the data timeliness and fidelity using the age of information (AoI) and the mean squared error (MSE), respectively. We first present a tight approximation of the average AoI in closed-form and derive a tight lower bound on the MSE of the sensing system. Then, sub-optimal numbers of sensor nodes minimizing a weighted-sum of the average AoI and the MSE are obtained in closed-forms for both scenarios based on high signal-to-noise ratio regime analysis. Iteration algorithms are further provided to approach the optimums. It is shown that the optimal partial number of nodes is proportional to the square root of total number of nodes asymptotically. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the solutions in improving the timeliness-fidelity tradeoff.}

	abstract = {Stream media content caching is a key enabling technology to promote the value chain of future urban vehicular networks. Nevertheless, the high mobility of vehicles, intermittency of information transmissions, high dynamics of user requests, limited caching capacities and extreme complexity of business scenarios pose an enormous challenge to content caching and distribution in vehicular networks. To tackle this problem, this paper aims to design a novel edge-computing-enabled hierarchical cooperative caching framework. Firstly, we profoundly analyze the spatio-temporal correlation between the historical vehicle trajectory of user requests and construct the system model to predict the vehicle trajectory and content popularity, which lays a foundation for mobility-aware content caching and dispatching. Meanwhile, we probe into privacy protection strategies to realize privacy-preserved prediction model. Furthermore, based on trajectory and popular content prediction results, content caching strategy is studied, and adaptive and dynamic resource management schemes are proposed for hierarchical cooperative caching networks. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the superiority of our proposed scheme and algorithms. It shows that the proposed algorithms effectively improve the performance of the considered system in terms of hit ratio and average delay, and narrow the gap to the optimal caching scheme comparing with the traditional schemes.}

	abstract = {Topological subsystem color codes (TSCCs) are an important class of topological subsystem codes that allow for syndrome measurement with only 2-body measurements. It is expected that such low complexity measurements can help in fault tolerance. While TSCCs have been studied over depolarizing noise model, their performance over the erasure channel has not been studied as much. Recently, we proposed erasure decoders for TSCCs and reported a threshold of 9.7%. In this paper, we continue our study of TSCCS over the erasure channel. We propose two erasure decoders for topological subsystem color codes. These decoders employ a mapping of the TSCCs to topological color codes (TCCs). In addition, these decoders use the technique of gauge fixing, where some of the gauge operators of the subsystem code are promoted to stabilizers. We perform gauge fixing using 4-body and 8-body gauge operators. With partial gauge fixing, we obtained a threshold of 17.7% on a TSCC derived from the square octagon lattice. Using an order maximal gauge fixing decoder we were able to improve the threshold to 44%. The performance of the order maximal gauge fixing decoder can be further improved to close to 50% in conjunction with an optimal erasure decoder for topolological color codes. We also study the correctability of erasures on the subsystem codes.}

In the improved model, the output signal follows Gaussian distribution, but its variance is signal-dependent. Two different methods are proposed to obtain lower and upper bounds on the secrecy rate of the strong user for direct transmission. Under some constraints, closed-form expressions of the lower and upper bounds on secrecy rate regions for various (trusted cooperative half-duplex) relaying schemes are derived. Moreover, the scenarios of blockage/outside coverage are included, and the relevant security performances are discussed. Numerical results show that the lower and upper bounds on secrecy rate regions are tight enough, and the cooperative jamming is superior over other relaying schemes.}

	abstract = {The emerging intelligent transparent surface (ITS), unlike the intelligent reflection surface (IRS), allows incident signals to penetrate it instead of being reflected, which enables the ITS to combat the severe signal penetration loss for high-speed railway (HSR) wireless communications. This paper thus investigates the channel estimation problem where the ITS is attached to the HSR carriage window. We first propose a new transmission scheme with two pilot blocks for each frame. Second, we formulate the channels as functions of physical parameters and thus transform the problem into a parameter recovery problem. Third, we develop a successive closed-form, maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, each estimate is expressed as the sum of its perfectly known value and the estimation error. By leveraging the relationship between channels for the two pilot blocks, we eliminate the unknown parameters besides Doppler shifts, which can be thereby recovered. With the reconstructed Doppler-induced phase shifts, we acquire other channel parameters. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for each parameter is derived as a performance benchmark. Finally, we provide numerical results to establish the effectiveness of our proposed estimators.}

We optimize the non-convex global energy efficiency metric for this FD system by using the minorization-maximization (MM) framework, which transforms the optimization into a sequence of surrogate concave problems. We construct a novel surrogate function to exploit the MM framework. We numerically characterize the effect of FD interference on Rayleigh- and Rician-faded mMIMO networks, and show the higher immunity of the latter to the FD interference. We also show the SE gain provided by the dynamic ADC/DAC architecture which allows us to judiciously choose ADC/DAC resolution, while reducing the power consumption.}

	abstract = {Full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has great potential in future vehicular networks. However, the FD requirement and the ISAC functions make the receiver processing extremely complicated, particularly when multiple transmissions are uncoordinated. In this paper, we study frequency-hopping (FH) based receivers in an FD ISAC system, where the arrivals of backscattered signals from one node may overlap with those of signals from another node. To mitigate the interferences caused by the overlapping signals, we consider two receiver options based on either conventional communications or frequency-modulated continuous-wave radars, and two signal modulations based on either fast FH or un-slotted ALOHA FH. Based on the different signal modulations, we develop two parameter estimation schemes via using FH-decoding and de-chirp operations, respectively. To further improve the sensing accuracy, we proceed to propose an iterative algorithm, which refines the estimates of all parameters via using short-time-Fourier transform and maximizing the received power in desired frequency bands. After obtaining all channel parameters in sensing, bilateral communications between two nodes are realized by differential phase-shift keying. Finally, simulation results are provided and verify that the proposed FD ISAC can obtain parameters in high resolution and realize robust communication links.}

The double-RIS is distributed on the surface of buildings can assist the UAV transmitter to reflect its own signals to the ground receiver (GR), and simultaneously enhance the propagation by passive beamforming on the RISs. In the proposed channel model, we derive the path power gains for different propagation links between the UAV and GR, thus enabling the proposed channel model to effectively characterize both large- and small-scale fading characteristics of realistic UAV-to-ground communication systems. Furthermore, we derive the critical propagation properties of the proposed channel model, including the spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), and frequency correlation functions (FCFs), with respect to different RIS reflection phase configurations as well as different RIS orientation angles. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the propagation characteristics of the proposed double-RIS assisted UAV-to-ground channel model behave better than those of traditional channel models with single-RIS link or LoS link, thereby validating the necessity of introducing double-RIS into UAV-to-ground communication.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of wireless communication technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently paved the way to augmenting the performance of wireless networks with the aid of multiple reflecting surfaces by efficiently attuning the signal reflection through a large number of low-cost passive elements. In this paper, we consider an RIS-aided full-duplex (FD) communication network consisting of a FD access point (AP) that communicates with an uplink and a downlink user simultaneously with the aid of an RIS as well as through the direct link between the AP and users. To evaluate the system performance under infinite blocklength (IBL) and finite blocklength (FBL) codes, we derive the analytical expressions for the outage probability and throughput in case of IBL, and for block-error rate (BLER) and goodput in the case of FBL, for both uplink and downlink transmission. Furthermore, the expressions for the maximum achievable rate under FBL and IBL transmission are derived. Next, we also extend the analysis of the single-user framework to a more practical scenario with multiple users utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and derive analytical expressions for the outage probability and BLER at each downlink user and at the AP. The accuracy of the derived expressions is validated via simulation results, and insights are provided regarding the impact of the number of reflecting elements and imperfect channel state information (CSI) on the performance of the considered system. Finally, from the comparative analysis, it is shown that the RIS-aided system outperforms the system without RIS in both IBL and FBL scenarios, providing remarkable improvement in the outage probability and BLER.}

	abstract = {In mobile edge computing (MEC) supporting multiple mobile users (MUs), it is essential to optimize the offloading policy and communication and computation resource allocation. A main challenge is that the computation burden of a computation task may be random and even with uncertain probabilistic distribution. To address this challenge, we investigate a multiple-MU MEC system with random computation burden. For the random computation burden of an MU, only the mean and variance are known, but its distribution is unknown. Robustness is provided such that computation outage probabilities (due to uncertain distribution of computation burden) are bounded by a predefined threshold. We minimize the weighted sum of the MUs’ energy consumption. The formulated optimization problem is non-deterministic and non-convex, and thus, is hard to solve. To deal with the challenge, we transform the formulated problem into a deterministic and convex problem by applying the Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality and some mathematical manipulations. We further decompose the convex problem to a lower-level and an upper-level problem. Low-complexity algorithms are developed for the lower-level and upper-level problems. The overall complexity of our proposed method is linear with the number of MUs.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted half-duplex (HD) cooperative rate-splitting multiple access (C-RSMA) networks. The proposed system model is built up considering one base station (BS), one RIS, and two users. With the goal of minimizing the network energy consumption, a joint framework to optimize the precoding vectors at the BS, common stream split, relaying device transmit power, the time slot allocation, and the passive beamforming at the RIS subject to the power budget constraints at both the BS and the relaying node, the quality of service (QoS) constraints at both users, and a common stream rate constraint is proposed. The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem due to the high coupling among the optimization variables. To tackle this challenge, an efficient algorithm is presented by invoking the alternating optimization (AO) technique, which decomposes the original problem into two sub-problems; namely, sub-problem-1 and sub-problem-2, which are alternatively solved. Specifically, sub-problem-1 jointly optimizes the precoding vectors, common stream split, and relaying device power. Meanwhile, sub-problem-2 is to optimize the phase shift matrix at the RIS. In order to solve sub-problem-1, an efficient low-complexity solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed. Meanwhile, and with the aid of difference-of-convex (DC) rank-one representation and the SCA approach, an efficient solution for the phase shift matrix at the RIS is obtained. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted HD C-RSMA achieves a significant gain in minimizing the total energy consumption compared to the RIS-assisted RSMA scheme, RIS-assisted HD cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA), RIS-assisted NOMA, HD C-RSMA without RIS, and HD C-NOMA without RIS.}

	abstract = {In this paper, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is investigated in the multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) system to improve the computation rate. Compared with traditional RIS-aided MEC, STAR-RIS extends the service coverage from half-space to full-space and provides new flexibility for improving the computation rate for end users. However, the STAR-RIS-aided MEC system design is a challenging problem due to the non-smooth and non-convex binary amplitude coefficients with coupled phase shifters. To fill this gap, this paper formulates a computation rate maximization problem via the joint design of the STAR-RIS phase shifts, reflection and transmission amplitude coefficients, the receive beamforming vectors, and energy partition strategies for local computing and offloading. To tackle the discontinuity caused by binary variables, we propose an efficient smoothing-based method to decrease convergence error, in contrast to the conventional penalty-based method, which brings many undesired stationary points and local optima. Furthermore, a fast iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain a stationary point for the joint optimization problem, with each subproblem solved by a low-complexity algorithm, making the proposed design scalable to a massive number of users and STAR-RIS elements. Simulation results validate the strength of the proposed smoothing-based method and show that the proposed fast iterative algorithm achieves a higher computation rate than the conventional method while saving the computation time by at least an order of magnitude. Moreover, the resultant STAR-RIS-aided MEC system significantly improves the computation rate compared to other baseline schemes with conventional reflect-only/transmit-only RIS.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a power allocation algorithm to guarantee quality of experience (QoE) while considering the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) in multi-connectivity multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Multi-connectivity is a promising solution for wireless technologies to fulfill ever-increasing demands for QoE via massive MIMO. However, the performance of MIMO systems mostly depends on the accuracy of the channel estimation algorithm that provides CSI. Under imperfect CSI scenarios, increasing transmit power to satisfy QoE for one user exacerbates interference with others, thus leading to a tradeoff between power consumption and user satisfaction. To guarantee QoE while minimizing transmission power under imperfect CSI, the effect of imperfect CSI is quantified, and a closed form signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is derived. Then, a two-stage algorithm categorizes UEs into two groups: those that only need single connectivity and those that need dual connectivity (i.e., adaptive connectivity). After classification, transmission power is allocated to guarantee QoE via a power control strategy that minimizes the transmission power. By comparing performance with a single connectivity–based algorithm and fixed multi-connectivity–based algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm not only satisfies all the UEs in the system but also consumes less transmission power than the benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Backscatter communication (BackCom), one of the core technologies to realize zero-power communication, is expected to be a pivotal paradigm for the next generation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the “strong” direct link (DL) interference (DLI) is traditionally assumed to be harmful, and generally drowns out the “weak” backscattered signals accordingly, thus deteriorating the performance of BackCom. In contrast to the previous efforts to eliminate the DLI, in this paper, we exploit the constructive interference (CI), in which the DLI contributes to the backscattered signal. To be specific, our objective is to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming vectors and tag selection factors under different detection error probability (DEP) requirements, which leads to two different optimization problems. However, the resulting problems are non-convex and unanalyzable due to constraints on the DEP. To solve these problems, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is first applied to transform the DEP into a tractable form. Then, inspired by the alternating optimization, we respectively propose two successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithms to solve the corresponding sub-problems with beamforming design, and a greedy algorithm to solve the sub-problem with tag selection. In order to gain insight into the CI, we consider a special case with the single-antenna reader to reveal the channel angle between the backscattering link (BL) and the DL, in which the DLI will become constructive. Simulation results show that significant performance gain can always be achieved with the proposed algorithms compared to the traditional algorithms without the CI in terms of the received SNR. The derived constructive channel angle for the BackCom system with a single-antenna reader is also confirmed by simulation results.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the resource allocation and computation offloading problem for multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems, where multiple mobile users (MUs) equipped with multiple antennas access the base station in a non-orthogonal multiple access manner. We jointly optimize the offloading ratio, computational frequency and transmit precoding matrix of each MU to minimize the total energy consumption of all MUs while satisfying the latency constraints. The problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and a two-layer iterative method is proposed to solve the problem efficiently with low complexity. Specifically, we first decompose the original problem into several subproblems, and then sequentially solve these subproblems in an alternative fashion. Furthermore, we also discuss the optimal decoding order of MUs under two different scenarios. Firstly, when the MUs’ channel conditions are similar, by deriving closed-form expressions for energy consumptions of all MUs, we prove that the optimal decoding order is only determined by the latency requirements. On the other hand, when the MUs’ channel conditions are different, we show that the optimal decoding order is determined by both the channel conditions and the latency requirements. As such, we propose a metric aiming to balance the effects of channel conditions and latency requirements on the MUs’ decoding order. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive user pairing (AUP) scheme in multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. In the AUP scheme, two users with different channel conditions are selected for user pairing while multiple IRSs assist to improve received signal quality at users. We consider the problem of jointly optimizing the precoding matrix, the phase shift of IRSs, and the user pairing element to maximize the overall spectral efficiency (SE) subject to the maximum power budget at the base station (BS) and user-specific quality-of-service (QoS). The SE problem formulated as the maximization of non-concave functions involves a mixed-integer program, which is very challenging to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we first relax the user pairing elements to be continuous and then transform the formulated problem into an equivalent non-convex problem with a more tractable form. We then apply the iterative algorithm (IA) with low complexity to guarantee convergence at a relative optimum. Towards real-time optimization, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to predict the optimal solution of the precoding matrix, the phase shift of IRSs, and user pairing elements according to the user’s locations and channel gains. Compared to the conventional optimization method, the DL-based optimization framework can achieve the optimal solution within a very short time via an efficient inference process. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm improves the SE over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the effects of essential parameters such as the total BS transmit power, the number of UEs, IRSs, and BS’s antennas on the system are discussed and evaluated to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in balancing resource utilization.}

	abstract = {The stringent timing and reliability requirements in mission-critical applications require a detailed statistical characterization of end-to-end latency. Teleoperation is a representative use case, in which a human operator (HO) remotely controls a robot by exchanging command and feedback signals. We present a framework to analyze the latency of a closed-loop teleoperation system consisting of three entities: an HO, a robot located in remote environment, and a Base Station (BS) with Mobile edge Computing (MEC) capabilities. A model of each component is used to analyze the closed-loop latency and optimize the compression strategy. The closed-form expression of the distribution of the closed-loop latency is difficult to estimate, such that suitable upper and lower bounds are obtained. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem to minimize the closed-loop latency. Using the obtained upper and lower bound on the closed-loop latency, a computationally efficient procedure to optimize the closed-loop latency is presented. The simulation results reveal that compression of sensing data is not always beneficial, while system design based on average performance leads to under-provisioning and may cause performance degradation. The applicability of the proposed analysis is much wider than teleoperation, including a large class of systems whose latency budget consists of many components.}

	abstract = {Spectrum maps are of crucial importance for realizing efficient spectrum management in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks. However, existing spectrum map construction schemes mainly depend on spatial interpolation or just simply exploit the frequency correlation and cannot accurately construct the spectrum map when measurement data at the target frequency are not available. To overcome this challenge, we propose two accurate spectrum map construction schemes using different intelligent frequency-spatial reasoning methods. The frequency correlation among different spectrum maps at different frequencies is fully exploited to construct highly accurate spectrum maps of the frequencies without spectrum data by combining the joint frequency-spatial spectrum representation method with deep learning data-driven techniques. Specifically, a joint three-dimensional spectrum representation model is established and both a novel autoencoder network and a novel conditional generative adversarial network suitable for processing the three-dimensional spectrum data are proposed to realize the intelligent frequency-spatial reasoning. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are superior to the benchmark schemes in terms of the spectrum map construction accuracy. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed neural networks have a fast convergence speed, which achieves a better tradeoff between the computation efficiency and the construction accuracy.}

	abstract = {Reverse analysis of the intercepted signal to reconstruct the communication scheme used by the transmitter is a key problem in the non-cooperative context. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the joint blind reconstruction of the cyclic codes and self-synchronous scramblers directly using soft-decision sequences. First, we derive the conclusion that if the parity polynomial of the factor of the generator polynomial of the cyclic code and the feedback polynomial of the self-synchronous scrambler are multiplied, then the vector corresponding to the inverse polynomial of this product forms a parity-check relation with the row vector of the self-synchronously scrambled cyclic code bit matrix, which is constructed by the sequence of self-synchronously scrambled cyclic codes. To detect this parity-check relation, the concept of average parity-check probability (APCP) is defined, which uses the intercepted soft-decision sequence to measure the reliability of the parity-check relation. An optimal threshold based on the minimum error criterion is then derived. When the APCP is greater than this optimal threshold, the parity-check relation is considered to be detected, i.e., the corresponding irreducible polynomial is a factor of the generator polynomial of the cyclic code and the corresponding candidate feedback polynomial is the feedback polynomial of the self-synchronous scrambler. Therefore, the blind reconstruction problem in this paper is exactly equivalent to the hypothesis-testing problem. Simulation results show that the algorithm is more fault-tolerant than existing algorithms in noisy environments.}

In this paper, by benefiting from the polarization and guessing techniques, we prove that the required computation in sequential decoding of pre-transformed polar codes polarizes, and this polarization determines which set of bit positions within the rate profile may result in high computational complexity. Based on this, we propose a technique for taming the Reed-Muller (RM) rate-profile construction, and the performance results demonstrate that the error-correction performance of the PAC codes can achieve the theoretical bounds using the tamed-RM rate-profile construction and requires a significantly lower computational complexity than the RM rate-profile construction.}

To achieve ultra-reliable communications beyond 99.999%, this paper envisions a new interaction-based communication paradigm that exploits feedback from the receiver. We present AttentionCode, a new class of feedback codes leveraging deep learning (DL) technologies. The underpinnings of AttentionCode are three architectural innovations: AttentionNet, input restructuring, and adaptation to fading channels, accompanied by several training methods, including large-batch training, distributed learning, look-ahead optimizer, training-test signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mismatch, and curriculum learning. The training methods can potentially be generalized to other wireless communication applications with machine learning. Numerical experiments verify that AttentionCode establishes a new state of the art among all DL-based feedback codes in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and fading channels. In AWGN channels with noiseless feedback, for example, AttentionCode achieves a block error rate (BLER) of 10−7 when the forward channel SNR is 0 dB for a block size of 50 bits, demonstrating the potential of AttentionCode to provide ultra-reliable short-packet communications.}

	abstract = {Extremely low-latency communication has attracted considerable recent attention because it holds the promise of supporting emerging real-time applications such as autonomous driving, smart grids, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Owing to the limited bandwidth in wireless environments, the sub-packets or even bits have to be transmitted successively, thereby inducing non-negligible delay-induced cost for real-time remote monitoring, estimation, decision making, and control. In this paper, we present a unified incremental decoding framework for real-time applications, the costs of which are extremely sensitive to the latency of each individual sub-packet or bit. In contrast to conventional methods, in which a decision is made after fully decoding the entire packet, the incremental decoding strategy allows monitors or actors to make their decisions in real time based on partially received packet. By this means, there is no need to wait for the whole packet to be decoded, thereby reducing the delay-induced costs substantially. To minimize cumulative cost during the real-time monitoring and control, we design source coding and decision making algorithms jointly, in which a backward induction property is found. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic programming algorithm for a given source codebook to significantly reduce the cumulative decision costs while maintaining low computational complexity.}

In this paper, we derive the conditional SEP expressions of MPSK signals in terms of Gaussian\nQ\nand Owen's\nT\nfunctions by changing the domain of integration from a plane bounded by two rays into a quadrant. By weighting the conditional SEP expressions according to average distance spectrum, the closed-form BEP expressions of MPSK signals over AWGN channel are obtained. Only two summations involving two parameters are required. The closed-form BEP expressions of MPSK signals over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channel are derived by using the BEP expressions over AWGN channel and the moment generating function-based approach. The approximate BEP expressions of MPSK signals over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channel are obtained by using elementary functions-based approximations of Gaussian\nQ\nand Owen’s\nT\nfunctions. The conciseness and computational complexity of our BEP expressions are verified by the comparison with existing results.}

Furthermore, a novel pilot-aided Bayesian learning (PA-BL) technique is conceived for the channel state information (CSI) estimation of SISO OTFS systems based on the expectation-maximization (EM) technique. Subsequently, a data-aided Bayesian learning (DA-BL)-based joint CSI estimation and data detection technique is proposed, which beneficially harnesses the estimated data symbols for improved CSI estimation. In this scenario our sophisticated data detection rule also integrates the CSI uncertainty of channel estimation into our the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detectors. The AP-SIP framework is also extended to MIMO OTFS systems, wherein the DD-domain input matrix is affine-precoded for each transmit antenna (TA). Then an EM algorithm-based PA-BL scheme is derived for simultaneous row-group sparse CSI estimation for this system, followed also by our data-aided DA-BL scheme that performs joint CSI estimation and data detection. Moreover, the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bounds (BCRBs) are also derived for both SISO as well as MIMO OTFS systems. Finally, simulation results are presented for characterizing the performance of the proposed CSI estimation techniques in a range of typical settings along with their bit error rate (BER) performance in comparison to an ideal system having perfect CSI.}

	abstract = {Molecular Communication via Diffusion (MCvD) is a prominent small-scale technology, which roots from the nature. With solid analytical foundations on channel response and advanced modulation techniques, molecular single-input-single-output (SISO) systems are one of the most studied molecular networks in the literature. However, the literature is yet to provide sufficient analytical channel modeling on molecular multiple-output systems with fully absorbing receivers, one of the common applications in the area. In this paper, a channel model for molecular single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) systems is proposed for estimating the channel response of such systems. With the model’s recursive nature, the closed-form solution of the channel response of molecular 2-Rx SIMO systems is analytically derived. A simplified model with lower complexity is also presented at a cost of slightly less accurate channel estimation. The models are extended to the molecular SIMO systems with more than two receivers. The performance of the methods are evaluated for several topologies with different parameters, and the accuracy of the model is verified by comparing to computer-simulated channel estimations in terms of quantitative error metrics such as root-mean-squared error. The performance of the simplified model is verified by the amount of deviation, indicating sufficient channel modeling performance with reduced computational power.}

	abstract = {Taking inspiration from linguistics, the communications theoretical community has recently shown a significant recent interest in pragmatic, or goal-oriented, communication. In this paper, we tackle the problem of pragmatic communication with multiple clients with different, and potentially conflicting, objectives. We capture the goal-oriented aspect through the metric of Value of Information (VoI), which considers the estimation of the remote process as well as the timing constraints. However, the most common definition of VoI is simply the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the whole system state, regardless of the relevance for a specific client. Our work aims to overcome this limitation by including different summary statistics, i.e., value functions of the state, for separate clients, and a diversified query process on the client side, expressed through the fact that different applications may request different functions of the process state at different times. A query-aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution based on statically defined VoI can outperform naive approaches by 15-20%.}

	abstract = {Visual perception is an effective way to obtain the spatial characteristics of wireless channels and to reduce the overhead for communications system. A critical problem for the visual assistance is that the communications system needs to match the radio signal with the visual information of the corresponding user, i.e., to identify the visual user that corresponds to the target radio signal from all the environmental objects. In this paper, we propose a user matching method for environment with a variable number of objects. Specifically, we apply 3D detection to extract all the environmental objects from the images taken by multiple cameras. Then, we design a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the location distribution of users by the images and beam pairs at multiple moments, and thereby identify the users from all the extracted environmental objects. Moreover, we present a resource allocation method based on the taken images to reduce the time and spectrum overhead compared to traditional resource allocation methods. Simulation results show that the proposed user matching method outperforms the existing methods, and the proposed resource allocation method can achieve 92% transmission rate of the traditional resource allocation method but with the time and spectrum overhead significantly reduced.}

In contrast, split learning (SL) can reduce the computing load of devices by model splitting and assignment. To take advantage of FL and SL, we propose a hybrid federated split learning (HFSL) framework for wireless networks in this paper, which combines the multi-worker collaborative training of FL and the flexible splitting of SL. To reduce the computational idleness in model splitting, we design a parallel computing scheme for model splitting without label sharing and conduct a theoretical analysis of the impact of the delayed gradient on the convergence. Aiming to obtain the trade-off between the training time and energy consumption, we model the joint optimization problem of splitting decisions, the bandwidth, and computing resources as a multi-objective problem. As such, we propose a predictive generative adversarial network (GAN)-powered multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain the Pareto front of the problem, which utilizes the discriminator to guide the training of the generator to predict promising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the considered baselines in finding Pareto optimal solutions, and the solutions obtained from the proposed HFSL framework can dominate the solution of FL.}

	abstract = {Recently, federated learning (FL), which replaces data sharing with model sharing, has emerged as an efficient and privacy-friendly machine learning (ML) paradigm. One of the main challenges in FL is the huge communication cost for model aggregation. Many compression/quantization schemes have been proposed to reduce the communication cost for model aggregation. However, the following question remains unanswered: What is the fundamental trade-off between the communication cost and the FL convergence performance? In this paper, we manage to answer this question. Specifically, we first put forth a general framework for model aggregation performance analysis based on the rate-distortion theory. Under the proposed analysis framework, we derive an inner bound of the rate-distortion region of model aggregation. We then conduct an FL convergence analysis to connect the aggregation distortion and the FL convergence performance. We formulate an aggregation distortion minimization problem to improve the FL convergence performance. Two algorithms are developed to solve the above problem. Numerical results on aggregation distortion, convergence performance, and communication cost demonstrate that the baseline model aggregation schemes still have great potential for further improvement.}

Specifically, the encoder of the proposed JPDCE scheme is composed of two sub-networks which are used for pilot location assignment and pilot power allocation, respectively. To ensure accurate learning of the pilots, the OFDM block consisting of intelligently customized layers is designed to constrain the output of the encoder. Furthermore, the decoder is used to learn the channel state information (CSI) based on the output of OFDM layers by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. The numerical results indicate that the JPDCE scheme considerably outperforms the traditional methods as well as two state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based ones, demonstrating its excellent ability to learn the statistical characteristics of the wireless channel. In addition, we demonstrate that the JPDCE scheme shows excellent robustness against various channel distortion and interference: when 1) there are limited pilots; 2) the cyclic prefix (CP) is removed; and/or 3) clipping noise is introduced.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (OAC) is a promising technology that can achieve rapid model aggregation by utilizing the wireless waveform superposition feature to harness the interference of multiple-access channel for wireless federated learning (FL). However, OAC-based aggregation for OAC faces critical security challenges due to unfavorable and wireless broadcast properties, such as privacy leaks and eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we propose to utilize an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to support covert OAC-based FL. We first derive the optimal condition for covertness in OAC with IRS and formulate a joint optimization problem to select the maximum covert devices participating in the model aggregation while satisfying the mean squared error (MSE) requirement. We then design a covert difference-of-convex-functions program (CDC) to efficiently determine the transmission power of the device, aggregation beamforming of base station (BS), phase shifts, and reflection amplitudes at the IRS. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve significant performance gain compared to the baseline algorithms by deploying IRS into covert OAC-based FL.}

However, in the presence of intricate constraints, e.g., users’ quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction becomes a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework to solve the classical power control problem in a multi-user interference channel, where the objective is to maximize the network sum-rate under users’ minimum data rate or QoS requirements and power budget constraints. Utilizing a differentiable projection function, two novel deep learning (DL) solutions are pursued. The first is called Deep Implicit Projection Network (DIPNet), and the second is called Deep Explicit Projection Network (DEPNet). DIPNet utilizes a differentiable convex optimization layer to implicitly define a projection function. On the other hand, DEPNet uses an explicitly-defined projection function, which has an iterative nature and relies on a differentiable correction process. DIPNet requires convex constraints; whereas, the DEPNet does not require convexity and has a reduced computational complexity. To enhance the sum-rate performance of the proposed models even further, Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) has been applied to the output of the proposed models. Extensive simulations depict that the proposed DNN solutions not only improve the achievable data rate but also achieve zero constraint violation probability, compared to the existing DNNs. The proposed solutions outperform the classic optimization methods in terms of computation time complexity.}

We jointly optimize the precoding at the access points (APs) and the phase shifts at multiple RISs to maximize the worst-case sum rate of the CF system subject to the constraints of maximum transmit power of APs, unit-modulus phase shifts, limited backhaul capacity, and bounded CSI errors. By applying a series of transformations, the non-smoothness and semi-infinite constraints are tackled in a low-complexity manner that facilitates the design of an alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm. The proposed algorithm divides the considered problem into two subproblems. For the RIS phase shifts optimization subproblem, we exploit the penalty convex-concave procedure (P-CCP) to obtain a stationary solution and achieve effective initialization. For precoding optimization subproblem, successive convex approximation (SCA) is adopted with a convergence guarantee to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming design, which achieves superior performance with low complexity. Moreover, the importance of RIS phase shift optimization for robustness and the advantages of distributed RISs in the CF system are further highlighted.}

More specifically, we consider the selection of RISs based on the outdated and imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the composite UAV-RIS-User channels at the UAV. After selection process, the UAV communicates to the user via the selected RISs and also with the direct link. Particularly, we derive an infinite series based expression for selection probability of RISs under both the outdated and imperfect CSI of composite channels based selection scheme. We also derive the statistical distribution of instantaneously received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under outdated and imperfect CSI conditions of both the direct and composite links at the user. Next, using the derived statistics, we analyze the network’s performance in terms of the average coverage probability (ACP) and average bit error rate (ABER) over the complete UAV flight time. Moreover, we discuss the behavior of ACP and ABER for very small and very large values of UAV transmit power, respectively. It is depicted through numerical results that selecting more RISs from a group of small-sized RISs may not be as advantageous as selecting fewer RISs from a group of large-sized RISs. Moreover, we also demonstrate the effect of several system parameters such as number of RIS reflecting elements, number of selected RISs, the severity of UAV-RIS and RIS-User links, and the severity of imperfect and outdated CSI on the network’s performance. The analytical results are corroborated with Monte-Carlo simulations.}

In this paper, coded random access (CRA) with massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is investigated as a solution to design highly-scalable massive multiple access protocols, taking into account stringent requirements on latency and reliability. With a focus on signal processing aspects at the physical layer and their impact on the overall system performance, critical issues of successive interference cancellation (SIC) over fading channels are first analyzed. Then, SIC algorithms and a scheduler are proposed that can overcome some of the limitations of the current access protocols. The effectiveness of the proposed processing algorithms is validated by Monte Carlo simulation, for different CRA protocols and by comparisons with developed benchmarks.}

We investigate the joint design of the active transmit beamformer at the base station (BS) and the passive phase shift matrix along with the deployment orientation (facing/pointing direction) of the IRS for maximizing the worst-case minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) received by the users. In order to show the potential gains obtained by adjusting the deployment orientation of the IRS, a single-input-single-output (SISO) system is studied where a closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the user is obtained. For the multi-user case, to solve the resulting non-convex problem, an inexact-alternating-optimization algorithm consisting of a double-loop iteration is proposed. Specifically, in the inner loop, an optimization problem with semi-infinite constraints needs to be solved to increase the worst-case min-SINR compared to the given SINR reference value. We first transform the semi-infinite constraints into linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints with finite form by applying the Taylor expansion approximation method, the general S-procedure, and the general sign-definiteness lemma. Then an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the two-dimensional search method, negative square penalty (NSP) method, and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is proposed. While in the outer loop, we update the given SINR reference value as the worst-case minimum SINR obtained after each inner loop iteration. The whole algorithm terminates when the updated SINR reference values converge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and also show the additional system performance gain brought by the optimization of the IRS deployment orientation compared to its counterpart with fixed IRS deployment orientation, especially for a smaller IRS element number and a more prominent non-isotropic reflection property of the IRS element.}

	abstract = {Dynamic index coding is a practical generalization of conventional index coding that deals with real dynamic traffic streams. We identify the code-constrained capacity region of a dynamic index coding problem with a complete bi-directional side information graph and introduce the performance metric of dynamic index coding gain to measure how dynamic index coding reduces the required data transmissions. A greedy dynamic index coding scheme is proposed that achieves the maximum coding gain almost everywhere in the identified capacity region. Although the greedy scheme attains the maximum coding gain, its selfish nature may unacceptably increase transmission delay. To address this issue, a time-shared friendly dynamic index coding scheme is introduced that achieves the maximum coding gain over the entire capacity region and offers a lower delay than its greedy counterpart. To obtain the minimum delay, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to tune time-sharing weights in the friendly scheme. The closed-form solution of the optimization is derived for the special two-flow case. Furthermore, the results and analysis are extended to dynamic index coding problems with arbitrary side information graphs. We also use analytical and simulation results to provide graphical intuition for the obtained results.}

	abstract = {This paper analyzes and optimizes the average Age of Information (AAoI) of Frame Slotted ALOHA with Reservation and Data slots (FSA-RD) in a multi-access network, where multiple users transmit their randomly generated status updates to a common access point in a framed manner. Each frame consists of one reservation slot and several data slots. The reservation slot is further split into several mini-slots. In each reservation slot, users that want to transmit a status update will randomly send short reservation packets in one of the mini-slots to contend for data slots of the current frame. The reservation is successful only if one reservation packet is sent in a mini-slot. The data slots are then allocated to those users that succeed in the reservation slot. In the considered FSA-RD scheme, one user with a status update for transmission, termed active user, may need to perform multiple reservation attempts before successfully delivering it. As such, the number of active user(s) in different frames are dependent and thus the probability of making a successful reservation varies from frame to frame, making the AAoI analysis non-trivial. We manage to derive an analytical expression of AAoI for FSA-RD by characterizing the evolution of the number of active user(s) in each frame as a discrete-time Markov chain. We then consider the FSA-RD scheme with one reservation attempt per status update, termed FSA-RD-One. Thanks to the independent frame behaviors of FSA-RD-One, we attain a closed-form expression for its AAoI, which is further used to find the near-optimal reservation probability. Our analysis reveals the impact of key protocol parameters, such as frame size and reservation probability, on the AAoI. Simulation results validate our analysis and show that the optimized FSA-RD outperforms the optimized slotted ALOHA.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system design in a clutter environment. Assisted by an IRS equipped with a uniform planar array (UPA), a multi-antenna base station (BS) is targeted for simultaneously sensing multiple targets in the non-light-of-sight (NLoS) region and communicating with multiple communication users (CUs). We consider the joint IRS-assisted ISAC design in the case with Type-I or Type-II CUs, where each Type-I CU and Type-II CU can and cannot cancel the interference from sensing signals, respectively. Under the perfect communication/sensing channel state information assumption, we aim to maximize the minimum sensing beampattern gain among multiple targets, where the sensing beampattern gain qualifies the achieved illumination signal power at the given location of the target of interest. We jointly optimize the BS’s communication-sensing beamformers and the IRS’s phase shifting matrix, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each Type-I/Type-II CU, the interference power constraint per clutter, the transmission power constraint at the BS, and the cross-correlation pattern constraint. Due to the design variable coupling, the joint IRS-assisted ISAC design problem is shown to be non-convex in the case with Type-I or Type-II CUs. To circumvent the non-convexity dilemma, we propose semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based alternating optimization algorithms in both cases, for which the computational complexity and convergency behavior are analyzed. In the case with Type-I CUs, we show that the dedicated sensing signal at the BS can help enhance the sensing performance gain. By contrast, the dedicated sensing signal at the BS is not required for the IRS-assisted ISAC designs in the case with Type-II CUs. Numerical results are provided to show that the proposed IRS-assisted ISAC design schemes achieve a significant gain over the existing benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {The seamless and ubiquitous wireless access is crucial to the immersive experiences in the metaverse. Considering the limited communication and computing resources, how to provide metaverse services with high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users is still challenging. In this paper, an innovative QoE model for metaverse services based on the virtual distance and network effect is proposed. Especially, we introduce a novel metric called “meta-distance” to measure virtual distance in the metaverse, which jointly considers the service delay and social distance among metaverse users. To solve the QoE utility maximization problem, we propose a Joint Resource Allocation and Metaverse service Selection (JRAMS) scheme, which is composed of a two-step mechanism. In the first step, referred to as the inner loop of JRAMS, a one-to-many matching game with externalities is used to match base stations and metaverse users with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) based subchannel allocation. In the second step, referred to as the outer loop of JRAMS, a hedonic coalition formation game is used to solve the metaverse service selection problem. After finite iterations, JRAMS can converge to a stable solution. The simulation results show that compared with baselines, the average QoE utility of JRAMS can be significantly improved.}

	abstract = {Recently, the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has gained popularity and is emerging as a promising technique to provide improved link reliability and enhanced coverage area. In this paper, we propose an optical reflecting surface (ORS)-assisted free space optics (FSO) communication system, which is based on optical space shift keying (OSSK) technique. Specifically, the closed-form expression for probability density function (PDF) of the ORS-assisted FSO channel is derived over Malaga turbulence model. Further, we have obtained the moment generating function (MGF) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the overall OSSK-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-FSO system. Using the derived channel statistics, an upper bound expression for the average bit error rate (BER) and a lower bound for the ergodic capacity are derived. Further, the asymptotic BER is utilized to calculate the diversity gain of the system. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the theoretical analysis of the system, along with insightful discussions. It is observed from the numerical results that the atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors have a negligible effect on the performance of the proposed system. Finally, a trade-off is noticed with respect to the average BER performance versus the spectral efficiency of the proposed system.}

	abstract = {Integrated visible light positioning and communication (VLPC), capable of combining advantages of visible light communications (VLC) and visible light positioning (VLP), is a promising key technology for the future Internet of Things. In VLPC networks, positioning and communications are inherently coupled, which has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. We propose a robust power allocation scheme for integrated VLPC Networks by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between positioning and communications. Specifically, we derive explicit relationships between random positioning errors, following both a Gaussian distribution and an arbitrary distribution, and channel state information errors. Then, we minimize the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of positioning errors, subject to the rate outage constraint and the power constraints, which is a chance-constrained optimization problem and generally computationally intractable. To circumvent the nonconvex challenge, we conservatively transform the chance constraints to deterministic forms by using the Bernstein-type inequality and the conditional value-at-risk for the Gaussian and arbitrary distributed positioning errors, respectively, and then approximate them as convex semidefinite programs. Finally, simulation results verify the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed integrated VLPC design schemes.}

	abstract = {Covert transmission is investigated for a cooperative deception strategy, where a cooperative jammer (Jammer) tries to attract a multi-antenna adversary (Willie) and degrade the adversary’s reception ability for the signal from a transmitter (Alice). For this strategy, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the covert rate when three different types of channel state information (CSI) are available. The total power is optimally allocated between Alice and Jammer subject to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint, which can be expressed analytically and be widely used as a covertness measurement. Different from the existing literature, in our proposed strategy, we also determine the optimal transmission power at the jammer when Alice is silent, while existing works always assume that the jammer’s power is fixed. Specifically, we apply the S-procedure to convert infinite constraints into linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) constraints. When statistical CSI at Willie is available, we convert double integration to single integration using asymptotic approximation and substitution method. Finally, our simulation results show that for the proposed strategy, the covert rate is increased with the number of antennas at Willie. Moreover, compared to the benchmark, our proposed strategy is more robust in the presence of imperfect CSI.}

	abstract = {Jamming attacks to hinder communication capabilities are becoming a critical aspect of wireless networks. A challenging issue is the detection of reactive jammers that perform spectrum sensing and attack the network only when legitimate communication is in progress. In this scenario, we introduce a novel framework for reactive jamming detection using a patrol of radio-frequency (RF) sensors external to the network to be protected. The solution relies on two key components: i) a novel underdetermined blind source separation (UBSS) method that, starting from the signal mixtures observed by the RF patrollers, is capable of separating the jamming temporal profile from the network nodes’ transmission profiles; ii) a new jamming detection based on causal inference called all-versus-one transfer entropy (AvOTE). The framework is then applied to a case study where the victim network is a Long Range (LoRa)-based internet of things (IoT) system with star topology. The solution outperforms a state-of-the-art method and an approach that attempts to find the causal relationship via time series correlation, exhibiting very good performance in the presence of shadowing. Indeed, a detection probability of 90% is achieved with a false alarm probability of 6% in the presence of nuisances such as collisions and severe shadowing.}

	abstract = {Pulse-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have the advantages of high ranging resolution and strong resistance to self-interference, compared with continuous wave (CW) based systems. However, for pulse-based ISAC systems, multi-path channels pose various challenges to data recovery and ranging by providing diversity gain for data recovery but incurring the interference to the identification of the first path in ranging. In this paper, we design a pulse-based ISAC receiver for multi-path channels. The designed receiver can obtain the diversity gain by correlating the received signal with the estimated template signal. Meanwhile, it can detect the arrival of the first path by using a threshold detection method based on a constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Furthermore, we extend the pulse-based ISAC design to a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) scenario. A low-cost receiver design is provided for the pulse-based ISAC system that can recover data and estimate range simultaneously considering the non-linear effect caused by the low-resolution ADC. Simulation results show that compared with the generalized maximum likelihood (GML) based receiver, the proposed full-resolution pulse-based ISAC receiver has 1dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss in bit error rate (BER) and almost the same mean squared error (MSE) performance with the significantly reduced computational complexity. Also, compared with the full-resolution ISAC receiver, the ISAC receiver with 3-level quantization incurs only 0.8dB SNR loss in BER and 1dB SNR loss in MSE.}

As the noise-free OFDM-DCSK symbol matrix has rank 1, we exploit the vector outer product for its modeling, while sparse coding is also applied to reduce the transmission energy. To demodulate information bits from the sparse-coded signal, we formulate an objective function which consists of a sum of Frobenius norm for rank-1 matrix recovery and\nℓ\n0\n-norm for identifying the possibly outlier-contaminated symbols, with a self-adaptive weight parameter. The resultant optimization problem is solved iteratively via block coordinate descent, and the Laplacian kernel with the Silverman’s rule is adopted for outlier detection. Theoretical analysis including convergence of the objective function, bit error rate (BER), energy efficiency and computational complexity, are provided. Simulation results show that the proposed system has comparable mean square error and BER performance with the\nℓ\np\n-norm minimization based matrix recovery approach at\np=2\nin additive white Gaussian noise, and is superior to that of\np=1\nin Middleton class A noise, even when sparse coding is applied.

In this paper, we propose a novel decision-directed successive interference cancellation (DDSIC) based on frequency-domain minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) equalization for practical FTN systems. To reduce the computational complexity, the detection process is performed frame-by-frame in the frequency domain. In addition, we derive the theoretical bit error rate (BER) expression for each iteration in DDSIC as well as the BER lower bound for\nM\n-ary quadrature amplitude modulated FTN systems. The simulation results verify the theoretical analyses and demonstrate that our proposed method enables lower complexity and better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {In this manuscript, an innovative method for the detection and the estimation of multiple targets in a radar system employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is illustrated. The core of this method is represented by a novel algorithm for detecting multiple superimposed two-dimensional complex tones in the presence of noise and estimating their parameters. This algorithm is based on a maximum likelihood approach and combines a single tone estimator with a serial cancellation procedure. Our numerical results lead to the conclusion that the developed method can achieve a substantially better accuracy-complexity trade-off than various related techniques in the presence of closely spaced targets.}

	abstract = {We consider a hardware-impaired multi-cell Rician-faded massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) system with two-layer pilot decontamination precoding, also known as large-scale fading precoding (LSFP). We derive a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression by assuming a flexible dynamic analog-to-digital converter (ADC)/digital-to-analog converter (DAC) architecture, and hardware-impaired radio frequency chains at the base stations (BSs) and user equipments. The dynamic ADC/DAC architecture enables us to vary the resolution of ADC/DAC connected to each BS antenna, and suitably choose them to maximize SE. We design a distortion-aware minimum mean squared error (DA-MMSE) precoder, and investigate its usage by combining it with the two-layer LSFP, and conventional single-layer precoding (SLP). We show that the DA-MMSE precoder with SLP outperforms its distortion-unaware counterpart, which is used with LSFP. We analytically show that for pure LoS channels, the LSFP reduces to SLP, and its implementation can thus be avoided. It is shown that the LSFP can tolerate high hardware impairments at the BS, but is extremely sensitive to the ADC resolution of the user. We also optimize the global energy efficiency by using a minorization-maximization based algorithm, and show its improved performance over the conventional SE optimization techniques.}

On the other hand, by introducing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), it can enhance the offloading capability of MEC, such that enabling low latency and high throughput. To enhance the task offloading, we investigate the MEC non-orthogonal multiple access (MEC-NOMA) network framework for mobile edge computation offloading with the assistance of a RIS. Different from conventional communication systems, we aim at allowing multiple IoT devices to share the same channel in tasks offloading process. Specifically, the joint consideration of channel assignments, beamwidth allocation, offloading rate and power control is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), which includes minimizing the offloading delay of computing-oriented IoT devices (CP-IDs) and maximizing the transmission rate of communication-oriented IoT devices (CM-IDs). Since the resulting problem is non-convex, we employ\nϵ\n-constraint approach to transform the MOP into the single-objective optimization problems (SOP), and then the RIS-assisted channel assignment algorithm is developed to tackle the fractional objective function. Simulation results corroborate the benefits of our strategy, which can outperforms the other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems to improve spectral efficiency. However, the coexistence of sensing and communication functionalities can cause harmful interference. In this paper, we propose to use a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in conjunction with ISAC to address this issue. The RIS is composed of a large number of low-cost elements that can adjust the amplitude and phase shift of impinging signals, thus providing a relatively high beamforming gain. To maximize the sum-rate of the communication system, we jointly optimize the beamformer at the base station (BS) and the phase shifts at the RIS, subject to a threshold on the interference power, the unit-norm constraint of the transmit power, and the unit modulus constraint of the RIS phase shifts. To efficiently tackle this NP-hard problem, we first reformulate the problem into a more tractable form using the fractional programming (FP) technique. Then, we exploit the geometrical properties of the constraints and adopt an alternating manifold-based optimization to compute the optimal active beamformer and the RIS phase shifts, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted design significantly reduces the mutual interference and improves the system sum-rate for the communication system.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) has recently been proposed and is recognized as a promising technology that can further enhance the capacity of communication systems and compensate for severe path loss. However, the pilot overhead of beam training in XL-RIS-assisted wireless communication systems is enormous because the near-field channel model needs to be taken into account, and the number of candidate codewords in the codebook increases dramatically. To tackle this problem, we propose two deep learning-based near-field beam training schemes in XL-RIS-assisted communication systems, where deep residual networks are employed to determine the optimal near-field RIS codeword. Specifically, we first propose a far-field beam-based beam training (FBT) scheme in which the received signals of all far-field RIS codewords are fed into the neural network to estimate the optimal near-field RIS codeword. In order to further reduce the pilot overhead, a partial near-field beam-based beam training (PNBT) scheme is proposed, where only the received signals corresponding to the partial near-field XL-RIS codewords are input to the neural network. Moreover, we further propose an improved PNBT scheme to enhance the performance of beam training by fully exploring the neural network’s output. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the existing beam training schemes and can reduce the beam sweeping overhead by approximately 95%.}

First, the statistical information is driven in closed form for the aggregated channels, unveiling various influences of the system and environment on the average channel power gains. Next, we study two active and passive beamforming designs corresponding to two objectives. The first problem maximizes channel capacity by jointly optimizing the active precoding and combining matrices at the transceivers and passive beamforming at the double RISs subject to the transmitting power constraint. In order to tackle the inherently non-convex issue, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm (AO) based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The second problem enhances communication reliability by jointly training the encoder and decoder at the transceivers and the phase shifters at the RISs. Each neural network representing a system entity in an end-to-end learning framework is proposed to minimize the symbol error rate of the detected symbols by controlling the transceiver and the RISs’ phase shifts. Numerical results verify our analysis and demonstrate the superior improvements of phase shift designs to boost system performance.}

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications have brought significantly increased demands for concurrent sensing, localization and communication services. To achieve multiple functions concurrently, new unified wireless systems including integrated localization and communication (ILAC) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are facing the fundamental challenge of integrative resource allocation among coexisting functions and services. In addressing this challenge, an ILAC system based on the efficient allocation of the common hardware and radio resource pool for localization and communication is proposed. A novel concept, termed Value of Service (VoS), is coined to maximize the unified performance of ILAC system for diverse service provisioning including localization accuracy and communication data rate. Furthermore, the bandwidth and temporal resource allocation problem is formulated for ILAC to maximize its VoS. Specifically, the problem is treated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem solved by an iterative joint resource allocation (JRA) strategy. In each iteration, the resource allocation is decomposed into two steps. Firstly, the bandwidth resource is optimized with a Kelly mechanism-based continuous allocation method followed by discretization. Secondly, the temporal resource is assigned with the aid of an adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based approach. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed VoS evaluation metric and JRA method in ILAC system under limited resources.}

	abstract = {In conventional dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, the radar and communication channels are routinely estimated at fixed time intervals based on their worst-case operation scenarios. Such situation-agnostic repeated estimations cause significant training overhead and dramatically degrade the system performance, especially for applications with dynamic sensing/communication demands and limited radio resources. In this paper, we leverage the channel aging characteristics to reduce training overhead and to design a situation-dependent channel re-estimation interval optimization-based resource allocation in a multi-target tracking DFRC system. Specifically, we exploit the channel temporal correlation to predict radar and communication channels for reducing the need for training preamble retransmission. Then, we characterize the channel aging effects on the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for radar tracking performance analysis and achievable rates with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) transmit beamforming for communication performance analysis. In particular, the aged CRLBs and achievable rates are derived as closed-form expressions with respect to the channel aging time, bandwidth, and power. Based on the analyzed results, we optimize these factors to maximize the average total aged achievable rate subject to individual target tracking precision demand, communication rate requirement, and other practical constraints. Since the formulated problem belongs to a non-convex problem, we develop an efficient one-dimensional search based optimization algorithm to obtain its suboptimal solutions. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the correctness of the derived theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed allocation scheme.}

The theoretical analysis for non-terrestrial networks (NTN) is significant before applying them in practical scenarios, but the existing works failed to provide a general analysis approach for NTN. Against this background, multiple satellites and civil aircrafts (CAs) are modeled as 3-D binomial point processes (BPPs) in the given finite space in this paper, and we desire to investigate the coverage performance of downlink CA augmented-SAGIN (CAA-SAGIN). Considering the sectorized beam pattern of platforms, we provide a detailed analysis of the different distributions of the serving and interfering platforms and derive the Laplace transform of the interference under shadowed-Rician fading channels. Then, the exact and closed-form expressions are obtained for the general cases with interference and the particular cases without interference via stochastic geometry. The approximations and boundary values are derived by adopting the existing mathematical theories. We analyze the effects of different parameters on the coverage probability of satellite and CA networks, and prove the validity of the derived analytical expressions, approximations, and bounds.

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a cost-efficient technique to improve the wireless network’s capacity and performance. Existing works on IRS have mainly considered IRS being deployed in the environment to dynamically control the wireless channels between the base station (BS) and its served users in favor of their communications. In contrast, we propose in this paper a new integrated IRS-BS architecture by deploying IRSs inside the BS’s antenna radome to directly reconfigure the signal radiation to/from the BS’s antennas. In other words, the IRSs can be considered as auxiliary passive arrays with real-time reconfigurability equipped at the BS to enhance its communication performance cost-effectively. Since the distance between the integrated IRSs and BS’s antenna array is practically small (in the order of several to tens of wavelengths), the path loss among them is significantly reduced as compared to conventional IRS deployed much farther away from the BS, while the real-time control of the IRS’s reflection by the BS becomes easier to implement. However, the resultant near-field channel model also becomes drastically different from its far-field counterpart for conventional far-away IRSs in the literature. Thus, we propose an element-wise channel model for IRS to characterize the channel vector between each single-antenna user and the antenna array of the BS, which includes the direct (without any IRS’s reflection) as well as the single and double IRS-reflection channel components. Based on this channel model, we formulate a problem to optimize the reflection coefficients of all IRS reflecting elements for maximizing the uplink sum-rate of the users. By considering two typical cases with/without perfect channel state information (CSI) at the BS, the formulated problem is solved efficiently by adopting the successive refinement method and iterative random phase algorithm (IRPA), respectively. Numerical results validate the substantial capacity gain of the integrated IRS-BS architecture over the conventional multi-antenna BS without integrated IRS. Moreover, the proposed algorithms significantly outperform other benchmark schemes in terms of sum-rate, and the IRPA without CSI can approach the performance upper bound with perfect CSI as the training overhead increases.}

	abstract = {In general, the generator matrix sparsity is a critical factor in determining the encoding complexity of a linear code. Further, certain applications, e.g., distributed crowdsourcing schemes utilizing linear codes, require most or even all the columns of the generator matrix to have some degree of sparsity. In this paper, we leverage polar codes and the well-established channel polarization to design capacity-achieving codes with a certain constraint on the weights of all the columns in the generator matrix (GM) while having a low-complexity decoding algorithm. We first show that given a binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel $W$ and a constant $s \\in (0, 1]$ , there exists a polarization kernel such that the corresponding polar code is capacity-achieving with the rate of polarization $s/2$ , and the GM column weights being bounded from above by $N^{s}$ . To improve the sparsity versus error rate trade-off, we devise a column-splitting algorithm and two coding schemes for BEC and then for general BMS channels. The polar-based codes generated by the two schemes inherit several fundamental properties of polar codes with the original $2 \\times 2$ kernel including the decay in error probability, decoding complexity, and the capacity-achieving property. Furthermore, they demonstrate the additional property that their GM column weights are bounded from above sublinearly in $N$ , while the original polar codes have some column weights that are linear in $N$ . In particular, for any BEC and $\\beta < 0.5$ , the existence of a sequence of capacity-achieving polar-based codes where all the GM column weights are bounded from above by $N^{\\lambda} $ with $\\lambda \\approx 0.585$ , and with the error probability bounded by ${\\mathcal {O}}(2^{-N^{\\beta }})$ under a decoder with complexity ${\\mathcal {O}}(N\\log N)$ , is shown. The existence of similar capacity-achieving polar-based codes with the same decoding complexity is shown for any BMS channel and $\\beta < 0.5$ with $\\lambda \\approx 0.631$ .}

	abstract = {In this paper, due to the important value in practical applications, we consider the coded distributed matrix multiplication problem of computing AA^{\\top}\nin a distributed computing system with N\nworker nodes and a master node, where the input matrices A\nand A^{\\top}\nare partitioned into m\n-by- p\nand p\n-by- m\nblocks of equal-size sub-matrices respectively. For effective straggler mitigation, we propose a novel computation strategy, named folded polynomial code, which is obtained by modifying the entangled polynomial codes. Moreover, we characterize a lower bound on the optimal recovery threshold among all linear computation strategies when the underlying field is the real number field, and our folded polynomial codes can achieve this bound in the case of m=1\n. Compared with all known computation strategies for coded distributed matrix multiplication, our folded polynomial codes outperform them in terms of recovery threshold, download cost, and decoding complexity.}

	abstract = {U-UV codes were recently proposed as a competent short-to-medium length coding scheme. With well designed component codes, U-UV codes can outperform similar rate cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-polar codes with the successive cancellation (SC) and the SC list (SCL) decoding. In order to improve the coded transmission spectral efficiency, this paper proposes the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) scheme with U-UV codes as the channel codes. A bit interleaver structure is proposed to facilitate the component code rate allocation based on the polarized subchannel capacities. Under the BICM paradigm, the component code rates can be allocated by first estimating the modulation subchannel capacities, then adjusting based on the finite length rates and the equal error probability rule. Theoretical performance bounds and their approximations on decoding error rates are further analyzed. It provides the theoretical benchmarks for our simulations and guides the optimized design of the coded modulation scheme. Finally, simulation results of the U-UV coded BICM scheme are provided to demonstrate its error-correction competency. It can outperform the relevant bit-interleaved polar coded modulation (BIPCM) scheme.}

	abstract = {The performance of generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes under binary and ternary message passing decoding (BMP/TMP) is analyzed from a density evolution (DE) perspective. At the check nodes, two types of local decoders are considered, namely optimum a-posteriori probability (APP) soft-input soft-output decoding, and bounded distance decoding (BDD). The purpose is to shed light on the performance loss incurred by BMP and TMP decoding of GLDPC codes with respect to unquantized belief propagation (BP) decoding. A DE analysis for irregular code ensembles is developed for all the algorithms, which allows obtaining the scaling coefficients needed for the variable node operation of BMP and TMP decoders. The stability analysis for the case of bounded distance decoding at the check nodes is derived. The asymptotic DE analysis is confirmed by the finite-length simulation results. For the codes analyzed in this paper, which rely on extended Hamming component codes, the study shows that under BMP decoding, BDD at the check nodes yields almost the same performance as optimum APP check node processing, while under TMP decoding the loss incurred by the sub-optimum BDD at check nodes is within 0.7 dB, when compared with APP decoding at the check nodes.}

Different from those traditional iterations designed for the linear system (denoted by \\mathbf {Ax}=\\mathbf {b}\nwith \\mathbf {A}=\\mathbf {H}^{H}\\mathbf {H}\nand \\mathbf {b}=\\mathbf {H}^{H}\\mathbf {y}\n), we show that besides the complexity reduction about the matrix inversion, in the proposed NRIDA the computational complexity of matrix multiplication for the linear detection is also greatly reduced without any performance loss, thus leading to a much lower detection complexity. Meanwhile, according to convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed NRIDA enjoys a globally exponential convergence performance, enabling it well suited to the various detection cases of interest. Besides, further complexity reduction and the choices of the sampling distribution in NRIDA are studied as well in full details. Moreover, in order to achieve a better detection trade-off between performance and complexity, we introduce the concept of the conditional sampling into NRIDA, which brings significant gains in both iteration convergence and efficiency. Finally, simulations with respect to the uplink large-scale MIMO detection are presented to illustrate the remarkable gains of the proposed NRIDA in both performance and complexity.}

	abstract = {Massive machine type communication (mMTC) has attracted new coding schemes optimized for reliable short message transmission. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based near-orthogonal superposition (NOS) coding scheme is proposed to transmit short messages in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels for mMTC applications. In the proposed MIMO-NOS scheme, a neural network-based encoder is optimized via end-to-end learning with a corresponding neural network-based detector/decoder in a superposition-based auto-encoder framework including a MIMO channel. The proposed MIMO-NOS encoder spreads the information bits to multiple near-orthogonal high dimensional vectors to be combined (superimposed) into a single vector and reshaped for the space-time transmission. For the receiver, we propose a novel looped\nK\n-best tree-search algorithm with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) assistance to enhance the error correcting ability in the block-fading MIMO channel. For a comprehensive understanding of the proposed MIMO-NOS scheme, we further quantify the gain from individual components/modules in the framework, and analyze the decoding complexity measured by the floating point operations (FLOPs). Simulation results show the proposed MIMO-NOS scheme outperforms maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO detection combined with a polar code with CRC-assisted list decoding by 1 – 2 dB in various MIMO systems for short (32 – 64 bit) message transmission.}

	abstract = {Molecular communication (MC) is an emerging field aiming at realizing information exchange via chemical signals between nanomachines in nanonetworks. Information transmission that is energy-efficient and relies on relatively low-complexity transceiver techniques is of practical importance for MC systems. Based on the fact that constellation shaping can improve energy efficiency, in this paper, we propose a molecular shell mapping (MSM) scheme to implement the probabilistic constellation shaping for MC. The MSM method is designed to exploit the concentration sequences with the lowest sum sequence weight, which results in an energy-efficient signal constellation. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for selecting and sorting the concentration sequences to mitigate inter-symbol interference. For information detection, we design a genie-aided maximum-likelihood (ML) detector and a realistic ML detector to leverage the constructive effect of intra-sequence interference, as well as derive their bit error rates and achievable rates. Additionally, for the applications using large blocklength sequences, a low-complexity ML detection method is proposed. Numerical simulation results confirm that the shaped signaling using the MSM method is more energy-efficient than the conventional equiprobable signaling, achieving shaping gains of up to 1.5 dB at an ultra-short blocklength of 4.}

The BS shares a direct link to the NU, while communication to the DU is assisted by a battery-aided energy harvesting FD relay. We consider a static battery energy (SBE) scheme in which a fixed amount of battery energy augments the harvested energy and analyze the performance of both NU and DU. Also, a new dynamic battery energy (DBE) scheme, wherein the harvested energy is augmented with as little battery energy as possible in order to achieve desired quality of service, is proposed and is shown to ensure efficient battery utilization. Considering a threshold-based nonlinear EH model, closed-form expressions are derived for the throughput of NU and DU for both SBE and DBE schemes. Furthermore, for the DBE scheme, we also derive an exact closed-form expression for the average battery energy drawn per symbol interval. We then demonstrate that the choice of battery energy and TS parameter is crucial to attain a maximum DU throughput while simultaneously guaranteeing a target throughput at the NU.}

	abstract = {Photon counting is an effective detection technique for weak optical signals in underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC). This paper proposes a new approach for power allocation in an uplink\nM\n-ary pulse position modulation (PPM), photo-counting non-orthogonal multiple-access (PhC-NOMA) system. Different from existing techniques in photon-counting systems, the new approach supports consistent duty cycles across underwater devices and adjusts the transmit rates of the devices through their transmit powers, thereby avoiding the delays of duty cycle adjustments and supporting high-speed transmissions. Power allocation is non-trivial in photon-counting systems due to signal-dependent Poisson shot noises. As a key contribution, we derive the exact and asymptotic expressions for the achievable rate of the\nM\n-ary PPM PhC-NOMA system with the signal-dependent Poisson shot noise and multiuser interference considered. With the expressions, we reveal the received power at the base station (BS) is minimized when their minimum data rate requirements are delivered and can be solved using an incremental algorithm. We also asymptotically maximize the photon efficiency of the devices while preventing the saturation of the receiving photon detector, using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulations show that our approach can reduce the received power at the BS by up to 25% and double the photon efficiency, as compared to the existing techniques.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the generalization error of reservoir computing (RC), a special category of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The specific RC implementation considered in this paper is the echo state network (ESN), and an upper bound on its generalization error is derived via the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) approach. While recent work in deriving risk bounds for RC frameworks makes use of a non-standard ERC measure and a direct application of its definition, our work uses the standard ERC measure and tools allowing fair comparison with conventional RNNs. The derived result shows that the generalization error bound obtained for ESNs is tighter than the existing bound for vanilla RNNs, suggesting easier generalization for ESNs. With the ESN applied to symbol detection in MIMO-OFDM (Multiple Input Multiple Output-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) systems, we show how the derived generalization error bound can guide underlying system design. Specifically, the derived bound together with the empirically characterized training loss is utilized to identify the optimum reservoir size in neurons for the ESN-based symbol detector. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with results from simulations that employ 3GPP standards-compliant wireless channels, signifying the practical relevance of our work.}

	abstract = {Due to the ability of feature extraction, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been recently applied to channel state information (CSI) compression feedback in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Existing DL-based CSI compression methods are usually effective in extracting a certain type of features in the CSI. However, the CSI usually contains two types of propagation features, i.g., non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation-path feature and dominant propagation-path feature, especially in channel environments with rich scatterers. To fully extract the both propagation features and learn a dual-feature representation for CSI, this paper proposes a dual-feature-fusion neural network (NN), referred to as DuffinNet. The proposed DuffinNet adopts a parallel structure with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention-empowered neural network (ANN) to respectively extract different features in the CSI, and then explores their interplay by a fusion NN. Built upon this proposed DuffinNet, a new encoder-decoder framework is developed, referred to as Duffin-CsiNet, for improving the end-to-end performance of CSI compression and reconstruction. To facilitate the application of Duffin-CsiNet in practice, this paper also presents a two-stage approach for codeword quantization of the CSI feedback. Besides, a transfer learning-based strategy is introduced to improve the generalization of Duffin-CsiNet, which enables the network to be applied to new propagation environments. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed Duffin-CsiNet noticeably outperforms the existing DL-based methods in terms of reconstruction performance, encoder complexity, and network convergence, validating the effectiveness of the proposed dual-feature fusion design.}

	abstract = {Channel fading can have a strong impact on the convergence of over-the-air federated edge learning (OTA-FEEL). This paper develops a new and optimal power control policy to minimize the optimality gap of OTA-FEEL under any independently and identically distributed fading. Specifically, we reveal that the optimal power control policy takes a structure where the variance of the effective channel from a device to the server should be minimized when its mean is given. Following this structure, a novel nested optimization algorithm is developed to iteratively minimize the variance using the Lagrange-dual method and then optimize the mean of the effective channel using one-dimensional search. A quasi-closed-form expression of the optimal power control policy is derived. It is shown that the optimal adaptive power control for OTA-FEEL performs an integration of the “channel inverting” strategy and the opposite “channel-proportional” strategy to balance the mean and variance of the effective channel. We also generalize the new policy when the channel statistics are unknown a-priori, and show that the optimal policy can be asymptotically approached over time. Simulations confirm the superiority of the policy to its existing alternatives in the convergence speed and learning accuracy of OTA-FEEL.}

In this paper, we focus on the joint optimization problem of online offloading decision and charging resource allocation for minimizing task accomplishing time in dynamic time-varying wireless channel scenarios. The optimal solution involves addressing a mixed integer programming problem in real time, which is proved to be NP-hard, and imposes nontrivial challenges to design with conventional optimization methods. To efficiently address this problem, we leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology to propose an energy-aware online offloading algorithm called EAOO. EAOO algorithm learns empirically the online offloading decision policies via a well-designed DRL framework, and adopts the feasible solution region analysis method to implement the charging resource allocation. We further propose a novel feasible decision vector generation method, and incorporate the crossover and mutation technology to expand the offloading vector search space with the provable feasibility guarantee. Extensive experimental results show that, our EAOO algorithm outperforms existing baseline algorithms, and achieves near-optimal performance with low CPU execution latency, which well satisfies the practical requirements of real-time and efficiency.}

The number of resource blocks when using traditional orthogonal transmission strategies for FL linearly scales with the number of participating devices, which conflicts with the scarcity of communication resources. To tackle this issue, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged recently which leverages the inherent superposition property of wireless channels to perform one-shot model aggregation. However, the aggregation accuracy in AirComp suffers from the unfavorable wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we consider the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to mitigate this problem and improve FL performance with AirComp. Specifically, a novel performance-oriented long-term design scheme that integrated design multiple communication rounds to minimize the optimality gap of the loss function is proposed. We first analyze the convergence behavior of the FL procedure with the absence of channel fading and noise. Based on the obtained optimality gap which characterizes the impact of channel fading and noise in different communication rounds on the ultimate performance of FL, we propose both online and offline schemes to tackle the resulting design problem. Simulation results demonstrate that such a long-term design strategy can achieve higher test accuracy than the conventional isolated design approach in FL. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical results exhibit a “later-is-better” principle, which demonstrates the later rounds in the FL procedure are more sensitive to aggregation error, and hence more resources are required over time.}

	abstract = {Rapid and efficient sensor data acquisition plays a critical role in the decision-making process of each robot in a multi-robot smart factory. This paper investigates the trajectory design of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and communication resource allocation problems in industrial Internet of Things. Specifically, by exploiting both power and spatial domains, we adopt non-orthogonal multiple access to improve network connectivity in a spectrum-efficient manner, while the multi-antenna technique is employed to enhance diversity gain. The average sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power of sensors and the trajectory of AMRs. To deal with prior knowledge and dynamic channel conditions, we reformulate the long-term maximization problem as a Markov decision process, and further develop a provably efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with a near-optimal regret bound. Our theoretical analysis reveals that both the decentralized execution and the experience exchange method are beneficial to accelerate convergence. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can reduce at least 80% convergence time compared to the centralized baseline, and can gain better rewards than the conventional \\epsilon\n-greedy exploration.}

	abstract = {With the great success of deep learning (DL) in image classification, speech recognition, and other fields, more and more studies have applied various neural networks (NNs) to wireless resource allocation. Generally speaking, these artificial intelligent (AI) models are trained under some special learning hypotheses, especially that the statistics of the training data are static during the training stage. However, the distribution of channel state information (CSI) is constantly changing in the real-world wireless communication environment. Therefore, it is essential to study effective dynamic DL technologies to solve wireless resource allocation problems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named meta-gating, for solving resource allocation problems in an episodically dynamic wireless environment, where the CSI distribution changes over periods and remains constant within each period. The proposed framework, consisting of an inner network and an outer network, aims to adapt to the dynamic wireless environment by achieving three important goals, i.e., seamlessness, quickness and continuity. Specifically, for the former two goals, we propose a training method by combining a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm with an unsupervised learning mechanism. With this training method, the inner network is able to fast adapt to different channel distributions because of the good initialization. As for the goal of ‘continuity’, the outer network can learn to evaluate the importance of inner network’s parameters under different CSI distributions, and then decide which subset of the inner network should be activated through the gating operation. Additionally, we theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed meta-gating framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed meta-gating framework can well achieve the three important goals compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) demonstrates tremendous potential in high-mobility communication systems, especially from the perspective of signal detection. However, most existing DL-based detection methods are data/environment specific and the re-training process is resource intensive. To address these shortcomings, we propose a contrastive learning-based environmentally robust signal detection approach in orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (CL-ODDM) to achieve fast convergence, high accuracy and strong robustness to variations in wireless environments. Specifically, unlike conventional methods which explore only positive samples in the dataset for detection, in this work, we propose to leverage contrastive learning to fully exploit both positive and negative samples in the training dataset. This enables us to extract more comprehensive features of signals, which can accelerate convergence, improve detection accuracy, and enhance the generalized ability of our CL-ODDM. Moreover, we creatively employ a convolutional neural network and recurrent encoder-decoder (CREN) to represent the underlying properties of ODDM signals and extract high-quality features. To further improve environmental robustness, we propose novel training strategies, i.e., data augmentation (DA) and adaptive updating scheme (AUS). The proposed DA method is expected to increase the diversity of the dataset and represent more effective signal features. The designed AUS leverages transfer learning to adapt partial layers of CREN to make our CL-ODDM suitable for various wireless environments. Numerous simulation results validate that the proposed CL-ODDM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art related works, in terms of detection accuracy, environmental robustness and convergence rate.}

	abstract = {The active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can amplify the incident signal besides reflecting, thus alleviating the double-fading effect of the cascaded link. However, if the interference caused by the cascaded link cannot be effectively cancelled, the alleviated effect may result in increased interference among users, thus limiting the performance gain brought by the active IRS. To this end, an active IRS aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is proposed in this paper for the millimeter-wave hybrid antenna array. In the proposed scheme, a user grouping method is designed to circumvent the narrow beamwidth constraint, and the 2-layer rate-splitting (RS) strategy applicable to the user grouping result and the corresponding successive interference cancellation are designed to cancel interference. To evaluate the max-min fairness (MMF) performance of the proposed scheme, an MMF optimization problem (OP) is formulated, where the digital precoder, the RS vector, and the reflecting vector are jointly optimized. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with a novel AO strategy is proposed to solve the MMF OP, where the RS vector is optimized in two subproblems. An initialization method is designed specially to start the AO algorithm. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can more fully exploit the active IRS, and although the active IRS consumes additional power, it can bring energy efficiency gain to system.}

	abstract = {To enhance the outage performance of downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, we investigate opportunistic user pair scheduling (UPS) as well as the joint power allocation and decoding order selection (PA-DOS) for the scheduled user pair. Unlike most existing literature where the UPS and PA-DOS schemes are solely driven by channel conditions, we consider the impact of both the channel conditions and users’ target rates in the scheme design, since these two factors jointly determine the occurrence of transmission outages. Specifically, a two-stage rate-aware scheme for joint UPS and PA-DOS is proposed, which is proved to achieve the minimum system outage probability and guarantee fair access opportunities among users. For performance evaluation, the exact system outage probability achieved by the proposed scheme is derived in closed form, based on which a high-signal-to-noise-ratio asymptotic result is further derived for meaningful insights. Our analytical results reveal a new finding: The diversity order achieved by our proposed scheme, which is also the maximum achievable diversity order of the considered NOMA system, varies with the users’ target rates. Simulations confirm our findings and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a significant outage performance gain over the existing benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Remote first-aid treatment on ambulances is a promising application of 5G. However, there still exist gaps between the capabilities of current 5G networks and the stringent requirements of remote emergency on ambulances. Dual connectivity (DC) is an efficient technology to fill these gaps by integrating 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) with Sub-6GHz networks. In this paper, we investigate a dual-connectivity handover scheme to enhance the transmission rate of the wireless links for a 5G-enabled ambulance. Due to the long delay caused by signal transmission and processing, the conventional handover schemes based on reference signal received power (RSRP) measured by users are not sufficiently sensitive to the rapidly changing propagation environments surrounding the 5G-enabled ambulance. Instead, considering the randomness of environments and the delay caused by the handover process, we employ a deep Q network (DQN)-based algorithm to find a far-sighted policy for solving the handover problem. However, due to the drawbacks of single-step bootstrapping, value overestimation, and low-efficiency exploration, the vanilla DQN is performance-limited. To this end, we adopt effective techniques including multi-step learning, double DQN, and NoisyNet to improve learning performances, and propose a noisy double DQN (NDDQN)-based dual-connectivity handover scheme. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our NDDQN-based handover scheme compared with the vanilla DQN and upper confidence bound (UCB)-based handover schemes, and then show that our handover scheme can adapt to various handover models.}

	abstract = {The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in IoT networks, especially data collection, has received extensive attention. Due to the urgency of the mission and limitation of the network cost, the mission completion time and number of UAVs are research hotspots. Most studies mainly focus on the trajectory optimization of the UAV to shorten the mission completion time. However, under different data collection modes, flying mode (FM) and hovering mode (HM), the collection time will also greatly affect the mission completion time. This paper studies the data collection from ground IoT devices (GIDs) in Multi-UAV enabled IoT networks. The problem of data collection is formulated to minimize the aerial cost and maximum mission completion time of UAVs by optimizing mission allocation, UAV trajectory, and UAVs’ flying speeds. In view of the complexity and non-convexity of the formulated problem, we propose a heuristic-based approximation algorithm to optimize the mission allocation of UAVs. Then, we specifically optimize the trajectory of the UAV for GIDs to minimize the flight time and collection time. Since the UAV’s flying speed affects the mission completion time, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is adopted to optimize it. Simulation results show that our scheme achieves the performance of near-optimal solution.}

A multi-cell Aloha network may easily become unstable as the inter-cell interference grows if the traffic input rates and transmission probabilities of nodes are not properly regulated. Yet how to stabilize a multi-cell Aloha network has remained largely unknown. To address the above open issue, an analytical framework is proposed in this paper for multi-cell Aloha networks to characterize the stability region of traffic input rates and operating region of transmission probabilities of nodes for achieving network stability. Specifically, the inter-cell interference level is captured by the overlapping ratio of each cell, and shown to be a key factor that determines the stability performance. For a two-cell Aloha network, the stability region of input rates and complete operating regions of transmission probabilities are obtained as functions of the overlapping ratios of cells. For the general\nM\n-cell case, a transmission control algorithm is further proposed to stabilize the network only based on the local information exchange between neighboring cells, with effectiveness demonstrated through simulations.}

	abstract = {In optical wireless communications (OWC), hybrid optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM) schemes, such as hybrid asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (HACO-OFDM) and layered asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (LACO-OFDM), enjoy both high power and spectral efficiency. However, due to the non-orthogonal transmission of signal components induced by the clipping distortion, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is required in these hybrid O-OFDM schemes, leading to notably increased complexity. In this paper, we conceive novel hybrid O-OFDM schemes to offer both high spectral and power efficiency, whilst possessing low complexity. By elaborately designing a time-domain (TD) distortion elimination methodology at the transmitter, a novel distortion-elimination hybrid O-OFDM (DEHO-OFDM) is first proposed, which combines asymmetrically clipped O-OFDM (ACO-OFDM) and pulse-amplitude-modulated discrete multitone (PAM-DMT) in an interference-free manner. In order to further improve the spectral efficiency, an enhance DEHO-OFDM (EDEHO-OFDM) is designed by activating the remaining subcarrier resources. Both DEHO-OFDM and EDEHO-OFDM can be realized through a single-IFFT transmitter and standard OFDM receiver, leading to much lower complexity than the existing hybrid O-OFDM schemes. Simulation results have demonstrated the superiorities of the proposed schemes over HACO-OFDM and LACO-OFDM in terms of peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) and bit error rate (BER).}

The optimal input distribution that maximizes the mutual information of the proposed approximated channel under the peak amplitude constraint is then studied. We present that, considering the input-dependency of the noise, the conventional amplitude-constrained constellation designs can be geometrically shaped to provide significant mutual information gains. However, it is observed that further probabilistic shaping and constellation size optimization can provide only limited additional gains beyond the best geometrically shaped benchmark scheme, i.e., 64 Amplitude Phase Shift Keying. Then, an approximated channel model that neglects the correlation between subcarriers is proposed for the matched filtered signaling system, based on which the input constellation is geometrically shaped. We demonstrate that although the inter-subcarrier interference in the filtered case is neglected in the channel model, the shaping of the matched filtered case can provide promising gains in mismatch capacity over the unfiltered scenario.}

We propose that the direct current component and the alternating current component of the VLPC signals are utilized for positioning and communication, respectively. With a single LED-lamp, we propose a received-signal-strength based 3D VLP scheme, and further derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Then, by exploiting the inherent coupling relationship between VLP and VLC, the positioning results are utilized for channel estimation of VLC, which can significantly reduce the channel estimation pilot overhead. Furthermore, we optimize the waveform design by minimizing the CRLB, while satisfying both the outage probability of communication rate and total transmit power constraints. However, this problem turns to be non-convex and intractable. To address this challenging problem, we utilize the Conditional Value-at-Risk to conservatively transform the outage probability constraint into a deterministic form. By exploiting the block coordinate descent algorithm, the waveform design problem can be efficiently solved by alternately optimizing VLP and VLC convex sub-problems and dual problem. Finally, simulation results verify both the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed waveform design.}

To this end, this paper investigates an indoor wireless network that aggregates communication resources in visible light and radio-frequency (RF) bands, taking advantage of the complementary aspects of the two technologies. More specifically, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is introduced for the visible light communication (VLC) downlink, such that cell-edge users experiencing a weak VLC signal enhance their aggregated data rate with the aid of cooperative communications over RF sidelinks (i.e., device-to-device links). The optimal resource allocation strategy over both VLC and RF bands is derived aiming at EE maximization based on the Dinkelbach’s algorithm and successive convex approximation. Additionally, for the sake of flexibility, a weighted EE metric is proposed for the characterization of the aggregated VLC/RF network performance. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed analysis, revealing the impact of various design and system parameters, such as the weighting factors, quality of service requirements, and channel conditions.}

	abstract = {Information-theoretic secure (ITS) authentication is an essential part of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. In the QKD network, the authentication scheme based on the ITS QKD keys pre-shared by the QKD system. However, such a scheme is subject to the limitation that consumes a significant amount of authentication keys when the scale and communication requirements of QKD networks grow. To address the issue, we propose an ITS group authentication scheme for QKD networks that consumes considerably fewer keys. In our scheme, multiple QKD network nodes collaborate and complete the authentication as a group. Compared to the pre-shared keys authentication scheme, our scheme reduces the complexity of authentication key consumption from\nO(\nN\n2\nd)\nto\nO(N)\n, where\nN\nis the number of nodes and\nd\nis the average path length of the network topology. The security of the proposed scheme is analyzed in detail and simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate our scheme’s effectiveness for varying networks scales and communication requirements.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the joint transceiver design for full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output relay systems where the direct link (DL) and nonlinear successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) detection are considered. The objective is to jointly optimize the source precoder, relay precoder, and receiver such that the resultant symbol-vector error rate (SVER) is minimized. The joint design is challenging since the coexistence of DL and FD relaying will introduce the inter symbol-vector interference. To address this problem, we first propose a novel QR-SIC receiver structure by performing the dual-filtering (DuF) and channel stacking before SIC. Then, the source and relay precoders are optimized for the proposed DuF-based QR-SIC receiver. Compared with the source precoder, optimizing the relay precoder is much more involved due to the complicated objective function. Hence, we transform the original optimization problem into a trace-minimization one, enabling a closed-form solution for the relay precoder. Furthermore, we theoretically show that the proposed design framework can be extended to the system with the DuF-based minimum mean-squared-error SIC receiver. Simulations show that our transceivers are indeed able to significantly improve the overall SVER performance.}

	abstract = {The wireless in-band full-duplex (IBFD) technology can in theory double the system capacity over the conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) or time-division duplex (TDD) alternatives. But the strong self-interference of the IBFD can cause excessive quantization noise at the output of the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which hampers its real implementation. Fortunately, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can reconfigure the wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the reflection coefficients, which makes it a promising solution to self-interference mitigation (SIM) for the IBFD system. This paper considers a RIS-assisted IBFD (RAIBFD) system where a full-duplex base station (BS), assisted by a co-located RIS, receives and transmits signals on the same frequency band simultaneously. We propose to jointly design the DL precoding matrix and the RIS coefficients to mitigate the strong self-interference before the ADCs of finite bit resolutions. To gauge the performance of the proposed RAIBFD system, we also consider an idealistic RIS-assisted IBFD (I-RAIBFD) system with ADCs of infinite bit resolutions and RIS-assisted FDD (RAFDD) system, and take them as performance benchmarks. The effectiveness of the proposed RAIBFD system is verified by simulation studies, even if the phases of the RIS have only finite resolutions.}

We first derive a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression for this system, and later propose two novel optimization techniques to optimize the non-convex SE metric by exploiting the minorization-maximization (MM) method. The first one requires a numerical optimization solver, and has a high computation complexity. The second one with closed-form transmit power updates, has a trivial computation complexity. We numerically show that i) the two-layer LSFD scheme effectively mitigates the interference due to channel aging for both low- and high-velocity UEs; and ii) increasing the number of AP antennas does not mitigate the SE deterioration due to channel aging. We numerically characterize the optimal pilot length required to maximize the SE for various UE speeds. We also numerically show that the proposed closed-form MM optimization yields the same SE as that of the first technique, which requires numerical solver, and that too with a much reduced time-complexity.}

Three transmission modes, i.e., groundwave, near vertical incident skywave (NVIS), and long-distance skywave are considered to eliminate the blind area and realize the full-coverage for shortwave communication. The ionospheric absorption loss and surface reflection loss during multi-hop transmissions are explored in the proposed channel model. In addition, new massive MIMO channel characteristics including the near-field spherical wavefront effect and spatial non-stationarity are considered. Temporal and frequency non-stationarities are also modeled due to the receiver (Rx) mobility and large relative bandwidth, respectively. The analytical and simulated space cross-correlation function (SCCF), time autocorrelation function (TACF), and frequency correlation function (FCF) of the proposed model are compared. The simulated path loss and singular value spread (SVS) are compared with those of the corresponding channel measurements, illustrating good fittings. In addition, the delay power spectral density (PSD) and Doppler PSD, and channel capacity are also simulated and analyzed. The proposed model can be used as a basis for the design and construction of shortwave communication systems.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio has emerged as a promising technology for spectrum- and energy-efficient wireless communications, where the passive secondary backscatter devices (BDs) reuse not only the spectrum but also the power of the active primary users to transmit their own information. In return, the primary communication links can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the BDs. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, due to the severe double-fading attenuation of the passive backscattering links, the enhancement of the primary link provided by one single BD is extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic radio, in this paper, we study multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbiotic radio communication systems with massive BDs. We first derive the achievable rates of the primary active communication and secondary passive communication, and then consider the asymptotic regime as the number of BDs goes large, for which closed-form expressions are derived to reveal the relationship between the primary and secondary communication rates. Furthermore, the precoding optimization problem is studied to maximize the primary communication rate while guaranteeing that the secondary communication rate is no smaller than a certain threshold. Simulation results are provided to validate our theoretical studies.}

	abstract = {To support extremely high data rates in 6G wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communications have gained much attention in recent years. By manipulating the phase shifts of reflecting elements, the RIS can proactively adjust the wireless propagation environment of THz systems, thereby enhancing the overall throughput significantly. To realize the full potential of RIS-assisted THz systems, an acquisition of accurate channel information is of great importance. However, since the wavefront of the THz electromagnetic signal is spherical, the conventional channel estimation techniques using the planar wavefront assumption suffer from severe performance degradation in the near-field RIS-assisted THz systems. An aim of this work is to propose an efficient channel estimation technique for near-field RIS-assisted wideband THz systems. Key idea of the proposed polar-domain frequency-dependent RIS-assisted channel estimation (PF-RCE) scheme is to estimate the sparse multipath components (i.e., angles, distances, and path gains) of the near-field THz channel by exploiting the polar-domain sparsity and common support properties. We demonstrate from the numerical evaluations that PF-RCE achieves a significant performance gain over the conventional THz channel estimation schemes in terms of the normalized mean square error (NMSE).}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is able to enhance the capacity of wireless communication systems with low overhead. Extremely large (XL)-RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has become a promising key technique for future 6-th Generation (6G) systems. The performance gain brought in by XL-RIS relies on the accurate channel state information (CSI). However, channel estimation requires huge training overhead and high computational complexity due to the XL number of passive elements at RIS. Moreover, the unknown visual region (VR) infomation caused by the sensitivity of mmWave signal to random blockages makes the channel estimation more difficult. In this paper, we consider the channel estmation for XL-RIS-aided mmWave uplink system. We firstly model the XL-RIS-aided channel as a hybrid one composed of near-field RIS-to-user channel and far-field RIS-to-base station (BS) channel, where the VR issue of XL-RIS has been taken into consideration. Then we formulate the channel estimation problem as a sparse recovery problem. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm for joint channel estimation and VR detection. Finally numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing benchmark schemes in terms of normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) due to the VR detection and the utilization of shift common-support property among sub-channels.}

However, due to the severe double path loss, the traditional passive RIS can provide sufficient gain only when receivers are very close to the RIS. Moreover, RIS cannot provide signal coverage for the receivers at the back side of it. To address these drawbacks in practical implementation, we introduce a novel reflection and transmission dual-functional active RIS (DF-ARIS) architecture in this paper, which can simultaneously realize reflection and transmission functionalities with active signal amplification to significantly extend signal coverage and enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of all users. The problem of joint transmit beamforming and dual-functional active RIS design is investigated in RIS-enhanced multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Both sum-rate maximization and power minimization problems are considered. To address their non-convexity, we develop efficient iterative algorithms to decompose them into several separate design problems, which are efficiently solved by exploiting fractional programming (FP) and Riemannian-manifold optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed dual-functional active RIS architecture and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms over various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a downlink secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits confidential messages to a single-antenna communication user (CU) while performing sensing on targets that may act as suspicious eavesdroppers. To ensure the quality of target sensing while preventing their potential eavesdropping, the BS combines the transmit confidential information signals with additional dedicated sensing signals, which play a dual role of artificial noise (AN) for degrading the qualities of eavesdropping channels. Under this setup, we jointly design the transmit information and sensing beamforming, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of beampattern matching errors and cross-correlation patterns for sensing subject to secure communication constraints. The robust design takes into account the channel state information (CSI) imperfectness of the eavesdroppers in two practical CSI error scenarios. First, we consider the scenario with bounded CSI errors of eavesdroppers, in which the worst-case secrecy rate constraint is adopted to ensure secure communication performance. In this scenario, we present the optimal solution to the worst-case secrecy rate constrained sensing beampattern optimization problem, by adopting the techniques of S-procedure, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and a one-dimensional (1D) search, for which the tightness of the SDR is rigorously proved. Next, we consider the scenario with Gaussian CSI errors of eavesdroppers, in which the secrecy outage probability constraint is adopted. In this scenario, we present an efficient algorithm to solve the more challenging secrecy outage-constrained sensing beampattern optimization problem, by exploiting the convex restriction technique based on the Bernstein-type inequality, together with the SDR and 1D search. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed designs can properly adjust the information and sensing beams to balance the tradeoffs among communicating with CU, sensing targets, and confusing eavesdroppers, so as to achieve desirable sensing transmit beampatterns while ensuring the CU’s secrecy requirements for the two scenarios.}

	abstract = {Distributed optimization is ubiquitous in emerging applications, such as robust sensor network control, smart grid management, machine learning, resource slicing, and localization. However, the extensive data exchange among local and central nodes may cause a severe communication bottleneck. To overcome this challenge, over-the-air computing (AirComp) is a promising medium access technology, which exploits the superposition property of the wireless multiple access channel (MAC) and offers significant bandwidth savings. In this work, we propose an AirComp framework for general distributed convex optimization problems. Specifically, a distributed primal-dual (DPD) subgradient method is utilized for the optimization procedure. Under general assumptions, we prove that DPD-AirComp can asymptotically achieve zero expected constraint violation. Therefore, DPD-AirComp ensures the feasibility of the original problem, despite the presence of channel fading and additive noise. Moreover, with proper power control of the users’ signals, the expected non-zero optimality gap can also be mitigated. Two practical applications of the proposed framework are presented, namely, smart grid management and wireless resource allocation. Finally, numerical results confirm DPD-AirComp’s excellent performance, while it is also shown that DPD-AirComp converges an order of magnitude faster compared to two digital orthogonal multiple access schemes, specifically, time-division multiple access (TDMA), and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA).}

	abstract = {Spectrum sensing is a key technique for dynamically detecting available spectrum in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), which can introduce high resource demands such as energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel cluster-based cooperative sensing-after-prediction scheme where a learning cluster and a sensing cluster are jointly considered to perform cooperative prediction and sensing efficiently. This enables us to skip the complex physical sensing to reduce the demands when the spectrum availability can be simply predicted using cooperative prediction. Furthermore, the clustering is flexible, in order to meet different performance requirements. We then formulate two optimization problems to minimize the total number of users in the two clusters or to minimize the total energy consumption, to meet different performance requirements, while in both cases guaranteeing the system accuracy requirement and individual energy constraints. To solve the two challenging integer programming problems, the unconstrained problems are mathematically solved first by relaxing the integer variable and fixing the cluster size. Such analytical solutions serve as a foundation for solving the original optimization problems. Then, two low-complexity search algorithms are proposed to achieve the global optimum, as they can obtain the same performance with exhaustive search. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions and demonstrate that the total energy consumption and the number of users contributing to learning and sensing can be greatly reduced by applying our optimized clustered sensing-after-prediction scheme.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can resolve the inter-cell interference issue in cellular networks through cooperative beamforming of the distributed access points (APs). This paper focuses on an uplink cell-free massive MIMO network and investigates novel methods to train the central processing unit (CPU), the APs, and the users in the network. To reduce the communication burden posed on the fronthaul, each AP applies receive beamforming to compress the vector signals into scalar ones before passing them to the CPU for centralized processing. By drawing analogies between an uplink cell-free network and a quasi-neural network and borrowing the idea of backpropagation algorithm, we propose a novel scheme named the distributed learning for uplink cell-free massive MIMO beamforming (DLCB), which can achieve the multi-AP cooperation without explicit estimation of their channel state information (CSI). The DLCB has low computational complexity and is applicable to various objective functions, such as the minimum mean squared error criterion and the maximum sum rate criterion. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The Device-to-Device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks has advantages of improving the spectral utilization and throughput. This paper studies mode selection and resource allocation scheme for D2D communications underlaying cellular networks aiming to achieve a tradeoff of throughput and user satisfaction. An offline channel state information model based on geographic location is proposed to store offline channel state data which are used to estimate the SINR and data rate of the users. A resource assignment priority is defined by jointly considering the service priority, subscriber priority, and the distance between D2D users. The user’s achieved data rate and the resource assignment priority are combined to evaluate the user’s satisfaction with the revised Mean Opinion Score (MOS) index. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate and satisfaction of all users with resource assignment priority considered. The differential evolution algorithm is employed to solve this problem and the user satisfaction is measured by two defined metrics. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain a higher user satisfaction level at the cost of slightly reduced overall throughput of the system.}

	abstract = {In classical coding theory, it is common to construct new codes via propagation rules. There are various propagation rules to construct classical block codes. However, propagation rules have not been extensively explored for locally repairable codes. In this paper, we systematically study some of propagation rules to construct optimal and asymptotically good locally repairable codes. To our surprise, these simple propagation rules produce interesting results. Firstly, by a lengthening propagation rule that adds some rows and columns to a parity-check matrix of a given linear code, we are able to convert a classical maximum distance separable (MDS) code into a Singleton-optimal locally repairable code and provide a simplified proof of the asymptotic Tafasman-Vlăduţ-Zink bound which exceeds the asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound of locally repairable codes. Secondly, by concatenating a locally repairable code as an inner code with a classical block code as an outer code, we obtain a family of dimension-optimal locally repairable codes. Thirdly, we can make use of the shortening technique to produce more dimension-optimal locally repairable codes. Finally, one of phenomena that we observe in this paper is that some trivial propagation rules in classical block codes do not hold anymore for locally repairable codes.}

However, most of them require contacting all the surviving nodes during a node repair process, resulting in a repair degree of\nd=n−1\n. In practical systems, it may not always be feasible to connect and download data from all surviving nodes, as some nodes may be unavailable. Therefore, there is a need for MSR code constructions with a repair degree of\nd<n−1\n. Up to now, only a few\n(n,k)\nMSR code constructions with repair degree\nd<n−1\nhave been reported, some have a large sub-packetization level, a large finite field, or restrictions on the repair degree\nd\n. In this paper, we propose a new\n(n,k)\nMSR code construction that works for any repair degree\nd>k\n, and has a smaller sub-packetization level or finite field than some existing constructions. Additionally, in conjunction with a previous generic transformation to reduce the sub-packetization level, we obtain an MDS array code with a small sub-packetization level and\n(1+ϵ)\n-optimal repair bandwidth (i.e.,\n(1+ϵ)\ntimes the optimal repair bandwidth) for repair degree\nd=n−1\n. This code outperforms some existing ones in terms of either the sub-packetization level or the field size.}

In the problem setting, the server has a library of\nN\nfiles, and each user is equipped with a dedicated cache of capacity\nM\n. A novel solution for the multi-antenna coded caching problem is obtained by designing a combinatorial structure called an extended placement delivery array (EPDA). It is shown that the placement delivery arrays known for the centralized coded caching scheme are a special class of EPDAs with\nL=1\n. Furthermore, three constructions of EPDAs are proposed for the settings: a)\nK=t+L\n, b)\nK=nt+(n−1)L;L≥t,n≥2\n, and c)\nK,L,t\nsuch that\nt+L≤K\n, where\nt=KM/N\nis an integer.

	abstract = {In this work we propose RELDEC, a novel approach for sequential decoding of moderate length low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The main idea behind RELDEC is that an optimized decoding policy is subsequently obtained via reinforcement learning based on a Markov decision process (MDP). In contrast to our previous work, where an agent learns to schedule only a single check node (CN) within a group (cluster) of CNs per iteration, in this work we train the agent to schedule all CNs in a cluster, and all clusters in every iteration. That is, in each learning step of RELDEC an agent learns to schedule CN clusters sequentially depending on a reward associated with the outcome of scheduling a particular cluster. We also modify the state space representation of the MDP, enabling RELDEC to be suitable for larger block length LDPC codes than those studied in our previous work. Furthermore, to address decoding under varying channel conditions, we propose agile meta-RELDEC (AM-RELDEC) that employs meta-reinforcement learning. The proposed RELDEC scheme significantly outperforms standard flooding and random sequential decoding for a variety of LDPC codes, including codes designed for 5G new radio.}

This assumption does not allow the exploitation of actual non-uniform priors, which may exist, to improve the threshold at which ECC decoding fails. This work presents a new scheme that builds a probabilistic model for data and uses this model to enhance ECC decoding performance. The approach is flexible because training is done online and does not assume any specific data type or structure but only the existence of some temporal correlation between codewords. This scheme can be helpful for a large class of systems, such as wireless sensors and autonomous platforms. The method was tested via simulation using standard ECC from the IEEE802.11 standard and in experiments in which an autonomous platform transmitted data to the base station. The results show significant improvement in decoding performance. Additionally, the article explains the nature of the performance gain.}

The optimal tradeoff among the normalized number of stored files (storage load), computed intermediate values (computation load), and transmitted bits in the uplink and downlink (communication loads) is characterized. A coded computing scheme is proposed to achieve the Pareto-optimal tradeoff surface, in which the access point only needs to perform simple chain coding between the signals it receives, and information- theoretical bound matching the surface is also provided.}

The server connects to users through the error-free shared link and the users in the service region of a cache node can freely retrieve all cached contents of this cache node. We aim to design a coded caching scheme for 2D caching-aided UDN system to reduce the transmission load in the worst case while meeting all possible users’ demands. First, we divide all possible users into four classes according to their geographical locations. Then our first order optimal scheme is proposed based on the Maddah-Ali and Niesen scheme. Furthermore, by compressing the transmitted signals of our first scheme based on Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code, we obtain an improved order optimal scheme with a smaller transmission load.}

	abstract = {As subclasses of spatially coupled turbo-like codes (SC-TCs), hybrid coupled serially concatenated codes (HC-SCCs) and spatially coupled serially concatenated codes (SC-SCCs) are attractive for streaming applications. However, it is a long-standing problem to estimate the error floors of HC-SCCs and SC-SCCs. To tackle this problem, we present a genie-aided approach in this paper. Specifically, we first show that the performance of a given HC-SCC or SC-SCC can be lower bounded by a hybrid concatenated code which is obtained by assuming the coupled sub-sequences are known or partially known. Second, we derive the average input-output weight enumerating functions (IOWEF) of the hybrid concatenated code ensembles corresponding to SC-SCC and HC-SCC. Third, the obtained IOWEFs are used to estimate the error floors. The numerical results show the tightness of the proposed method in estimating the error floors of SC-SCCs and HC-SCCs. We then use the proposed method to analyze the impact of the memories of the component convolutional codes on error floor. Particularly, we show that, for a given total memory order\nv\n, the lowest error floor is achieved by selecting the memories of the outer and inner component convolutional codes as\n⌈\nv\n2\n⌉\nand\n⌊\nv\n2\n⌋\n, respectively. In addition, for both SC-SCCs and HC-SCCs, reduced error floor can be achieved by increasing the outer coupling memory.}

	abstract = {As a promising technique for high-mobility wireless communications, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has been proven to enjoy excellent advantages with respect to traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Although multiple studies have considered index modulation (IM) based OTFS (IM-OTFS) schemes to further improve system performance, a challenging and open problem is the development of effective IM schemes and efficient receivers for practical OTFS systems that must operate in the presence of channel delays and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we propose two novel block-wise IM schemes for OTFS systems, named delay-IM with OTFS (DeIM-OTFS) and Doppler-IM with OTFS (DoIM-OTFS), where a block of delay/Doppler resource bins are activated simultaneously. Based on a maximum likelihood (ML) detector, we analyze upper bounds on the average bit error rates for the proposed DeIM-OTFS and DoIM-OTFS schemes, and verify their performance advantages over existing IM-OTFS systems. We also develop a multi-layer joint symbol and activation pattern detection (MLJSAPD) algorithm and a customized message passing detection (CMPD) algorithm for our proposed DeIM-OTFS and DoIM-OTFS systems with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MLJSAPD and CMPD algorithms can achieve desired performance with robustness to the imperfect channel state information (CSI).}

In this system, the users first harvest the radio-frequency energy from the AP in the downlink, then adopt the harvested energy to transmit information to the AP in the uplink concurrently. Two policies are considered for the proposed system. The first one assumes that the time-switching protocol is used in the downlink while the energy-splitting protocol is adopted in the uplink, which is referred to as time-switching and energy-splitting policy (TEP). The second one assumes that the energy-splitting protocol is utilized in both the downlink and uplink, which is referred to as double energy-splitting policy (EEP). The outage probability, sum throughput, and average age of information (AoI) of the proposed system with TEP and EEP are investigated over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels. In addition, we also analyze the outage probability, sum throughput, and average AoI of the STAR-RIS aided wireless-powered time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) system. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system with TEP and EEP yields better performance than baseline schemes. Although the proposed system sacrifices the outage probability and average AoI performance compared to STAR-RIS aided wireless-powered TDMA systems, it significantly enhances the sum throughput. Furthermore, we design a genetic-algorithm based time allocation and power allocation (GA-TAPA) algorithm to maximize the sum throughput and ensure a certain average AoI. Simulation results indicate that the proposed GA-TAPA algorithm can further improve the sum throughput of the proposed system.}

If the unitary transform is set to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, the model naturally captures filtering and spectral constraints. In particular, this model allows studying the impact of quantization on out-of-band (OOB) emission constraints. The out-of-band emission constraints are defined using a “spectrum mask” in practical wireless systems. All transmissions need to meet the OOB constraint to allow other services and technologies to operate in adjacent bands.In the limit of a large random unitary transform, it is shown that the effect of quantization can be precisely described via an additive Gaussian noise model. This model in turn leads to simple and intuitive expressions for the power spectrum of the transmitted signal and a lower bound to the capacity with quantization. Comparison with non-quantized capacity and a capacity upper bound that does not make linearity assumptions suggests that while low resolution quantization has minimal impact on the achievable rate at typical parameters in 5G systems, satisfying OOB emissions is potentially much more of a challenge.}

	abstract = {We consider a set reconciliation setting in which two parties hold similar sets that they would like to reconcile. In particular, we focus on set reconciliation based on invertible Bloom lookup tables (IBLTs), a probabilistic data structure inspired by Bloom filters. IBLT-based set reconciliation schemes have the advantage of exhibiting low computational complexity, however, the schemes available in the literature are known to be far from optimal in terms of communication complexity (overhead). The inefficiency of IBLT-based set reconciliation can be attributed to two facts. First, it requires an estimate of the cardinality of the difference between the sets, which implies an increase in overhead. Second, to cope with uncertainties in the estimation of the cardinality of the set difference, IBLT schemes in the literature oversize the data structures, thus further increasing the overhead. In this work, we present a novel IBLT-based set reconciliation protocol that does not require estimating the cardinality of the set difference. The proposed scheme relies on what we termed multi-edge-type (MET) IBLTs. The simulation results illustrate that the novel scheme outperforms state-of-the-art IBLT-based approaches to set reconciliation in terms of communication cost, i.e., in terms of the number of bits to be exchanged.}

	abstract = {Considering the infrastructure deployment cost and energy consumption, it is unrealistic to provide seamless coverage of the vehicular network. The presence of uncovered areas tends to hinder the prevalence of the in-vehicle services with large data volume. To this end, we propose a predictive cooperative multi-relay transmission strategy (PreCMTS) for the intermittently connected vehicular networks, fulfilling the 6G vision of semantic and green communications. Specifically, we introduce a task-driven knowledge graph (KG)-assisted semantic communication system, and model the KG into a weighted directed graph from the viewpoint of transmission. Meanwhile, we identify three predictable parameters about the individual vehicles to perform the following anticipatory analysis. Firstly, to facilitate semantic extraction, we derive the closed-form expression of the achievable throughput within the delay requirement. Then, for the extracted semantic representation, we formulate the mutually coupled problems of semantic unit assignment and predictive relay selection as a combinatorial optimization problem, to jointly optimize the energy efficiency and semantic transmission reliability. To find a favorable solution within limited time, we proposed a low-complexity algorithm based on Markov approximation. The promising performance gains of the PreCMTS are demonstrated by the simulations with realistic vehicle traces generated by the SUMO traffic simulator.}

	abstract = {Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has manifested great potentials in improving wireless network’s power saving, most existing literature restricts to pure physical (PHY) layer beamforming design and neglects the impact of media access control (MAC) layer’s data traffic flows. Simultaneously, current RIS technology suffers from defects — the severe fading loss and the limitation of half-space coverage. This paper aims to perform a cross-layer design via jointly optimizing MAC layer scheduling and PHY layer RIS beamforming to reduce power consumption. Besides, we propose a novel double-faced-active (DFA)-RIS architecture to promote RIS’ capability. The proposed design task leads to a highly challenging stochastic problem to minimize long-term power consumption while stabilizing queues. Inspired by Lyapunov control theory, we propose an online optimization strategy to resolve this challenge. Via exploiting alternative directional method of multipliers (ADMM), we develop an analytic-based solution to solve the online sub-problems highly efficiently without resorting to any numerical solvers. Our strategy theoretically guarantees all queues’ stability and achieves a tunable trade-off between the power expenditure and queue lengths. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed cross-layer design and the DFA-RIS’ advantage over other cutting-the-edge RIS architectures.}

	abstract = {Hybrid precoding plays a key role in realizing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitters with controllable cost. MIMO precoders are required to frequently adapt based on the variations in the channel conditions. In hybrid MIMO, where precoding is comprised of digital and analog beamforming, such an adaptation involves lengthy optimization and depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). This affects the spectral efficiency when the channel varies rapidly and when operating with noisy CSI. In this work we employ deep learning techniques to learn how to rapidly and robustly optimize hybrid precoders, while being fully interpretable. We leverage data to learn iteration-dependent hyperparameter settings of projected gradient sum-rate optimization with a predefined number of iterations. The algorithm maps channel realizations into hybrid precoding settings while preserving the interpretable flow of the optimizer and improving its inference speed. To cope with noisy CSI, we learn to optimize the minimal achievable sum-rate among all tolerable errors, proposing a hybrid precoder based on the projected conceptual mirror prox minimax optimizer. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach allows using over ten times less iterations compared to that required by conventional optimization with shared hyperparameters, while achieving similar and even improved performance.}

To reduce the computation burden, we propose a deep unfolding UE scheduling, BS clustering and beamforming (DU-USBCB) method based on the iterative weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, where the UE scheduling and BS clustering are represented by the group sparsity of the transmit beamforming vectors. The proposed DU-USBCB neural network layer comprises receive coefficient, weight and transmit beamforming vector modules, the former two of which have closed-form expressions. For the third module, the group sparse transmit beamforming vectors are obtained by multiple steps of projected gradient descent and nonlinear sparsification, where the step-sizes are learned through unsupervised learning. We also propose a distributed UE selection (DUS) algorithm, which helps reduce the computation workload. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed DU-USBCB and DUS methods. The learned step-sizes are directly applied in the testing scenarios with different numbers of UEs, BSs and antennas as well as incomplete channel state information. Besides, our proposed methods can achieve comparable performance but with about 53% and 89% computation reduction compared to the RSRP-WMMSE and SWMMSE methods respectively.}

The problem of joint control of the RIS’s amplification matrix and phase shift matrix is formulated to maximize the communication success ratio with considering the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, dynamic communication state, and dynamic available energy of RIS. To tackle this non-convex problem, a cascaded deep learning algorithm namely long short-term memory-deep deterministic policy gradient (LSTM-DDPG) is designed. First, an advanced LSTM based algorithm is developed to predict users’ dynamic communication state. Then, based on the prediction results, a DDPG based algorithm is proposed to joint control the amplification matrix and phase shift matrix of the RIS.

However, designing the hybrid precoder is challenging due to its nonconvex objective functions and constraints. Existing algorithms struggle with high computational complexity or poor performance, which often result from slow or no convergence. This study proposes a solution that leverages model-driven deep learning (DL) to maximize the spectral efficiency of MU-MIMO systems through hybrid precoding. The optimization problem is first transformed into a weighted minimum mean square error optimization. Then, it is combined with manifold optimization and DL to improve performance and simplify the process. The algorithm is designed to be robust in changing environments and utilizes DL to address imperfect channel state information.

A robust maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem is formulated by taking into consideration the CSI uncertainties caused by both the channel estimation error and the channel variation. To address the challenging discrete optimization problem, we propose an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, which only requires calculating closed-form solutions in each iteration. Furthermore, a robust detection network RADMMNet is constructed by unfolding the ADMM iterations and employing both model-driven and data-driven philosophies. Moreover, in order to relieve the computational burden, a low-complexity ADMM-based robust detector is developed using the Gaussian approximation, and the corresponding deep unfolding network LCRADMMNet is further established. On the other hand, we also provide a novel robust data-aided Kalman filter (RDAKF)-based channel tracking method, which can effectively refine the CSI accuracy and improve the performance of the proposed robust detectors. Simulation results validate the significant performance advantages of the proposed robust detection networks over the non-robust detectors with different CSI acquisition methods.}

Although there exist some approaches to address this problem, they usually require global channel state information, which is hard to obtain in practice, and get the sub-optimal power allocation policy with high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based power control scheme for the HetNet, where each access point makes power control decisions independently based on local information. To promote cooperation among agents, we develop a penalty-based Q learning (PQL) algorithm for MADRL systems. By introducing regularization terms in the loss function, each agent tends to choose an experienced action with high reward when revisiting a state, and thus the policy updating speed slows down. In this way, an agent’s policy can be learned by other agents more easily, resulting in a more efficient collaboration process. We then implement the proposed PQL in the considered HetNet and compare it with other distributed-training-and-execution (DTE) algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed PQL can learn the desired power control policy from a dynamic environment where the locations of users change episodically and outperform existing DTE MADRL algorithms.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently received significant attention in wireless networks owing to its ability to smartly control the wireless propagation through passive reflection. Although prior works have employed the IRS to enhance the system performance under various setups, the fundamental capacity limits of an IRS aided multi-antenna multi-user system have not yet been characterized. Motivated by this, we investigate an IRS aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel by considering the capacity-achieving dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme and dynamic beamforming configurations. We first propose a bisection based framework to characterize its capacity region by optimally solving the sum-rate maximization problem under a set of rate constraints, which is also applicable to characterize the achievable rate region with the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that dynamic beamforming is able to enlarge the achievable rate region of ZF if the IRS phase-shifts cannot achieve fully orthogonal channels, whereas the attained gains become marginal due to the reduction of the channel correlations induced by smartly adjusting the IRS phase-shifts. The result implies that employing the IRS is able to reduce the demand for implementing dynamic beamforming. Finally, we analytically prove that the sum-rate achieved by the IRS aided ZF is capable of approaching that of the IRS aided DPC with a sufficiently large IRS in practice. Simulation results shed light on the impact of the IRS on transceiver designs and validate our theoretical findings, which provide useful guidelines to practical systems by indicating that replacing sophisticated schemes with easy-implementation schemes would only result in slight performance loss.}

To mitigate the effects of imperfect CSIT, we employ rate-splitting (RS) multiple-access, which separates the messages into common and private streams. Unlike prior works, we present a clustered CF multi-user multiple-antenna framework with RS, which groups the transmit antennas in several clusters to reduce the computational and signaling loads. The proposed RS-CF system employs one common stream per cluster to exploit the network diversity. Furthermore, we propose new cluster-based linear precoders for this framework. We then devise a power allocation strategy for the common and private streams within clusters and derive closed-form expressions for the sum-rate performance of the proposed cluster-based RS-CF system.

While for QPSK the established minimum symbol error probability criterion is used, a criterion for PSK modulation, in general, is proposed based on the minimum union-bound symbol-error probability. Based on these criteria different low-resolution precoding approaches are proposed. First, suboptimal solutions are computed via a partial greedy search method. Then the suboptimal solutions are utilized as initialization for a novel branch-and-bound algorithm that can exploit knowledge of the system’s quality-of-service demands. Different than existing branch-and-bound approaches the proposed quality-of-service branch-and-bound method searches for a solution that attains a target symbol-error probability while going in the direction of the global optimal solution. In this sense, the proposed branch-and-bound method allows for tunable complexity performance trade-offs. Numerical results confirm that the proposed quality-of-service branch-and-bound algorithm yields reduced symbol-error probability with significantly smaller computational complexity than other state-of-the-art branch-and-bound designs.}

	abstract = {Combining simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a feasible scheme to enhance energy efficiency (EE) performance. In this paper, we investigate a multiuser IRS-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with SWIPT. For the purpose of maximizing the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the base station (BS) transmit beamforming vectors, the IRS reflective beamforming vector, and the power splitting (PS) ratios, while considering the maximum transmit power budget, the IRS reflection constraints, and the quality of service (QoS) requirements containing the minimum data rate and the minimum harvested energy of each user. The formulated EE maximization problem is non-convex and extremely complex. To tackle it, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm by decoupling the original nonconvex problem into three subproblems, which are solved iteratively by using the Dinkelbach method. In particular, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) as well as the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) techniques to solve the non-convex transmit beamforming and reflective beamforming optimization subproblems. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the AO algorithm as well as the benefit of deploying IRS for enhancing the EE performance compared with the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a system in which multiple users send periodically generated status information to a common access point (AP) over a collision channel. To avoid high overhead, there is no time synchronization and no feedback information from the AP to indicate whether a transmission is successful or not. The performance metric that we focus on is the age-of-information (AoI), which represents the freshness of the status information received at the AP. For this model, we propose a sequence based MAC scheme in which each user is pre-assigned a periodic sequence to schedule transmissions. This scheme guarantees each user at least one successful packet transmission within a sequence period, in the absence of time synchronization and feedback information from the AP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating AoI performance under a sequence based MAC scheme. We derive the closed-form expressions for average AoI, average peak AoI and average age penalty under the sequence based scheduling. Besides, we derive several critical properties of the sequences to optimize the AoI performance. Comparison results show that our proposed sequence scheme outperforms slotted ALOHA and framed ALOHA in various settings.}

In order to enable random access in such mMTC networks, base station needs to identify the active devices while operating within stringent access delay constraints. In this paper, an energy efficient active device identification protocol is proposed in which active devices transmit On-Off Keying (OOK) modulated preambles jointly and base station employs non-coherent energy detection avoiding channel estimation overheads. The minimum number of channel-uses required by the active user identification protocol is characterized in the asymptotic regime of total number of devices\nℓ\nwhen the number of active devices\nk\nscales as\nk=Θ(1)\nalong with an achievability scheme relying on the equivalence of activity detection to a group testing problem. Several practical schemes based on Belief Propagation (BP) and Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP) are also proposed. Simulation results show that BP strategies outperform COMP significantly and can operate close to the theoretical achievability bounds. In a partial-recovery setting where few misdetections are allowed, BP continues to perform well.}

	abstract = {Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) technology enables vehicles to make smart decisions, improving vehicular services and enhancing the driving experience through a secure and privacy-preserving manner in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Many existing works exploit two-layer blockchain-based FL frameworks consisting of a mainchain and subchains for data interactions among intelligent vehicles, which resolve the limited throughput issue of single blockchain-based vehicular networks. However, the existing two-layer frameworks still suffer from a) strong dependency on predetermined and fixed parameters of vehicular blockchains which limit blockchain throughput and reliability; and b) high communication costs incurred by interactions among intelligent vehicles between the mainchain and subchains. To address the above challenges, we first design an adaptive blockchain-enabled FL framework for ITS based on blockchain sharding to facilitate decentralized vehicular data flows among intelligent vehicles. A streamline-based shard transmission mechanism is proposed to ensure communication efficiency almost without compromising the FL accuracy. We further formulate the proposed framework and propose an adaptive sharding mechanism using Deep Reinforcement Learning to automate the selection of parameters of vehicular shards. Numerical results clearly show that the proposed framework and mechanisms achieve adaptive, communication-efficient, credible, and scalable data interactions among intelligent vehicles.}

	abstract = {Numerous radio units (RUs) are required to densely compose small cells in the beyond 5G mobile networks. The concept of vehicle-mounted RUs is a promising solution for dynamically deploying small cells in accordance with demand distribution. Wireless relay fronthaul networking is the key enabler for this concept, where forwarding paths of fronthaul streams are computed in real-time by an edge server using the link-state information reported from RUs. Optimization of the reporting interval is a significant issue because of the tradeoff between the freshness of report messages and network load. However, existing works have not investigated the freshness of link information in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce a new reliability metric called the reliability of information (RoI). The RoI is defined as the joint probability that all nodes in the network maintain correct information. We establish a tractable lower bound of the RoI under a mild assumption on the dynamics of node connectivity, which enables us to design small cells guaranteeing information reliability. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem to find an optimal reporting interval. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation experiments for a highly dynamic vehicular network.}

In this network, a collision happens whenever at least two nodes transmit their packets simultaneously. Thus, there is some interaction among queues, and the transmission delay of a packet might prolong more than one slot. The packets are generated at each node stochastically and independently. The nodes follow the preemptive queueing policy. In this network, we propose a trellis-based model to analyze packet system time and derive the exact average PAoI of symmetric and asymmetric slotted ALOHA networks. We confirm our analysis by simulation results in different conditions. By exploiting numerical results, we optimize the average PAoI of the symmetric slotted ALOHA network, find the PAoI-constrained regions, and compare the PAoI of slotted ALOHA networks with and without retransmission of the failed packets.}

	abstract = {We consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) optical wireless communications (OWC) system with highly correlated channels, causing bit error rate (BER) performance degradation. Because of intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), the transmitted signals are real-valued and non-negative, which limits the utilization of precoding in phase domain. We employ direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) modulation to design a group of phase rotation (PR) factors in frequency domain for OWC systems, robust against high channel correlations. The proposed PR-based precoding has a number of advantages over the power factor-based design in the literature: i) no change of transmission power on each LED; ii) no signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and no BER degradation on transmitted signals of all LEDs. We formulate an optimization problem to obtain the optimal PR factors by maximizing the minimum pairwise Euclidean distances between all candidate signals. The optimization problem is non-convex, requiring multi-dimensional exhaustive searches. In order to reduce the complexity, we propose three low-complexity PR-based precoding approaches which provide BER performances better than the power factor-based designs in the literature, and are close to their own analytical results derived, respectively. The proposed approaches are validated via a built testbed, producing comparable performance between measured and simulated BERs.}

In this scheme, phase shift keying (PSK)-modulated coherent states are allowed to be further discretely modulated with different amplitudes, so that these modulated coherent states can be scattered on different amplitude rings in phase space. The advantage for this multi-ring structure is that the error probability of quantum detector for discriminating discretely-modulated coherent states (DMCSs) is more lower than that of original single-ring discretely modulated CVQSS, which is beneficial for improving the performance of whole CVQSS system. We derive the security bound for MR-CVQSS against both eavesdroppers and dishonest users, and the numerical simulation shows that the performance of MR-CVQSS in terms of both maximal transmission distance and maximal available number of users can be largely improved. Moreover, security analysis shows that the modulation variance of MR-CVQSS does not need to be very small, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of whole CVQSS system.}

In most wireless communication systems, mMIMO is employed together with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) which exhibits a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR). While passing the OFDM signal through one of the common RF front-ends of limited linearity, significant distortion of the transmitted signal can be expected. In mMIMO systems, this problem is still relevant as in some channels the distortion component is beamformed in the same directions as the desired signal. In this work, we propose a multi-antenna clipping noise cancellation (MCNC) algorithm for the downlink of the mMIMO OFDM system. Computer simulations show it can remove nonlinear distortion even under severe nonlinearity. Next, a simplified version of the algorithm is proposed. It was observed that for the direct visibility channels, its performance is only slightly degraded with respect to the MCNC algorithm.}

The Walsh Transform is used as a computational basis for evaluating a predistorter (PD) model. The mathematical properties of the Walsh theory are exploited to adapt a memory polynomial (MP) in the sequency domain. A block-based Walsh LMS is introduced to seek the optimal PD coefficients. Simulations and results of linearization of class-AB PAs are exhibited. The comparison with conventional DPD algorithms shows that the proposed method converges 10 times faster with a reduction of 12% of the complexity for similar accuracy. Finally, a complete DPD architecture based on the Walsh Transform is proposed.}

	abstract = {The problem of fully distributed sequential change detection (FDSCD) is studied, where a bunch of distributed sensors collaboratively detect the occurrence of an abrupt event without the help of a fusion center. Due to the distributed nature, each sensor determines whether the event has occurred according to their own observations and messages received from their neighbors through noiseless links with finite capacity. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for FDSCD that views every sensor as a fusion center and mimics the behavior of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm that is optimal in the presence of fusion center. One crucial factor in the proposed algorithm is the weighting factors that reduce the influence of stale messages circulated in the network. Design of these weighting factors based on genetic algorithms is provided. Quantizer design is also studied to meet the finite capacity constraint. Two designs are proposed where the first one numerically maximizes the total output Kullback-Leibler divergence and the second one again exploits the genetic algorithms. Extensive simulations are conducted whose results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-art in terms of the tradeoff between expected delay and average run length to a false alarm.}

To extend the coverage area, the concept of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) has been proposed, yielding supporting 360° coverage user equipment (UE) located on both sides of the RIS. In this paper, we theoretically formulate the ergodic sum-rate of the STAR-RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) uplink in the face of channel estimation errors and hardware impairments (HWI). Specifically, the STAR-RIS phase shift is configured based on the statistical channel state information (CSI), followed by linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation of the equivalent channel spanning from the UEs to the access point (AP). Afterwards, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed at the AP using the estimated instantaneous CSI, and we derive the theoretical ergodic sum-rate upper bound for both perfect and imperfect SIC decoding algorithm. The theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that both the channel estimation and the ergodic sum-rate have performance floor at high transmit power region caused by transceiver hardware impairments.}

However, it suffers from hardware impairments (HWIs) in practical design, manufacturing and deployment, which inevitably degrades its performance and thus limits its full potential. To address this practical issue, we first propose a new RIS reflection model involving phase-shift errors, which is verified by the measurement results from field trials. With this beamforming model, various phase-shift errors caused by different HWIs can be analyzed. The phase-shift errors are classified into three categories: 1) globally independent and identically distributed errors; 2) grouped independent and identically distributed errors; and 3) grouped fixed errors. The impact of typical HWIs, including frequency mismatch, PIN diode failures and panel deformation, on RIS beamforming ability are studied with the theoretical model and are verified with numerical and field test data. The impact of frequency mismatch are discussed separately for narrow-band and wide-band beamforming. Finally, useful insights and guidelines on the RIS design and its deployment are highlighted for practical wireless sytsems.}

	abstract = {We propose a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based millimeter wave (mmWave) backhaul architecture that is offered as a cost effective and easy to deploy solution, to connect a disaster or remote area to the nearest core network. First, we fully characterize the single relay fixed-wing UAV-based communication system by taking into account the effects of realistic physical parameters, such as the UAV’s circular path, critical points of the flight path, heights and positions of obstacles, flight altitude, tracking error, the severity of UAV’s vibrations, the real 3D antenna pattern, mmWave atmospheric channel loss, temperature and air pressure. Second, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric, which is based on the sum of a series of Dirac delta functions. Using the SNR distribution, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic capacity of the considered system as a function of all system parameters. To provide an acceptable quality of service for longer link lengths, we extend the analytical expressions to a multi-relay system. The accuracy of the analytical expressions are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, by providing sufficient simulation results, we investigate the effects of key channel parameters such as antenna pattern gain and flight path on the performance of the considered system; and we carefully analyze the relationships between those parameters in order to maximize the average channel capacity.}

	abstract = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication technology, which employs large-scale antenna arrays, enables inherent sensing capabilities. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can utilize channel multipath angle estimates to realize integrated sensing and communication design in 6G communication systems. However, existing works have ignored the significant overhead required by the mmWave beam management when implementing SLAM with angle estimates. This study proposes a joint beam management and SLAM design that utilizes the strong coupling between the radio map and channel multipath for simultaneous beam management, localization, and mapping. In this approach, we first propose a hierarchical sweeping and sensing service design. The path angles are estimated in the hierarchical sweeping, enabling angle-based SLAM with the aid of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to realize sensing service. Then, feature-aided tracking is proposed that utilizes prior angle information generated from the radio map and IMU. Finally, a switching module is introduced to enable flexible switching between hierarchical sweeping and feature-aided tracking. Simulations show that the proposed joint design can achieve sub-meter level localization and mapping accuracy (with an error < 0.5 m). Moreover, the beam management overhead can be reduced by approximately 40% in different wireless environments.}

	abstract = {In high-resolution Earth observation imagery, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites capture and transmit images to ground to create an updated map of an area of interest. Such maps provide valuable information for meteorology and environmental monitoring, but can also be employed for real-time disaster detection and management. However, the amount of data generated by these applications can easily exceed the communication capabilities of LEO satellites, leading to congestion and packet dropping. To avoid these problems, the Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) can be used to distribute the data among multiple satellites and speed up processing. In this paper, we formulate a satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) framework for real-time and very-high resolution Earth observation and optimize the image distribution and compression parameters to minimize energy consumption. Our results show that our approach increases the amount of images that the system can support by a factor of 12\\times\nand 2\\times\nwhen compared to directly downloading the data and to local SMEC, respectively. Furthermore, energy consumption was reduced by 11% in a real-life scenario of imaging a volcanic island, while a sensitivity analysis of the image acquisition process demonstrates that energy consumption can be reduced by up to 90%.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communication will be a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. While THz frequency bands provide abundant bandwidth and extremely high data rates, their effective operation is inhibited by short communication ranges and narrow beams, thus, leading to major challenges pertaining to user mobility, beam alignment, and handover. In particular, there is a strong need for novel beam tracking methods that consider the tradeoff between enhancing the received signal strength via increasing beam directivity, and increasing the coverage probability by widening the beam. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with the goal of jointly maximizing the expected rate and minimizing the outage probability subject to transmit power and overhead constraints. Subsequently, a novel parameterized beamformer with dynamic beamwidth adaptation is proposed. In addition to the precoder, an event-based beam tracking approach is introduced that efficiently prevents outages caused by beam misalignment and dynamic blockage while maintaining a low pilot overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed beamforming scheme improves average rate performance and reduces the amount of outages caused by the brittle THz misalignment process and the particularly severe path loss in the THz band. Moreover, the proposed event-triggered THz channel estimation approach enables connectivity with minimal overhead and reliable communication at THz bands.}

First, we propose an improved density evolution (DE) algorithm for the SC-RA based JSCAC with PJEWD scheme. Based on the proposed DE algorithm, we systematically analyze the anytime property, the belief propagation (BP) decoding threshold, and the decoding complexity of this system over binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN), as well as the effects of code parameters on performances of the above three aspects. Moreover, we explore some application scenarios for JSCAC schemes, where it could maximize its advantages over the prior-art JSCC schemes. Both numerical and simulation results demonstrate the potentials of the proposed JSCAC scheme for high reliability and low latency communications. The proposed DE algorithm could also provide a good reference for the analysis of other JSCAC systems.}

	abstract = {While constructing polar codes for successive-cancellation decoding can be implemented efficiently by sorting the bit channels, finding optimal polar codes for cyclic-redundancy-check-aided successive-cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoding in an efficient and scalable manner still awaits investigation. This paper first maps a polar code to a unique heterogeneous graph called the polar-code-construction message-passing (PCCMP) graph. Next, a heterogeneous graph-neural-network-based iterative message-passing (IMP) algorithm is proposed which aims to find a PCCMP graph that corresponds to the polar code with minimum frame error rate under CA-SCL decoding. This new IMP algorithm’s major advantage lies in its scalability power. That is, the model complexity is independent of the blocklength and code rate, and a trained IMP model over a short polar code can be readily applied to a long polar code’s construction. Numerical experiments show that IMP-based polar-code constructions outperform classical constructions under CA-SCL decoding. In addition, when an IMP model trained on a length-128 polar code directly applies to the construction of polar codes with different code rates and blocklengths, simulations show that these polar-code constructions deliver comparable performance to the 5G polar codes.}

NOFDM is regarded as a frequency-domain faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling with block transmission, where each subcarrier is compressed in the frequency domain by utilizing the discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFRFT). Since pulse shaping filters are not employed, the effective bandwidth of the NOFDM signal should take into account the resulting out-of-band (OOB) radiation. Therefore, we derive a closed-form expression for the power spectral density (PSD) of the NOFDM signal with windowing for OOB reduction. Through numerical comparison, it is shown that NOFDM outperforms OFDM in view of the effective signal bandwidth if they are compared under the same number of subcarriers. On the other hand, by the capacity analysis based on the asymptotic spectral efficiency with a large number of subcarriers, we elucidate that NOFDM may not outperform OFDM from an information-theoretic perspective.}

	abstract = {Magnetic induction (MI) communications have gained substantial attention due to the advantages in special environments such as underground, underwater, and human body. MI wireless networks in such environments can enable important applications in future civil and public security fields. However, due to the particularity of application environments, it is challenging to guarantee the energy supply for MI devices. In this paper, we propose a backscatter based bidirectional full-duplex MI communication (BFMC), which can enhance the energy efficiency of MI communications. In BFMC, additional information is backscattered with the inherent backscatter property of MI channel and the backscatter device (BD) is free of self-interference (SI). For the BFMC based multi-user network, we formulate the joint magnetic beamforming and time allocation optimization problem, which aims to minimize the average energy consumption and guarantee the downlink signal to noise ratio (SNR), uplink signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), and energy harvesting requirements. The formulated problem is non-convex and transformed into magnetic beamforming and time allocation sub-problems. Based on block coordinate descent (BCD) method, the sub-problems are solved iteratively. Numerical results show that BFMC and the proposed joint beamforming and time allocation scheme can effectively reduce average energy consumption and enhance energy efficiency.}

Specifically, we assume that the receiver is capable of successfully decoding any collision of up to and including K\nconcurrent packet transmissions and can perform SIC along the tree. We show a number of novel results for this type of tree algorithms. We first derive the basic performance parameters, which are the expected length of the collision resolution interval and the throughput normalized with K\n, conditioned on the number of contending users. We then analyze their asymptotic behaviour, identifying an oscillatory component that amplifies as K\nincreases. In the next step, we derive the maximum stable throughput (MST) for the gated and windowed access assuming Poisson arrivals. We show that for windowed access, the bound on MST normalized with K\nincreases with K\n. Finally, we discuss practical issues related to implementation of such scheme, as well as compare it to slotted ALOHA-based schemes that exploit both K\n-MPR and SIC.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) architecture is the workhorse of modern communication systems. Currently, two fundamental bottlenecks, namely, power consumption and receiver saturation, limit the full potential achievement of this technology. These bottlenecks are intricately linked with the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used in each radio frequency (RF) chain. The power consumption in M-MIMO systems grows exponentially with the ADC’s bit budget while ADC saturation causes permanent loss of information. This motivates the need for a solution that can simultaneously tackle the above-mentioned bottlenecks while offering advantages over existing alternatives such as low-resolution ADCs. Taking a radically different approach to this problem, we propose\nλ\n–MIMO architecture which uses modulo ADCs (\nM\nλ\n–ADC) instead of a conventional ADC. Our work is inspired by the Unlimited Sampling Framework.\nM\nλ\n–ADC in the RF chain folds high dynamic range signals into low dynamic range modulo samples, thus alleviating the ADC saturation problem. At the same time, digitization of modulo signal results in high resolution quantization. In the novel\nλ\n–MIMO context, we discuss baseband signal reconstruction, detection and uplink achievable sum-rate performance. The key takeaways of our work include, (a) leveraging higher signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR), (b) detection and average uplink sum-rate performances comparable to a conventional, infinite-resolution ADC when using a 1–2 bit\nM\nλ\n–ADC. This enables higher order modulation schemes e.g., 1024 QAM that seemed previously impossible, (c) superior trade-off between energy efficiency and bit budget, thus resulting in higher power efficiency. Numerical simulations and modulo ADC based hardware experiments corroborate our theory and reinforce the clear benefits of\nλ\n–MIMO approach.}

	abstract = {The evolution of mobile communication networks has always been accompanied by the advancement of inter-symbol interference (ISI) mitigation techniques, from equalization in the second-generation (2G), spread spectrum and RAKE receiver in the third generation (3G), to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G). Looking forward towards the sixth-generation (6G), by exploiting the high spatial resolution brought by large antenna arrays and the multi-path sparsity of millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz channels, a novel ISI mitigation technique termed delay alignment modulation (DAM) was recently proposed. However, existing works only consider the single-carrier perfect DAM, which is feasible only when the number of base station (BS) antennas is no smaller than that of channel paths, so that all multi-path signal components can be aligned for arriving at the receiver simultaneously and constructively. This imposes stringent requirements on the number of BS antennas and multi-path sparsity. In this paper, we propose a generic DAM technique to manipulate the channel delay spread via spatial-delay processing, thus providing a flexible framework to combat channel time dispersion for efficient single- or multi-carrier transmissions. To gain some insights, we first show that when the number of BS antennas is much larger than that of channel paths, perfect delay alignment can be achieved to transform the time-dispersive channel to time non-dispersive channel with the simple delay pre-compensation and path-based maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. When perfect DAM is infeasible or undesirable, the proposed generic DAM technique can be applied to significantly reduce the channel delay spread. Based on such results, we further propose the novel DAM-OFDM technique, which is able to save the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead or mitigate the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) issue suffered by conventional OFDM. We show that the proposed DAM-OFDM involves joint frequency- and time-domain beamforming optimization, for which a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed DAM-OFDM achieves significant performance gains over the conventional OFDM, in terms of spectral efficiency, bit error rate (BER) and PAPR.}

	abstract = {One of the most critical challenges of federated learning (FL) is to send data efficiently and reliably over the noisy wireless channels between the clients and server to achieve target learning accuracy as fast as possible. To achieve this goal, we design effective error correction coded FL with managed retransmissions. Rather than using Shannon capacity as the performance measure to design the communication mechanisms for FL, our approach relies critically on learning accuracy. Our fundamental idea is based on the observation that Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) and its family can tolerate some errors in the course of training. Inspired by this, to reduce the communication burden without degrading the learning accuracy, our FL framework with Managed Redundancy (FL-MR) has two phases: (i) the No-Retransmission phase, where retransmissions are never performed even in case of erroneous decoding of data and (ii) the Select Retransmission phase, where only some carefully selected data packets are retransmitted. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed coded FL system achieves target accuracies much faster than the baseline coded approach.}

Realizing that may greatly simplify the deployment and operation of these surfaces and reduce the infrastructure control overhead. This paper investigates the feasibility of building standalone/transparent RIS systems and shows that one key challenge lies in determining the user equipment (UE)-side RIS beam reflection direction. To address this challenge, we propose to equip the RISs with multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., using wireless and visual sensors) that enable them to develop some perception of the surrounding environment and the mobile users. Based on that, we develop a machine learning framework that leverages the wireless and visual sensors at the RIS to select the high-performance beams between the base station (BS) and UEs and enable standalone/transparent RIS operation for 5G high-frequency systems. Using a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with co-existing wireless and visual data, we extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict the BS and UE-side candidate beams, and that the standalone RIS beam selection solution is capable of realizing near-optimal achievable rates with significantly reduced beam training overhead.}

To sustain several such applications, the wireless access points need to probe the users in the network periodically in an energy-efficient manner. We study a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting that mandates probing all the arms periodically while keeping track of the best current arm in a piece-wise stationary environment. We develop TS-GE that balances the regret guarantees of the classical Thompson sampling (TS) with the broadcast probing (BP) of all the arms simultaneously in order to actively detect a change in the reward distributions. The main innovation is in identifying the changed arm by an optional indexing subroutine called group exploration (GE) that scales as\nlog\n2\n(K)\nfor a\nK−\narmed bandit setting. We characterize the probability of missed detection and the probability of false alarms in terms of environmental parameters. We highlight the conditions for which the regret guarantee of TS-GE outperforms that of the state-of-the-art passively-adaptive and actively-adaptive algorithms, in particular, ADSWITCH . We demonstrate the efficacy of TS-GE by employing it in two wireless system applications - task offloading in mobile-edge computing (MEC) and an industrial Internet-of-Things (I-IoT) network designed for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT).}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free MIMO achieves an extremely high rate while its beam alignment (BA) suffers from excessive overhead due to a large number of transceivers. Recently, user location and probing measurements are utilized for BA based on machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural network (DNN). However, most of these ML models are centralized with high communication and computational overhead and give no specific consideration to practical issues, e.g., limited training data and real-time model updates. In this paper, we study the probing beam-based BA for mmWave cell-free MIMO downlink with the help of broad learning (BL). For channels without and with uplink-downlink reciprocity, we propose the user-side and base station (BS)-side BL-aided incremental collaborative BA approaches. Via transforming the centralized BL into a distributed learning with data and feature splitting respectively, the user-side and BS-side schemes realize implicit sharing of multiple user data and multiple BS features. Simulations confirm that the user-side scheme is applicable to fast time-varying and/or non-stationary channels, while the BS-side scheme is suitable for systems with low-bandwidth fronthaul links and a central unit with limited computing power. The advantages of proposed schemes are also demonstrated compared to traditional and DNN-aided BA schemes.}

	abstract = {Unsourced random access emerged as a novel wireless paradigm enabling massive device connectivity on the uplink. We consider quasi-static Rayleigh fading wherein the access point has multiple receive antennas and every mobile device a single transmit antenna. The objective is to construct a coding scheme that minimizes the energy-per-bit subject to a maximum probability of error given a fixed message length and a prescribed number of channel uses. Every message is partitioned into two parts: the first determines pilot values and spreading sequences; the remaining bits are encoded using a polar code. The transmitted signal contains two distinct sections. The first features pilots and the second is composed of spread modulated symbols. The receiver has three modules: an energy detector, tasked with recovering the set of active pilot sequences; a bank of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimators acting on measurements at the receiver; and a polar list-decoder, which seeks to retrieve the coded information bits. A successive cancellation step is applied to subtract recovered codewords, before the residual signal is fed back to the decoder. Empirical evidence suggests that an appropriate combination of these ideas can outperform state-of-the-art coding techniques when the number of active users exceeds one hundred.}

Considering that the number of users is much larger than that of beams or feeds, user selection should be performed so that multiple users can be served successively in different time slots. In order to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users and maximize the system sum rate, three user selection algorithms are proposed: greedy user selection (GUS) algorithm, add swap user selection (AS) algorithm, and random add swap user selection (RAS) algorithm. Among the three algorithms, only the “add” operation is adopted in the GUS algorithm, both the “add”, and “swap” operations are considered in the AS algorithm. On this basis, heuristic search and “random swap” operation are introduced and the RAS algorithm is obtained. The complexity of the above three algorithms is analyzed analytically and the RAS algorithm is found to have the highest complexity. Besides, the performance of the three algorithms is analyzed and compared through simulations, where the random user selection (RUS) algorithm is taken as a benchmark. Numerical results show that the system sum rate and energy efficiency are greatly improved by the proposed algorithms and the RAS algorithm has the best performance.}

	abstract = {To satisfy the highly heterogeneous requirements of Internet of Things applications for the sixth-generation (6G) networks, the machine-type communication (MTC) aims to support multiple types of services having diverse traffic demands, which will cause significant challenges in the grant-free based channel estimation (CE) and multi-user detection (MUD) scheme design for massive MTC (mMTC) networks. To address this challenge, we develop a multi-state Markov chain based transmission model to characterize the diverse time-varying traffic demands for MTC users, where the temporal correlation of user activity and the data length diversity are jointly exploited. Based on the developed transmission model, a multi-service oriented joint CE-MUD scheme is proposed to realize the efficient CE, user activity identification and data detection. Specifically, we first construct the joint block sparse structure for the transmitted pilot and data signals to fully explore the structured sparsity of the pilot and data symbols. Then, we convert the joint CE-MUD into a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) problem such that the block sparsity of the transmitted signals and the diverse traffic demands provided by the established transmission model can be efficiently exploited. Moreover, we further develop an adjustable prior probability aided Bayesian sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (APP-BSAMP) algorithm to efficiently solve the formulated MAP problem. In the proposed algorithm, we first adjust the prior user activation probabilities through the approximate message passing (AMP) based detector to reduce the impact of the misestimation of user transmission status. Then, we jointly reconstruct the transmitted pilot and data signals under the Bayesian pursuit framework, where the active user set is obtained by maximizing the posterior probabilities. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a substantial performance gain over existing methods.}

In this paper, we focus on unpredictable frame-synchronized traffic, which captures a number of scenarios in IoT communications, and generalize prior studies on this issue by considering a general ALOHA-like protocol, a general single-packet reception (SPR) channel, urgency-dependent throughput (UDT) based on a general urgency function, and the dynamic programming optimality. With a complete knowledge of the number of active users, we use the theory of Markov Decision Process (MDP) to explicitly obtain optimal policies for maximizing the UDT, and prove that a myopic policy is in general optimal. With an incomplete knowledge of the number of active users, we use the theory of Partially Observable MDP (POMDP) to seek optimal policies, and show that a myopic policy is in general not optimal by presenting a counterexample. Because of the prohibitive complexity to obtain optimal or near-optimal policies for this case, we propose two practical policies that utilize the inherent property of our MDP framework and channel model. Simulation results show that both outperform other alternatives. The robustness under relaxed system settings is also examined.}

In particular, two CR-NOMA transmission protocols are developed by utilizing the key features of different data generation models and applying CR-NOMA as an add-on to a legacy orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based network. The fact that the implementation of CR-NOMA causes little disruption to the legacy OMA network means that the proposed CR-NOMA protocols can be practically implemented in various communication systems which are based on OMA. Closed-form expressions for the AoI achieved by the proposed NOMA protocols are developed to facilitate performance evaluation, and asymptotic studies are carried out to identify two benefits of using NOMA to reduce the AoI in wireless networks. One is that the use of NOMA provides users more opportunities to transmit, which means that the users can update their base station more frequently. The other is that the use of NOMA can reduce access delay, i.e., the users are scheduled to transmit earlier than in the OMA case, which is useful to improve the freshness of the data available in the wireless network.}

	abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) network has been thriving in the IoT era due to its long-range coverage and energy efficiency. Prevalent LoRa applications rely on time synchronization to achieve accurate data ordering and coordination among the LoRa network. The energy-efficient nature of the LoRa network where end nodes in sleep scheduling always initiate communications, however, contradicts most conventional time synchronization methods based on message exchanges. In this paper, we propose a one-way time synchronization scheme tailored for the energy-efficient LoRa network based on the reverse asymmetric framework. We first discuss the delay minimization and compensation for the reverse one-way time synchronization in the LoRa network. We then propose a time synchronization scheme consisting of two time translation methods with different computational complexities and error bounds, respectively for resource-abundant and -constrained LoRa gateway and end nodes. Experiment results on a real LoRa testbed consisting of LoRa gateway and end nodes demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve microsecond-level synchronization accuracy in both scenarios between the end node and gateway and between the end node and end node; the latter scenario is advocated in the recent multi-hop LoRa network research.}

	abstract = {The explosively increasing development of marine communication networks will improve the quality of service (QoS) of marine applications (e.g., ocean farm and marine tourism), which has attracted much attention from both academia and industrial in recent years. However, real-time data processing for diverse marine tasks (especially those computing-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks) is still challenging due to the limited marine communication and computing resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) driven by powerful computing capability is envisioned as a promising solution to address the issue for resource-constrained marine services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offshore and aerial-based multi-access edge computing scheme in marine communication networks to improve the QoS of marine applications. Specifically, we consider a scenario that both offshore base-station and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are equipped with edge-servers, and the computation workloads of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) can be simultaneously offloaded to offshore base-station and UAVs via multi-access manner. To minimize the latency of completing USV’s workloads and reduce USV’s energy consumption, we formulate a joint optimization problem to optimize the offloading decision, transmission time, and computing-rate allocation, with the objective of M inimizing the M aximum W orkloads L atency (MMWL). Exploiting the features of the formulated problem, we present a layered structure approach and decompose it into three subproblems. We propose efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions and validate the optimality of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we provide simulation results and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme and algorithms in comparison with benchmark algorithms.}

However, in multi-cell systems, PKG suffers from severe pilot contamination due to the reuse of pilots in different cells. In this paper, we invoke multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for adaptively shaping the environment and enhancing the PKG performance. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum key rate (WSKR) by jointly optimizing the precoding matrices at the base stations (BSs) and the phase shifts at the RISs. To address the non-convexity of the problem, we adopt an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that divides the joint optimization problem into two subproblems. For the subproblem of precoding matrices, we apply the Lagrangian dual approach based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. As for the subproblem of phase shifts, we adopt a projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating significant gains in WSKR. Moreover, compared with a single-RIS case, deploying multiple RISs offer spatial diversity so as to improve the PKG performance of multicell systems.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new simultaneous information relaying and jamming (SIRJ) scheme based on a dual-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve secure non-orthogonal multiple access communications. Specifically, the RIS elements are split into two groups, where elements in one group perform signal reflection to enhance the legitimate reception quality while elements in the other group generate artificial jamming to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve). Based on different channel state information (CSI) availabilities of Eve, the system sum-rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of the base station, reflect beamforming of the RIS, and mode selection of each RIS element, subject to a maximum tolerable information leakage to Eve. For the case with perfect Eve’s CSI, a penalty based alternating algorithm is proposed to deal with the challenging multivariate coupled and mixed integer non-convex optimization problem. For the case with imperfect Eve’s CSI, we consider the infinite number of secrecy constraints, for which the traditional\nS\n-procedure cannot be directly applied. To tackle this challenge, we devise an efficient transformation that fits the\nS\n-procedure to the problem and propose a robust secure beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed SIRJ scheme over the existing baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has shown its great potential in facilitating device-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where sensing and communication tasks are mostly conducted on different time-frequency resources. While the more challenging scenarios of simultaneous sensing and communication (SSC) have so far drawn little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel RIS-aided ISAC framework where the inherent location information in the received communication signals from a blind-zone user equipment is exploited to enable SSC. We first design a two-phase ISAC transmission protocol. In the first phase, communication and coarse-grained location sensing are performed concurrently by exploiting the very limited channel state information, while in the second phase, by using the coarse-grained sensing information obtained from the first phase, simple-yet-efficient sensing-based beamforming designs are proposed to realize both higher-rate communication and fine-grained location sensing. We demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve almost the same performance as the communication-only frameworks, while providing up to millimeter-level positioning accuracy. In addition, we show how the communication and sensing performance can be simultaneously boosted through our proposed sensing-based beamforming designs. The results presented in this work provide valuable insights into the design and implementation of other ISAC systems considering SSC.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication scheme which uses the concept of spatial modulation, namely RIS-assisted receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-RQSM). In the proposed RIS-RQSM system, the information bits are conveyed via both the indices of the two selected receive antennas and the conventional in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulation. We propose a novel methodology to adjust the phase shifts of the RIS elements in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and at the same time to construct two separate PAM symbols at the selected receive antennas, as the in-phase and quadrature components of the desired IQ symbol. An energy-based greedy detector (GD) is implemented at the receiver to efficiently detect the received signal with minimal channel state information (CSI) via the use of an appropriately designed one-tap pre-equalizer. We also derive a closed-form upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed RIS-RQSM system. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the ABEP in order to improve the performance of the system, which allows the GD to act as a near-optimal receiver. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the error rate performance of the system and to compare with that of a prominent benchmark scheme. The results verify the remarkable superiority of the proposed RIS-RQSM system over the benchmark scheme.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is recognized as an enabler of future dual-function radar-communications (DFRC) by improving spectral efficiency, coverage, parameter estimation, and interference suppression. Prior studies on IRS-aided DFRC focus either on narrowband processing, single-IRS deployment, static targets, non-clutter scenario, or on the under-utilized line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. In this paper, we address the aforementioned shortcomings by optimizing a wideband DFRC system comprising multiple IRSs and a dual-function base station that jointly processes the LoS and NLoS wideband multi-carrier signals to improve both the communications SINR and the radar SINR in the presence of a moving target and clutter. We formulate the transmit, receive and IRS beamformer design as the maximization of the worst-case radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) subject to transmit power and communications SINR. We tackle this nonconvex problem under the alternating optimization framework, where the subproblems are solved by a combination of Dinkelbach algorithm, consensus alternating direction method of multipliers, and Riemannian steepest decent. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed multi-IRS-aided wideband DFRC provides over 4 dB radar SINR and 31.7% improvement in target detection over a single-IRS system.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be used extensively in the future for various applications, either as user equipment (UEs) connected to a cellular wireless network, or as an infrastructure extension of an existing wireless network to serve other UEs. Next generation wireless networks will consider the use of UAVs for joint communication and radar and/or as dedicated radars for various sensing applications. Increasing number of UAVs will naturally result in larger number of communication and/or radar links that may cause interference to nearby networks, exacerbated further by the higher likelihood of line-of-sight signal propagation from UAVs even to distant receivers. With all these, it is critical to study network coexistence of UAV-mounted base stations (BSs) and radar transceivers. In this paper, using stochastic geometry, we derive closed-form expressions to characterize the performance of coexisting UAV radar and communication networks for spectrum overlay multiple access (SOMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA). We evaluate successful ranging probability (SRP) and the transmission capacity (TC) and compare the performance of TDMA and SOMA. Our results show that SOMA can outperform TDMA on both SRP and TC when the node density of active UAV-radars is larger than the node density of UAV-comms.}

	abstract = {Recently, the full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output relay (FD-MIMO-R) has been widely considered a promising way to increase the spectrum efficiency of a cooperative communication network. Under frequency-selective fading channels, an FD-MIMO-R system simultaneously exhibits the self-interference (SI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Most existing transceiver designs aim to cancel or mitigate these two interferences by treating them as harmful signals. However, SI and ISI are inherently generated from the desired signal, which implies that further performance improvement is possible if they can be properly exploited. This concept motivates us to propose novel finite-order space-time source and relay filters so that the end-to-end mean-square error can be minimized. Our design is based on the following two phases. First we derive the optimum spectrums of the source and relay filters with a majorization theory and alternating optimization. The finite-order filters are then developed by applying the weighted least-square criterion. Numerical experiments show that our proposed filters are indeed able to significantly improve the system performance in either flat or frequency-selective fading channels.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been widely considered as a key technique to improve spectral efficiency for the 5th generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) communications. Compared with most existing research that only focuses on the reflective RIS, the design and prototyping of a novel transmissive RIS are presented in this paper, and its enhancement to the RIS-aided communication system is experimentally demonstrated. The 2-bit transmissive RIS element utilizes the penetration structure, which combines a 1-bit current reversible dipole and a 90° digital phase shifter based on a quadrature hybrid coupler. A transmissive RIS prototype with\n16×16\nelements is designed, fabricated, and measured to verify the proposed design. The measured phase shift and insertion loss of the RIS element validate the 2-bit phase modulation capability. Being illuminated by a horn feed, the prototype achieves a maximum broadside gain of 22.0 dBi at 27 GHz, and the two-dimensional beamforming capability with scan angles up to ±60° is validated. The experimental results of the RIS-aided communication system verify that by introducing the extra gain and beam steering capability, the transmissive RIS is able to achieve a higher data rate, reduce the transmit power, improve the transmission capability through obstacles, and dynamically adapt to the signal propagation direction.}

	abstract = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) is a promising passive device that contributes to full-space coverage via transmitting and reflecting the incident signal simultaneously. As a new paradigm in wireless communications, how to analyze the coverage and capacity performance of STAR-RISs becomes essential but challenging. To solve the coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) problem in STAR-RIS-assisted networks, a multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MO-PPO) algorithm is proposed to handle long-term effects. To strike a balance between each objective, the MO-PPO algorithm provides a set of optimal solutions to approach a Pareto front (PF), where the solution on the approximate PF is regarded as an optimal result. Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the MO-PPO algorithm, two update strategies, i.e., action-value-based update strategy (AVUS) and loss function-based update strategy (LFUS), are investigated. For the AVUS, the improved point is to integrate the action values of both coverage and capacity and then update the loss function. For the LFUS, the improved point is only to assign dynamic weights for both loss functions of coverage and capacity, while the weights are calculated by a min-norm solver at every update. The numerical results demonstrated that the investigated update strategies outperform the fixed weights MO optimization algorithms in different cases, which include a different number of sample grids, the number of STAR-RISs, the number of elements in the STAR-RISs, and the size of STAR-RISs. Additionally, the STAR-RIS-assisted networks achieve better performance than conventional wireless networks without STAR-RISs. Moreover, with the same bandwidth, a millimetre wave is able to provide higher capacity than sub-6 GHz, but at a cost of smaller coverage.}

In this paper, we consider an UAV-assisted network where the UAV flies between the resource-limited sensor nodes (SNs) and collects their status updates. The UAV trajectory and SN scheduling are jointly optimized to minimize the Age of Synchronization (AoS). In contrast to the conventional Age of Information (AoI), AoS takes into account both the freshness and the content of the information, which makes AoS a more suitable design criterion for information collection in an energy-constrained wireless network. Since the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non convexity, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to obtain the optimal solution with various action and state spaces. Our simulation results show the fast convergence rate of the proposed DRL algorithm and demonstrate that our proposed scheme can improve the performance of the UAV-assisted network compared to AoI-based schemes.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique that smartly reshapes wireless propagation environment in the future wireless networks. In this paper, we apply RIS to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, in which the transmit signals from multiple UAVs to ground users are strengthened through RIS. Our objective is to minimize the power consumption of the system while meeting the constraints of minimum data rate for users and minimum inter-UAV distance. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex by jointly optimizing the position of UAVs, RIS reflection coefficients, transmit power, active beamforming vectors and decoding order, and thus is quite hard to solve optimally. To tackle this problem, we divide the resultant optimization problem into four independent subproblems, and solve them in an iterative manner. In particular, we first consider the sub-solution of UAVs placement which can be obtained via the successive convex approximation (SCA) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). By applying the Gaussian randomization procedure, we yield the closed-form expression for the RIS reflection coefficients. Subsequently, the transmit power is optimized using standard convex optimization methods. Finally, a dynamic-order decoding scheme is presented for optimizing the NOMA decoding order in order to guarantee fairness among users. Simulation results verify that our designed joint UAV deployment and resource allocation scheme can effectively reduce the total power consumption compared to the benchmark methods, thus verifying the advantages of combining RIS into the multi-UAV assisted NOMA networks.}

Besides, there are several reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that aim to improve the coverage quality, spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE). Relying on the knowledge of only imperfect channel state information, a tight closed-form expression for the lower-bound achievable SE is derived. Based on this expression, we quantitatively investigate the impacts of different system parameters on uplink SE and EE, and conduct a tradeoff analysis between using more APs versus using more RISs with respect to the above performance metrics. In addition, we also design a max-min SE algorithm that takes into account both large-scale fading decoding weights and power control coefficients to guarantee UE fairness. Specifically, the proposed algorithm admits a closed-form solution and is therefore memory-efficient and time-saving. Both the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed max-min SE algorithm are verified via extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can improve the performance of wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the radio environment, existing passive RISs face two key challenges, i.e., double-fading attenuation and dependence on grid/battery. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new RIS architecture, called multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS). Different from conventional reflecting-only RIS, the proposed MF-RIS is capable of supporting multiple functions with one surface, including signal reflection, amplification, and energy harvesting. As such, our MF-RIS is able to overcome the double-fading attenuation by harvesting energy from incident signals. Through theoretical analysis, we derive the achievable capacity of an MF-RIS-aided communication network. Compared to the capacity achieved by the existing self-sustainable RIS, we derive the number of reflective elements required for MF-RIS to outperform self-sustainable RIS. To realize a self-sustainable communication system, we investigate the use of MF-RIS in improving the sum-rate of multi-user wireless networks. Specifically, we solve a non-convex optimization problem by jointly designing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS coefficients. As an extension, we investigate a resource allocation problem in a practical scenario with imperfect channel state information. By approximating the semi-infinite constraints with the \\mathcal {S}\n-procedure and the general sign-definiteness, we propose a robust beamforming scheme to combat the inevitable channel estimation errors. Finally, numerical results show that: 1) compared to the self-sustainable RIS, MF-RIS can strike a better balance between energy self-sustainability and throughput improvement; and 2) unlike reflecting-only RIS which can be deployed near the transmitter or receiver, MF-RIS should be deployed closer to the transmitter for higher spectrum efficiency.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) has recently been proposed to improve cell edge performance. However, most prior works consider perfect hardware impairments (HIs), which are difficult to be achieved in practical systems. This paper studies the impact of HI in an uplink cell-free mMIMO system with both multi-antenna access points (APs) and multi-antenna user terminals (UTs) under the Weichselberger channel model.Firstly, we study a two-layer decoding scheme with local minimum mean-squared error or maximum ratio combining at the AP side and with optimal large-scale fading decoding in the central processing unit. We derive novel closed-form SE expressions and prove that the effect of HI can be mitigated in the case of UTs with multiple antennas. However, the achievable SE is constrained by the pilot contamination and pilot overhead. To this end, the superimposed pilot (SP) transmission method is considered in this paper, where all the coherence intervals are used for both pilot and data symbols transmission. Finally, numerical results verify our derived expressions and reveal the relationship between HI and the number of antennas per UT for different pilot schemes. Note that the advantages of SP over regular pilots disappear when the hardware quality decreases with multi-antenna UTs.}

	abstract = {Delivering as many data packets as possible and making the life time of the network as long as possible is one fundamental request for battery-driven wireless network design, where sleeping schemes are usually adopted for prolonging the life time, while, at the sacrifice of the throughput performance. For random access networks, fulfilling this fundamental request is rather challenging due to the distributed nature of the access behavior of nodes. This paper considers massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) networks where each node adapts the representative random access scheme Aloha and periodical sleeping-awake cycle. We aim to address how to maximize the life-time throughput of each node, i.e., average number of packets each node can successfully deliver during its life time, with a guarantee of targeted life time via optimal selection of the channel access probability and the sleeping ratio of each node. By deriving the explicit expressions of the life time and the life-time throughput of each node and jointly tuning both the channel access probability and the sleeping ratio, we characterize the maximum life-time throughput with targeted life time, and the corresponding optimal settings. The analysis reveals that if only the channel access probability is optimally tuned, then the throughput and life-time throughput cannot be optimized simultaneously when the network becomes saturated with a large packet arrival rate. In contrast, the network would operate at unsaturated conditions via the joint tuning of the access probability and the sleeping ratio. In this case, the maximum life-time throughput always grows with the packet arrival rate. In addition, it is shown that the effect of the life-time constraint becomes significant only when it exceeds a threshold, where maximum life-time throughput will sacrifice for life-time expectation. The analysis sheds important light on the access and sleeping scheme design of practical Aloha-type networks. By taking Narrow Band-IoT with Power Saving Mode (PSM) as an example, extensive simulation results corroborate that with the proposed optimal setting, the life-time throughput could be significantly improved, especially when the life time requirement is demanding, e.g., 10 years without battery replacement.}

	abstract = {Metaverse aims for building a fully immersive virtual shared space, where the users are able to engage in various activities. To successfully deploy the service for each user, the Metaverse service provider and network service provider generally localise the user first and then support the communication between the base station (BS) and the user. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is capable of creating a reflected link between the BS and the user to enhance line-of-sight. Furthermore, the new key performance indicators (KPIs) in Metaverse, such as its energy-consumption-dependent total service cost and transmission latency, are often overlooked in ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) designs, which have to be carefully considered in next-generation URLLC (xURLLC) regimes. In this paper, our design objective is to jointly optimise the transmit power, the RIS phase shifts, and the decoding error probability to simultaneously minimise the total service cost and transmission latency and approach the Pareto Front (PF). We conceive a twin-stage central controller, which aims for localising the users first and then supports the communication between the BS and users. In the first stage, we localise the Metaverse users, where the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is invoked for accurate user localisation. In the second stage, a meta-learning-based position-dependent multi-objective soft actor and critic (MO-SAC) algorithm is proposed to approach the PF between the total service cost and transmission latency and to further optimise the latency-dependent reliability. Our numerical results demonstrate that 1) The proposed solution strikes a tradeoff between the total service cost and transmission latency, which provides a candidate group of optimal solutions for diverse practical scenarios. 2) The proposed meta-learning-based MO-SAC algorithm is capable of adaption to new wireless environments, compared to the benchmarkers. 3) The approximate PF depicted discovered the relationships among the KPIs for the Metaverse, which provides guidelines for its deployment.}

	abstract = {The meta distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) provides fine-grained information about each link’s performance in a wireless system and the reliability of the whole network. While the UAV-enabled network has been studied extensively, most of the works focus on the spatial average performance, such as coverage probability, while SINR meta distribution has received less attention. In this paper, we use the SINR meta distribution to systematically analyze the improvement and the influence of deploying UAVs on the reliability of a wireless network. We first derive the\nb\n-th moments of the conditional success probability of the UAV-enabled network and give the approximated expressions derived by Gil-Pelaez theorem and the beta approximation of the meta distribution. Our numerical results show that deploying UAVs in wireless networks in most cases can greatly improve the system reliability, which denotes the fraction of users achieving cellular coverage, especially for the spatially-clustered users. In addition, establishing LoS links is not always beneficial since it also increases the interference. For instance, with the increase of the SINR threshold, the system reliability of a high LoS probability environment decreases dramatically and it is even lower than a low LoS probability environment. We also show that in highrise urban areas, UAVs can help in establishing extremely reliable (very high SINR) links.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a potential 6G candidate waveform which provides improved performance in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper we investigate the combination of OTFS with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Existing equalization and detection methods for OTFS-NOMA, such as minimum-mean-squared error with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC), suffer from poor performance. Additionally, existing iterative methods for single-user OTFS based on low-complexity iterative least-squares solvers are not directly applicable to the NOMA scenario due to the presence of multi-user interference (MUI). Motivated by this, in this paper we propose a low-complexity method for equalization and detection for OTFS-NOMA. The proposed method uses a novel reliability zone (RZ) detection scheme which estimates the reliable symbols of the users and then uses interference cancellation to remove MUI. The thresholds for the RZ detector are optimized in a greedy manner to further improve detection performance. In order to optimize these thresholds, we modify the least squares with QR-factorization (LSQR) algorithm used for channel equalization to compute the post-equalization mean-squared error (MSE), and track the evolution of this MSE throughout the iterative detection process. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed equalization and detection technique to the existing MMSE-SIC benchmark in terms of symbol error rate (SER).}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, where a massive number of geographically distributed access points cooperate to jointly serve the users, have been proved to solve many of the interference related issues associated to cellular networks. One of the main challenges of cell-free massive MIMO networks, however, is to guarantee that the potential benefits this architecture entails can be achieved with signal processing computational complexities and fronthaul resource requirements that are scalable as the number of users goes to infinity. User-centric architectures have been proposed in the literature that potentially solve the scalability issues related to, first, the signal processing associated to channel estimation and massive MIMO combining/precoding, second, the power allocation algorithms and, third, the fronthaul signaling for data and channel state information sharing. One of the best centralized combiners/precoders that have been proposed in practice, however, which is termed as partial minimum mean square error (P-MMSE), does not allow obtaining expressions of its spectral efficiency in a scalable way except when using lower bounds based on the well-known use-and-then-forget (UatF) approach. These lower bounds, however, in addition to being rather inaccurate, are not suited for the design and analysis of non-linear combining/precoding schemes based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) when users are equipped with multiple antennas. In this paper, we propose novel linear and non-linear combining/precoding schemes, which we term improved P-MMSE (IP-MMSE), whose achievable spectral efficiency can be accurately analyzed in a scalable manner. The proposed IP-MMSE combiner/precoder achieves spectral efficiencies close to that provided by MMSE-based unscalable solutions, and outperforms to a great extent the P-MMSE-based counterparts.}

Statistical properties of the proposed model are derived, including STF correlation function and multi-link spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), and the corresponding numerical results are analyzed. Moreover, the proposed model is verified by channel measurements in two high-mobility communication scenarios, such as vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario and high-speed railway scenario, in terms of temporal autocorrelation function, frequency correlation function and multi-link spatial CCF. It shows a good agreement between the measurement and model results, which confirms the reliability of the proposed model.}

The statistical model of the state feedback matrix can be updated according to the Markov model. With the established statistical model of the state feedback matrix, we build the statistical model of the IDNC graph, which can be used to indicate the likelihood of the coding opportunities among the vertices in the IDNC graph. The decoding delay reduction problem can be formulated as a maximum weight clique (MWC) problem. We develop two heuristic algorithms to solve the MWC problem, namely the maximum weight vertex (MWV) search and the approximate maximum weight path based MWV (A-MWP-MWV) search. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme based on statistical reception status model outperforms the scheme which keeps the reception state unchanged due to lossy feedback in estimating the reception status, and A-MWP-MWV outperforms MWV in solving the MWC problem without increasing additional complexity.}

	abstract = {The pivotal storage density win achieved by solid-state devices over magnetic devices in 2015 is a result of multiple innovations in physics, architecture, and signal processing. One of the most important innovations in that regard is enabling the storage of more than one bit per cell in the Flash device, i.e., having more than two charge levels per cell. Constrained coding is used in Flash devices to increase reliability via mitigating inter-cell interference that stems from charge propagation among cells. Recently, capacity-achieving constrained codes were introduced to serve that purpose in modern Flash devices, which have more than two levels per cell. While these codes result in minimal redundancy via exploiting the underlying physics, they result in non-negligible complexity increase and access speed limitation since pages cannot be read separately. In this paper, we suggest new constrained coding schemes that have low-complexity and preserve the desirable high access speed in modern Flash devices. The idea is to eliminate error-prone patterns by coding data either only on the left-most page (binary coding) or only on the two left-most pages (4-ary coding) while leaving data on all the remaining pages uncoded. Our coding schemes work for any number of levels $q \\geq 4$ per cell, offer systematic encoding and decoding, and are capacity-approaching. Since the proposed schemes enable the separation of pages, except the two left-most pages in the case of 4-ary coding, we refer to them as read-and-run (RR) constrained coding schemes as opposed to schemes adopting read-and-wait for other pages. The 4-ary RR coding scheme is introduced in order to limit the rate loss incurred by the binary RR coding schemes, and we show that our 4-ary RR coding scheme is also competitive when it comes to complexity and error propagation. We analyze the new RR coding schemes and discuss their impact on the probability of occurrence of different charge levels. We also demonstrate the performance improvement achieved via RR coding on a practical triple-level cell Flash device.}

However, conventional decoders suffer from a large resource consumption due to gathering messages from all the neighbour variable-nodes and/or check-nodes through cumulative calculations. In this paper, a check-belief propagation (CBP) decoding algorithm is proposed. Check-belief is used as the probability that the corresponding parity-check is satisfied. All check-beliefs are iteratively enlarged in a sequential recursive order, and successful decoding will be achieved after the check-beliefs are all big enough. Compared to previous algorithms employing a large number of cumulative calculations to gather all the neighbour messages, CBP decoding can renew each check-belief by propagating it from one check-node to another through only one variable-node, resulting in a low complexity decoding with no cumulative calculations. The simulation results and analyses show that the CBP algorithm provides little error-rate performance loss in contrast with the previous BP algorithms, but consumes much fewer calculations and memories than them. It earns a big benefit in terms of complexity.}

	abstract = {Piggybacking design has been applied extensively in distributed storage systems in recent years, since it can reduce repair bandwidth significantly with small sub-packetization. In this work, a bidirectional piggybacking design (BPD) is proposed with sub-packetization\n2≤l≤r\n, where\nr=n−k\nequals the redundancy of an\n[n,k]\nlinear code. Unlike most existing piggybacking designs, there is no distinction between systematic nodes and parity nodes in BPD and the piggybacks are added bidirectionally. Consequently, BPD leads to lower average repair bandwidth than previous piggybacking designs at the equal sub-packetization level. However, BPD needs larger fields to maintain the MDS property. We prove two upper bounds on the field size for explicit BPD and existential constructions, respectively. By computer search, specific BPD can be given over a field much smaller than the proved upper bounds. As examples, BPD codes with sub-packetization\nl=4\nbased on the\n[12,8]\nand\n[14,10]\nReed-Solomon codes are given over\nF\n2\n8\n, which obtain about 16% savings in the average repair bandwidth over previous designs with\nl≤4\n.}

	abstract = {As the 6G network is evolving towards a space-air-ground integrated scale with ubiquitous long-distance non-terrestrial network (NTN) links, packet-level streaming forward erasure correction (FEC), which can achieve low end-to-end in-order delivery delay over lossy links with long propagation delay, has drawn increasing interest. However, the existing streaming FEC has a problem that full-length encoding windows (EWs) including all non-acknowledged source packets are used when generating repair packets, which incurs high computational cost when the link’s bandwidth-delay product is large. To address the problem, this paper proposes a new low-complexity streaming FEC design, where a mixture of short and full-length EWs are used. We propose a novel method to analyze the decoding window width observed by arriving repair packets, which is based on the analysis of the busy period of a virtual queue using renewal theory. Later, using the analysis as the key enabler, a design problem is formulated and solved to optimize parameters including the EW width and the fraction of short-length repair packets such that the computational cost is reduced. Evaluations using real-life code implementations show that the proposed design can significantly reduce the computational cost, while maintaining the key benefits of the original streaming FEC.}

	abstract = {Low-rate and short-packet transmissions are important for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). In this paper, we put forth a new family of sparse superposition codes for URLLC, called block orthogonal sparse superposition (BOSS) codes. We first present a code construction method for the efficient encoding of BOSS codes. The key idea is to construct codewords by the superposition of the orthogonal columns of a dictionary matrix with a sequential bit mapping strategy. We also propose an approximate maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder with two stages. The approximate MAP decoder reduces the decoding latency significantly via a parallel decoding structure while maintaining a comparable decoding complexity to the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder of polar codes. Furthermore, to gauge the code performance in the finite-blocklength regime, we derive an exact analytical expression for block-error rates (BLERs) of single-layered BOSS codes in terms of relevant code parameters. Lastly, we present a cyclic redundancy check aided-BOSS (CA-BOSS) code with simple list decoding to boost the code performance. Our experiments verify that CA-BOSS codes with the simple list decoder outperform CA-polar codes with SCL decoding in the low-rate and finite-blocklength regimes while achieving the finite-blocklength capacity upper bound within one dB of signal-to-noise ratio.}

	abstract = {A different approach for constructing protograph-based spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes is proposed. Instead of lifting multiple copies of an identical SC-LDPC protograph at the lifting stage of code construction, we divide the copies into fractions \\alpha \\in [{0,1}]\nSC-LDPC protographs and \\beta =1-\\alpha\nuncoupled sequence of block LDPC protographs. The permutations in the edge bundles formed by two different protograph structures follow the multi-edge-type framework. The rate loss associated with SC-LDPC codes is reduced, and we obtain code ensembles with flexible rates, by varying \\beta\n. We call these codes partial spatially coupled (PSC) LDPC codes, and through density evolution, we show that for data transmission over the binary erasure channel, the gap between channel capacity and thresholds of these codes is smaller as compared to SC-LDPC codes. The main bottleneck in the practical implementation of SC-LDPC codes is the rate loss. Conventionally, the rate loss can be reduced by taking large coupling length L\n, which however increases the decoding complexity. The proposed PSC-LDPC codes mitigate this tradeoff. Furthermore, these codes can also be decoded by the windowed decoder (WD), and through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the WD performance of PSC-LDPC codes is better than that of SC-LDPC codes.}

In particular, differently from previous studies, our analysis accounts for the fact that the number of terminals contending the channel may vary over time, as a function of the duration of the previous contention period. The stability of the protocol is analyzed via a drift analysis, which allows us to determine the presence of stable and unstable equilibrium points. We also provide an exact characterization of the AoI performance, through which we determine the impact of some key protocol parameters, such as the maximum length of the contention period, on the average AoI. Specifically, we show that configurations of parameters that maximize the throughput may result in a degradation of the AoI performance.}

In this paper, Beneš network is a general term used to refer to an N\\times {N}~n -nary Beneš network. Such networks, denoted by B( n , t) , where N = n^{t} and t \\ge2 , are based on regular n\\times n switches, and are RNB as well. A Beneš network is constructed recursively from a 3-stage Clos network. For an N\\times N RNB Clos network C( n , m , r) , where N = nr and m \\ge n , the maximum allowable number of non-contact faults in each single shell for realizing any permutation has been investigated in an earlier study, where shell k in a network consists of both the k th and the k th-to-last node stages. That study showed that, for a given integer N , an RNB C( n , n , r) network with larger n\\times n switches leads to tolerance of more non-contact faults in shell 1. In this paper, for an N\\times N B( n , t) network, we study the maximum allowable number, say f_{k} , of non-contact faults for any permutation not only in each single shell k , but also in all shells simultaneously under the fault condition that at most f_{k} non-contact faults are arbitrarily located in the switches in each shell k . We call the former the fault tolerance capability in a single shell, and the latter the fault tolerance capability of the network. We show that a larger switch size, i.e., n\\times n , in an {N} \\times N B( n , t) network leads to a higher fault tolerance capability of the network and a higher fault tolerance capability in each non-middle shell. An N\\times N Beneš network B( n , t) considers only the value of N which is a power of n . To consider a flexible N with N = n^{s}\\cdot \\textit {q} , where s\\ge2 , 1 < {q} < n and {q}\\vert n , which means that n is divisible by {q} , we propose in this paper an N\\times N RNB Beneš-type network using regular n\\times n switches, which is called an extended Beneš and denoted by B( n , s , {q}) . Both Beneš and extended Beneš networks are based on regular switches, and they have better scalabilities than a Clos network. We define a network’s fault tolerance rate as the ratio of the fault tolerance capability to the total crosspoints in the network. For given integers N and n , we derive that the fault tolerance capability and fault tolerance rate of an {N} \\times N Beneš (or extended Beneš) network are higher than or equal to those of an N\\times N RNB C( n , n , r) network, and the former outperforms the latter in most cases.}

	abstract = {It is supposed that ultra-reliable low latency communication (uRLLC) would continue to evolve in the future sixth generation (6G) network, to provide enhanced capability towards extreme connectivity, with the aid of well established multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. Since the latency constraint can be represented equivalently by the blocklength of a codeword, channel coding theory at a finite blocklength plays an important role in theoretic analysis of uRLLC. Based on Polyanskiy’s and Yang’s asymptotic results on maximal achievable rate, we first derive the proximate closed-form expressions for the expectation and variance of channel dispersion. Then, the upper bound of average maximal achievable rate is obtained for massive MIMO systems under ideal independent and identically distributed fading channels. Since almost all the fundamental parameters, including the spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF), are considered, this expression can be viewed as a performance bound of the spatiotemporal two-dimension channel coding to some extent. Moreover, it is shown by simulation and analysis, as the DoF goes to infinity, MIMO systems reveal a nature of deterministic transmission, since the average maximal achievable coding rate per antenna can be achieved at each transmission. In this case, the inversely proportional law observed therein implies that the blocklength in the time domain can be further shortened at the expense of spatial DoF. This exchangeability of space and time, to support a given coding rate, paves a solid and feasible road for us to further reduce latency in 6G uRLLC.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is useful to effectively improve the coverage and data rate of end-to-end communications. In contrast to the well-studied coverage-extension use case, in this paper, multiple RIS panels are introduced, aiming to enhance the data rate of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels in presence of insufficient scattering. Specifically, via the operator-valued free probability theory, the asymptotic mutual information of the large-dimensional RIS-assisted MIMO channel is obtained under the Rician fading with Weichselberger’s correlation structure, in presence of both the direct and the reflected links. Although the mutual information of Rician MIMO channels scales linearly as the number of antennas and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels, numerical results show that it requires sufficiently large SNR, proportional to the Rician factor, in order to obtain the theoretically guaranteed linear improvement. This paper shows that the proposed multi-RIS deployment is especially effective to improve the mutual information of MIMO channels under the large Rician factor conditions. When the reflected links have similar arriving and departing angles across the RIS panels, a small number of RIS panels are sufficient to harness the spatial degree of freedom of the multi-RIS assisted MIMO channels.}

The second scenario is request-random D2D coded caching. Adapting the 2RR1S scheme to this scenario, we show the superiority of our adapted scheme for medium to large cache size.

	abstract = {In many sensor network applications, a fusion center often has additional valuable information, such as context data, which cannot be obtained directly from the sensors. Motivated by this, we study a generalized CEO problem where a CEO has access to context information. The main contribution of this work is twofold. Firstly, we characterize the asymptotically optimal error exponent per rate as the number of sensors and sum rate grow without bound. The proof extends the Berger-Tung coding scheme and the converse argument by Berger et al. (1996) taking into account context information. The resulting expression includes the minimum Chernoff divergence over context information. Secondly, assuming that the sizes of the source and context alphabets are respectively\n|X|\nand\n|S|\n, we prove that it is asymptotically optimal to partition all sensors into at most\n(\n|X|\n2\n)|S|\ngroups and have the sensors in each group adopt the same encoding scheme. Our problem subsumes the original CEO problem by Berger et al. (1996) as a special case if there is only one letter for context information; in this case, our result tightens its required number of groups from\n(\n|X|\n2\n)+2\nto\n(\n|X|\n2\n)\n. We also numerically demonstrate the effect of context information for a simple Gaussian scenario.}

	abstract = {Multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) assisted by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been recently investigated to provide a high spectral and energy efficiency transmission. This paper proposes a practical channel estimation approach for the first time to an IRS-assisted multi-user ISAC system. The estimation problem in such a system is challenging since the sensing and communication (SAC) signals interfere with each other, and the passive IRS lacks signal processing ability. A two-stage approach is proposed to transfer the overall estimation problem into sub-ones, successively including the direct and reflected channels estimation. Based on this scheme, the ISAC base station (BS) estimates all the SAC channels associated with the target and uplink users, while each downlink user estimates the downlink communication channels individually. Considering a low-cost demand of the ISAC BS and downlink users, the proposed two-stage approach is realized by an efficient neural network (NN) framework that contains two different extreme learning machine (ELM) structures to estimate the above SAC channels. Moreover, two types of input-output pairs to train the ELMs are carefully devised, which impact the estimation accuracy and computational complexity under different system parameters. Simulation results reveal a substantial performance improvement achieved by the proposed ELM-based approach over the least-squares and NN-based benchmarks, with reduced training complexity and faster training speed.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a new artificial intelligence technology with which an edge server can orchestrate with multiple end users to train a global model collaboratively. Under this setting, users only upload the locally trained parameters instead of their local data, substantially reducing communication costs and boosting data privacy. Nonetheless, federated learning mainly relies on users’ local training, overlooking the abundant computing resources owned by the edge server. To exploit the edge server’s processing power, we propose a hybrid learning paradigm that consists of centralized and federated learning components. This scheme uploads a portion of users’ data for centralized learning when the local model is trained under federated learning. We derive a theoretical upper bound for the model accuracy, which can be used to assess the performance of the proposed new learning paradigm. To balance the computation and communication resources for a good model accuracy performance, we establish a joint optimization problem of model accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. We also devise the corresponding joint optimization algorithm to solve the problem. Experiment results show that compared with centralized and federated learning, the proposed hybrid learning algorithm can effectively improve the model accuracy and significantly reduce computation and communication resources.}

However, conventional optimization methods usually solved the joint AP clustering and beamforming design by separately handling them, at the cost of high computing resources, especially when quality of service (QoS) constraint is also considered. To this end, this paper proposes a low-complexity unsupervised deep learning method to jointly optimize AP clustering and beamforming design, called as joint clustering and beamforming network (JcbNet). The JcbNet also designs a neural network to handle the QoS constraint to reduce the hyperparameters of loss function, and it introduces a learnable safety distance parameter in the loss function to reduce the violation rate of QoS constraint. In addition, the JcbNet is scalable since the dimensions of parameters and output beamforming vary with the dimension of input channel state information (CSI). The experimental results show that the JcbNet is low-complexity, and achieves a higher sum rate under a smaller number of AP clustering compared to traditional and deep learning algorithms such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), sparse WMMSE (S-WMMSE) and convolutional neural network (CNN).}

	abstract = {For frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, downlink channel state information (CSI) feedback is essential. Deep learning-based auto-encoder (AE) structures have shown promise in reducing feedback overhead. However, designing a super-large AE network to handle the CSI of all scenarios is not practical. A more practical approach is to divide the CSI dataset by region/scenario and use multiple simple AE networks. However, this method requires high memory capacity, making it unsuitable for low-end user equipment (UE). In this paper, we propose a new UE-friendly framework based on multi-tasking mode. Our framework, called single-encoder-to-multiple-decoders (S-to-M), uses multi-task-learning to design multiple independent AEs into a joint architecture with a shared encoder that corresponds to multiple task-specific decoders. We also integrate GateNet as a classifier to enable the base station to autonomously select the right task-specific decoder for the subregion. Our experiments on a simulated multi-scenario CSI dataset show that our proposed S-to-M framework outperforms other benchmark modes by significantly reducing model complexity and UE memory consumption.}

	abstract = {Symbol-level precoding (SLP) can fully exploit the multi-user interference in the downlink. This paper investigates fast SLP algorithms for phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In particular, we prove that the weighted max-min signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing (SB) SLP problem with PSK signaling is not separable, which is contrary to the power minimization (PM) SLP problem, and accordingly, existing decomposition methods are not applicable. To tackle this issue, we establish an explicit duality between the SB-SLP and PM-SLP problems with PSK modulation. The proposed duality enables simultaneously obtaining the solutions to the SB-SLP and PM-SLP problems. We concurrently propose a closed-form power scaling algorithm to address the SB-SLP problem by the solution to the PM-SLP problem, via which the separability can be leveraged to decompose the problem. In terms of QAM signaling, a succinct model is used to formulate the PM-SLP problem and convert it into a separable equivalent. The new problem is decomposed into several simple parallel subproblems with closed-form solutions, employing the proximal Jacobian alternating direction method of multipliers (PJ-ADMM). We further prove that the proposed duality can be generalized to the multi-level modulation case, based on which a power scaling parallel inverse-free algorithm is proposed to solve the SB-SLP problem with QAM signaling. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms offer optimal performance with lower complexity than the state-of-the-art.}

We show that the proposed feedback technique leads to a substantial reduction in the packet error rates and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to support various numbers of active users.

	abstract = {Satellite Internet of Things (S-IoT) with low Earth orbit satellites has become an effective solution for providing global coverage for massive machine type communications (mMTC). Considering that the massive user equipments covered by the S-IoT are periodically activated and dominated by short packet communications, the pilot collision has become a challenging problem due to the limited length and number of pilot sequences. In this paper, we propose a low-correlation superimposed pilot grant-free massive access (LSP-GFMA) scheme, where a low-correlation-zone periodic sequence (LPS) is designed for the superimposed pilot (SP) structure. Our LPS can maintain low cross-correlation with random non-orthogonal shifts compared with the conventional Zadoff-Chu sequence (ZCS), which can alleviate pilot collision while ensuring high spectral efficiency. In addition, we propose an iterative channel estimation based on Kaczmarz algorithm to attain accurate channel state information for the SP structure with low complexity. Then, we derive the theoretical expressions of access failure probability (AFP) and achievable throughput for our LSP-GFMA scheme under the shadowed-Rician fading channel. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical derivations, and demonstrate that our LSP-GFMA scheme with LPS can achieve lower AFP and higher achievable throughput than that with ZCS, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Age of information (AoI) is an effective performance metric measuring the freshness of information and is particularly suitable for applications involving status update. In this paper, using the age violation probability as the metric, scheduling for heterogeneous multi-source systems is studied. Two queueing disciplines, namely the infinite packet queueing discipline and the single packet queueing discipline, are considered for scheduling packets within each source. A generalized round-robin (GRR) scheduling policy is then proposed to schedule the sources. Bounds on the exponential decay rate of the age violation probability for the proposed GRR scheduling policy under each queueing discipline are rigorously analyzed. Simulation results are provided, which show that the proposed GRR scheduling policy can efficiently serve many sources with heterogeneous arrivals and that our bounds can capture the true decay rate quite accurately. When specialized to the homogeneous source setting, the analysis concretizes the common belief that the single packet queueing discipline has a better AoI performance than the infinite packet queueing discipline. Moreover, simulations on this special case reveals that under the proposed scheduling policy, the two disciplines would have similar asymptotic performance when the inter-arrival time is much larger than the total transmission time.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the joint resource allocation and group formation for platoon in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks under vehicular channel uncertainty. To achieve the high spectrum efficiency and overcome the platoon head communication range limitation, an adaptive multicast-based group cooperation communication model is developed for the platoon with dynamic topology. Considering the heterogeneous characteristics of different types of links, i.e., high capacity for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and ultra-reliability for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we attempt to maximize the V2I capacity whilst satisfying a probability constraint for ultra-reliable V2V-supported intra-platoon communication. To handle the intractable probability constraint, a support vector clustering (SVC) based method is developed to capture the distributional geometry of massive uncertain channel samples as a sphere in high-dimensional feature space with asymmetric structure. Based on it, the probability constraint is transformed into a tractable linear convex set. After that, an exploration-selection-alternating-iterative algorithm is developed to solve the formulated problem with coupled optimization variables. Specifically, in the exploration process, a two-stage algorithm is proposed for the resource allocation problem under fixed group formation decision, which includes power control and spectrum allocation. During the selection process, a performance difference-based decision transition rate is designed to optimize group formation solution. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed data-driven approach can overcome the over-conservatism of the traditional symmetric-geometry-based uncertainty sets, and the multicast-based group cooperation communication model corresponds to a higher performance on V2I capacity than other traditional schemes.}

We first present spectrum sensitivity (SS) of the crosstalk-sensitive core matrix to evaluate inter-core crosstalk (XT) in trench-assisted (TA) MCF. We then propose the XT-sensitive spectrum assignment to suppress XT. We consider both static and dynamic network planning based on the spectrum sensitivity. In the static scenario, an integer linear programming (ILP) model along with effective heuristic CSA algorithms are developed to suppress XT and improve the spectrum efficiency. In the dynamic scenario, two heuristic CSA algorithms are proposed aiming to initiate a graceful tradeoff between average crosstalk and spectrum efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CSA algorithms compared with the existing CSA algorithm in MCF-based SDM-EONs.}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is an emerging wireless technology to support high transmission rate for indoor devices by using existing lighting infrastructure, and VLC-based indoor localization is capable of providing high-accuracy localization. However, current VLC-based localization systems suffer from several key challenges such as sensitivity to random tilting of the receiver, which limits its full potential in real-world applications. In this paper, we design an integrated visible light communication and localization (VLCL) system to simultaneously support accurate real-time localization and communication services for indoor devices. To achieve this, an advanced differential phase difference of arrival (A-DPDOA) localization design is developed to simplify hardware and improve tracking robustness. In addition, a joint adaptive modulation, subcarrier and power allocation scheme is also proposed, which aims to improve the communication data rate and localization accuracy. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate that the proposed integrated VLCL system achieves higher localization accuracy and transmission data rate, compared to existing systems and schemes. Experiments also illustrate that the localization algorithm is more robust against the random tilting of the receiver under device movement in two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios.}

In this work, a new optical transceiver architecture is proposed to solve this coverage problem via a novel Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based Polarized Pulse Position Modulation (in short, P-OFDM-PPM) with time-frequency spreading. The optical polarization diversity and multiplexing are utilized at the optical transmitter to improve the system’s robustness and the transmission data rate. This new scheme is able to boost the range coverage by several folds as verified via simulations using realistic models of optical channel propagation.

	abstract = {In time entanglement-based quantum key distribution (TE-QKD), Alice and Bob extract the raw key bits from the arrival times of entangled photon pairs. Each entangled pair can contribute to multiple key bits depending on how precisely Alice and Bob can measure the photon arrival times. Thus, TE-QKD can potentially increase the secret key rate compared to typical QKD implementations, which extract up to a bit per photon. Because of entanglement, the times of photon arrivals at Alice’s and Bob’s detectors and, thus, their raw keys should be identical. However, practical photon detectors suffer from time jitter errors. These errors cause discrepancies between Alice’s and Bob’s raw keys. Therefore, Alice must send information to Bob through the public channel to reconcile their raw keys. The amount of data sent for reconciliation represents a loss, rendering secret keys shorter than the raw keys. We compute the secret key rates possible in systems with detector jitter errors and show that they are much higher than those achievable in polarization entanglement-based QKD. We then construct codes for information reconciliation to approach these rates. We demonstrate that short and moderate-length standard error-correcting codes represent excellent information reconciliation choices, making TE-QKD a promising technology.}

We first establish the receiver model for ternary phase shift keying optical quantum communication system using Kennedy receiver with ODTD in a realistic situation. Then we analytically study the error probability for ODTD and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize this error probability of detection, which is a challenging mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem due to the discreteness of the detection threshold. We then propose an efficient algorithm to tackle this MIP problem and design the displacement and the threshold on both detection branches. We also discuss the receiving scheme using ODTD in the case of unequal prior probabilities and optimize the signal power distribution between the two branches. Numerical results show that for the discrimination of ternary coherent signals using Kennedy-type receiver, ODTD can mitigate the influence of thermal noise and dark count noise and is robust to imperfect quantum efficiency. Besides, we find that the error probability performance can be improved by optimizing the decoding order of the ternary signals and the reflectance of the beam splitter.}

	abstract = {Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are often considered to have the optimal error correction capability against malicious adversaries because they achieve the Singleton bound in terms of the rate-distance tradeoff. However, by allowing a vanishing probability of decoding error and considering an adversary with limited knowledge, it is interesting to understand whether a rate higher than the Singleton bound is achievable, and if so, what the optimal rate is. To answer these questions, we instantiate the aforementioned problem as a communication problem where the transmission medium is a wiretap multipath network that consists of multiple parallel links. A malicious adversary is able to eavesdrop on a subset of links, and also jam on a potentially overlapping subset of links. The primary objective is to ensure the communication is robust to adversarial jamming; additionally, another goal is to guarantee that the communication is information-theoretically secure with respect to the adversary. We present a complete characterization of both capacity and secrecy capacity as functions of the number of links that can be eavesdropped and/or jammed. Our achievability schemes are computationally efficient, and rely on a non-trivial combination of MDS codes and a pairwise hashing scheme.}

	abstract = {In this paper, rapidly converging low-complexity iterative transmit precoding (TPC) techniques are proposed for the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. First of all, the proposed random block-based iterative TPC (RBI-TPC) algorithm performs its iterations by updating multiple rather than a single component at each instant, where the updating order of each block containing multiple components relies on the samples randomly sampled from a discrete distribution. Based on the analytically derived convergence rate, we demonstrate that improved convergence is achieved by the block-based update mechanism conceived since the correlation between multiple components can be beneficially exploited. Then, the random sampling that determines the updating order is studied. By applying conditional random sampling, the updating order is optimized based on the latest updates for attaining more rapid convergence. We also demonstrate that the associated updating order may become deterministic under specific conditions so that a fixed but optimized updating order can be used for facilitating the practical implementations, which paves the way for conceiving the ordered block-based iterative TPC (OBI-TPC) algorithm. Finally, the concept of successive over-relaxation (SOR) is adopted for further convergence improvement and simulations are presented to illustrate the performance improvements of the proposed RBI and OBI TPC algorithms compared to the existing low-complexity iterative TPC schemes.}

	abstract = {Compared to the linear MIMO detectors, the Belief Propagation (BP) detector has shown greater capabilities in achieving near-optimal performance and better nature to iteratively cooperate with channel decoders. Aiming at real applications, recent works mainly fall into the category of reducing the complexity by simplified calculations, at the expense of performance sacrifice. However, the complexity is still unsatisfactory with exponentially increasing complexity or required exponentiation operations. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art (SOA) BP detectors persistently encounter error floor in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, which becomes even worse with calculation approximation. This work aims at a revised BP detector, named Belief-selective Propagation (BsP) detector by selectively utilizing the trusted incoming messages with sufficiently large a priori probabilities for updates. Two proposed strategies: symbol-based truncation (ST) and edge-based simplification (ES) squeeze the complexity (orders lower than the BP detector), while greatly relieving the error floor issue over a wide range of antenna and modulation combinations. For the 256-QAM 128 \\times 64\nuplink massive multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) system, the \\mathcal {B}(1,1)\nBsP detector achieves more than 1dB performance gain (@ \\text {BER}=10^{-4}\n) with lower complexity than the state-of-the-art (SOA) BP detector. Trade-off between performance and complexity towards different application requirements can be conveniently obtained by tuning the parameters of the ST and ES strategies.}

	abstract = {Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising approach to enhance the coverage quality, spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency. In this paper, an RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO downlink system suffering from the transceiver hardware impairments (T-HWIs) is investigated. To improve the accuracy of the direct estimation (DE) scheme, a modified ON/OFF estimation (MOE) with moderate pilot overhead is proposed. Relying on the knowledge of imperfect channel state information, we derive closed-form expressions of the lower-bound achievable SE with T-HWIs under both DE and MOE schemes. The closed-form results facilitate the investigation of how RIS improves the downlink SE under various system settings and allow us to explore the trade-off strategies between using more hardware-impaired APs and low-cost RISs in terms of the downlink SE and power consumption. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed MOE scheme outperforms the DE scheme in terms of the downlink SE. Moreover, the benefits of introducing RIS into hardware-impaired cell-free massive MIMO systems are also illustrated.}

In addition, we classify these statistical properties according to their definitions and then reveal the complex relationships between them and channel model parameters.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a specular technology that can assist the terrestrial base stations. However, the battery limitation of UAV inhibits the system performance by decreasing the overall lifespan of coverage provided by the UAV, driving the necessity of replacement and recharging. Thus, the energy-depleted UAV must be returned to a charging station and be replaced by a fully charged UAV to increase the service span. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework of UAV replacement to maintain coverage continuity in a UAV-assisted wireless communication system when a serving UAV runs out of energy. Our objective during this replacement process is to maximize the minimum achievable throughput to the UAV-served ground users by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) multi-UAV trajectory and resources allocated to the users from the individual UAVs. The formulated problem is non-convex for which an efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation and alternating optimization is proposed. Numerical results provide insights into the UAV trajectories and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the existing benchmark schemes.}

In UC CF mMIMO each user equipment (UE) is jointly served by a small subset of a large set of cooperating access points (APs). The APs are connected through the fronthaul to a central unit (CU) for joint processing. The key to efficiency is the UE-APs association procedure together with the APs/CU cooperative signal decoding. The first is essential for reducing fronthaul signaling and the latter for removing interference. In this work, we design an algorithm to jointly perform UE-APs association and decoding. The aim is to maximize the mean squared error (MSE) between transmitted and CU decoded data, considering the fronthaul data rate limitations. In our approach, the two aspects are jointly considered, allowing improved performance while keeping the amount of fronthaul signaling low. Furthermore, the proposed method has low-complexity, requiring only the knowledge of a signal quality indicator of each UE at the CU to perform joint decoding and UE-APs association. The numerical results have shown that there is a tradeoff between performance and fronthaul requirements, where the proposed method with fewer APs may achieve the same bit error rate (BER) performance in comparison to conventional CF systems where each AP serves all UEs.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communication is widely deemed the next frontier of wireless networks owing to the abundant spectrum resources in the THz band. Whilst THz signals suffer from severe propagation losses, a massive antenna array can be deployed at the base station (BS) to mitigate those losses through beamforming. Nevertheless, a very large number of antennas increases the BS’s hardware complexity and power consumption, and hence it can lead to poor energy efficiency (EE). To surmount this fundamental problem, we propose a novel array design based on superdirectivity and nonuniform inter-element spacing. Specifically, we exploit the mutual coupling between closely spaced elements to form superdirective pairs. A unique property of them is that all require the same excitation amplitude, and thus can be driven by a single radio frequency chain akin to conventional phased arrays. Moreover, they facilitate multi-port impedance matching, which ensures maximum power transfer for any beamforming angle. After addressing the implementation issues of superdirectivity, we show that the number of BS antennas can be effectively reduced without sacrificing the achievable rate. Simulation results demonstrate that our design offers huge EE gains compared to uncoupled arrays with uniform spacing, and hence could be a radical solution for future THz systems.}

	abstract = {Driven by the development of time-sensitive applications, short packet transmission (SPT) design has become the key point in the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) area. The primary challenge in it is that the delay caused by pilot overhead cannot be neglected. To deal with this issue, this paper presents a frame structure adopting partial-superimposed-pilot (PSP) scheme for SPT. The key of PSP scheme is that the number of data symbols is equal to the available blocklength, and the number of pilot symbols transmitted with data in the training stage needs to be optimized. Under the finite blocklength regime, we first derive a closed-form lower bound achievable rate of an uplink massive MIMO system with imperfect pilot removal for maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) receiver. Then, we formulate a weighted sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the pilot length, pilot power, and data power. We derive a closed-form solution of optimal pilot length. Using the log-function and successive convex approximation (SCA) method, we develop an iterative optimization framework to find a locally optimal power solution. For comparison, the conventional frame structures based on complete-superimposed-pilot (CSP) and regular pilot (RP) schemes are also shown. Simulation results indicate that the proposed PSP scheme is superior to the existing CSP and RP schemes.}

	abstract = {This article investigates the feasibility of combinerless multilevel outphasing transmitter as a potential architecture for large millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased arrays. We consider two distinct ways of distributing the component signals to the antennas and develop a model for the received signal at each radiated spatial direction from a phased array. Based on the received signal model, we derive expressions for the signal-to-distortion ratio as well as total power experienced at each spatial direction. Furthermore, antenna branch mismatches, overload distortion and quantization are considered, and an analytical model for the signal-to-distortion ratio at the intended receiver is derived. We additionally establish a model for comparing the achievable energy efficiency to those of the relevant reference methods. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the analytical works, and to assess the commonly used metrics of error vector magnitude (EVM) and total radiated power adjacent channel leakage ratio (TRP-ACLR). It is shown that the combinerless architecture is a valid option for mmWave phased arrays, demonstrating favorable EVM results and TRP-ACLR beyond the 28 dBc limit imposed by the 3GPP, even in the presence of the considered distortions. The conducted energy efficiency assessment shows that efficiency of the reference methods can be exceeded with sufficient amount of outphasing levels. The considered architecture is thus an interesting alternative for addressing the linearity vs. energy-efficiency challenge in mmWave phased-array systems.}

We derive a novel lower bound on complement of interference violation probability (IVP). This result helps determine the power margin required at secondary access points (APs) to meet the IVP constraint. We deduce new analytical expressions for spectral efficiency (SE) and bit error rate (BER) of UAVs and GUEs. This analysis entails finding expectation of secondary AP transmit power based on order statistics of the strongest interference channel between secondary APs and GUEs. We prove that for lower pilot power, a larger power margin is required to keep IVP fixed. We show that for a given IVP, the larger the interference threshold is, the greater (lower) the likelihood for the UAVs (GUEs) to obtain higher SE is. For a given interference threshold, probability that UAVs attain higher SE increases as IVP increases for a fixed number of secondary APs ( N\n) or as N\nincreases for a given IVP. Impact of interference threshold and height of UAVs on BER is elucidated.}

Based on the maximum likelihood detector, the expression for the conditional pairwise error probability (CPEP) of the RIS-SSM scheme is derived for both cases of correct demodulation of the received beam or not. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form expressions of the unconditional pairwise error probability (UPEP) by employing two different methods: the probability density function and the moment-generating function expressions with a descending order of scatterer gains. To provide more useful insights, we derive the asymptotic UPEP and the diversity gain of the RIS-SSM scheme in the high SNR region. Depending on UPEP and the corresponding Euclidean distance, we further give the union upper bound of the average bit error probability (ABEP). To acquire the effective capacity of the proposed system, a new framework for ergodic capacity analysis is also provided. Finally, all derivation results are validated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations and reveal that the proposed RIS-SSM scheme outperforms the benchmarks in terms of reliability.}

As a beneficial feature of our STSK-OTFS-MA system, extra information bits are mapped onto the indices of the active dispersion matrices, which allows the system to enjoy the joint benefits of both STSK and OTFS signalling. Due to the fact that both the time-, space- and DD-domain degrees of freedom are jointly exploited, our STSK-OTFS-MA achieves increased diversity and coding gains. To mitigate the potentially excessive detection complexity, the sparse structure of the equivalent transmitted symbol vector is exploited, resulting in a pair of low-complexity near-maximum likelihood (ML) multiuser detection algorithms. Explicitly, we conceive a progressive residual check-based greedy detector (PRCGD) and an iterative reduced-space check-based detector (IRCD). Then, we derive both the unconditional single-user pairwise error probability (SU-UPEP) and a tight bit error ratio (BER) union-bound for our single-user STSK-OTFS-MA system employing the ML detector. Furthermore, the discrete-input continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity of the proposed system is derived. The optimal dispersion matrices (DMs) are designed based on the maximum attainable diversity and coding gain metrics. Finally, it is demonstrated that our STSK-OTFS-MA system achieves both a lower BER and a higher DCMC capacity than its conventional spatial modulation (SM) and its orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. As a benefit, the proposed system strikes a compelling BER vs. system complexity as well as BER vs. detection complexity trade-offs.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been regarded as a promising technique due to its high array gain, low cost, and low power. However, the traditional passive RIS suffers from the “double fading” effect, which has become a major bottleneck in restricting the performance of passive RIS-aided communications. Fortunately, active RIS can alleviate this problem by adjusting the phase shift and amplifying the received signal simultaneously. Nevertheless, a high beamforming gain often requires a large number of reflecting elements, which leads to non-negligible power consumption, especially for the active RIS. Thus, one challenge is how to improve the scalability of the RIS and the energy efficiency. Different from the existing works where all reflecting elements are activated, we propose a novel element on-off mechanism where reflecting elements can be flexibly activated and deactivated. To achieve a tradeoff between the transmission rate and energy consumption, two different optimization problems for passive RIS and active RIS are formulated by maximizing the total energy efficiency, where the constraints of the maximum power of users and the RIS, the minimum transmission rate, the element on-off factor, and the unit moduli of passive elements are taken into account. In light of the intractability of the formulated problems, we develop two different alternating optimization-based iterative algorithms by combining quadratic transform, variable substitution, and the successive convex approximation method to obtain sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, in order to gain more insight into problems, we consider special cases involving transmission rate maximization problems for given the same total power budget, and respectively analyze the number configuration for passive RIS and active RIS. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms, and reflecting elements under the proposed algorithms can be flexibly activated and deactivated.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communications have been widely considered as one of the promising technologies for future 6G wireless systems. In order to cope with the high path loss in THz systems, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) composed of low-complexity reflecting elements can be deployed to generate directional beams. In order to acquire the direction of user equipment (UE) to send directional beams, the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) is very important. Beam training is widely utilized to acquire the CSI. However, existing beam training schemes have not taken the wideband beam split effect into consideration, so the beam training accuracy decreases a lot in wideband scenarios. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an analytical beam training framework in RIS-assisted wideband THz communication systems. Specifically, we first propose a power distribution pattern (PDP) based direction estimation scheme, where the exact value of the received power is utilized to analytically calculate the UE direction. Then, we design the analytical codebook for the proposed framework based on the inherent parameters of the wideband THz system. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can achieve the near-optimal achievable rate performance with a lower beam training overhead than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced channel estimation and device activity detection technique for the next generation massive internet of things (IoT) networks. Thanks to its low cost, RIS can be introduced into massive IoT networks to extend the area coverage and support more online devices. However, introducing RIS also brings new challenges in channel estimation and device detection for massive connectivity systems owning to the resulting cascaded channel and its inherent passive characteristics. To address this issue, we first formulate the RIS-aided channel estimation and device activity detection as a joint sparse signal recovery problem by simultaneously exploring the sparsity of sporadic transmission and RIS-aided channel links. After that, an RIS-aided generalized Turbo multiple measurement vector algorithm to estimate the channels between the devices and the base station, and detect the active devices jointly under different channel distributions, i.e., the Bernoulli Gaussian scale mixture distribution and the Bernoulli Gaussian approximation distribution. Furthermore, we analyze the state evolution equations of the proposed channel estimation technique and the theoretical detection results from the perspective of missing detection and false alarm probabilities are also provided. Numerical results confirm the correctness of the theoretical analysis, and show that RIS is beneficial for improving the mean square error performance of the channel estimators, as well as the active device detection performance of detectors in massive connectivity systems.}
