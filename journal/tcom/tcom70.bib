	abstract = {The design and implementation of error correcting codes has long been informed by two fundamental results: Shannon’s 1948 capacity theorem, which established that long codes use noisy channels most efficiently; and Berlekamp, McEliece, and Van Tilborg’s 1978 theorem on the NP-completeness of decoding linear codes. These results shifted focus away from creating code-independent decoders, but recent low-latency communication applications necessitate relatively short codes, providing motivation to reconsider the development of universal decoders. We introduce a scheme for employing binarized symbol soft information within Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding, a universal hard detection decoder. We incorporate codebook-independent quantization of soft information to indicate demodulated symbols to be reliable or unreliable. We introduce two decoding algorithms: one identifies a conditional Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding; the other either reports a conditional ML decoding or an error. For random codebooks, we present error exponents and asymptotic complexity, and show benefits over hard detection. As empirical illustrations, we compare performance with majority logic decoding of Reed-Muller codes, with Berlekamp-Massey decoding of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes, with CA-SCL decoding of CA-Polar codes, and establish the performance of Random Linear Codes, which require a universal decoder and offer a broader palette of code sizes and rates than traditional codes.}

	abstract = {The base station-mobile device communication traffic has dramatically increased recently due to mobile data, which in turn heavily overloaded the underlying infrastructure. To decrease Base Station (BS) interaction, intra-cell communication between local devices, known as Device-to-Device, is utilized for distributed data caching. Nevertheless, due to the continuous departure of existing nodes and the arrival of newcomers, the missing cached data may lead to permanent data loss. In this study, we propose and analyze a class of Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes for distributed data caching in cellular networks. Contrary to traditional distributed storage, a novel repair algorithm for LDPC codes is proposed which is designed to exploit the minimal direct BS communication. To assess the versatility of LDPC codes and establish performance comparisons to classic coding techniques, novel theoretical and experimental evaluations are derived. Essentially, the theoretical/numerical results for repair bandwidth cost in presence of BS are presented in a distributed caching setting. Accordingly, when the gap between the cost of downloading a symbol from BS and from other local network nodes is not dramatically high, we demonstrate that LDPC codes can be considered as a viable fault-tolerance alternative in cellular systems with caching capabilities for both low and high code rates.}

	abstract = {High-rate product codes (PCs) and staircase codes (SCs) are ubiquitous codes in high-speed optical communication achieving near-capacity performance on the binary symmetric channel. Their success is mostly due to very efficient iterative decoding algorithms that require very little complexity. In this paper, we extend the density evolution (DE) analysis for PCs and SCs to a channel with ternary output and ternary message passing, where the third symbol marks an erasure. We investigate the performance of a standard error-and-erasure decoder and of its simplification using DE. The proposed analysis can be used to find component code configurations and quantizer levels for the channel output. We also show how the use of even-weight BCH subcodes as component codes can improve the decoding performance at high rates. The DE results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations, which show that additional coding gains of up to 0.6dB are possible by ternary decoding, at only a small additional increase in complexity compared to traditional binary message passing.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a simplified successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm for polar codes on insertion/deletion error channels is proposed. First, the SC decoding is designed to decode polar codes on insertion/deletion channels and the joint weight distribution is derived to measure the occurrence probability of different scenarios. Some scenarios with small occurrence probability can be pruned to obtain lower decoding complexity with negligible performance loss. Inspired by this, a fixed pruning strategy (FPS) is proposed to reduce the decoding complexity, which can prune as many scenarios as possible with the given performance requirement. By exploiting the periodicity of the joint weight distribution, the upper bound of the block error rate of the pruned SC decoding is derived. Furthermore, according to the convergence of the upper bound, a dynamic self-adjusting pruning strategy is designed to further reduce the decoding complexity and improve the flexibility of the pruning algorithm. Simulation results show that the decoding complexity of the proposed pruning-based decoding algorithms is significantly reduced compared to the state-of-the-art scenario simplified SC decoding algorithm.}

	abstract = {The T -Private Information Retrieval ( T -PIR) problem is that a user wishes to retrieve a single record from N servers, without revealing the identity of the desired record even if the number of colluding servers up to T . Here every server stores all M records and each record can be viewed as a vector over the q -ary finite field \\mathbb {F}_{q} . To reduce the field size, a capacity-achieving T -PIR scheme based on some MDS array codes for all possible N>T,M\\geq 2 was constructed by Xu and Zhang in 2019. A key idea in that scheme is to construct some MDS array codes in query phase, whose generator matrices satisfy the recovery property (see (C1) in Example 1 , page 6), i.e., there exist some specific columns in each generator matrix such that the number of them is equal to the rank of such matrix. We call the set of each column index of those columns in each generator matrix as the column index set. However, that scheme didn’t give an explicit selection of the column index set satisfying the recovery property. In this paper, let N=d(2t-1) , N>T=dt>1, M\\geq 3 and d\\geq 1 , under the constraint of 2^{t-1}\\geq N , we present a novel method to construct capacity-achieving T -PIR schemes over the binary field with an explicit selection of the column index set. Moreover, our scheme has sub-packetization N(2t-1)^{M-2} , which is optimal for all linear capacity-achieving T -PIR schemes determined by Zhang and Xu in 2019. The key to our method is that all locators and column multipliers are precisely selected such that a Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) code defined by them has a zero-dimensional subfield sub-code. Compared with all the known capacity-achieving T -PIR schemes for the same non-trivial parameters, ours is the first explicit capacity-achieving T -PIR scheme over the binary field.}

	abstract = {Digital receivers based on 1-bit quantization and oversampling w.r.t. the transmit signal bandwidth promise lower energy consumption. However, since 1-bit quantization is a highly non-linear operation, standard off the shelf receiver algorithms cannot be applied. In this paper we consider an unknown phase rotation and timing offset and a fully digital receiver. To reduce the non-linear behavior introduced by 1-bit quantization, we assume that the receiver applies uniform phase and sample dithering, which can be implemented by sampling at an irrational normalized intermediate frequency and with an irrational oversampling factor, respectively. Based on the least squares objective function we derive a typical digital matched filter receiver with a data- and timing-aided phase estimator and square time recovery based timing estimation. Our main contribution is to show that both estimators are consistent under very general assumptions, e.g., arbitrary colored noise and stationary ergodic transmit symbols. Performance evaluations are done via simulations and are compared against a numerically computable upper bound of the Cramér–Rao lower bound. For low signal-to-noise ratio the estimators perform well but for high signal-to-noise ratio they run into an error floor. The performance loss of the phase estimator due to decision-directed operation or estimated timing information is marginal.}

Each update from the source has to be scheduled on one of\nK\navailable communication channels. The probability of success of each attempted communication is a function of the channel used. This function is unknown to the scheduler. The metric of interest is the Age-of-Information (AoI), formally defined as the time elapsed since the destination received the recent most update from the source. We model our scheduling problem as a variant of the multi-arm bandit problem with communication channels as arms. We characterize a lower bound on the AoI regret achievable by any policy and characterize the performance of UCB, Thompson Sampling, and their variants. Our analytical results show that UCB and Thompson sampling are order-optimal for AoI bandits. In addition, we propose novel policies which, unlike UCB and Thompson Sampling, use the current AoI to make scheduling decisions. Via simulations, we show the proposed AoI-aware policies outperform existing AoI-agnostic policies.}

A practical system model that takes into account the presence of phase error due to quantization at the IRS when a) source-destination (SD) link is present and b) SD link is absent is considered. First, an exact expression is derived, and then we derive three simple approximations for the OP using the following approaches: (i) uni-variate dimension reduction, (ii) moment matching and, (iii) Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence minimization. The resulting expressions for OP are simple to evaluate and quite tight even in the tail region. The validity of these approximations is demonstrated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We also study the impact of the number of bits available for quantization, the position of IRS with respect to the source and destination and the number of IRS elements on the OP for systems with and without an SD link. We also demonstrate how the method of moment matching and KL divergence minimization can be used to analyze systems experiencing spatial correlation between the IRS elements.}

We depict practical schemes for using the proposed concepts with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We analyze the performance in terms of the minimum Euclidean distance and bit error rate. We also show that the proposed techniques exhibit desirable properties such as efficient low-complexity detection, very simple bits-to-symbols, and symbols-to-bits mappings, and a better error performance when compared to the OFDM-IM and related schemes. More importantly, contrary to the vast majority of IM studies that focus on showing the superiority of the IM techniques against conventional modulation techniques, we show that modulation concepts based on a well-known MDS code can achieve better error performance than the IM and related schemes while exhibiting a structure as simple as these schemes.}

For the MF-based TX, the molecule release probability and the fraction of molecules released from the TX membrane are derived. Incorporating molecular degradation and a fully-absorbing receiver (RX), the channel impulse response (CIR) is derived for two scenarios: 1) Both TX and RX are static, and 2) both TX and RX are diffusion-based mobile. Moreover, a sequence of bits transmitted from the TX to the RX is considered. The average bit error rate (BER) is obtained for both scenarios, wherein the probability mass function (PMF) of the number of molecules absorbed in the mobile scenario is derived. Furthermore, a simulation framework is proposed for the MF-based TX, based on which the derived analytical expressions are validated. Simulation results show that a low MF probability or low vesicle mobility slows the release of molecules and reduces the molecule hitting probability at the RX. Simulation results also indicate the difference between the MF-based TX and an ideal point TX in terms of the inter-symbol interference (ISI).}

In URLLC with random channel gains and a hard delay constraint, the scheduling of backlogged queues and finite blocklength coding in the physical layer will make it very challenging to specify its performance limits. In this paper, we focus our attention on the asymptotic cross-layer analysis of URLLC when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high. More specifically, we find that a fundamental tradeoff exists among the service capability, latency, and error probability in the high SNR regime, which is characterized by a gain conservation equation. The main result of this work reveals that the sum of our defined service rate gain, real-time gain, and reliability gain is equal to one under the optimal policy. Numerical simulations are also exploited to validate that the derived gain conservation equation holds even with bounded random arrival.}

	abstract = {The recently introduced polar codes constitute a breakthrough in coding theory due to their capacity-achieving property. This goes hand in hand with a quasilinear construction, encoding, and successive cancellation list decoding procedures based on the Plotkin construction. The decoding algorithm can be applied with slight modifications to Reed-Muller or eBCH codes, that both achieve the capacity of erasure channels, although the list size needed for good performance grows too fast to make the decoding practical even for moderate block lengths. The key ingredient for proving the capacity-achieving property of Reed-Muller and eBCH codes is their group of symmetries. It can be plugged into the concept of Plotkin decomposition to design various permutation decoding algorithms. Although such techniques allow to outperform the straightforward polar-like decoding, the complexity stays impractical. In this paper, we show that although invariance under a large automorphism group is valuable in a theoretical sense, it also ensures that the list size needed for good performance grows exponentially. We further establish the bounds that arise if we sacrifice some of the symmetries. Although the theoretical analysis of the list decoding algorithm remains an open problem, our result provides an insight into the factors that impact the decoding complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the outage probability minimizing problem in a two-hop cooperative relay network. To reduce outage probability, existing studies propose many schemes for relay selection and power allocation, which are usually based on the assumption of exact channel state information (CSI). However, it is difficult to obtain perfect instantaneous CSI in practical situations where channel states change rapidly, and thus traditional methods would not perform well. Considering these factors, we turn to the emerging reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solutions. RL methods do not need any prior knowledge of CSI, but use neural network for approximation and decision after interacting with communication environment. Nevertheless, conventional RL methods, including most deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, cannot perform well when the search space is too large. In addition, non-stationarity is a common problem when using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which is caused by the changing behavior in different hierarchies. Therefore, we first propose a DRL framework with an outage-based reward function, which is then used as a baseline. Then, we further design an HRL framework and training algorithm. By decomposing relay selection and power allocation into two hierarchical optimization objectives, and combining on- policy and off-policy methods in the HRL framework, our method successfully address the sparse reward and non-stationary problem. Simulation results reveal that compared with traditional DRL method, the proposed HRL training algorithm can converge faster and reduce the outage probability by 8% in two-hop relay network with the same outage threshold.}

	abstract = {This paper formulates the polar-code construction problem for the successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoder as a maze-traversing game, which can be solved by reinforcement-learning techniques. The proposed method provides a novel technique for polar-code construction that no longer depends on sorting and selecting bit-channels by reliability, as in most current algorithms. Instead, this technique decides whether the input bits should be frozen in a purely sequential manner. The equivalence of optimizing the polar-code construction for the SCL decoder under this technique and maximizing the expected reward of traversing a maze is drawn. Simulation results show that the standard polar-code constructions that are designed for the successive-cancellation decoder are no longer optimal for the SCL decoder with respect to the frame error rate (FER). In contrast, the proposed game-based construction method finds code constructions that have similar or lower FER for various code lengths and various list sizes of the SCL decoder, compared to the state-of-the-art construction methods. The advantage of the game-based constructions over the standard constructions increases with the channel signal-to-noise ratio and the list size of SCL decoding. Moreover, the learning is highly efficient in terms of the number of required training samples and computational operations.}

	abstract = {In frequency-division duplexing systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme leads to high training and feedback overhead. In this work, we propose an uplink-aided downlink channel acquisition framework using deep learning to reduce such overhead. We consider the entire downlink CSI acquisition process, including the downlink pilot design, channel estimation, and feedback. First, we propose an adaptive pilot design module by exploiting the correlation in magnitude among bidirectional channels in the angular domain to improve channel estimation. Second, to avoid the bit allocation problem during the feedback module, we concatenate the complex channel and embed the uplink channel magnitude to the channel reconstruction at the base station. Finally, we combine the two modules and compare two popular uplink-aided downlink channel acquisition frameworks. One framework estimates and subsequently feeds back the channel at the user equipment. In the other framework, the user equipment directly feeds back the received pilot signals to the base station. Results reveal that with the help of the uplink channel, directly feeding back pilot signals can save approximately 20% of feedback bits. This work thus provides a guideline for future research.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we aim to propose a novel transmission control protocol (TCP) congestion control method from a cross-layer-based perspective and present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven method called DRL-3R (DRL for congestion control with Radio access network information and Reward Redistribution) so as to learn the TCP congestion control policy in a superior manner. In particular, we incorporate the RAN information to timely grasp the dynamics of RAN, and empower DRL to learn from the delayed RAN information feedback potentially induced by several consecutive actions. Meanwhile, we relax the implicit assumption (that the feedback to one specific action returns at a round-trip-time (RTT) after the action is applied) in previous researches, by redistributing the rewards and evaluating the merits of actions more accurately. Experiment results show that besides maintaining a reasonable fairness, DRL-3R significantly outperforms classical congestion control methods (e.g., TCP Reno, Westwood, Cubic, BBR and DRL-CC) on network utility by achieving a higher throughput while reducing delay in various network environments.}

	abstract = {In recent years, wireless federated learning (FL) has been proposed to support the mobile intelligent applications over the wireless network, which protects the data privacy and security by exchanging the parameter between mobile devices and the base station (BS). However, the learning latency increases with the neural network scale due to the limited local computing power and communication bandwidth. To tackle this issue, we introduce model pruning for wireless FL to reduce the neural network scale. Device selection is also considered to further improve the learning performance. By removing the stragglers with low computing power or bad channel condition, the model aggregation loss caused by model pruning can be alleviated and the communication overhead can be effectively reduced. We analyze the convergence rate and learning latency of the proposed model pruning method and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the convergence rate under the given learning latency budget via jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, device selection, and wireless resource allocation. By solving the problem, the closed-form solutions of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation are derived and the threshold-based device selection strategy is developed. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed model pruning algorithm outperforms other existing schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and bit error rate (BER) analysis of a phase-independent non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. The proposed NOMA system can utilize amplitude-coherent detection (ACD) which requires only the channel amplitude for equalization purposes. In what follows, three different designs for realizing the detection of the proposed NOMA are investigated. One is based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle, while the other two are based on successive interference cancellation (SIC). Closed-form expressions for the BER of all detectors are derived and compared with the BER of the coherent ML detector. The obtained results, which are corroborated by simulations, demonstrate that, in most scenarios, the BER is dominated by multiuser interference rather than the absence of the channel phase information. Consequently, the BER using ML and ACD are comparable for various cases of interest. The paper also shows that the SIC detector is just an alternative approach to realize the ML detector, and hence, both detectors provide the same BER performance.}

Taking a fundamental dimensional analysis perspective, the main question is to identify which antenna configurations allow synergistic DoF gains. The main results of this work are two-fold. The first result identifies antenna configurations where both reconfigurable antennas and partial channel knowledge are individually beneficial, as those where M_{1}< N_{1}< \\min (M_{2},N_{2})\n. The second result shows that synergistic gains exist in each of these settings, over the best known solutions that rely on either reconfigurable antennas or partial channel knowledge alone. Coding schemes that jointly exploit partial channel knowledge and reconfigurable antennas emerge as a byproduct of the analysis.}

We first propose a new algorithm to adaptively select an appropriate set of multi-antenna access points (APs) to serve each user at any time instant. A multi-level hidden Markov model (HMM) is constructed to predict the trajectory of a user and forecast the changing set of serving APs for the user over time. Given the selected, time-changing sets of serving APs, we also formulate a new multi-objective power control problem to minimize a weighted sum of the energy and delay costs of the users. By employing Bernoulli bandit learning (BBL) and Gaussian bandit learning (GBL), two new energy-delay-aware power control strategies are developed to adapt unpredictable channel dynamics, minimize the energy-delay costs online, and remain effective over a long time even when sharp changes occur in the channels. Numerical results demonstrate that the new predictive selection of serving APs and the new learning-based energy-delay-aware power control policies can significantly improve the reliability of uplink transmissions in dynamic CF massive MIMO networks, as compared to state-of-the-art static oracle solutions.}

The signal transmission of both stages experience frequency selectivity. The relay is powered both by an energy source through the wireless power transfer as well as by the energy recycled from its own self-interference during the second stage. Accordingly, we jointly design the power allocations both at the multiple source nodes and at a common relay node for maximizing the network’s sum-throughput, which poses a large-scale nonconvex problem, regardless whether proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) or improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) is used for signal transmission to the relay. We develop new alternating descent procedures for solving our joint optimization problems, which are based on closed-forms and thus are of very low computational complexity even for large numbers of subcarriers. The results show the superiority of IGS over PGS in terms of both its sum-rate and individual user-rate. Another benefit of IGS over PGS is that the former promises fairer rate distribution across the subcarriers. Moreover, the recycled self-interference also provides a beneficial complementary energy source.}

Under these restrictions, we formulated and analyzed the achievable rate and maximum departure regions in two well-studied scenarios, i.e., a classical PS-SWIPT MAC and a PS-SWIPT MAC with user cooperation. In the classical PS-SWIPT MAC setting, closed-form expressions for the optimal values of the PS factors are derived for two fundamental decoding schemes: simultaneous decoding and successive interference cancellation. In the PS-SWIPT MAC with user cooperation, the joint optimal power allocation for users as well as the optimal PS factor are derived. This reveals that one decoding scheme outperforms the other in the classical PS-SWIPT MAC, depending on the function type of the decoding cost. Finally, it is shown that the cooperation between users can potentially boost the performance of a PS-SWIPT MAC under decoding cost and non-linear EH constraints. Moreover, effects of the decoding cost functions, non-linear EH model and channel quality between the users are studied, and performance characteristics of the system are discussed.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive MIMO is one of the key technologies for future wireless communications, in which users are simultaneously and jointly served by all access points (APs). In this paper, we investigate the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. To facilitate the theoretical analysis, only single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in this paper, i.e., the MMSE estimation is performed based on the received pilot signals at each AP separately. Inspired by the decoupling principle of replica symmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the corresponding decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) non-zero components, which plays a key role in the theoretical analysis of SMV based MMSE estimation of the effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. Subsequently, based on the obtained decoupling principle of MMSE estimation, likelihood ratio test and the optimal fusion rule, we perform user activity detection based on the received pilot signals at only one AP, or cooperation among the entire set of APs for centralized or distributed detection. Via theoretical analysis, we show that the error probabilities of both centralized and distributed detection tend to zero when the number of APs tends to infinity while the asymptotic ratio between the number of users and pilots is kept constant. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of oracle estimation in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity via random matrix theory. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the potential performance loss of SMV based MMSE estimation, which does not employ the correlation between the received pilot signals at different APs, the multiple measurement vector (MMV) based MMSE estimation, i.e., joint MMSE estimation with pilot signals from all APs, is analyzed via numerical results. Numerical analysis shows that the theoretical analyze with our decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with i.n.i.d. non-zero components matches well with the numerical results.}

Moreover, both channel estimation errors and pilot contamination effects caused by re-use of pilot sequences in neighboring cells are taken into consideration in this work. The analysis is carried out using statistical tools under the exact and asymptotic regimes in which the number of antennas at BS\nN\n, the number of users in each cell\nK\n, and the number of scatterers\nS\ngrow large at the same pace. Furthermore, the obtained exact expressions and deterministic approximations of the ergodic rates are expressed in simplified closed-forms under the special case of multi-keyhole channels to yield useful insights. They reveal that signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SINR) without user grouping in a multi-keyhole channel is similar to that under standard Rayleigh channel in the asymptotic regime. However, under user grouping, we show that the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) gains promised by deploying large-scale antenna arrays in multi-cell settings are limited by the number of scatterers even if the number of antennas grows large. Simulation results illustrate the close match provided by the asymptotic analysis for moderate system dimensions and confirm the insights drawn from the theoretical findings.}

	abstract = {The key challenges in live video multicasting include how to properly form multicast groups, select video versions and allocate wireless resources, in order to guarantee the quality of experience (QoE) while ensuring low latency delivery. To address these challenges, in this paper, a novel multicast framework that leverages the advantages of network-assisted dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP and cloud radio access networks is proposed, where a multicast assistant server is deployed at the edge of a mobile network. Under this architecture, a joint user grouping, version selection, and bandwidth allocation method is designed to optimize the sum of users’ utilities. In particular, a two-step scheme is proposed to solve this complex problem. The number of multicast groups is first automatically determined and a user clustering method is presented. Then, group-level version selection and spectrum assignment algorithms are performed at different time scales. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can improve at least 7% QoE compared to baseline methods.}

In this paper, we consider a content platform belonging to the telco operator, which can provide periodically-updated contents with small Age of Information (AoI), namely, fresh contents. The content update consumes radio resource resulting in a trade-off between the AoI and the latency. We adopt the contract theory to monetize contents considering the above two factors in a realistic asymmetric information scenario. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the feasibility of the contract. We further propose the optimal update schemes and the corresponding fees, which maximizes the utility of the operator. Simulation reveals that the proposed contract enables the users, who attach importance to the freshness, to obtain frequently updating contents.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a body-to-body network (BBN) framework, which enables wireless body area network (WBAN) users located in close proximity to cooperate and share their network resources to improve the overall network performance. Our main aim is to design a distributed resource allocation mechanism that encourages each participating WBAN user to participate and upload each other’s data collaboratively. We propose an auction-based mechanism that optimizes data uploading for all participating users and the corresponding reimbursement. In the proposed auction mechanism, each user acts as both auctioneer and bidder. Fist, the auctioneer initiates the auction by announcing the amount of resource it wants to share and its price and each bidder submits their bid to each auctioneer based on its demand. We further propose a distributed algorithm for the auction mechanism that jointly solves both the auctioneers’ and the bidders’ optimization problems and determines the optimal amount of resource users should reserve for their own and the portion they should share. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed distributed algorithm converges to the solution that maximizes the aggregated benefit of the users. Finally, the simulation results exhibit that the proposed algorithm always improves WBAN user’s individual performance together with overall BBN performance.}

	abstract = {Edge infrastructures, including edge computing servers, are increasingly powered by renewable energy and smart grid combined. Two-way energy trading allows the surplus or shortfall of renewable energy to be traded between a server and the smart grid, but is non-trivial due to randomly varying computation demands and renewables. This paper proposes a new online policy, namely, distributed online resource allocation and load management (DORL), which enables such an edge server and its serving devices to minimize their energy cost and energy consumption, respectively, in a fully distributed manner. The key idea is that we employ the stochastic dual-subgradient method to interpret the battery of the server as a virtual queue. Based on the virtual queue and task queues, the CPU frequencies of the devices and the edge server, the offloading transmit rates of the devices (to the server) and the energy trading decisions of the server (with the smart grid) are decoupled over time and among devices, and optimized on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, we prove that the DORL yields a feasible and asymptotically optimal solution with a cost-backlog tradeoff of\n[η,1/η]\n. Simulations show that the DORL reduces the system cost by nearly 50%, as compared to existing benchmarks.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the minimum-age scheduling problem in a wireless sensor network where an access point (AP) monitors the state of an object via a set of sensors. The freshness of the sensed state, measured by the age-of-information (AoI), varies at different sensors and is not directly observable to the AP. The AP has to decide which sensor to query/sample in order to get the most updated state information of the object (i.e., the state information with the minimum AoI). In this paper, we formulate the minimum-age scheduling problem as a multi-armed bandit problem with partially observable arms and explore the greedy policy to minimize the expected AoI sampled over an infinite horizon. To analyze the performance of the greedy policy, we 1) put forth a relaxed greedy policy that decouples the sampling processes of the arms, 2) formulate the sampling process of each arm as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and 3) derive the average sampled AoI under the relaxed greedy policy as a sum of the average AoI sampled from individual arms. Numerical and simulation results validate that the relaxed greedy policy is an excellent approximation to the greedy policy in terms of the expected AoI sampled over an infinite horizon.}

	abstract = {We consider a status update system where multiple sensors communicate timely information about various random processes to a sink. The sensors share orthogonal sub-channels to transmit such information in the form of status update packets. A central controller can control the sampling actions of the sensors to trade-off between the transmit power consumption and information freshness which is quantified by the Age of Information (AoI). We jointly optimize the sampling action of each sensor, the transmit power allocation, and the sub-channel assignment to minimize the average total transmit power of all sensors, subject to a maximum average AoI constraint for each sensor. To solve the problem, we develop a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and provide optimality analysis of the algorithm. According to the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method, to solve the main problem, we need to solve an optimization problem in each time slot which is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem. We propose a low-complexity sub-optimal solution for this per-slot optimization problem that provides near-optimal performance and we evaluate the computational complexity of the solution. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the proposed dynamic control algorithm and the performance of the sub-optimal solution for the per-slot optimization problem versus the different parameters of the system. The results show that the proposed dynamic control algorithm achieves more than\n60 %\nsaving in the average total transmit power compared to a baseline policy.}

	abstract = {Due to the flexibility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising way for gathering data generated by wireless sensor networks. However, the limited battery capacity of the UAV restricts its application on many occasions, e.g., the networks deployed in the wild. In this paper, we propose a cooperative trajectory planning scheme to deal with the energy issue of the UAV, where a truck carrying backup batteries moves along with the UAV acting as a “mobile recharging station”. Our optimization task is to minimize the total mission time for gathering data from all the sensor nodes, which can be achieved by solving two problems: First, we need to divide the entire mission area into multiple subregions so that the UAV can hover over each subregion to collect the data of the sensor nodes through just one taking-off and landing under the constraint of battery capacity; second, we should find out the optimal trajectory of the truck so that the UAV can get to the hovering positions of each subregion from the truck and fly back to it before the battery drains considering the road condition in real world. We introduce an efficient clustering algorithm to partition the area into subregions in a load-balanced way to minimize the number of movements of the UAV. The trajectory planning task is formulated as a coordinated traveling salesman problem, which is solved by a three-step trajectory planning algorithm heuristically, and we also give the analysis of the upper bound and lower bound to demonstrate the performance guarantee. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme provides an effective and cost-efficient way for the data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks in practical scenarios.}

Despite its central importance, an account that is both physically grounded and applicable to a broad class of problems and amenable to yielding closed-form expressions including timing jitter is lacking. We consider an optical-pulse train produced by an active- or hybrid-mode-locked laser with timing jitter originating in both the locking oscillator and the mode-locked laser. Our focus is on the power spectral density of a stationary random signal generated by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process sampled by the mode-locked laser. Based on an analytically tractable theoretical treatment, we find conditions under which the power spectral density of the sampled signal maintains reasonable fidelity with the original within the signal bandwidth and elucidate the rôles of the departure from periodicity in the sampling and the effect of the timing jitter on the sampled signal on the degradation of the PSD due to timing jitter. The effective number of bits (ENOB) associated with intrinsic properties of the underlying mode-locked laser are predicted to be large, i.e. , the ENOB in practical devices is likely to be dominated by extrinsic noise and quantization error.}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) builds upon the dual use of LED-based lighting infrastructure for data transmission. It is particularly attractive for user-dense environments and mainly positioned as a complementary wireless access technology to radio-frequency (RF) counterparts. The practical implementation of hybrid light/radio access networks requires the design of efficient vertical and horizontal handover mechanisms to exploit their complementary features. In this paper, we propose an event-triggered adaptive handover mechanism for centralized hybrid VLC/millimeter wave (MMW) systems. Unlike distributed architectures where all the functionalities are deployed in each access point (AP), the centralized systems allow better optimization of network parameters due to awareness of global network view. The proposed handover mechanism takes advantage of this architecture and uses offset-enhanced signal-to-interference plus noise ratio levels of APs as performance metrics. To ensure balanced distribution of user equipment (UE) numbers between two underlying technologies, it auto-tunes the offset variables using rule-set based algorithms based on the number of connected UEs and data rates as inputs. Our results demonstrate that the proposed handover mechanism significantly improves hybrid system performance via adaptive tuning of AP selection parameter while minimizing signaling overhead.}

	abstract = {To realize the Quantum Internet, quantum communications require pre-shared entanglement among quantum nodes. However, both the generation and the distribution of the maximally-entangled quantum states are inherently contaminated by quantum decoherence. Conventionally, the quantum decoherence is mitigated by performing the consecutive steps of quantum entanglement distillation followed by quantum teleportation. However, this conventional approach imposes a long delay. To circumvent this impediment, we propose a novel quantum communication scheme relying on realistic noisy pre-shared entanglement, which eliminates the sequential steps imposing delay in the standard approach. More precisely, our proposed scheme can be viewed as a direct quantum communication scheme capable of improving the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of the logical qubits despite relying on realistic noisy pre-shared entanglement. Our performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme offers competitive QBER, yield, and goodput compared to the existing state-of-the-art quantum communication schemes, despite requiring fewer quantum gates.}

	abstract = {Feature-based physical layer authentication (PLA) schemes, using position-specific channel characteristics as identifying features, can provide lightweight protection against impersonation attacks in overhead-limited applications like e.g., mission-critical and low-latency scenarios. However, with PLA-aware attack strategies, an attacker can maximize the probability of successfully impersonating the legitimate devices. In this paper, we provide worst-case detection performance bounds under such strategies for a distributed PLA scheme that is based on the channel-state information (CSI) observed at multiple distributed remote radio-heads. This distributed setup exploits the multiple-channel diversity for enhanced detection performance and mimics distributed antenna architectures considered for 4G and 5G radio access networks. We consider (i) a power manipulation attack, in which a single-antenna attacker adopts optimal transmit power and phase; and (ii) an optimal spatial position attack. Interestingly, our results show that the attacker can achieve close-to-optimal success probability with only statistical CSI, which significantly strengthens the relevance of our results for practical scenarios. Furthermore, our results show that, by distributing antennas to multiple radio-heads, the worst-case missed detection probability can be reduced by 4 orders of magnitude without increasing the total number of antennas, illustrating the superiority of distributed PLA over a co-located antenna setup.}

The multiple eavesdroppers may overhear the confidential task offloading, which leads to information leakage. In order to address this issue, we present the minimization problem of the secrecy outage probability (SOP), by jointly taking into account the constraints from the latency and energy consumption. With the aim to improve the system secrecy performance, we then introduce three user selection criteria to choose the best user among multiple ones. Specifically, criterion I maximizes the locally computational capacity, while criterion II and III maximize the secrecy capacity and data rate of main links, respectively. For these criteria, we further analyze the system secrecy performance by deriving analytical and asymptotic expressions for the SOP, from which we can conclude important insights for the system design. Finally, simulation and analytical results are provided to verify the proposed analysis. The results show that the three criteria can efficiently safeguard the MEC networks, compared to the traditional local computing and fully offloading, especially with a large value of user number.}

Polar subcodes (PSCs) are polar codes (PCs) with dynamically-frozen symbols and have a larger code minimum distance than PCs with only statically-frozen symbols. A randomized nested PSC construction, where the low-rate code is a PSC and the high-rate code is a PC, is proposed for successive cancellation list (SCL) and sequential decoders. This code construction aims to perform lossy compression with side information, i.e., Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding. Nested PSCs are used in the key agreement problem with physical identifiers and two terminals since WZ-coding constructions significantly improve on Slepian-Wolf coding constructions such as fuzzy extractors. Significant gains in terms of the secret-key vs. storage rate ratio as compared to nested PCs with the same list sizes are illustrated to show that nested PSCs significantly improve on all existing code constructions. The performance of the nested PSCs is shown to improve with larger list sizes, unlike the nested PCs considered. A design procedure to efficiently construct nested PSCs and possible improvements to the nested PSC designs are also provided.}

This work presents further investigations on this problem with regards to the fine estimation task, which is accomplished through a suitable interpolation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of the observation data. The focus is on fast real-time applications, where iterative estimation methods can hardly be applied due to their latency and complexity. After deriving the analytical expression of the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for general values of the system parameters, we present a new DFT interpolation scheme based on the weighted least-squares (WLS) rule, where the optimum weights are precomputed through a numerical search and stored in the receiver. In contrast to many existing alternatives, the proposed method can employ an arbitrary number of DFT samples so as to achieve a good trade-off between system performance and complexity. Simulation results and theoretical analysis indicate that, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, the estimation accuracy is close to the relevant CRB at any value of the frequency error. This provides some advantage with respect to non-iterative competing schemes, without incurring any penalty in processing requirement.}

A general framework for detector design involving model-driven and data-driven approaches is introduced. Specifically, the extreme eigenvalues based likelihood ratio test (LRT) is derived via the model-driven approach. Merging the model-driven and data-driven approaches, the Naive Bayesian detector is proposed based on the extreme eigenvalues, which converts the design of test statistic into a two-class decision boundary construction problem, and a solution is provided by the Naive Bayesian classifier. To render the detectors more practical, two near-optimal detectors called\nα\n-sum and\nα\n-product of maximum and minimum eigenvalues (\nα\n-SMME,\nα\n-PMME) are further designed, in which\nα\nis a weight coefficient. Furthermore, the theoretical performance analysis of the\nα\n-SMME and\nα\n-PMME algorithms is provided, and the optimal weight selection is further obtained by solving an optimization problem under the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed detectors achieve performance improvements over the state-of-the-art detectors using extreme eigenvalues, and almost coincide with the detection performance of the LRT detector.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a symbol encryption method based on the complex-valued symbol multiplication and design the encryption symbol placement for offset quadrature amplitude modulation based filter bank multicarrier (OQAM/FBMC) systems. Specifically, we firstly analyze the encryption and decryption effects of complex-valued symbol multiplication on the original OQAM symbols. Then, by utilizing the intrinsic interference characteristics of prototype filters, a symbol encryption method and the placement design are proposed to simultaneously achieve the encryption of all OQAM symbols and low complexity decryption. Finally, the symbol error rate (SER), average signal transmit power, computational overhead and power spectral density (PSD) are analyzed. Simulation results are consistent with the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional method based on imaginary-valued encryption symbol insertion in terms of the SERs of both legitimate and illegitimate receivers.}

	abstract = {Inspired by excellent precision of carrier phase positioning, this paper presents a new carrier phase positioning technique for 5G new radio cellular networks with a focus on clock synchronization and integer ambiguity resolution. A carrier-phase based clock offset estimation method is first proposed to achieve precise clock synchronization among base stations, and proved to achieve the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) asymptotically. A fusion method is developed to fuse the estimated positions of a mobile station (MS) based on time-difference-of-arrival, with the estimated position changes based on the temporal changes of carrier phase measurements. While circumventing the integer ambiguities of the carrier phase measurements, the fusion method provides quality interim estimates of the MS positions, at which the measurements can be linearized to resolve the integer ambiguities. As a result, precise MS positions can be obtained based on the disambiguated carrier phase measurements. Numerical simulations show that the proposed carrier phase positioning can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy in wireless cellular networks.}

	abstract = {In Internet of Things (IoT), the freshness of status updates is crucial for mission-critical applications. In this regard, it is suggested to quantify the freshness of updates by using Age of Information (AoI) from the receiver’s perspective. Specifically, the AoI measures the freshness over time. However, the freshness in the content is neglected. In this paper, we introduce an age-based utility, named as Age of Changed Information (AoCI), which captures both the passage of time and the change of information content. By modeling the underlying physical process as a discrete time Markov chain, we investigate the AoCI in a time-slotted status update system, where a sensor samples the physical process and transmits the update packets to the destination. With the aim of minimizing the weighted sum of the AoCI and the update cost, we formulate an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process. We show that the optimal updating policy has a special structure with respect to the AoCI and identify the condition under which the special structure exists. By exploiting the special structure, we provide a low complexity relative policy iteration algorithm that finds the optimal updating policy. We further investigate the optimal policy for two special cases. In the first case where the state of the physical process transits with equiprobability, we show that optimal policy is of threshold type and derive the closed-form of the optimal threshold. We then study a more generalized periodic Markov model of the physical process in the second case. Lastly, simulation results are laid out to exhibit the performance of the optimal updating policy and its superiority over the zero-wait baseline policy.}

Hence, the European telecommunications standard institute (ETSI) has defined four packet types, with varying priority levels, to be used as broadcast packets in such communication. This paper studies the medium access control (MAC) layer performance of IEEE 802.11p and cellular-V2X (C-V2X) Mode 4 using discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) based models, while considering parallel multi-priority data streams. The overall model consists of four queue models with their respective traffic generators, which are appropriately linked with the DTMCs modeling the MAC layer operations of IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4. Closed-form solutions for the steady-state probabilities of the models are obtained, which are then utilized to derive expressions for key performance indicators at the MAC layer. Numerical results are provided to draw insights on the MAC layer performance of the two technologies. IEEE 802.11p is comparatively superior in average delay, and at maintaining fairness among multi-priority data streams, whereas C-V2X Mode 4 exhibits better collision resolution, which leads to its higher throughput. The paper also includes design insights on possible performance enhancements for future releases.}

In this paper, we study a free-space RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system in far-field operation. To maximize the received power from the physical and electromagnetic nature point of view, a comprehensive optimization, including beamforming of the transmitter, phase shifts of the RIS, orientation and position of the RIS is formulated and addressed. After exploiting the property of line-of-sight (LoS) links, we derive closed-form solutions of beamforming and phase shifts. For the non-trivial RIS position optimization problem in arbitrary three-dimensional space, a dimensional-reducing theory is proved. The simulation results show that the proposed closed-form beamforming and phase shifts approach the upper bound of the received power. The robustness of our proposed solutions in terms of the perturbation is also verified. Moreover, the RIS significantly enhances the performance of the mmWave/THz communication system.}

We then propose a ray-level process to model the spatial-temporal evolution of individual multipath components (MPCs), including near-field effects and (dis)appearance, and cluster-level large-scale fading. The proposed evolution process can flexibly control rays’ lifespans and smoothness of (dis)appearance in both space and time domains. In addition, we propose an improved Rayleigh-distance criterion to determine the most adequate wavefront for each cluster and ray. Existing models can easily implement the proposed criterion and make a more efficient use of computation resources. Also, a Gamma-Poisson mixture distribution is introduced to model the distribution of the number of clusters when multiple locations of the mobile station are considered. Key statistical properties of the channel, including the autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectral density (PSD), spatial cross-correlation function (S-CCF), and frequency correlation function (FCF), are derived and the impact of the ray-level evolution process on them is analyzed. We demonstrate the correctness of the derived statistical properties through numerical and simulation results.}

	abstract = {A sparse channel state information (CSI) estimation model is proposed for reducing the pilot overhead of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Explicitly, the pilots are directly transmitted over the time-frequency (TF)-domain grid for estimating the delay-Doppler (DD)-domain CSI that leads to a reduction of the pilot overhead, training duration and pre-processing complexity. Furthermore, it completely avoids placing multiple DD-domain guard intervals corresponding to each transmit antenna within the same OTFS frame, while keeping the training duration flexible, hence increasing the bandwidth efficiency. A unique benefit of the proposed CSI estimation model is that it can efficiently handle fractional Dopplers also. The resultant DD-domain CSI becomes simultaneously row and group (RG)-sparse. To exploit this compelling property, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based RG-OMP technique is developed, conveniently complemented by an enhanced Bayesian learning (BL)-based RG-BL framework, both of which substantially outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, low-complexity linear detectors are designed for the ensuing data detection phase, which directly employ the estimated DD-domain sparse CSI, without assuming any further knowledge concerning the number of dominant multipath components. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate performance improvement of the proposed BL-based schemes over the OMP and the state-of-the-art schemes.}

By using this model, we maintain an equilibrium of the outage performance analysis between mathematical tractability and the fidelity of realistic THz channels. Specifically, by utilizing the compound channel model, outage performance analysis can get rid of sophisticated case-specific channel modeling relying on field measurement and the ray-tracing assessment. To facilitate the application of the proposed channel model, we also design a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based channel parameter estimation approach for the compound channel model. The analytical results of outage performance by using the compound channel model are given in closed form and verified by numerical results.}

In this work, we focus on the cross-layer co-design of wireless edge caching schemes with sophisticated physical layer techniques, which facilitate non-orthogonal multiple access and interference mitigation. A flexible caching-aided RS (CRS) technique is proposed that operates in various modes that specify the cache placement at the receivers. We consider two caching policies: the intelligent coded caching (CC), as well as the well-known most popular content (MPC) policy. Both caching policies are integrated within the design parameters of RS in order to serve multiple cache-enabled receivers. The proposed technique is investigated from a system level perspective by taking into account spatial randomness. We consider a single cell network consisting of center and edge receivers and provide a comprehensive analytical framework for the evaluation of the proposed technique in terms of achieved rates. Specifically, we derive the rate achieved at each receiver under minimum rate constraints while incorporating the cache placement characteristics. Numerical results are presented which highlight the flexibility of the proposed technique and show how caching can be exploited in order to further boost the performance of RS.}

	abstract = {Large-scale antenna arrays employed by the base station (BS) constitute an essential next-generation communications technique. However, due to the constraints of size, cost, and power consumption, it is usually considered unrealistic to use a large-scale antenna array at the user side. Inspired by the emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we firstly propose the concept of user-specific RIS (US-RIS) for facilitating the employment of a large-scale antenna array at the user side in a cost- and energy-efficient way. In contrast to the existing employments of RIS, which belong to the family of base-station-specific RISs (BSS-RISs), the US-RIS concept by definition facilitates the employment of RIS at the user side for the first time. This is achieved by conceiving a multi-layer structure to realize a compact form-factor. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that, in contrast to the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the signal reflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating multi-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new degree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially exploited for performance enhancement. In addition, based on the proposed multi-layer US-RIS, we formulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem of US-RIS-aided communications. Due to the non-convexity of the problem introduced by this multi-layer structure, we propose a multi-layer transmit beamformer design relying on an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal solution by alternately updating each variable. Finally, our simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed multi-layer US-RIS as a compact realization of a large-scale antenna array at the user side for uplink transmission.}

	abstract = {The problem of beam alignment and tracking in high mobility scenarios such as high-speed railway(HSR) becomes extremely challenging, since large overhead cost and significant time delay are introduced for fast time-varying channel estimation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a learning-aided beam prediction scheme for HSR networks, which predicts the beam directions and the channel amplitudes within a period of future time with fine time granularity, using a group of observations. Concretely, we transform the problem of high-dimensional beam prediction into a two-stage task, i.e., a low-dimensional parameter estimation and a cascaded hybrid beamforming operation. In the first stage, the location and speed of a certain terminal are estimated by maximum likelihood criterion, and a data-driven data fusion module is designed to improve the final estimation accuracy and robustness. Then, the probable future beam directions and channel amplitudes are predicted, based on the HSR scenario priors including deterministic trajectory, motion model, and channel model. Furthermore, we incorporate a learnable non-linear mapping module into the overall beam prediction to allow non-linear tracks. Both of the proposed learnable modules are model-based and have a good interpretability. Compared to the existing beam management scheme, the proposed beam prediction has (near) zero overhead cost and time delay. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Different from conventional wired line connections, industrial control through wireless transmission is widely regarded as a promising solution due to its reduced cost, increased long-term reliability, and enhanced reliability. However, mission-critical applications impose stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements that entail ultra-reliability low-latency communications (URLLC). The primary feature of URLLC is that the blocklength of channel codes is short, and the conventional Shannon’s Capacity is not applicable. In this paper, we consider the URLLC in a factory automation (FA) scenario. Due to densely deployed equipment in FA, wireless signal are easily blocked by the obstacles. To address this issue, we propose to deploy intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to create an alternative transmission link, which can enhance the transmission reliability. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis for IRS-aided URLLC-enabled communications in a FA scenario. Both the average data rate (ADR) and the average decoding error probability (ADEP) are derived under finite channel blocklength for seven cases: 1) Rayleigh fading channel; 2) With direct channel link; 3) Nakagami-m fading channel; 4) Imperfect phase alignment; 5) Multiple-IRS case; 6) Rician fading channel; 7) Correlated channels. Extensive numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of our derived results.}

	abstract = {For high-rate linear systematic maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, most early constructions could initially optimally repair all the systematic nodes but not all the parity nodes. Fortunately, this issue was first solved by Li et al. in (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 64(9), 6257-6267, 2018), where a transformation that can convert any nonbinary MDS array code into another one with desired properties was proposed. However, the transformation does not work for binary MDS array codes. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing another generic transformation that can convert any\n[n,k]\nbinary MDS array code into a new one, which endows any\nr=n−k≥2\nchosen nodes with optimal repair bandwidth and optimal rebuilding access properties, and at the same time, preserves the normalized repair bandwidth/rebuilding access for the remaining\nk\nnodes under some conditions. As two immediate applications, we show that 1) by applying the transformation multiple times, any binary MDS array code can be converted into one with optimal rebuilding access for all nodes, 2) any binary MDS array code with optimal repair bandwidth or optimal rebuilding access for the systematic nodes can be converted into one with the corresponding optimality property for all nodes.}

	abstract = {We present a novel iterative decoding algorithm for Reed-Muller (RM) codes, which takes advantage of a graph representation of the code. Vertices of the considered graph correspond to codewords, with two vertices being connected by an edge if and only if the Hamming distance between the corresponding codewords equals the minimum distance of the code. The algorithm uses a greedy local search to find a node optimizing a metric, e.g. the correlation between the received vector and the corresponding codeword. In addition, the cyclic redundancy check can be used to terminate the search as soon as a valid codeword is found, leading to an improvement in the average computational complexity of the algorithm. Simulation results for both binary symmetric channel and additive white Gaussian noise channel show that the presented decoder approaches the performance of maximum likelihood decoding for RM codes of length less than 1024 and for the second-order RM codes of length less than 4096. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the considered decoding approach outperforms state-of-the-art decoding algorithms of RM codes with similar computational complexity for a wide range of block lengths and rates.}

	abstract = {Recently, some high-rate maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes were designed to optimally repair a single failed node by connecting all the surviving nodes. However, in practical systems, sometimes not all the surviving nodes are available. To facilitate the practical storage system, a few constructions of (n,k)\nMDS array codes with the property that any single failed node can be optimally repaired by accessing any d\nsurviving nodes (i.e., minimum-storage regenerating (MSR) codes) have been proposed, where d\\in [k+1:n-1)\n. However, all high-rate MDS array codes with this property either have large sub-packetization levels or are not explicit for all the parameters. To address these issues, we propose a generic transformation that can convert any (n',k')\nMDS array/scalar code to another (n=n'-\\delta,k=k'-\\delta)\nMDS array code with the optimal repair property and optimal access property for an arbitrary set of two nodes, while the repair efficiency of the remaining n-2\nnodes can be kept, where 2\\le \\delta \\le n'-k'\n. By recursively applying the generic transformation to an MDS scalar code multiple times, we get a high-rate MDS array code with the optimal repair property and the optimal access property for all nodes, which outperforms previous known high-rate MDS array codes in terms of either the sub-packetization level or the flexibility of the parameters.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a model that mimics the programming operation of memory cells. This model was first introduced by Lastras-Montano et al. for continuous-alphabet channels, and later by Bunte and Lapidoth for discrete memoryless channels (DMC). Under this paradigm we assume that cells are programmed sequentially and individually. The programming process is modeled as transmission over a channel, such that it is possible to read the cell state in order to determine its programming success, and in case of programming failure, to reprogram the cell again. Reprogramming a cell can reduce the bit error rate, however this comes with the price of increasing the overall programming time and thereby affecting the writing speed of the memory. An iterative programming scheme is an algorithm which specifies the number of attempts to program each cell. Given the programming channel and constraints on the average and maximum number of attempts to program a cell, we study programming schemes which maximize the number of bits that can be reliably stored in the memory. We extend the results by Bunte and Lapidoth and study this problem when the programming channel is either discrete-input memoryless symmetric channel (including the BSC,BEC, BI-AWGN) or the\nZ\nchannel. For the BSC and the BEC our analysis is also extended for the case where the error probabilities on consecutive writes are not necessarily the same. Lastly, we also study a related model which is motivated by the synthesis process of DNA molecules.}

Without sacrificing bit error rate (BER), joint adaptive transmission can fully utilize the time-varying nature of wireless channels, by allowing both power and rate to adapt to channel fading. Two adaptive power allocation strategies, namely, Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 , each of which guarantees the minimum target rate for one user while supporting the highest possible rate for the other, are first proposed. Then, based on the two power schemes, the performance of joint adaptive transmission in terms of average spectral efficiency (SE) is studied for continuous-rate and discrete-rate modulation, while guaranteeing the minimum required rate and BER requirements. With the focus on practical discrete-rate M-QAM modulation, it is proved that for the strong user in Scheme 1 and the weak user in Scheme 2 , their average SEs converge to the minimum target rates. In order to further increase the total transmission rate, we then propose a dynamic rate and power adaptation (DRPA) algorithm, aiming to increase the rate of one user without sacrificing the rate of the other. It is shown that at high SNRs, the DRPA algorithm allows the strong user in Scheme 1 and the weak user in Scheme 2 to continue to increase their transmission rates until reaching the highest modulation order that the system can support. Hence, the total transmission rate can be greatly increased at high SNRs due to the adoption of DRPA, by allowing both users in each scheme to reach the highest transmission rate in the system.}

	abstract = {Cloud-based cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) technology, which exploits a large number of distributed antennas to cooperatively serve multiple users, constitutes an appealing technique for B5G/6G wireless communications. However, the distributed nature of cloud-based CFmMIMO imposes great challenges in analyzing the error probability bounds, and very few efforts have so far been paid to optimize the detector design. In this paper, we try to add a stroke to this blank by analyzing the symbol error rate (SER) and design near-optimal detection algorithms. Specifically, considering non-identical large-scale coefficients and channel estimation errors, we first leverage the pairwise error probability to derive an asymptotic SER bound for uplink cloud-based CFmMIMO systems, which is verified by simulation results. Furthermore, motivated by the concepts of successive interference cancellation (SIC) and error correction mechanism (ECM), we design two distinct types of near-optimal detectors for cloud-based CFmMIMO systems and analyze their complexity and convergence performance. Finally, extensive simulation results show that our proposed SIC and ECM based detectors outperform conventional matched filtering (MF) and minimum mean squred error (MMSE) counterparts. In particular, the MMSE-SIC and MMSE-ECM detectors approach the derived asymptotic bound, and the MF-ECM detector strikes a balance between the SER and complexity in ultra CFmMIMO scenarios.}

In this regard, a brief discussion of HPWSs is presented in order to point out the complementary characteristics of power line and wireless media. By considering orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing and maximal-ratio combining, optimization problems associated with the minimization of the average BEP in hybrid communication systems are formulated under two distinct transmission power constraints, called sum power and sum power-channel constraints. For both constraints, it is demonstrated that at most one medium should be used for data transmission over subchannels with the same index in order to minimize the average BEP in hybrid communication systems. Based on this finding, power allocation algorithms are derived for this purpose in HPWSs. Numerical analyses are then used to validate the proposed algorithms by comparing them with interior-point-based power allocation algorithms. In addition, performance comparisons show the advantage of the proposals over alternative algorithms from the literature, including previous algorithms proposed for maximizing the achievable data rate.}

However, its crossbar array structure causes severe “sneak-path” interference, which also leads to strong inter-cell correlation. Recent works have mainly focused on sub-optimal data detection schemes by ignoring inter-cell correlation and assuming sneak-path interference is independent between different array cells. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal data detection scheme that can approach the performance bound of the optimal detection scheme. Our detection scheme leverages a joint data and sneak-path interference recovery and can use all inter-cell correlations. The proposed scheme is suitable for data detection of large memory arrays with only linear operation complexity.}

The designed VCs have considerable shaping gains of up to 1.03 dB and finer choices of spectral efficiencies in practice compared with conventional VCs. A mutual information estimation method and a log-likelihood approximation method based on importance sampling for very large constellations are proposed and applied to the designed VCs.

	abstract = {Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has recently appeared as a powerful and robust multiple access and interference management strategy for downlink Multi-user (MU) multi-antenna communications. In this work, we study the precoder design problem for RSMA scheme in downlink MU systems with both perfect and imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) and assess the role and benefits of transmitting multiple common streams. Unlike existing works which have considered single-antenna receivers (Multiple-Input Single-Output–MISO), we propose and extend the RSMA framework for multi-antenna receivers (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output–MIMO) and formulate the precoder optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the Weighted Ergodic Sum-Rate (WESR). Precoder optimization is solved using Sample Average Approximation (SAA) together with the proposed vectorization and Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) based approach. Achievable sum-Degree of Freedom (DoF) of RSMA is derived for the proposed framework as an increasing function of the number of transmitted common and private streams, which is further validated by the Ergodic Sum Rate (ESR) performance using Monte Carlo simulations. Conventional MU–MIMO based on linear precoders and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) schemes are considered as baselines. Numerical results show that with imperfect CSIT, the sum-DoF and ESR performance of RSMA is superior to those of the two baselines, and is increasing with the number of transmitted common streams. Moreover, by better managing the interference, RSMA not only has significant ESR gains over baseline schemes but is more robust to CSIT inaccuracies, network loads and user deployments.}

	abstract = {Cooperative perception plays a vital role in extending a vehicle’s sensing range beyond its line-of-sight. However, exchanging raw sensory data under limited communication resources is infeasible. Towards enabling an efficient cooperative perception, vehicles need to address the following fundamental question: What sensory data needs to be shared? at which resolution? and with which vehicles? To answer this question, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed to allow reinforcement learning (RL)-based vehicular association, resource block (RB) allocation, and content selection of cooperative perception messages (CPMs) by utilizing a quadtree-based point cloud compression mechanism. Furthermore, a federated RL approach is introduced in order to speed up the training process across vehicles. Simulation results show the ability of the RL agents to efficiently learn the vehicles’ association, RB allocation, and message content selection while maximizing vehicles’ satisfaction in terms of the received sensory information. The results also show that federated RL improves the training process, where better policies can be achieved within the same amount of time compared to the non-federated approach.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz MIMO systems rely on pre-defined beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. These pre-defined codebooks, however, are commonly not optimized for specific environments, user distributions, and/or possible hardware impairments. This leads to large codebook sizes with high beam training overhead which makes it hard for these systems to support highly mobile applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns how to optimize the codebook beam patterns relying only on the receive power measurements. The developed model learns how to adapt the beam patterns based on the surrounding environment, user distribution, hardware impairments, and array geometry. Further, this approach does not require any knowledge about the channel, RF hardware, or user positions. To reduce the learning time, the proposed model designs a novel Wolpertinger -variant architecture that is capable of efficiently searching the large discrete action space. The proposed learning framework respects the RF hardware constraints such as the constant-modulus and quantized phase shifter constraints. Simulation results confirm the ability of the developed framework to learn near-optimal beam patterns for line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), mixed LOS/NLOS scenarios and for arrays with hardware impairments without requiring any channel knowledge.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the general problem of resource allocation for mitigating channel fading effects in Free Space Optical (FSO) communications. The resource allocation problem is modeled as the constrained stochastic optimization framework, which covers a variety of FSO scenarios involving power adaptation, relay selection and their joint allocation. Under this framework, we propose two algorithms that solve FSO resource allocation problems. We first present the Stochastic Dual Gradient (SDG) algorithm that is shown to solve the problem exactly by exploiting the strong duality but whose implementation necessarily requires explicit and accurate system models. As an alternative we present the Primal-Dual Deep Learning (PDDL) algorithm based on the SDG algorithm, which parameterizes the resource allocation policy with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and optimizes the latter via a primal-dual method. The parameterized resource allocation problem incurs only a small loss of optimality due to the strong representational power of DNNs, and can be moreover implemented without knowledge of system models. A wide set of numerical experiments are performed to corroborate the proposed algorithms in FSO resource allocation problems. We demonstrate their superior performance and computational efficiency compared to the baseline methods in both continuous power allocation and binary relay selection settings.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output can obtain more performance gain by exploiting the downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). Therefore, studying CSI feedback with limited communication resources in frequency-division duplexing systems is of great importance. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback has shown considerable potential. However, the existing DL-based explicit feedback schemes are difficult to deploy because current fifth-generation mobile communication protocols and systems are designed based on an implicit feedback mechanism. In this paper, we propose a DL-based implicit feedback architecture to inherit the low-overhead characteristic, which uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the precoding matrix indicator (PMI) encoding and decoding modules. By using environment information, the NNs can achieve a more refined mapping between the precoding matrix and the PMI compared with codebooks. The correlation between subbands is also used to further improve the feedback performance. Simulation results show that, for a single resource block (RB), the proposed architecture can save 25.0% – 40.0% of overhead compared with the Type I codebook under different antenna configurations. For a wideband system with 52 RBs, overhead can be saved by 30.7% and 48.0% compared with the Type II codebook when ignoring and considering extracting subband correlation, respectively.}

	abstract = {By activating blocked users and altering successive interference cancellation (SIC) sequences, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) become promising for enhancing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. To evaluate the benefits between RISs and NOMA, a downlink RIS-aided multi-cell-NOMA network is investigated via stochastic geometry. We first introduce the unique path loss model for RIS reflecting channels. Then, we evaluate the angle distributions based on a Poisson cluster process (PCP) model, which theoretically demonstrates that the angles of incidence and reflection are uniformly distributed. Additionally, we derive closed-form analytical and asymptotic expressions for coverage probabilities of the paired NOMA users. Lastly, we derive the analytical expressions of the ergodic rate for both of the paired NOMA users and calculate the asymptotic expressions for the typical user. The analytical results indicate that 1) the achievable rates reach an upper limit when the length of RIS increases; 2) exploiting RISs can enhance the path loss intercept to improve the performance without influencing the bandwidth. The simulation results show that 1) RIS-aided networks have superior performance than the networks without RISs; and 2) the SIC order in NOMA systems can be altered since RISs are able to change the channel quality of NOMA users.}

Comparing with previous studies, we consider more practical aspects of the system, including non-i.i.d. signature matrices, low-resolution quantization, and random users activated by an unknown sparse rate. A new estimation algorithm, termed hybrid decentralized generalized expectation consistent (HyDeGEC), is then derived based on a hybrid network that applies scalar message passing for the prior inference and vector message passing for the likelihood inference. This new algorithm outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques in terms of robustness (to non-i.i.d. signatures), complexity (in computation per iteration), and/or estimation accuracy (of the channel and the activity rate). The state evolution of the algorithm is also analyzed, which, as validated by simulations, can capture precisely the algorithm’s per-iteration behavior in MSE. Summing up, the algorithm we propose here is practically effective, computationally efficient, and theoretically analyzable.}

Specifically, we analyze two possible multiple-input multiple-output wireless fronthaul solutions: multicast and zero forcing (ZF) beamforming. We develop a statistical model for the fronthaul rate and, coupled with an analysis of the user access rate, we optimize the placement of the RRHs. This model allows us to formulate the location optimization problem with a statistical constraint on fronthaul outage. Our results are cautionary, showing that the fronthaul requires considerable bandwidth to enable joint service to users. This requirement can be relaxed by serving a low number of users on the same RB. Additionally, we show that, with a fixed number of antennas, for the multicast fronthaul, it is prudent to concentrate these antennas on a few RRHs. However, for the ZF beamforming fronthaul, it is better to distribute the antennas on more RRHs. For the parameters chosen, using a ZF beamforming fronthaul improves the typical access rate by approximately 8% compared to multicast. Crucially, our work quantifies the effect of these fronthaul solutions and provides an effective tool for the design of distributed networks.}

Lower bounds of achievable rates for both D2D users (DUEs) and CF-mMIMO users (CFUEs) are derived in closed-form, with perfect and imperfect channel state information. Next, in order to reduce pilot contamination, greedy and graph coloring-based pilot allocation algorithms are proposed and analyzed for the considered scenario. Furthermore, to control interference and improve the performance, two power control strategies are designed and their complexity and convergence are also discussed. The first power control strategy aims at maximizing CFUEs’ sum spectral efficiency (SE) subject to quality of service constraints on DUEs, while the second one maximizes the weighted product of CFUEs’ and DUEs’ signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (SINRs). Numerical results show that the proposed pilot and power allocations bring a considerable improvement to the network SE. Also, it is revealed that the activation of D2D links has a positive effect on the system throughput, i.e. the network offloading ensured by the D2D links overcomes the increased interference brought by D2D communications.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the downlink (DL) transmit design for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems, where only the slow-varying statistical channel state information is exploited at the transmitter. The channel model for the DL massive MIMO LEO satellite system is established, in which both the satellite and the user terminals (UTs) are equipped with uniform planar arrays. Observing the rank-one property of the channel matrices, we show that the single-stream precoding for each UT is the optimal choice that maximizes the ergodic sum rate. This favorable result simplifies the complicated design of transmit covariance matrices into that of precoding vectors without any loss of optimality. Then, an efficient algorithm is devised to compute the precoding vectors. Furthermore, we formulate an approximate transmit design based on the upper bound on the ergodic sum rate, for which the optimality of single-stream precoding still holds. We show that, in this case, the design of precoding vectors can be simplified into that of scalar variables, for which an effective algorithm is developed. In addition, a low-complexity learning framework is proposed for optimizing the scalar variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can achieve significant performance gains over the existing schemes.}

Each packet is also equipped with a preamble that is used for channel estimation and detection of permutation and scrambling sequences utilized for payload encoding. We propose an algorithm to resolve multiple-access preamble transmission, based on the approximate message-passing (AMP), that is capable to support high numbers of active users and achieve low probabilities of miss-detection. We also develop a parallel interference cancellation technique for payload reception that iteratively refines the channel estimates and attempts to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the users’ data via selective error-correction decoding. Finally, we derive a detailed system performance analysis that closely matches the obtained numerical results. We demonstrate that the presented system can more than double the number of active users, supported by the state-of-the-art systems. Large gains in terms of the minimal required signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)s are also demonstrated for a wide range of active user numbers.}

However, while the downlink (DL) spectral efficiency (SE) increases with FD, the uplink (UL) SE decreases because of the Base Station to Base Station (BS) interference. In this paper, assuming a three-node model, we propose a method based on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to reduce the BS-to-BS interference present in FD cellular networks. The approach consists in coordinating BSs to enable the decoding and the suppression of undesired signals that impair uplink transmissions. We analyze both distributed and Centralized Radio Access Networks (CRAN) architectures. Stochastic geometry is used to derive the coverage probability and mean data rate of the proposed scheme. In the distributed scenario, the FD UL average data rate is increased by 25% with our solution compared to a classical FD network, while our FD scheme still outperforms Half-Duplex (HD) on the DL. In the centralized scenario, our solution outperforms HD by 10% and classical FD by 78% on the UL, while preserving classical FD gains on the DL.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an enabling technology for low-latency AI applications, by caching AI services originally deployed in remote data centers to 5G base stations in network edge. Due to limited computing resource of 5G base stations, not all services can be cached in base stations to meet the resource demands of user requests. Also, if the workload of a 5G base station reaches to its resource capacity, the energy consumption of the base station will be pushed up exponentially. To reduce the energy consumption and overcome resource limitations on base stations, an alternative is to allow the base stations to collaborate with each other to admit user requests. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative service caching and request offloading between a 5G-enabled MEC and remote data centers, while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, and resource capacities on base stations that are operated by multiple selfish network service providers. We aim to maximize the total payoff of all base stations. To this end, we first propose a two-stage optimization framework: In the first stage, we develop a mechanism that adopts a best-reply rule for dynamically distributed coalition formation. In the second stage, we propose a near-optimal payoff allocation method by devising a randomized algorithm with a provable approximation ratio. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization framework by extensive experimental simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms its counterparts by achieving at least 30% higher payoff and 20% lower energy consumption of base stations.}

	abstract = {Indoor optical wireless communication (IOWC) is a key technology complementing radio communication in 6G. Typically, the downlink of IOWC is implemented using visible light and uplink is implemented using infrared. Though the downlink of IOWC has been studied well, the uplink of multiple-access IOWC requires further research. In this paper, power allocation strategies in the uplink of IOWC with multiple non-cooperative users is studied. Optimizing power allocation in IOWC that maximize sum-rate with power constraints becomes a non-convex problem. First, this paper proposes an alternating maximization algorithm to compute near optimal power allocation policies for small number of users. Next, a phenomenon of invariance is observed when the number of users in the system is large. Under invariance, the optimal power allocation policy of a user becomes independent of other users, thereby facilitating fast and decentralized computation of power allocation strategies. From simulations, it was observed that the invariance can occur even with five to ten users. For the first time, a rigorous analysis of the invariance phenomenon is provided. An algorithm to compute the optimal power allocation at invariance is proposed; this algorithm is proven to achieve the global maxima in sum-rate without the channel knowledge of other users.}

Secure\nk\n-connectivity ensures that any two sensors can find a path in between for secure communication, even when\nk−1\nsensors fail. We present conditions on how to set the network parameters such that the network has secure\nk\n-connectivity asymptotically almost surely. The result is given in the form of a sharp zero–one law.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the security enhancement of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where a base station (BS) serves users securely with the assistance of distributed IRSs. Considering that eavesdropper’s instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is challenging to acquire in practice, we utilize secrecy outage probability (SOP) as the security metric. A problem of maximizing the minimum secrecy rate among users, by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming at the BS and phase shifts of the IRSs, is formulated. For a special case with a single-antenna BS, we derive the closed-form SOP expressions and propose a novel ring-penalty based successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to design transmit power and phase shifts jointly. For a general multi-antenna BS case, we develop a Bernstein-type inequality based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the challenging problem. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms over the baseline schemes. The results also show that: 1) the maximum secrecy rate is achieved when distributed IRSs share the reflecting elements equally; and 2) the distributed IRS deployment does not always outperform the centralized IRS deployment, due to the tradeoff between the number of IRSs and the reflecting elements equipped at each IRS.}

	abstract = {We explore leveraging the multiplicity of overt (public) messages, destined for different receivers through different channels, for hiding the transmission of a covert (private) message. The transmitter hides the covert message against a warden by superimposing it onto an overt message. We determine the optimum rule for choosing the overt message to maximize the total detection error probability (sum of the probability of false alarm and missed detection) at the warden. In addition, the channel variation is exploited to minimize the throughput loss on the overt message caused by the superimposition of the covert message. We show that the maximum total detection error probability converges fast to 1 as the number of overt messages (channels) increases; the total detection error probability is independent of the transmission power; and that a positive covert rate (bits per channel use) can be achieved while keeping the total detection error probability arbitrarily close to 1. These findings indicate that the multiplicity of overt messages (channels) and channel variations can be exploited to achieve a positive covert rate.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a learning-aided content-based image transmission scheme is proposed, where a multi-antenna source wishes to securely deliver an image to a legitimate destination in the presence of randomly-distributed passive eavesdroppers (Eves). We take into account the fact that not all regions of an image have the same importance from the security perspective. Hence, we employ a hybrid method to realize both the error-free data delivery of public regions—containing less-important pixels; and an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmission scheme for securing the confidential packets. To reinforce system’s security, fountain-based packet delivery is also adopted, where the source node encodes images into fountain-like packets prior to sending them over the air. The secrecy is achieved when the legitimate destination correctly receives the entire source packets before Eves obtain the important regions, while conforming to the latency limits of the system. Accordingly, the secrecy performance of our scheme is characterized by deriving a closed-form expression for the quality-of-security (QoSec) violation probability. Moreover, our proposed image delivery scheme leverages a deep neural network (DNN) and learns to maintain optimized transmission parameters, while achieving a low QoSec violation probability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate that our proposed learning-assisted scheme outperforms the state-of-the-arts by achieving considerable gains in terms of security and delay requirement.}

	abstract = {Despite the wide utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV communications are susceptible to eavesdropping due to air-ground line-of-sight channels. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is capable of reconfiguring the propagation environment, and thus is an attractive solution for integrating with UAV to facilitate the security in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission design for an IRS-assisted UAV network in the presence of an eavesdropper. With the aim at maximizing the average secrecy rate, the trajectory of UAV, the transmit beamforming, and the phase shift of IRS are jointly optimized. To address this sophisticated problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems and resort to an iterative algorithm to solve them alternately. First, we derive the closed-form solution to the active beamforming. Then, with the optimal transmit beamforming, the passive beamforming optimization problem of fractional programming is transformed into corresponding parametric sub-problems. Moreover, the successive convex approximation is applied to deal with the non-convex UAV trajectory optimization problem by reformulating a convex problem which serves as a lower bound for the original one. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the performance improvement achieved by the joint trajectory and beamforming design.}

To improve the physical layer security, we propose two jamming strategies that can intelligently switch between jamming and non-jamming, namely, suboptimal jammer selection (SJS) scheme and optimal jammer selection (OJS) scheme. Specifically, when a user pair is assigned to access the shared spectrum, another source is chosen as a friendly jammer in order to create intentional interference at E. For the purpose of comparison, we present the non-jammer selection (NJS) scheme as a benchmark. Analytical closed-form secrecy outage probability expressions of NJS, SJS and OJS schemes are derived over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels. We further present an asymptotic secrecy outage probability analysis to evaluate the secrecy diversity gain performance of NJS, SJS and OJS schemes. Numerical results show that the secrecy outage probability performance of OJS scheme is better than SJS and NJS schemes in the low average channel power gain\nΩ\nD\nregion. Furthermore, the secrecy outage probabilities of NJS as well as SJS and OJS schemes converge to each other with the increase of\nΩ\nD\n, due to the fact that the OJS and SJS scheme will switch to NJS scheme when\nΩ\nD\ntends to infinity.}

	abstract = {For space communications, the transmitted signal generally faces a long-distance transmission and a high-accelerating movement. The long-distance transmission causes a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the high-accelerating movement causes a dynamic Doppler-shift. Under a very large acceleration, the long-time accumulation which aims to solve the very low SNR, brings about the serious energy dispersion problem, thus posing a great challenge for Doppler-shift acquisition. Introducing the clustering idea in machine learning, we propose one clustering-fast-Fourier-transform (CFFT) based Doppler-shift acquisition scheme with an affordable computational complexity, to address the energy dispersion problem for space communications. The proposed CFFT scheme includes two algorithms called the Generic CFFT algorithm and the High-order CFFT algorithm, respectively. First, the Generic CFFT algorithm clusters multiple density-reachable signal elements into one signal cluster, thus accumulating the dispersed energy again. Second, the High-order CFFT algorithm, which conducts several rounds of clustering, clusters more density-reachable signal elements into one larger signal cluster. Simulations results show that our proposed CFFT scheme achieves a higher acquisition probability than the existing FFT based schemes and consumes a lower computational complexity than the FRFT scheme.}

	abstract = {A channel time variation suppression scheme based on beamforming is proposed for high-mobility orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink transmissions. The residual channel time variation after Doppler shift compensation by finite resolution receive beamforming can be measured by the Doppler spread. The interchannel interference (ICI) due to the time-varying channel is then analyzed and the relation between the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and Doppler spread is given. Based on the derived Doppler spread and ICI, a beamforming network optimization scheme is proposed to reduce the channel time variation. A closed-form solution is first obtained to minimize the average ICI, which exploits the structure of a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. Next, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum Doppler spread to further verify the impact of average ICI on channel time variation. The sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) algorithm is exploited to solve the non-convex min-max problem. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis.}

	abstract = {Limited access to available spectrum motivates new age radio frequency (RF) systems to co-exist and cooperate. In this paper, we consider a joint communication and radar system (labeled Comm-Radar), that is capable of receiving and decoding communication signals while simultaneously enabling radar functionalities. Traditionally, systems that leverage principles of spectrum convergence, deemed each functions to be detrimental to the others. This has led to successive interference cancellations strategies that effectively isolate each of the functionalities. Here, in the context of Comm-Radar processing structure, we show that ambient communication transmissions actually assist in radar estimation. The insight is that communications multipath reflects off radar targets (we denote these comm-target paths) in the environment, and can be processed at the receiver to extract extra information. In this work we characterize the fundamental performance limits of such a joint system.To demonstrate the radar performance gain achievable via the processing of extra comm-target paths, the closed-form Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of direction, range and velocity of a target is derived, for both the general case, and practical radar and communication signalling schemes. Based on the CRB, joint outer bounds are obtained to characterize the trade off between estimation performance and communication rate. Finally, numerical results verify the advantages of utilizing the target reflections from the communication signal to bolster radar performance.}

	abstract = {Minimizing the symbol error in the uplink of multi-user multiple input multiple output systems is important, because the symbol error affects the achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and thereby the spectral efficiency of the system. Despite the vast literature available on minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers, previously proposed receivers for block fading channels do not minimize the symbol error in time-varying Rayleigh fading channels. Specifically, we show that the true MMSE receiver structure does not only depend on the statistics of the CSI error, but also on the autocorrelation coefficient of the time-variant channel. It turns out that calculating the average SINR when using the proposed receiver is highly non-trivial. In this paper, we employ a random matrix theoretical approach, which allows us to derive a quasi-closed form for the average SINR, which allows to obtain analytical exact results that give valuable insights into how the SINR depends on the number of antennas, employed pilot and data power and the covariance of the time-varying channel. We benchmark the performance of the proposed receiver against recently proposed receivers and find that the proposed MMSE receiver achieves higher SINR than the previously proposed ones, and this benefit increases with increasing autoregressive coefficient.}

	abstract = {The use of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has enabled increased efficiency and capacity of wireless communication systems. When the downlink channel to user terminals (UTs) is known at the base station (BS), the BS can precode transmission to simplify detection at the UTs. In frequency division duplexed (FDD) systems, obtaining CSI at the transmitter to fully exploit the advantages of massive MIMO is complicated, since the number of channel coefficients to be trained and fed back from the UT is very large. This is exacerbated in the case where the channel is time varying, where frequent retraining and feedback is required. However, if the channel coefficients are spatially correlated, the amount of feedback required can be reduced significantly. In this paper, we consider the case where the channel coefficients from the BS to the UTs are spatially correlated, and show that efficient allocation of training power based on eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix significantly boosts achievable rates. Further, we show that using Kalman filters to track the evolving channel coefficients reduces the need to retrain channels, and the reduced training requirement translates to higher data rates. Simulations confirm that optimal training and tracking channel modes enhances rates significantly.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are capable of enhancing the capacity of wireless networks at a low cost. In practical RIS-assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) and RIS reflection optimization constitute a pair of challenges. In this paper, a low-complexity channel estimation and passive beamforming design is proposed. First of all , we conceive a low-complexity framework for maximizing the achievable rate of RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems having discrete phase shifts at each RIS element. In contrast to existing solutions, the proposed arrangement partitions the channel training stage into several phases, where the RIS reflection coefficients are pre-designed and the effective superposed channel is estimated instead of separately training the source-destination and source-RIS-destination links. Based on this, the active beamformer can be designed at low complexity and the RIS reflection optimization is performed by selecting that one from the pre-designed training set which maximizes the achievable rate. Secondly , we propose novel techniques for generating the training set of RIS reflection coefficients. The theoretical performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed and compared to the optimal RIS configuration. Finally , our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is more competitive than its existing counterparts when relying on imperfect CSI, especially for rapidly time-varying channels having short channel coherence time.}

	abstract = {The integration of terrestrial and satellite communications (Satcom) is advocated for satisfying the challenging requirements of seamless, high-performance services. However, both the bandwidth and the power available are limited over satellite channels. In this paper, we propose index modulation (IM) and code-aided Satcom by conveying information by a pair of distinguishable constellation modes and their permutations. In order to combat both the linear and nonlinear distortion imposed by satellite channels, we conceive a factor graph (FG)-based iterative detection algorithm for Satcom relying on dual-mode (DM) IM (Sat-DMIM). The correlation amongst Sat-DMIM symbols imposed by both the channel-induced dispersion and the mode-selection mapping is explicitly represented by the FG constructed. Then the amalgamated belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF) message passing algorithm is derived over this FG for detecting both the IM bits and the classic constellation mapping bits, while eliminating both the linear and nonlinear distortions. The complexity of the iterative detection algorithm is reduced by linearizing some high-order terms appearing in nonlinear distortion components using the a posteriori estimates of the Sat-DMIM symbols obtained from the previous iteration. Our simulation results demonstrate the power of the proposed amalgamated BP-MF-based and partial linearization approximation-based iterative detection algorithms.}

In this paper, we investigate JCAS waveform optimization in communication-centric systems, where a base station (BS) detects radar targets and communicates with mobile users simultaneously. Different from existing works, we study multi-metric optimizations for a practical low-cost system and establish their connections. To relax the requirement of full-duplex technology, we add a single receive antenna for sensing at the BS, which is synchronized with and spatially separated from the JCAS transmit array. We first optimize precoders for communications and radar, individually. Then, we formulate a JCAS waveform optimization problem that constrains either mutual information (MI) or Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of radar and maximizes the relaxed signal-to-interference-plus-noise rate (SINR) of communications. Exploiting the geometric characteristic of the relaxed SINR, we provide a closed-form solution under certain conditions and propose a numerical iteration algorithm that works in all situations. We also disclose the connections between optimizations with constraining MI and CRB, using numerical results. Finally, simulation results are provided and validate the proposed optimization solutions.}

	abstract = {The challenge in massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) is to support reliable and instant access for an enormous number of machine-type devices (MTDs). In some particular applications of mMTC, the access point (AP) only has to know the messages received, but not where they source from, thus giving rise to the concept of unsourced random access (URA). In this paper, we propose a novel URA scheme exploiting the elegant properties of Reed-Muller (RM) sequences. Specifically, after dividing the message of an active user into several information chunks, RM sequences are used to carry those chunks, for exploiting the vast sequence space to improve the spectral efficiency, and their nested structure to enable reliable and efficient sequence detection. Next, we further explore a novel structural property of RM sequences for designing sparse patterns which carry part of the information and serve as the hints of coupling the information chunks of a single user. The factors affecting the performance of our slot-based RM detection are characterized. Besides, the complexity of the proposed message stitching method is analyzed and compared to the commonly used tree coding approach. Our simulation results verify the enhanced performance of the proposed URA scheme in error probability and computational complexity compared to the existing counterpart.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the coexistence of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services in a cellular network that is assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The system model consists of one base station (BS) and one RIS that is deployed to enhance the performance of both eMBB and URLLC in terms of the achievable data rate and reliability, respectively. We formulate two optimization problems, a time slot basis eMBB allocation problem and a mini-time slot basis URLLC allocation problem. The eMBB allocation problem aims at maximizing the eMBB sum rate by jointly optimizing the power allocation at the BS and the RIS phase-shift matrix while satisfying the eMBB rate constraint. On the other hand, the URLLC allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem with the goal of maximizing the URLLC admitted packets and minimizing the eMBB rate loss. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the power and frequency allocations along with the RIS phase-shift matrix. In order to avoid the violation in the URLLC latency requirements, we propose a novel framework in which the RIS phase-shift matrix that enhances the URLLC reliability is proactively designed at the beginning of the time slot. For the sake of solving the URLLC allocation problem, two algorithms are proposed, namely, an optimization-based URLLC allocation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm. The simulation results show that the heuristic algorithm has a low time complexity, which makes it practical for real-time and efficient multiplexing between eMBB and URLLC traffic. In addition, using only 60 RIS elements, we observe that the proposed scheme achieves around 99.99% URLLC packets admission rate compared to 95.6% when there is no RIS, while also achieving up to 70% enhancement on the eMBB sum rate.}

As opposed to previous works where the energy efficiency (EE)/the spectral efficiency (SE) maximization or the EE-SE tradeoff was considered, our goal is to minimize the number of reflecting elements in the IRS-assisted system. Besides, both the EE and the SE constraints are considered in the number minimization problem, which has not been addressed in existing works. However, both the EE and the SE performance do not admit exact closed-form expressions due to the non-convexity incurred by joint beamforming and phase shift design. In order to make the optimization problem tractable, we resort to their performance bounds for problem reformulation. By decomposing the problem into two sub-problems, we are able to derive closed-form expressions for the minimum number of reflecting elements, and both the coherent phase shift (CPS)-oriented solution and the random phase shift (RPS)-oriented solution are proposed for comparison. In order to shed light on the practical design, the relationship between the derived number of reflecting elements is established for both schemes, and the upper bounds on both the EE and the SE thresholds and the placement of the IRS to achieve only one reflecting element are obtained. Simulation results confirm the validity of our analysis on the minimum number of reflecting elements and effectiveness of both schemes.}

	abstract = {The dramatic growth in computing capability and the inherent mobility of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) foster the recent surge of interests in incorporating UAVs into edge computing systems to facilitate on-demand deployment and extended coverage. Nonetheless, due to the limited communication capability of the UAVs, single-UAV edge computing systems may still be incompetent when serving remote users. Although the traditional multi-UAV relay network can be a viable solution, it fails to exploit the computing capability of the UAVs. With this consideration, a multi-hop task offloading with on-the-fly computation scheme is proposed in this work to enable a more powerful multi-UAV remote edge computing network. To solve the corresponding joint resource allocation and deployment problem, two efficient algorithms are proposed. One of them can find the global optimal strategy in a special case, while the other can obtain a good local optimal strategy in the general cases. Both algorithms have a complexity only linear in the number of UAVs and admit distributed implementation. In addition to analysis, numerical results are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

To tackle this problem, we introduce an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) to compensate the propagation loss and boost the transmission efficiency. This paper proposes a novel IRS-aided SWIPT system where a multi-carrier multi-antenna Access Point (AP) transmits information and power simultaneously, with the assist of an IRS, to a single-antenna User Equipment (UE) employing practical receiving schemes. Considering harvester nonlinearity, we characterize the achievable Rate-Energy (R-E) region through a joint optimization of waveform, active and passive beamforming based on the Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). This problem is solved by the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, where we obtain the active precoder in closed form, the passive beamforming by the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach, and the waveform amplitude by the Geometric Programming (GP) technique. To facilitate practical implementation, we also propose a low-complexity design based on closed-form adaptive waveform schemes. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithms bring considerable R-E gains with robustness to CSIT inaccuracy and finite IRS states, and emphasize the importance of modeling harvester nonlinearity in the IRS-aided SWIPT design.}

However, the existing research are mainly based on simplistic channel models, which will, in principle, lead to inaccurate analysis of the system performance. In this paper, we propose a general three-dimensional (3D) wideband non-stationary end-to-end channel model for RIS assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, which takes into account the physical properties of RIS, such as unit numbers, unit sizes, array orientations and array configurations. By modeling the RIS by a virtual cluster, we describe the end-to-end channel by a superposition of virtual line-of-sight (V-LoS), single-bounced non-LoS (SB-NLoS), and double-bounced NLoS (DB-NLoS) components. We also derive an equivalent cascaded channel model and show the equivalence between end-to-end and cascaded modeling of RIS channels. Then, a sub-optimal solution with low complexity is used to derive the RIS reflection phases. The impact of physical properties of RIS, such as unit numbers, unit sizes, array orientations, array configurations and array relative locations, on channel statistical characteristics has been investigated and analyzed, the results demonstrate that the proposed model is helpful for characterizing the RIS-assisted communication channels.}

Specifically, using an equivalence distance approach, we characterize the overall handoff (HO) probability in terms of the horizontal and vertical HO and mobility-aware coverage probability. In addition, we characterize novel coverage probability expressions for THz network in the presence of molecular absorption noise and highlight its significant impact on the users’ performance. Specifically, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the Laplace Transform of the cumulative molecular noise and interference observed by a mobile user in a hybrid RF-THz network. Furthermore, we provide a novel approximation to derive the conditional distance distributions of a typical user in a hybrid RF-THz network. Finally, using the overall HO probability and coverage probability expressions, the mobility-aware probability of coverage has been derived in a hybrid RF-THz network. Our mathematical results validate the correctness of the derived expressions using Monte-Carlo simulations. The results offer insights into the adverse impact of users’ mobility and molecular noise in THz transmissions on the probability of coverage of mobile users. Our results demonstrate that a small increase in the intensity of terahertz base-stations (TBSs) (about 5 times) can increase the HO probability much more compared to the case when the intensity of RF BSs (RBSs) is increased by 100 times. Furthermore, we note that high molecular absorption can be beneficial (in terms of minimizing interference and molecular noise) for specific deployment intensity of TBSs and the benefits can outweigh the drawbacks of signal degradation due to molecular absorption.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communications with multi-GHz bandwidth are envisioned as a key technology for 6G systems. Ultra-massive (UM) MIMO with hybrid beamforming architectures are widely investigated to provide a high array gain to overcome the huge propagation loss at THz band. However, most of the existing hybrid beamforming architectures can only utilize the multiplexing offered by the multipath components, i.e., inter-path multiplexing, which is very limited due to the spatially sparse THz channel. In this paper, a widely-spaced multi-subarray (WSMS) hybrid beamforming architecture is proposed, which improves the multiplexing gain by exploiting a new type of intra-path multiplexing provided by the spherical-wave propagation among k\nwidely-spaced subarrays, in addition to the inter-path multiplexing. The resulting multiplexing gain of WSMS architecture is k\ntimes of the existing architectures. For WSMS architecture, a novel design problem is formulated by optimizing the number of subarrays, subarray spacing, and hybrid beamforming matrices to maximize the spectral efficiency, which is decomposed into two subproblems. An optimal closed-form solution is derived for the first hybrid beamforming subproblem, while a dominant-line-of-sight-relaxation algorithm is proposed for the second array configuration subproblem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the WSMS architecture and proposed algorithms enhance the spectral efficiency substantially.}

Also, we investigate the impact of sub-band assignment on multi-connectivity (MC) enabled THzCom systems, where users associate and communicate with multiple access points simultaneously. We formulate resource allocation problems, with the primary focus on spectrum allocation, to determine sub-band assignment, sub-band bandwidth, and optimal transmit power.

Aided by numerical results, we show that by enabling and optimizing ASB, significantly higher throughput can be achieved as compared to adopting equal sub-band bandwidth, and this throughput gain is most profound when the power budget constraint is more stringent. We also show that our sub-band assignment strategy in MC-enabled THzCom systems outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-band assignment strategies and the performance gain is most profound when the spectrum with the lowest average molecular absorption coefficient is selected during spectrum allocation.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal resource allocation algorithm design for large intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. To facilitate efficient system design for large IRSs, instead of jointly optimizing all the IRS elements, we partition the IRS into several tiles and employ a scalable optimization framework comprising an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. In the offline stage, the IRS elements of each tile are jointly designed to support a set of different phase shift configurations, referred to as transmission modes, while the best transmission mode is selected from the set for each tile in the online stage. Given a transmission mode set, we aim to minimize the total base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming and the transmission mode selection policy taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear energy harvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which entails a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between optimality and computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal algorithm capitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that the proposed designs enable considerable power savings compared to several baseline schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that by properly adjusting the numbers of tiles and transmission modes, the proposed scalable optimization framework indeed facilitates online design for large IRSs. Besides, our results confirm that the advocated physics-based model and scalable optimization framework enable a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity, which is vital for realizing the performance gains promised by large IRS-assisted communication systems in practice.}

For the proposed users, we provide the approximate expressions for the performance in terms of coverage probability, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency (EE). The proposed stochastic geometry framework can capture the impact of channel fading, locations of BSs and IRSs, arbitrary phase-shifts and interference experienced by a typical user supported by direct transmission and/or IRS-assisted transmission. For IRS-assisted transmissions, we first model approximate the desired signal power from the nearest IRS as a sum of scaled generalized gamma (GG) random variables whose parameters are functions of the IRS phase shifts. Then, we derive the Laplace Transform (LT) of the received signal power in a closed form. Also, we approximate the aggregate interference from multiple IRSs as the sum of normal random variables. Then, we derive the LT of the aggregate interference from all IRSs and BSs. The derived LT expressions are used to calculate coverage probability, ergodic capacity, and EE for users served by direct BS transmissions as well as users served by IRS-assisted transmissions. Finally, we derive the overall network coverage probability, ergodic capacity, and EE based on the fraction of direct and IRS-assisted users, which is defined as a function of the deployment density of IRSs, as well as blockage probability of direct transmission links. Numerical results validate the derived analytical expressions and extract useful insights related to the number of IRS elements, large-scale deployment of IRSs and BSs, and the impact of IRS interference on direct transmissions.}

In this paper, we propose to deploy reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to improve the EE of femtocells. However, perfect channel state information is more difficult to obtain due to the passive characteristics of RISs and non-cooperative relationship between different tiers. Besides, the low-cost transceivers and reflecting units suffer nontrivial hardware impairments (HWIs) due to the hardware limitations of practical systems. To this end, we investigate a realistic robust beamforming design based on max-min fairness for an RIS-aided HetNet under channel uncertainties and residual HWIs. The joint optimization of transmit beamforming vectors of femto base stations (FBSs) and the phase-shift matrices of RISs is formulated as a non-convex problem to maximize the minimum EE of the femtocell subject to the constraints of the maximum transmit power of FBSs, the quality of service of users, and unit modulus phase-shift constraints of RISs. We develop an iterative block coordinate descent-based algorithm which exploits the semi-definite relaxation, the S-procedure, and the singular value decomposition method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of fairness, EE, and outage probability.}

	abstract = {Consider the identification (ID) via channels problem, where a receiver decides whether the transmitted identifier is its identifier, rather than decoding it. This model allows to transmit identifiers whose size scales doubly-exponentially in the blocklength, unlike common transmission codes with exponential scaling. Binary constant-weight codes (CWCs) suffice to achieve the ID capacity. Relating parameters of a binary CWC to the minimum distance of a code and using higher-order correlation moments, two upper bounds on binary CWC sizes are proposed. These bounds are also upper bounds on identifier sizes for ID codes constructed by using binary CWCs. We propose two constructions based on optical orthogonal codes (OOCs), which are used in optical multiple access schemes, have constant-weight codewords, and satisfy cyclic cross-correlation and auto-correlation constraints. These constructions are modified and concatenated with outer Reed-Solomon codes to propose new binary CWCs being optimal for ID. Improvements to the finite-parameter performance are shown by using outer codes with larger minimum distance vs. blocklength ratios. We illustrate ID regimes for which our ID code constructions perform significantly better than existing constructions.}

However, codes designed by conventional methods are not competitive under successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. This paper presents a new design method based on the BLER upper bound under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding (ML-BLER upper bound). The ML-BLER upper bound depends on the weight enumerating function (WEF) of the polar-coded modulation scheme over the squared Euclidean distance. In this paper, the polar-coded modulation is randomized by the concept of interleaved polar (i-polar) codes, and the WEF averaged over the ensemble of the polar-coded modulation schemes can be derived. Three polar-coded modulation schemes are considered, i.e., the bit-interleaved polar-coded modulation with a single interleaver (BIPCM-SI), the bit-interleaved polar-coded modulation with multiple interleavers (BIPCM-MI), and the multi-level polar-coded modulation (MLPCM). A new bit channel selection algorithm for polar-coded modulation schemes is proposed, which takes the polarization effect and the ML-BLER upper bound as design criteria. Design examples show that, under SCL decoding, the polar-coded modulation schemes (without CRC) with the proposed channel selection algorithm outperform those with conventional algorithms and are competitive as compared to the state-of-the-art 5G LDPC codes.}

In ASD, the interpolation polynomial\nQ(x,y,z)\nis the minimum candidate of a Gröbner basis. Based on a multiplicity matrix, an interpolation ideal can be defined. With the decoding output list size, an equivalent interpolation module can be led to. By further defining the set of interpolation points, a sequence of modules from the elliptic curve coordinate ring can be obtained. Based on the Lagrange interpolation functions over elliptic function field, a basis of the interpolation module can be constructed. The desired Gröbner basis that contains\nQ\ncan be determined by reducing the module basis. Re-encoding transform (ReT) is further introduced to reduce the basis reduction complexity. It is also shown that the interpolation can be facilitated by assessing the degree of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials. The decoding complexity is analyzed, which is verified by numerical results. That shows the advantage of this interpolation technique over the conventional Kötter’s interpolation. The ASD performance of elliptic codes is also presented.}

First, we derive upper bounds on the size of zero-error codes for segmented edit channels with segment-by-segment decoding. Second, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between prefixed VT codes and Levenshtein codes. Based on this relation, we can obtain explicit formulas on the size of prefixed VT codes via the existing results on the size of Levenshtein codes. Third, we construct a new zero-error prefixed VT code and show that the size of the constructed code is strictly larger than that of the existing prefixed VT code for the segmented deletion channel. Finally, an efficient systematic encoding method of prefixed VT codes is proposed for the segmented edit channels.}

Considering the above advantages, this paper investigates the RIS-assisted wireless communication in the presence of an interferer, where a receiver receives the desired signal and interference from a transmitter and an interferer, respectively, and the RIS is deployed to assist this system. First, an interference-limited channel capacity maximization problem is formulated, and a numerical algorithm based on the fraction programming and optimality conditions is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Then, this paper shows the upper boundary of the maximal capacity with interference and discusses what kind of channel conditions can achieve the upper boundary and the corresponding optimal phase shifts. Next, this paper analyzes the asymptotic behaviors of the maximal capacity in the scenarios that some or all of the number of reflecting elements, antennas at the transmitter, and interferer go to infinity. Finally, this paper generalizes the above results to the multiple interferers scenario.}

Both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relays are considered. In this framework, the NU combines the signals from base-station and relay at each stage of the successive interference cancellation (SIC) to attain good outage performance. For both NU and FU, the expressions for outage probability and throughput are derived in closed form. We also derive the high-SNR expressions for the outage probability to demonstrate that with the proposed framework, both users harness a diversity of two without feedback bits (this is the only framework to achieve this). We demonstrate that the choice of power allocation coefficient and target symbol rates is crucial to maximizing the NU throughput while ensuring a desired target FU throughput. We demonstrate that CDRT with the proposed framework outperforms known schemes in terms of outage probability, sum throughput, and energy efficiency. Moreover, we also show that optimal rate selection is important to maximize the energy efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations validate the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions.}

	abstract = {High resolution analog to digital converters (ADCs) are conventionally used at the receiver terminals to store an accurate digital representation of the received signal, thereby allowing for reliable decoding of transmitted messages. However, in a wide range of applications, such as communication over millimeter wave and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the use of high resolution ADCs is not feasible due to power budget limitations. In the conventional fully digital receiver design, where each receiver antenna is connected to a distinct ADC, reducing the ADC resolution leads to performance loss in terms of achievable rates. One proposed method to mitigate the rate-loss is to use analog linear combiners leading to design of hybrid receivers. Here, the hybrid framework is augmented by the addition of delay elements to allow for temporal analog processing. Two new classes of receivers consisting of delay elements, analog linear combiners, and one-bit ADCs are proposed. The fundamental limits of communication in single and multi-user (uplink and downlink) MIMO systems employing the proposed receivers are investigated. In the high signal to noise ratio regime, it is shown that the proposed receivers achieve the maximum achievable rates among all receivers with the same number of one-bit ADCs.}

We propose a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) partial-response equalizer that equalizes the unsynchronized samples of the multiple readback waveforms to a time-varying MIMO target, thereby enabling a trellis-based rotating-target (ROTAR) detector that accounts for the asynchrony. We evaluate the proposed equalization strategy on a two-dimensional magnetic-recording channel, and find that the proposed receiver outperforms a conventional receiver that detects one track at a time, by a 30% reduction in the bit-error rate, and that it closely matches the performance of a fictitious system in which the tracks are perfectly synchronous.}

	abstract = {Age of Information (AoI) has become an important concept in communications, as it allows system designers to measure the freshness of the information available to remote monitoring or control processes. However, its definition tacitly assumes that new information is used at any time, which is not always the case: the instants at which information is collected and used may be dependent on a certain query process, and resource-constrained environments such as most Internet of Things (IoT) use cases require precise timing to fully exploit the limited available transmissions. In this work, we consider a pull-based communication model in which the freshness of information is only important when the receiver generates a query: if the monitoring process is not using the value, the age of the last update is irrelevant. We optimize the Age of Information at Query (QAoI), a metric that samples the AoI at relevant instants, better fitting the pull-based resource-constrained scenario, and show how this can lead to very different choices. Our results show that QAoI-aware optimization can significantly reduce the average and worst-case perceived age for both periodic and stochastic queries.}

However, a major challenge for the conventional LoRa system is the performance degradation due to the long-range communication over fading channels. To resolve the challenging issue, this paper investigates a two-hop amplify-and-forward relaying LoRa network in a two-dimension plane, where random nodal distances are considered. Moreover, a relay-selection mechanism is developed for the proposed system. Based on the best relay-selection protocol, the analytical bit-error-rate (BER) and asymptotic BER expressions, achievable diversity order, coverage probability, and throughput of the proposed system are derived over the Nakagami-\nm\nfading channel. Furthermore, to maximize the throughput of the proposed system, a two-dimensional resource allocation optimization problem (i.e., the spread factor selection and power allocation optimization) is formulated and investigated. The proposed optimal spread factor selection and power allocation scheme is verified to outperform the two baseline schemes. Simulation and numerical results show that although the proposed system reduces the throughput compared to the conventional LoRa system, it significantly improves the BER and coverage probability. Hence, the proposed system can be considered as a promising technique for low-power, long-range and highly reliable Internet-of-Things applications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of distributed content caching in a small-cell Base Stations (sBSs) wireless network that maximizes the cache hit performance is considered. Most of the existing works consider static demands, however, here, data at each sBS is considered to be correlated across time and sBSs. Federated learning (FL) based caching strategy is proposed which is assumed to be a weighted combination of past caching strategies of the sBS as well as the neighbouring sBSs. A high probability generalization guarantees on the performance of the proposed federated caching strategy is derived. The theoretical guarantee provides following insights on obtaining the caching strategy: (i) run regret minimization at each sBS to obtain a sequence of caching strategies across time, and (ii) maximize an estimate of the bound to obtain a set of weights for the caching strategy which depends on the discrepancy. Theoretical guarantee on the performance of the least recently frequently used (LRFU) caching strategy is derived. Further, FL based heuristic caching algorithm is also proposed. Finally, it is shown through simulations using Movie Lens dataset that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the recent online learning algorithms.}

	abstract = {Many of the existing optimization-based transmit power control algorithms suffer from high computational complexity and require instantaneous global channel state information (CSI), both of which hinder their practical implementation. In this paper, we consider a wireless network with multiple transmitter-receiver pairs, where each transmitter only has access to its local CSI fed back from its intended receiver and does not require local CSI exchange with its neighboring transmitters. In such a network scenario, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based decentralized multi-agent power control (DEC-MAPC) algorithm for sum-rate maximization, where each transmitter acts as an intelligent agent. By leveraging the value decomposition technique, we establish a nonlinear mapping from the local reward of each agent to the global reward. Such a design allows each agent to independently control its transmit power based on its local CSI while enabling global collaboration among the agents. The proposed algorithm is scalable to large-scale networks as only local CSI is required, and is robust to the channel and interference variations via interacting with the environment. Simulation results show that the proposed DEC-MAPC algorithm with local CSI achieves comparable sum-rate performance with the centralized optimization algorithms with global CSI, while significantly reducing the computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Information theoretic learning (ITL) criteria have emerged useful for mitigating degradations caused by unknown non-Gaussian noise processes in future wireless communication systems. Specifically, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) based approaches relying on ITL based learning criteria are envisioned to provide near-optimal mitigation of unknown hardware impairments and non-Gaussian noises. Among several ITL criteria, the recent works find the minimum error entropy with fiducial points (MEEF) promising due to its guarantee of unbiased estimation and generalization over generic noise distributions. However, MEEF based learning approaches are known to depend on an accurate kernel-width initialization. Also, the optimal value of this kernel-width is well-known to vary temporally and across deployment scenarios. To remove the dependency on kernel-width, a hyperparameter-free MEEF based adaptive algorithm is derived using random-Fourier features with sampled kernel widths (RFF-SKW). In addition, a detailed convergence analysis is presented for the proposed hyperparameter-free MEEF, which promises a near-optimal error-floor independent of step-size and guarantees convergence for a wide range of step sizes. The promised hyperparameter-independence and improved convergence for the proposed hyperparameter-free MEEF are validated by computer simulations considering different case studies.}

By employing ResNet to extract features from the channel matrices, two neural networks, i.e., the antenna selection network (ASNet) and the hybrid beamforming network (BFNet), are respectively proposed for dynamic antenna selection and hybrid beamformer design. Furthermore, a deep probabilistic subsampling trick and a specially designed quantization function are respectively developed for ASNet and BFNet to preserve the differentiability while embedding discrete constraints into the network structures. With the aid of a flexibly designed loss function, ASNet and BFNet are jointly trained in a phased unsupervised way, which avoids the prohibitive computational cost of acquiring training labels in supervised learning. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach over conventional optimization-based algorithms in terms of both the achieved rate and the computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel resource management scheme that jointly allocates the transmit power and computational resources in a centralized radio access network architecture. The network comprises a set of computing nodes to which the requested tasks of different users are offloaded. The optimization problem minimizes the energy consumption of task offloading while takes the end-to-end-latency, i.e., the transmission, execution, and propagation latencies of each task, into account. We aim to allocate the transmit power and computational resources such that the maximum acceptable latency of each task is satisfied. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, we divide it into two sub-problems, one for transmit power allocation and another for task placement and computational resource allocation. Transmit power is allocated via the convex-concave procedure. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to jointly manage computational resources and task placement. We also propose a feasibility analysis that finds a feasible subset of tasks. Furthermore, a disjoint method that separately allocates the transmit power and the computational resources is proposed as the baseline of comparison. A lower bound on the optimal solution of the optimization problem is also derived based on exhaustive search over task placement decisions and utilizing Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. Simulation results show that the joint method outperforms the disjoint method in terms of acceptance ratio. Simulations also show that the optimality gap of the joint method is less than 5%.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study multi-user multi-antenna wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, where each antenna at the energy harvesting (EH) nodes is connected to a dedicated non-linear rectifier. We propose optimal transmit strategies which maximize a weighted sum of the average harvested powers at the EH nodes subject to a constraint on the power budget of the transmitter. First, for multiple-input single-output (MISO) WPT systems, we prove that the optimal strategy employs maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming and scalar symbols with arbitrary phases and discrete amplitudes following a probability density function (pdf) with at most two mass points. Then, we prove that for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) WPT systems, the optimal transmit symbol amplitudes are discrete random variables, whose pdf also has no more than two mass points. For general multi-user MIMO WPT, we show that the optimal transmit strategy employs scalar unit-norm symbols with arbitrary phases and at most two beamforming vectors. To determine these vectors, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem and obtain an optimal solution based on monotonic optimization. Since the computational complexity of the optimal solution is high, we propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution, which achieves near-optimal performance. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed transmit strategy for multi-user MIMO WPT systems outperforms baseline schemes based on a linear EH model and a single beamforming vector. For a given transmit power budget, we show that the harvested power saturates when increasing the number of transmit antennas. Finally, we observe that the harvested power region spanned by multiple EH nodes is convex and the power harvested at one EH node can be traded for a higher harvested power at the other nodes.}

Although CNOMA has recently attracted great attention, its error performance, particularly that of full-duplex cooperative NOMA (FD-CNOMA), is still underexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigated the error performance of FD-CNOMA systems under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and residual self-interference (RSI), where new closed-form expressions of the exact bit error rates (BER) are derived for both users. Through the derived BER expressions, high-SNR analyses are conducted to show that FD-CNOMA has an error floor. Based on the derived expressions, we proposed a novel SINR-based selective FD-relaying, which minimizes the end-to-end (e2e) BER and improves the overall system performance. The analyses are extended to cover pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) with arbitrary modulation orders. Monte Carlo simulations and numerical results are presented to corroborate the derived analytical expressions and give valuable insights into the error performance of FD-CNOMA systems.}

To achieve this objective, we first design a generalized coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior which captures this variable-sized block sparsity. We then derive its sub-optimal precision hyperparameter updates using majorization minimization framework. We next design a decentralized CP-SBL (dCP-SBL) algorithm for the emerging base station architectures with multiple processing units. The dCP-SBL algorithm converts the centralized hyperparameter cCP-SBL updates to an equivalent optimization problem, and solves it decentrally using asynchronous alternating direction method of multipliers. We also theoretically analyze the convergence of the dCP-SBL algorithm. We show using extensive numerical investigations that the i) proposed cCP- and dCP-SBL algorithms outperform several existing state-of-the-art designs; and ii) dCP-SBL algorithm is robust to processing unit failures and has a lower time complexity than the cCP-SBL algorithm.}

In order to efficiently manage radio resources, the CF central processing unit implement uplink power control policies. These policies aim to optimize a given network utility function. In this paper, we investigate the max-min fairness optimization problem, in which the spectral efficiency performance of the UE with the worst channel conditions is prioritized, taking into account a per-UE power constraint and assuming linear maximum ratio combining at APs. Existing solutions have typically relied on second-order cone programming with convex approximations, which exhibit high computational complexity and scalability issues. Therefore, meta-heuristics (MHs) are explored as alternative optimization schemes, capable of providing (near)-optimal solutions with reasonable computational effort. Three MH approaches with different operation principles are compared. Numerical results show that the differential evolution algorithm exhibits the best trade-off between solution quality and run time, being able to reach (near)-optimal solutions faster than the bisection approach while coping with the scalability issues of the geometric programming-based algorithm.}

We investigate the joint design of the task scheduling, service caching and power allocation to minimize the total task scheduling delay. To this end, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem taking into account the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, multiple task nodes (TNs) offload their computational tasks either to computing and caching nodes (CCN) constituted by nearby massive MIMO-aided relay nodes (MRN) or alternatively to the cloud constituted by nearby fog access nodes (FAN). To address the non-convexity of the optimization problem, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed. First, we solve the non-convex power allocation optimization problem by transforming it into a linear optimization problem for a given task offloading and service caching result. Then, we use the classic Lagrange partial relaxation for relaxing the binary task offloading as well as caching constraints and formulate the dual problem to obtain the task allocation and software caching results. Given both the power allocation, as well as the task offloading and caching result, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the jointly optimized results. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes, where the power allocation may be controlled by the asymptotic form of the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).}

	abstract = {In the edge computing Internet of Things network, we minimize the offloading overhead (caused by the bandwidth cost for data transmission and computation resource consumption for task remote processing) while providing the end-to-end (E2E) delay provisioning. Under the scenario, a tandem queue consisting of a transmission queue and a computing process queue is formed by the tasks offloaded to the edge server via wireless link and then processed through the computing resource. Due to the tandem queue, the offloading decision and computing resource allocation are coupled over the tandem queue. To make the problem tractable, we decouple the above two operations and propose a two-stage offloading filtering and computing resource allocation policy. After decouple, we then investigate the delay bound violation probability of the tandem queue by leveraging large deviation analysis. Further, we reveal that under the same E2E delay provisioning, the offloading overhead under the proposed decoupled policy can approach to the non-decoupled optimum by selecting an appropriate value of control parameter. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show the efficiency of the proposed policy.}

	abstract = {Providing truly ubiquitous connectivity requires development of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet, whose theoretical study is lagging behind network-specific simulations. In this paper, we derive analytical expressions for the downlink coverage probability and average data rate of a massive inclined LEO constellation in terms of total interference power’s Laplace transform in the presence of fading and shadowing, ergo presenting a stochastic geometry-based analysis. We assume the desired link to experience Nakagami-\nm\nfading, which serves to represent different fading scenarios by varying integer\nm\n, while the interfering channels can follow any fading model without an effect on analytical tractability. To take into account the inherent non-uniform distribution of satellites across different latitudes, we model the LEO network as a nonhomogeneous Poisson point process with its intensity being a function of satellites’ actual distribution in terms of constellation size, the altitude of the constellation, and the inclination of orbital planes. From the numerical results, we observe optimum points for both the constellation altitude and the number of orthogonal frequency channels; interestingly, the optimum user’s latitude is greater than the inclination angle due to the presence of fewer interfering satellites. Overall, the presented study facilitates general stochastic evaluation and planning of satellite Internet constellations without specific orbital simulations or tracking data on satellites’ exact positions in space.}

	abstract = {The design of optical buffers for packet contention resolution has been recognized as a key issue in all-optical packet switching. One of the most general buffering schemes is priority queues, which includes first-in first-out (FIFO) queues and last-in first-out (LIFO) queues as special cases. In a priority queue, each packet is associated with a unique priority upon its arrival, the packet with the highest priority is sent out from the queue whenever there is a departure request and there are packets in the queue, and the packet with the lowest priority is dumped from the queue whenever there is a buffer overflow. In this paper, we consider the constructions of optical priority queues by using a feedback system consisting of an optical (bufferless) crossbar switch and multiple optical FIFO multiplexers with delay one (FM1’s) in the feedback path for buffering packets and feeding packets back to the switch. Such a feedback system is a generalization of that used in one of the authors’ earlier attempt for the constructions of optical priority queues in Tang et al. (2020). We fix the no-buffering problem in Tang et al. (2020) by using optical FM1’s to replace the optical FIFO multiplexers (FM’s) in Tang et al. (2020), which enables us to successfully achieve an exact emulation of a priority queue. We improve the utilization of buffering capacity over that in Tang et al. (2020) by routing packets to the optical FM1’s according to their buffering tags instead of their tags as used in Tang et al. (2020). We also extend and generalize the construction in Tang et al. (2020) and obtain a much larger class of constructions of optical priority queues. Our constructions are made possible by showing that the highest-priority (resp., lowest-priority) packet is always available at the input links of the switch whenever it needs to be routed to the departure (resp., loss) link, and by showing that there is no collision and there is no buffer overflow at any FM1 at any time so that there is no internal packet loss at any time. Our complexity analysis shows that by using a feedback system consisting of an optical $(M+2) \\times (M+2)$ (bufferless) crossbar switch and $M$ fiber delay lines, we can achieve a buffer size of $2^{O(\\sqrt {\\alpha M})}$ , where $\\alpha $ is a constant that depends on the parameters used in our constructions. Furthermore, we show that the best buffer size that we can achieve is $2^{O(\\sqrt {4M/15})}$ . Our result (exponential in $\\sqrt {M}$ ) substantially improves on the best known result (polynomial in $M$ ) in the literature. Our numerical results show that the construction complexity of our constructions is lower than that of the construction in Tang et al. (2020), and the actual saving, in terms of the number of $2\\times 2$ switches needed, by our constructions could be quite significant even in the tiny-buffer and small-buffer regimes.}

	abstract = {The ambitious goal of light-fidelity (LiFi) technology to provide seamless user mobility in indoor environments requires strong link connections to confront any stochasticity that possibly comes out. In this context, a robust LiFi network should effectively address the spatial random terminal locations inside its coverage volume. In contrast with the previously published works dealing mainly with randomness in two dimensions, the present study aims to provide a more realistic framework by treating the problem in the three-dimensional space. In view of the foregoing, a LiFi configuration is adopted where a terminal lies at a random position inside its truncated conic coverage volume at a distance from the transmitter. Some key statistics for a distance-related metric and the channel gain, including the probability density function, are derived in the first place. The investigation is then headed on the performance analysis of the LiFi link by providing closed-form expressions of the outage probability and the average bit error rate for on-off keying assuming indirect modulation/direct detection at the receiver. A multiuser scenario with several users placed inside the coverage volume is examined as well. A series of numerical results is also depicted to provide valuable insights into how the random terminal placement affects the link performance.}

	abstract = {Optical wireless communication (OWC) is considered to be a promising technology which will alleviate traffic burden caused by the increasing number of mobile devices. In this study, a novel vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) array is proposed for indoor OWC systems. To activate the best beam for a mobile user, two beam activation methods are proposed for the system. The method based on a corner-cube retroreflector (CCR) provides very low latency and allows real-time activation for high-speed users. The other method uses the omnidirectional transmitter (ODTx). The ODTx can serve the purpose of uplink transmission and beam activation simultaneously. Moreover, systems with ODTx are very robust to the random orientation of a user equipment (UE). System level analyses are carried out for the proposed VCSEL array system. For a single user scenario, the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the central beam of the VCSEL array system can be approximated as a uniform distribution. In addition, the average data rate of the central beam and its upper bound are given analytically and verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. For a multi-user scenario, an analytical upper bound for the average data rate is given. The effects of the cell size and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) angle on the system performance are studied. The results show that the system with a FWHM angle of 4° outperforms the others.}

	abstract = {Fast and reliable synchronization in free-space optical (FSO) communications is a crucial task that has received little attention so far. Since in these applications the data rate is much higher than in traditional radio-frequency (RF) systems, novel technological constraints may arise in the design of the synchronization algorithms, as for example the need to operate at symbol rate instead with an oversampled data stream. In this work, we consider an FSO link and investigate the problem of channel estimation, symbol timing recovery and frame detection using a known synch pattern. The modulation format is on-off keying (OOK) and the received signal is plagued by a mixture of thermal and shot noise. By applying the least-squares criterion, we derive a novel synchronization scheme that can jointly retrieve all the unknown parameters using symbol-spaced samples. Although designed without taking the noise statistics into account, the estimator performance is assessed in a realistic scenario where shot noise is present. Comparisons are made with the relevant Cramér-Rao bound for the joint estimation of the synchronization parameters and signal-dependent noise variances. Numerical simulations and complexity analysis indicate that the resulting scheme performs satisfactorily with an affordable processing load. Hence, it represents a promising solution for fast synchronization in high-speed FSO communications.}

Then, we derive the impulse response of multi-element phase-tunable metasurface and orientation-tunable mirror array-based reflector setups for a general setting of source, reflector, and detector dimensions and relative positions. In addition, we derive simpler expressions for the two special cases, namely, the point source and the large-source small-reflector.

	abstract = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is a class of promising techniques for reducing the computational error of variational quantum algorithms. In general, the computational error reduction comes at the cost of a sampling overhead due to the variance-boosting effect caused by the channel inversion operation, which ultimately limits the applicability of QEM. Existing sampling overhead analysis of QEM typically assumes exact channel inversion, which is unrealistic in practical scenarios. In this treatise, we consider a practical channel inversion strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling, which introduces additional computational error that in turn may be eliminated at the cost of an extra sampling overhead. In particular, we show that when the computational error is small compared to the dynamic range of the error-free results, it scales with the square root of the number of gates. By contrast, the error exhibits a linear scaling with the number of gates in the absence of QEM under the same assumptions. Hence, the error scaling of QEM remains to be preferable even without the extra sampling overhead. Our analytical results are accompanied by numerical examples.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided secure wireless powered communication network (WPCN), where a transmitter first harvests energy from a power station (PS), and then uses the collected energy to transmit information to multiple internet of things (IoT) devices in the form of multicast in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. An IRS is deployed to enhance the efficiency of wireless energy transfer (WET) and secure wireless information transfer (WIT). Considering that the PS and transmitter belong to different service providers, we model this energy interaction through a Stackelberg game and propose an IRS-aided energy trading and secure communication (IRS-ETSC) scheme, in which the transmitter needs to pay an energy price as an incentive for the PS energy service. Specifically, the transmitter as the leader can control the energy price, WET time, two-stage phase shifts, and beamforming vector, while the PS as the follower can adjust the transmit power. To solve the non-convex leader game problem, we propose a two-step approach to decompose the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem can be solved independently by an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm, in which the closed-form optimal beamforming vector and energy phase shifts are alternately optimized. Then, the second subproblem is relaxed by semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and solved by an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent (BCD), where the optimal energy price, optimal WET time, and suboptimal information phase shifts can be obtained by golden section method and successive convex approximation (SCA) respectively. Both subproblems can converge to a stationary point. Numerical results show that compared with the traditional non-IRS scheme, the proposed IRS-ETSC scheme achieves utility improvement for both the PS and transmitter.}

In contrast to the prior works impractically assuming the existence of a controllable RF excitation source, our work arms the receiver of covert information with the full-duplex ability. The covert receiver can emit artificial noise (AN) with variable power to cover up the modulation action of a tag on the excitation signals while receiving the backscattered information. Specifically, we first derive the warden’s optimum power-detection threshold that minimizes the detection error probability. To against the optimal warden, we design the covert backscatter communication policy that determines the feasible region of the AN power at the covert receiver depending on the transmission power of the RF source and the reflection coefficient of the tag and guarantees the covertness constraint. We analyze the performance of the policy and provide the closed-form maximum covert rate and maximum detection error probability at the warden, revealing their tradeoff. The numerical analysis shows the increasing transmission power of the RF source and tag’s reflection coefficient would degrade the covertness of ABS when the covert receiver has to increase the AN power.}

Nevertheless, most of the TSB methods focus on the one-ring channel. In this paper, we consider the multiple scatterer clusters (MSC) channel in massive MIMO systems and propose a TSB method based on cluster group. To reduce the channel state information (CSI) feedback, for each cluster we use a cluster-group-based eigen-prebeamformer to sparsify the effective channel matrix. The DTL is also reduced by a graph-based downlink training design. We further develop a multi-user beamformer to mitigate the inter-user interference. To further reduce the DTL, two other methods are also proposed based on the vertex and edge deletion.

In this paper, coded modulation schemes, i.e., the use of higher-order constellations, is studied for generating both security against a wiretapper and reliability for the legitimate user. Specifically, a multilevel coding (MLC) scheme is considered. The influence of the constellation, in particular its cardinality and its dimensionality, on the gained security is assessed. As LSB component code, a practical secure coding scheme based on punctured LDPC codes is used. The security level for the employed LDPC code ensembles within MLC constructions is examined with an adapted density evolution technique.

Such a design allows us to subsequently compute the achievable rate for a given receive antenna size thereby providing a physical bound on the system performance that we compare to the standard size-unconstrained Shannon capacity. We also determine the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which strongly depends on the antenna size and experiences an apparent finite-size performance degradation where only a fraction of Shannon capacity can be achieved. We further determine the optimal signaling bandwidth which shows that impedance matching is essential in both narrowband and broadband scenarios. We also examine the achievable rate in presence of interference showing that the size constraint is immaterial in interference-limited scenarios. Finally, our numerical results of the derived achievable rate as function of the antenna size and the SNR reveal new insights for the physically consistent design of radio systems.}

	abstract = {We use a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to design an optimal antenna selection policy for downlink transmit beamforming at a multi-antenna base station (BS) equipped with only a limited number of RF chains. Assuming that the channel state evolves according to a finite-state Markov process and that only the channel coefficients which correspond to previously selected antennas, are available at the BS, we use the POMDP framework for antenna selection with the aim to maximize the long-term expected downlink data rate . To avoid the high computational complexity of the value iteration algorithm, we focus on the myopic policy and prove that in the case of positively correlated two-state Markov model for the channel over each antenna, the myopic policy is optimal for antenna selection for any number of RF chains . Based on this finding, for general fading channels, we propose to quantize each channel into two levels and apply the myopic policy for antenna selection. Our simulation results show that using this two-state coarse channel quantization for antenna selection results in only a small loss in performance, as compared to the antenna selection technique which uses full channel state information without quantization.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel transmission scheme, called sparse layered MIMO (SL-MIMO), that combines non-orthogonal transmission and singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding. Non-orthogonality in SL-MIMO allows re-using of the eigen-channels which improves the spectral efficiency and error rate performance of the system through enhancing the coding gain and diversity gain. We also present a low-complexity message-passing (MP) detector for the proposed SL-MIMO system which performs quite close to maximum likelihood (ML). The joint moment generating function (MGF) of the ordered eigenvalues is calculated and used to derive a closed-form upper bound on the average word error probability (AWEP) of the SL-MIMO system, and this derived expression is then used to analyze the diversity gain of the system. We use our analytical results to design sub-optimal codebooks to minimize the error rate of the SL-MIMO system. Simulation results in\n4×4\nand\n6×6\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with 4-ary, 16-ary, and 64-ary constellations show that our proposed SL-MIMO scheme outperforms competing approaches such as X- and Y-codes in terms of system error rate performance. SL-MIMO has 5.6 dB advantage compared to X-codes and 4.7 dB advantage compared to Y-codes in\n6×6\nMIMO system with a 64-ary constellation.}

	abstract = {This work is focused on the system-level performance of a broadcast network. Since all transmitters in a broadcast network transmit identical signals, received signals from multiple transmitters can be combined to improve system performance. We develop a stochastic geometry-based analytical framework to derive the coverage of a typical receiver. We show that there may exist an optimal connectivity radius that maximizes the rate coverage. Our analysis includes the fact that users may have their individual content/advertisement preferences. We assume that there are multiple classes of users with each user class preferring a particular type of content/advertisements and the users will pay the network only when they can see content aligned with their interest. The operator may choose to transmit multiple contents simultaneously to cater to more users’ interests to increase its revenue. We present revenue models to study the impact of the number of contents on the operator revenue. We consider two scenarios for users’ distribution- one where users’ interest depends on their geographical location and the other where it doesn’t. With the help of numerical results and analysis, we show the impact of various parameters including content granularity, connectivity radius, and rate threshold and present important design insights.}

Motivated by optimizing the achievable rate in compact antenna arrays, we present a system model that incorporates the effects of mutual coupling (MC) of wideband physically realizable single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. For the SIMO system setup, we extract the noise correlation matrices for two different antenna array configurations (parallel and co-linear). We optimize the inter-element spacing in each alignment while maximizing the achievable rate and fixing the transmit power. Then, we compare the two compact antenna designs to a perfectly matched single omni-directional antenna while accounting for MC. Likewise, for the MISO antenna system, we derive the optimal beamformer that maximizes the achievable rate using the same antenna configurations as the SIMO system. Then, we study the impact of MC and develop a new single-port matching technique for wideband antenna arrays. Finally, we provide reciprocity plots to compare the performance of the SIMO-MISO systems using different channel models.}

	abstract = {We study downlink channel estimation in a multi-cell Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system operating in time-division duplex. The users must know their effective channel gains to decode their received downlink data. Previous works have used the mean value as the estimate, motivated by channel hardening. However, this is associated with a performance loss in non-isotropic scattering environments. We propose two novel estimation methods that can be applied without downlink pilots. The first method is model-based and asymptotic arguments are utilized to identify a connection between the effective channel gain and the average received power during a coherence interval. The second method is data-driven and trains a neural network to identify a mapping between the available information and the effective channel gain. Both methods can be utilized for any channel distribution and precoding. For the model-aided method, we derive all expressions in closed form for the case when maximum ratio or zero-forcing precoding is used. We compare the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art using the normalized mean-squared error and spectral efficiency (SE). The results suggest that the two proposed methods provide better SE than the state-of-the-art when there is a low level of channel hardening, while the performance difference is relatively small with the uncorrelated channel model.}

To reflect the realistic maritime propagation environment, the effects of rough sea surface scattering and evaporation duct propagation are investigated in the proposed channel model. The model considers the movements of transmitter (Tx), receiver (Rx), and scatterers, and is capable of capturing the channel characteristics, including non-stationary characteristics, spatial consistency, location-dependent property, etc. Through taking the array cluster evolution into account, the proposed channel model can describe massive MIMO channels and can easily switch to conventional MIMO channel model by adjusting corresponding parameters. Based on the proposed model, key statistical properties like delay/angular/Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), space-time correlation function (STCF), stationary interval, and root mean square (RMS) Doppler/delay spreads in multi-scenarios are derived. The usefulness and accuracy of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing theoretical results, simulation results, and corresponding measurement results.}

	abstract = {Fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications confront explosive growth in mobile data demand and massive intensive user equipment (UE) connections. The optimization of base station (BS) array orientations in large-scale networks can provide high potential performance gain to meet these requirements. However, traditional schemes are highly dependent on experience and difficult in implementation due to their demand on repeated drive tests and large amounts of data samples. In this paper, via exploiting UE locations and channel direction information, we propose an intelligent network optimization framework to maximize the long-term network rate performance. For the augmentation of limited drive test data, a deep Gaussian process regression (DGPR) model is designed to construct a scenario-specific channel modeling. In addition, via a domain-knowledge driven fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), we propose a multi-branch deep neural network (DNN) to accurately map BS array orientations and concise channel measurements to the network performance. Finally, based on the scenario-specific modeling, an efficient gradient search approach is proposed to optimize BS array orientations via neural network (NN) backpropagation. Both simulations and field tests in 5G experimental networks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework, especially with limited drive test data.}

	abstract = {Achieving high channel estimation accuracy and reducing hardware cost as well as power dissipation constitute substantial challenges in the design of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To resolve these difficulties, sophisticated pilot designs have been conceived for the family of energy-efficient hybrid analog-digital (HAD) beamforming architecture relying on adaptive-resolution analog-to-digital converters (RADCs). In this paper, we jointly optimize the pilot sequences, the number of RADC quantization bits and the hybrid receiver combiner in the uplink of multiuser massive MIMO systems. We solve the associated mean square error (MSE) minimization problem of channel estimation in the context of correlated Rayleigh fading channels subject to practical constraints. The associated mixed-integer problem is quite challenging due to the nonconvex nature of the objective function and of the constraints. By relying on advanced fractional programming (FP) techniques, we first recast the original problem into a more tractable yet equivalent form, which allows the decoupling of the fractional objective function. We then conceive a pair of novel algorithms for solving the resultant problems for codebook-based and codebook-free pilot schemes, respectively. To reduce the design complexity, we also propose a simplified algorithm for the codebook-based pilot scheme. Our simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithms over the relevant state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.}

We propose a beamforming strategy based on a newly introduced transmission scheme known as rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA relies on multi-antenna rate-splitting at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, such that the intended message for a user is split into a common part and a private part and the interference is partially decoded and partially treated as noise. In this paper, we formulate the MMF problem subject to per-antenna power constraints at the satellite for the system with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We also consider the case of two-stage precoding which is assisted by on- board processing (OBP) at the satellite. Numerical results obtained through simulations for RSMA and the conventional linear precoding method are compared. When RSMA is used, MMF rate gain is promised and this gain increases when OBP is used. RSMA is proven to be promising for multigateway multibeam satellite systems whereby there are various practical challenges such as feeder link interference, CSIT uncertainty, per-antenna power constraints, uneven user distribution per beam and frame-based processing.}

A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to optimize the initial values of weights and biases of the BP neural network. For convenience, our proposed ranging model is denoted as GTBPD. A new localization algorithm is then proposed, which uses the GTBPD model and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP, an iterative nonlinear optimization algorithm), and the algorithm is denoted as GTBPD-LSQP for simplicity. Experiments were conducted in three areas of two different teaching buildings with complex environments. The performance of the proposed GTBPD-LSQP algorithm is evaluated and compared with four existing algorithms.

The original RCA-based DE (RCA-DE) technique is implemented under the assumption of binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channels (BI-AWGNCs). In BICM systems, however, M\n-ary modulation schemes are generally used, and they can be regarded as to be a parallel transmission of \\log _{2} M\nbits. Thus, \\log _{2} M\nseparate bit-level channels, which are not Gaussian equivalent, need to be considered. In order to extend the conventional RCA-DE technique to BICM systems, we first establish a model of protograph BICM ensembles. Two methods are developed based on the bit error rate (BER) and the BICM capacity in order to find a corresponding BI-AWGNC that models each of the bit-level channels. Using these methods, we implement the protograph RCA-DE technique for BICM systems and show that it achieves an accurate estimation. As a practical application of the proposed RCA-DE method, we design bit interleavers in order to achieve better BICM performance in the 3GPP New Radio (NR) LDPC coding system. Numerical results show that performance gain of up to 0.3 dB is consistently achieved over a wide range of parameter values.}

	abstract = {This paper uses the reconstruction-computation-quantization (RCQ)paradigm to decode low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. RCQ facilitates dynamic non-uniform quantization to achieve good frame error rate (FER) performance with very low message precision. For message-passing according to a flooding schedule, the RCQ parameters are designed by discrete density evolution. Simulation results on an IEEE 802.11 LDPC code show that for 4-bit messages, a flooding Min Sum RCQ decoder outperforms table-lookup approaches such as information bottleneck (IB) or Min-IB decoding, with significantly fewer parameters to be stored. Additionally, this paper introduces layer-specific RCQ, an extension of RCQ decoding for layered architectures. Layer-specific RCQ uses layer-specific message representations to achieve the best possible FER performance. For layer-specific RCQ, this paper proposes using layered discrete density evolution featuring hierarchical dynamic quantization (HDQ) to design parameters efficiently. Finally, this paper studies field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations of RCQ decoders. Simulation results for a (9472, 8192) quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC code show that a layered Min Sum RCQ decoder with 3-bit messages achieves more than a 10% reduction in LUTs and routed nets and more than a 6% decrease in register usage while maintaining comparable decoding performance, compared to a 5-bit offset Min Sum decoder.}

	abstract = {Despite the great promises that the resistive random access memory (ReRAM) has shown as the next generation of non-volatile memory technology, its crossbar array structure leads to a severe sneak path interference to the signal read back from the memory cell. In this paper, we first propose a novel belief propagation (BP) based detector for the sneak path interference in ReRAM. Based on the conditions for a sneak path to occur and the dependence of the states of the memory cells that are involved in the sneak path, a Tanner graph for the ReRAM channel is constructed, inside which specific messages are updated iteratively to get a better estimation of the sneak path affected cells. We further combine the graph of the designed BP detector with that of the BP decoder of the polar codes to form a joint detector and decoder. Tailored for the joint detector and decoder over the ReRAM channel, effective polar codes are constructed using the genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the BP detector can effectively detect the cells affected by the sneak path, and the proposed polar codes and the joint detector and decoder can significantly improve the error rate performance of ReRAM.}

We analyze performance of such a system under the maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver and when the set of activation patterns follows a multi-level code generated from asymptotically optimal alphabets. An asymptotic analysis of the pair-wise error probability (PEP) shows that the system can exploit a diversity order that is determined by the distance of the worst codeword pair in the l_{1}\nmetric, known as the Manhattan norm. We then explore the rate-diversity tradeoff for the developed non-coherent IM system as a function of the code length. Specifically, Gilbert-style bounds on the data rates for systems based on binary and ternary codes are obtained that can ensure a given diversity order. We approach the problem of packing in the l_{1}\nmetric by partitioning codes into permutation modulation codes (PMCs) and obtaining Gilbert-style bounds on PMCs. Several achievable rates for non-coherent binary and ternary IM systems, as well as a tradeoff between the information rate and codeword error probability (CEP) are also derived. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate the theoretical analysis.}

	abstract = {A capacity result involves two parts: achievability and converse. The achievability proof is usually non-constructive and only the existence of capacity-achieving codes is shown invoking probabilistic techniques. Recently, capacity-achieving codes have been found for several channels demonstrating that such codes can actually be constructed algorithmically. To this end, each construction is designed for a pre-specified channel so that the corresponding algorithm is specifically tailored to it. This paper addresses the general question of whether or not it is possible to find algorithms that can construct capacity-achieving codes for a whole class of channels. To do so, the concept of Turing machines is used which provides the fundamental performance limits of digital computers and therewith fully specifies which tasks are algorithmically feasible in principle. It is shown that there exists no Turing machine that is able to construct capacity-achieving codes for a whole class of channels, where the channel realization from this class is given as an input to the Turing machine. It is further shown that such an algorithmic construction remains impossible when the optimality condition is dropped and codes only need to achieve a fraction of the capacity. Finally, implications on channel-aware transmission, link adaptation, and cross-layer optimization are discussed.}

	abstract = {Uncoordinated multiple access has been proposed as a modern technique to provide massive connectivity. Among many proposals, irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) was shown to achieve a close-to-optimum throughput by irregular packet repetition and successive interference cancellation (SIC). However, most of the previous works are based on certain ideal assumptions. In this paper, we tackle one of such ideal assumptions, where a decoded packet can always be used to cancel out all its replicas transmitted in other slots. In reality, the random nature of IRSA results in a large dynamic range of the received power that cannot be recovered under a practical quantizer. A SIC limit that dictates the number of recoverable collided packets at a slot should exist. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel protocol, named IRSA with frame partitioning (IRSA-FP), which partitions a frame into several subframes. A feedback mechanism is enforced to inform those users, whose packets have been successfully decoded, to cease their transmissions. We then propose a novel density-evolution-type analysis for IRSA-FP. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed IRSA-FP can be accurately predicted by our analysis and the proposed IRSA-FP outperforms the traditional IRSA when practical SIC limit is introduced.}

When\nH\nH\nH\nhas two or less distinct eigenvalues and the remaining ones are repetitive, we derive the probability distribution function (pdf) of the signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR) of the ZF receiver. A closed form BER expression is then derived by averaging the conditional BER over the SINR pdf. When\nH\nH\nH\nhas\nn\ndistinct eigenvalues, we use numerical integration to derive a generalized expression for the SINR pdf. We show that this pdf can be tightly approximated by the Gamma pdf, and then use it to derive the BER expression. The derived OTFS ZF BER expression therefore, unlike the existing ones in the literature, does not require averaging over multiple channel realizations. We show, for different modulation schemes and OTFS system parameters, that the BER calculated using the derived expressions closely matches the one calculated numerically.}

The interference at the PRs caused by the reception of IRS-reflected signals sent by the primary transmitter is taken into account. A coordinated channel state information (CSI) acquisition protocol is proposed. Next, assuming availability at the ST of perfect CSI for all direct and IRS-cascaded transmitter–receiver channels, two penalty-based iterative algorithms are developed: an alternating minimization algorithm that involves semi-definite relaxation in JTBPS design and successive convex approximation in RB optimization, and a block coordinate descent algorithm that employs the Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm in RB updates. Finally, an outage-constrained robust design under imperfect CSI is devised. Numerical simulations highlight the performance gains of the proposed strategies over benchmarks, corroborate the benefits of using an IRS, and provide valuable insights.}

Based on channel reciprocity, our proposed CIPC schemes guarantee the power of received signal that is used to decode the information to be a constant value\nQ\n, by varying the transmit signal and power, which relaxes the assumption of knowing channel state information (CSI) at the user. Thus, the CIPC schemes eliminate the overhead of CSI feedback, reduce communication latency, and explore the benefits of multiple antennas to significantly improve transmission reliability. We derive analytical expressions for the packet loss probability of the proposed CIPC schemes, based on which we determine a closed interval and a convex set for optimizing\nQ\nin CIPC with imperfect and perfect channel reciprocity, respectively. Our results show that CIPC is an effective means to achieve one-way URLLC. The tradeoff among reliability, latency, and required resources (e.g., transmit antennas) is further revealed, which provides novel principles for designing one-way URLLC systems.}

We derive the closed-form expression of the average AoI of each stream in a heterogeneous case, where the distributions of service time are different for streams. To obtain more insights, we apply the results in a homogeneous system, where the service time distributions are identical, and find that preemption of packets would not always lead to the reduction of AoI, especially when the variance coefficient of the service time is small. We further optimize the generation rate to minimize the sum of average AoI. The results in heterogeneous cases show that given the same average service time for all streams, a higher generation rate should be allocated to the stream with a small service time variance. For the homogeneous cases with different AoI urgency weights for each stream, a higher generation rate should be reserved for the stream with more urgent AoI requirements for timeliness improvement. Besides, a lower bound on sum of average AoI is also provided, which only depends on the service rate and the number of data streams in homogeneous systems. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis.}

Due to the asymmetries, the capacity achieving input or a priori probability distributions deviate from uniformity. To perform the investigation, an analytical expression for the mutual information, in terms of an integral over a single variable, between the input (transmitted symbol) and the output (received signal vector comprising signals at receive antennas), is derived. For two-sided ASK, 8-QAM with cross constellation, and 16-QAM, analytical closed form expressions for the high and low signal-to-noise (SNR) approximations, respectively, of the capacity achieving input probability distribution, the capacity, and the relative gain in mutual information (between using the uniform and the capacity achieving input probability distributions) are obtained. Numerical results show that at low SNRs, the use of the capacity achieving nonuniform input probability distribution offers significant advantage over the use of the uniform input probability distribution, while at high SNRs, this advantage is significant only for configurations with one receive antenna. Furthermore, the high and low SNR approximations are shown to be reasonably accurate.}

However, due to the limitation of their on- board power and flight time, it is challenging to obtain an optimal resource allocation scheme for the UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we design a new UAV-assisted IoT system relying on the shortest flight path of the UAVs while maximising the amount of data collected from IoT devices. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based technique is conceived for finding the optimal trajectory and throughput in a specific coverage area. After training, the UAV has the ability to autonomously collect all the data from user nodes at a significant total sum-rate improvement while minimising the associated resources used. Numerical results are provided to highlight how our techniques strike a balance between the throughput attained, trajectory, and the time spent. More explicitly, we characterise the attainable performance in terms of the UAV trajectory, the expected reward and the total sum-rate.}

	abstract = {Secure model aggregation across many users is a key component of federated learning systems. The state-of-the-art protocols for secure model aggregation, which are based on additive masking, require all users to quantize their model updates to the same level of quantization. This severely degrades their performance due to lack of adaptation to available communication resources, e.g., bandwidth, at different users. As the main contribution of our paper, we propose HeteroSAg , a scheme that allows secure model aggregation while using heterogeneous quantization. HeteroSAg enables the edge users to adjust their quantization proportional to their available communication resources, which can provide a substantially better trade-off between the accuracy of training and the communication time. Our proposed scheme is based on a grouping strategy by partitioning the network into groups, and partitioning the local model updates of users into segments. Instead of applying aggregation protocol to the entire local model update vector, it is applied on segments with specific coordination between users. We further demonstrate how HeteroSAg can enable Byzantine robustness while achieving secure aggregation simultaneously. Finally, we prove the convergence guarantees of HeteroSAg under heterogeneous quantization in the non-Byzantine scenario.}

	abstract = {The renewable energy source (RES)-powered small cell base station (SBS) is a promising technology for the next-generation networks because RESs provide sustainable energy without being depleted. In RES-assisted networks, joint optimization of user association (UA) and power control (PC) is required to enhance the sum-rate performance by reducing inter-cell interference between SBSs. This paper tackles the UA and PC optimization for the sum-rate maximization under quality-of-service (QoS) and backhaul constraints. We formulate the problem as mixed-integer non-linear programming, in which UA and PC variables of different time slots are tightly coupled due to the RES energy dynamics model. Hence, designing a dynamic policy-based UA and PC with consideration of the future environments such as the quantity of channel gain and energy harvesting remains a challenge. First, we propose a deep unsupervised learning (DUL)-based UA scheme for a fixed PC variable. To lower the computational complexity and accelerate the convergence of the proposed learning-based optimization, we relax the UA variable, which originally has an extremely high dimension, into a low-dimensional continuous variable inspired by the Lagrangian method. Next, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based PC scheme, in which the stringent QoS and backhaul constraints are considered penalty terms on the reward design. The proposed DRL-based PC scheme facilitates dynamic PC inferring the relationship between the future environment and current PC. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances the sum-rate by 10%, accommodates 3.3 percent point (%p) more QoS-qualified users, and reduces the computation time by 20 times compared to the conventional optimization-based method.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) downlink communication system where hybrid analog-digital beamforming is employed at the base station (BS). We formulate a power minimization problem by jointly optimizing hybrid beamforming at the BS and the response matrix at the RIS, under the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at all users. The problem is highly challenging to solve due to the non-convex SINR constraints as well as the unit-modulus phase shift constraints for both the RIS reflection coefficients and the analog beamformer. A two-layer penalty-based algorithm is proposed to decouple variables in SINR constraints, and manifold optimization is adopted to handle the non-convex unit-modulus constraints. We also propose a low-complexity sequential optimization method, which optimizes the RIS reflection coefficients, the analog beamformer, and the digital beamformer sequentially without iteration. Furthermore, the relationship between the power minimization problem and the max-min fairness (MMF) problem is discussed. Simulation results show that the proposed penalty-based algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm. Results also demonstrate that the RIS plays an important role in the power reduction.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the outage performance of an uplink (UL) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network (HSTRN), in which two users communicate with the satellite through a decode-and-forward (DF) relay due to the lack of direct link. To provide a comprehensive yet hitherto unexplored outage analysis framework, we consider a more generalized channel model, i.e., the terrestrial and satellite links, respectively, undergo $\\alpha -\\mu $ and $\\kappa -\\mu $ shadowed fadings. Under fixed power allocation (FPA) for both multiple access phase and relaying phase, we firstly study three successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding schemes, of which the first two are refined from existing schemes, while the third one, named as extended SIC (ESIC) , is proposed in this paper to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) decoding criterion, which is shown to offer better performances for both users as compared to the former two SIC schemes. We also propose a novel dynamic power allocation (DPA) scheme for the multiple access phase, termed as enhanced DPA (EDPA) , to overcome both users’ error floor (EF) issue yet provide better user fairness than the conventional DPA in the literature. We then analyze the exact and asymptotic outage performance for three SIC and the EDPA schemes under the generalized channel setting. It is shown that both the proposed ESIC and EDPA can circumvent the EF issue and moreover, each has its own advantage in terms of the diversity order (DO). Our results also reveal that there exists a trade-off between ESIC and EDPA , since the former requires a premise on users’ targets rates to overcome the EF and once this premise is satisfied, no DO degradation will occur, while the latter does not entail such a premise but may face potential DO degradation. Finally, we present numerical results to verify the theoretical analysis, manifest the impacts of key parameters on the system performance, and demonstrate the advantages of our proposed network over other benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Full-duplex (FD) mode has great potential in improving the spectral efficiency. Mitigating the effect of self-interference becomes one key for performance enhancement of FD system. This work proposes a novel hybrid duplex scheme where the relay receives information for a fraction of time and simultaneously transmits and receives information for the rest, following a duty cycle. First, we formulate the achievable rate maximization of the proposed scheme as a joint FD duty cycle and source power allocation optimization problem. The optimal FD duty cycle, the optimal source power allocation, and the maximal achievable rate are explicitly given for some cases and characterized in detail for other cases. Then, the proposed scheme is applied to two-hop relaying systems. Specifically, the optimal source power allocation is proved to be a water-filling solution over the FD phase and the receives-only phase on the source-relay link. By dividing the system as low-, medium-, and high-source power cases, the optimal FD duty cycle and the maximal achievable rate are obtained in (approximate) closed-form case-by-case, where the source power thresholds among cases are clearly expressed. Numerical results validate that the proposed hybrid duplex scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes and can improve the achievable rate significantly.}

	abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising non-orthogonal multiple access technique to support massive connectivity for future wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks. As the main feature of SCMA, modulation and spread spectrum is embedded into codebook mapping, offering significant codebook shaping gains to mitigate inter-cell interference. Maximizing the constellation-constrained average mutual information (AMI) is an effective way for SCMA codebook optimization. However, deriving a closed-form expression of the AMI is analytically intractable, while it is computationally costly to estimate the AMI by numerical methods. To address this challenge, this paper first derives a lower bound of the AMI with a closed-form expression. On this basis, we propose a novel codebook optimization method referred to as joint bare bones particle swarm optimization (JBBPSO) through maximizing the AMI lower bound. The proposed low-complexity method jointly optimizes the mother codebook including basic constellation and other non-zero-dimensional constellations, and the rotation angles of multiple users. Numerical results show that our proposed optimized codebooks outperform the state-of-the-art SCMA codebooks in terms of both the lower bound and the error performance.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the unsourced random access (URA) scheme to accommodate numerous machine-type users communicating to a base station equipped with multiple antennas. Existing works adopt a slotted transmission strategy to reduce system complexity; they operate under the framework of coupled compressed sensing (CCS) which concatenates an outer tree code to an inner compressed sensing code for slot-wise message stitching. We suggest that by exploiting the MIMO channel information in the angular domain, redundancies required by the tree encoder/decoder in CCS can be removed to improve spectral efficiency, thereby an uncoupled transmission protocol is devised. To perform activity detection and channel estimation, we propose an expectation-maximization-aided generalized approximate message passing algorithm with a Markov random field support structure, which captures the inherent clustered sparsity structure of the angular domain channel. Then, message reconstruction in the form of a clustering decoder is performed by recognizing slot-distributed channels of each active user based on similarity. We put forward the slot-balanced\nK\n-means algorithm as the kernel of the clustering decoder, resolving constraints and collisions specific to the application scene. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed scheme achieves a better error performance at high spectral efficiency compared to the CCS-based URA schemes.}

Inspired by this, we propose a Parallel Optimal Task Allocation Mechanism (POTAM) framework for MEC, which includes Device to Device (D2D)-enabled computing, MBS computing and Edge Computation Resource Distribution (ECRD) computing. In POTAM, we exploit a parallel multi-block Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based method to model both requirements of delay and energy consumptions, which formulates the task allocation under these requirements as a nonlinear 0–1 integer programming problem. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient combination of conjugate gradient, Newton and linear search techniques based algorithm with Logarithmic Smoothing and Cyclic Block coordinate Gradient Projection (CBGP) methods, which can guarantee convergence and reduce computational complexity with a good scalability. In order to allocate task cooperatively, an optimal approach is proposed, ECRD-A, which is used to find the shortest path among each node. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the POTAM and it can effectively reduce delay and energy consumption for a large-scale MEC system.}

Via noticing the negligible retrieving latency and the potential joint transmission (JT) gain of sub-6G BSs, we propose a novel cache-enabled user association scheme for hybrid HCNets with limited local storage, in which partial sub-6G local storage caches contents with relatively low popularity for higher overall content diversity. To sufficiently exploit the large bandwidth of mmWave BSs, they are endowed with higher association priority. Then, the success probability and meta distribution of achievable rate are studied for the proposed scheme, respectively. We further provide the optimization of caching parameters and the condition for superior performance over the MPC-based scheme. Analytical and numerical results show that the network performance can be improved for larger sub-6G BS cooperation size and the array size at mmWave BSs, while the mmWave BS density has two adverse effect for low-to-medium and high rate threshold. For the proposed scheme, the content diversity in combination with JT gain benefits the success probability. And its performance advantage increases for larger local storage and/or higher association probability with mmWave BSs.}

	abstract = {Wireless networks in next generation will provide users ubiquitous computing services with low delay by devices at the network edge, namely mobile edge computing (MEC). The intensive computation tasks can be partially offloaded to the MEC server via the wireless link and then processed through the MEC computation resources to cater for the delay demand. A parallel computation process is formed in the MEC network consists of local computation at MEC users (MUs) and MEC computation at MEC servers. However, the fluctuating wireless channel environment, changeable spatial distribution of MUs and the randomness of MEC servers’ locations make it hard to characterize and guarantee the end-to-end quality of service requirements. In this work, we are devoted to analyze and optimize the overall delay bound for MEC networks under two orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) strategies via stochastic network calculus (SNC). Specifically, Poisson cluster process is utilized to capture the randomness of MEC servers’ and users’ spatial locations and to derive the Laplace transform of interference suffered by an MU of interest. The upper bounds for the delay violation probability of two OFDMA strategies are established by exploiting SNC with the Mellin transform of signal-to-interference ratio. Furthermore, we propose an optimal task offloading scheme by minimizing the overall delay, which balances the local computation delay and MEC delay.}

	abstract = {The integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) into an ultra-dense network (UDN) can provide ubiquitous task offloading services to computation-demanding users leveraging densely deployed micro base stations. The conventional multi-user task offloading strategies are performed centrally, where a central node makes global task offloading decisions on server selection and resource allocation. In practice, the deployment becomes prohibitively complex with the increasing number of users as it involves high communication overhead and complex global optimization operations. In this paper, we develop a novel decentralized task offloading strategy in UDN, enabling users to independently make local task offloading decisions. We formulate the associated optimization problem to minimize the long-term average task delay among all users. On this basis, we develop a novel calibrated contextual bandit learning (CCBL) algorithm, where users can learn the computational delay functions of micro base stations and predict the task offloading decisions of other users in a decentralized manner. The convergence of the proposed CCBL algorithm is verified via the approachability theory. Moreover, we transfer the target of calibrated learning from all micro base stations to a single user and propose a user-oriented CCBL algorithm to further decrease the computational complexity and increase the convergence rate. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing decentralized algorithms and approaches the centralized one.}

We investigate the caching placement and content delivery in cache-enabling cellular networks. To cope with the time-varying content popularity and user location in practical scenarios, we formulate a long-term joint dynamic optimization problem of caching placement and user association for minimizing the content delivery delay which considers both content transmission delay and content update delay. To solve this challenging problem, we decompose the optimization problem into two sub-problems, the user association sub-problem in a short time scale and the caching placement in a long time scale. Specifically, we propose a low complexity user association algorithm for a given caching placement in the short time scale. Then we develop a deep deterministic policy gradient based caching placement algorithm which involves the short time-scale user association decisions in the long time scale. Finally, we propose a joint user association and caching placement algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution for the proposed problem. We illustrate the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm by simulation results. Simulation results show that compared with the benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces the long-term content delivery delay in dynamic networks effectively.}

Using the derived statistical results, we present exact expressions of outage probability, average bit-error-rate (BER), ergodic capacity, and moments of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both DL-FSO and RISE-FSO systems. We also develop an asymptotic analysis of the outage probability and average BER and derive the diversity order of the considered systems. We validate the analytical expressions using Monte-Carlo simulations and demonstrate the performance scaling of the FSO system with the number of RIS elements for various turbulence channels, detection techniques, and weather conditions.}

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring the application of single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) in optical wireless communication (OWC). As a photon counting detector, SPAD can provide much higher sensitivity compared to the other commonly used photodetectors. However, SPAD-based receivers suffer from significant dead-time-induced non-linear distortion and signal dependent noise. In this work, we propose a novel SPAD-based OWC system in which the non-linear distortion caused by dead time can be successfully eliminated by the pre-distortion of the signal at the transmitter. In addition, another system with joint pre-distortion and noise normalization functionality is proposed. Thanks to the additional noise normalization process, for the transformed signal at the receiver, the originally signal dependent noise becomes signal independent so that the conventional signal detection techniques designed for AWGN channels can be employed to decode the signal. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SPAD-based systems compared to the existing systems in terms of BER performance and achievable data rate.}

Closed-form expressions of the achievable secrecy rate relied on the additive quantization noise model are derived. Based on these analytical results, we quantify the impacts of key system parameters, such as the antenna array number, DAC resolution, Rician \\mathcal K\n-factor, and balance factor between data and artificial noise power on secrecy enhancement. Several interesting insights are attained by assuming that Eve can or cannot perfectly remove inter-mobile-terminal interference. Moreover, we also propose a power control algorithm that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate, which can be represented as a series of second-order-cone programs for which efficient solvers exist. All the theoretical analyses and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are corroborated by simulation experiments.}

Under this framework, we first model the aggregate interference from the sporadic backscatter transmissions and derive the covert outage probability and the transmission success probability to capture the covertness and reliability. Then, we formulate a transmit power optimization problem to maximize the covert throughput subject to certain covertness and reliability requirements and derive a closed-form approximation of the maximum covert throughput. Particularly, we investigate the worst-case scenario of covert communication in which warden always uses the optimal detection thresholds. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that covert communication with the help of uninformed backscatters that are not coordinated with Alice in the hybrid network is feasible. Results also provide design guidelines for the optimal choice of interference parameters, which is capable of striking a balance between covertness and reliability.}

	abstract = {In this work, novel physical layer security (PLS) schemes are proposed for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to secure both data and pilots in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The majority of previous studies focus on only securing the data without considering the security of the pilots used for channel estimation. However, the leakage of channel state information (CSI) from a legitimate node to an eavesdropper allows the latter to acquire knowledge about the channel of the legitimate nodes. To this end, we propose adaptive and flexible PLS algorithms which can 1) secure data, 2) secure pilots, and 3) jointly secure both data and pilots. Particularly, minimum-phase all-pass channel decomposition is exploited, where the proposed algorithms use the all-pass component to provide security without harming the performance of the legitimate user. In the analysis for data security, we evaluate the secrecy under correlated and uncorrelated eavesdropping channels via closed-form bit error rate (BER) formulas. For pilot security, we analyze the estimated channel’s normalized mean squared error (NMSE) performance. The simulation results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the communication secrecy of the overall system.}

Each SU has a computation task to complete within a time deadline and can completely or partially offload the task to SES, while the monitor can either jam or assist the suspicious communications during task uploading and result downloading. With the heterogeneous offloading model adopted by the SUs, the problem of optimizing the monitor mode and transmit power to maximize the average ratio of successfully eavesdropped tasks, subject to the monitor transmit power constraint and the task completion time deadline constraint is investigated. The problem is solved via exploring the particular problem structure and adopting the sum-of-ratios optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms, especially for the SUs with partial offloading. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm is of low-complexity and achieves almost the same performance as the high-complexity optimal algorithm. Besides, compared to the SUs with binary offloading, the eavesdropping performance for the SUs with partial offloading is shown to be much better.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is promising to meet the high rate requirements for future 6G. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. Existing channel estimation algorithms with low pilot overhead heavily rely on the channel sparsity in the angular domain, which is achieved by the classical far-field planar-wavefront assumption. However, due to the non-negligible near-field spherical-wavefront property in XL-MIMO, this channel sparsity in the angular domain is not achievable. Therefore, existing far-field channel estimation schemes will suffer from severe performance loss. To address this problem, in this paper, we study the near-field channel estimation by exploiting the polar-domain sparsity. Specifically, unlike the classical angular-domain representation that only considers the angular information, we propose a polar-domain representation, which simultaneously accounts for both the angular and distance information. In this way, the near-field channel also exhibits sparsity in the polar domain, based on which, we propose on-grid and off-grid near-field XL-MIMO channel estimation schemes. Firstly, an on-grid polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (P-SOMP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently estimate the near-field channel. Furthermore, an off-grid polar-domain simultaneous iterative gridless weighted (P-SIGW) algorithm is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of our schemes.}

	abstract = {Nonlinear self-interference (SI) cancellation is crucial for eliminating the impact of the transmitter-side nonlinearity on the comprehensive SI cancellation performance in full-duplex radios. However, in the propagation environment with rich reflection paths of signals, the number of the delayed taps required for time-domain nonlinear SI cancellation booms exponentially with the increase of the multi-path number, leading to unacceptable complexity. In this paper, a novel frequency-domain nonlinear SI canceller based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated full-duplex systems subjected to both transmitter nonlinearity and receiver nonlinearity. The proposed frequency-domain nonlinear SIC (FD-NSIC) cancels nonlinear components one by one via separately estimating the channel frequency response suffered by each order nonlinear component, which significantly relaxes the computational cost. Besides, to avoid the influence of the strong correlation between nonlinear components, orthogonalization is operated before SIC to white basis functions, which accelerates the convergence speed of the proposed FD-NSIC. Simulations are explicitly performed, showing that compared with the conventional frequency-domain nonlinear canceller based on recursive least squares (RLS) channel estimation, the proposed FD-NSIC is capable of canceling the SI to the noise floor with only 52% computational cost under 50 dB interference-to-noise ratio.}

	abstract = {Hovering inaccuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) degrades the performance of UAV-aided radio frequency energy transfer (RFET). Such inaccuracy arises due to positioning error and rotational motion of UAV, which lead to localization mismatch (LM) and orientation mismatch (OM). In this paper, antenna array beam steering based UAV hovering inaccuracy mitigation strategy is presented. The antenna beam does not accurately point towards the field sensor node due to rotational motion of the UAV along with pitch, roll, and yaw, which leads to deviation in the elevation angle. An analytical framework is developed to model this deviation, and its variation is estimated using the data collected through an experimental setup. Closed-form expressions of received power at the field node are obtained for the four cases arising from LM and OM. An optimization problem to estimate the optimal system parameters (transmit power, UAV hovering altitude, and antenna steering parameter) is formulated. The problem is proven to be nonconvex. Therefore, an algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly mitigates the hovering inaccuracy; compared to reported state-of-the-art the same performance can be achieved with substantially less transmit power.}

Based on the characteristics of the BPP, we analyze the distance distributions and the distribution cases for the serving satellite. We analytically derive the exact outage probability, and its approximated expression is obtained using the Poisson limit theorem. With these derived expressions, the system throughput maximization problem is formulated under the satellite-visibility and outage constraints. To solve this problem, we reformulate it with bounded feasible sets and propose an iterative algorithm to obtain near-optimal solutions. Simulation results perfectly match the derived exact expressions for the outage probability and system throughput. The analytical results of the approximated expressions are fairly close to those of the exact ones. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm for the throughput maximization is very close to the optimal performance obtained by a two-dimensional exhaustive search.}

We assume, unlike the existing CF mMIMO literature, hardware-impaired UAVs and GUEs, which observe a mixture of spatially-correlated Rician- and Rayleigh-faded channels while communicating with hardware-impaired APs. We derive a closed-form downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expression by using practical models for the channel mixture, and by considering channel estimation errors. We propose a novel block quadratic transformation (block-QT) technique to optimize non-convex network-centric global energy efficiency (GEE) by appropriately modeling circuit, UAV propulsion and fronthaul powers. The novel block-QT approach combines block optimization and quadratic transformation technique to decompose GEE optimization into simpler convex sub-problems. We numerically show that i) it is better to operate a UAV at a larger height when it has severe hardware impairments; and ii) when UAVs operate at a lower height, they do not significantly affect the SE of GUEs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the performance of an RIS-aided wireless communication system subject to outdated channel state information that may operate in both the near- and far-field regions. In particular, we take two RIS deployment strategies into consideration: (i) the centralized deployment, where all the reflecting elements are installed on a single RIS and (ii) the distributed deployment, where the same number of reflecting elements are placed on multiple RISs. For both deployment strategies, we derive accurate closed-form approximations for the ergodic capacity, and we introduce tight upper and lower bounds for the ergodic capacity to obtain useful design insights. From this analysis, we unveil that an increase of the transmit power, the Rician-\nK\nfactor, the accuracy of the channel state information and the number of reflecting elements help improve the system performance. Moreover, we prove that the centralized RIS-aided deployment may achieve a higher ergodic capacity as compared with the distributed RIS-aided deployment when the RIS is located near the base station or near the user. In different setups, on the other hand, we prove that the distributed deployment outperforms the centralized deployment. Finally, the analytical results are verified by using Monte Carlo simulations.}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly investigate joint UL-DL optimization for UAV assisted systems under heterogeneous requirements. A hybrid-mode multiple access (HMMA) scheme is proposed toward heterogeneous traffic, where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) targets high average data rate, while orthogonal multiple access (OMA) aims to meet users’ instantaneous rate demands by compensating for their rates. HMMA enables a higher degree of freedom in multiple access and achieves a superior minimum average rate among users than the UAV assisted NOMA or OMA schemes. Under HMMA, a joint UL-DL resource allocation algorithm is proposed with a closed-form optimal solution for UL/DL power allocation to achieve quasi-balanced average rates for UL and DL. Furthermore, considering the error propagation in successive interference cancellation (SIC) of NOMA, an enhanced-HMMA scheme is proposed, which demonstrates high robustness against SIC error and a higher minimum average rate than the HMMA scheme.}

These studies either assume the number of users\nM\nis less than the number of RF units\nN\nRF\nor schedule the users in time domain by dedicating one RF unit to each user if\nM>\nN\nRF\n. It is expected that serving multiple users over OFDMA in each analog beam will offer better utilization of the wideband channel. To this end, for the scenario with\nM≫\nN\nRF\nwe propose a sectored-cell model that is supported by multi-RF chains over the wideband mmWave channel, with each beam serving multiple users within a sector and the sectors being scheduled in round-robin fashion. We also propose a variable time frame structure that conducts sector-wise initial access, with simultaneous access to all users within a sector. It provides improved spectrum efficiency and decreased initial access delay as compared to the initial access using exhaustive beam search method. We then jointly estimate the optimum beamwidth and optimum\nN\nRF\nthat offer maximum average long-run user rate. Further, we introduce a reduced-complexity sector sojourn time optimization for non-homogeneously distributed users, that improves fairness of long-run user rates leveraging the variable time frame structure. The numerical results show that, while a high value of\nN\nRF\ncauses more interference to peak data rate, the average long-run user rate improves. Additionally, using a very narrow beam is also not optimal for providing maximum rate support.

The proposed framework exploits stochastic geometry tools to associate the Pcov and the ASE to the end device (ED) transmit power and to the ED density. The analysis reveals the trends of the Pcov and of the ASE curves, with respect to both of the two parameters, while the robustness of the framework holds even at the asymptotic cases. Building upon the derived framework, the analysis demonstrates that no joint global optimum exists that jointly maximizes the Pcov over both parameters, suggesting that the optimization of the Pcov must be performed separately, for the two key network parameters considered. As opposed to that, the analysis demonstrates that a set of global optima exists that jointly maximize the ASE over both parameters, and these global maxima are subsequently derived in closed form. Thus, the derived framework fully characterizes the performance of LoRa networks, while defining in closed form the optimal points of operation that can be proven of significant value, for the transceiver and network design, of practical LoRa networks.}

	abstract = {Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) does not support data transmission during random access (RA) procedures, which results in unnecessary control signalling overhead and power consumption, especially for small data transmission (SDT). Motivated by this, 3GPP has proposed 4/2-step SDT RA schemes based on the existing grant-based (4-step) and grant-free (2-step) RA schemes, with the aim to enable data transmission during RA procedures in Radio Resource Control (RRC) Inactive state. To compare the 4/2-step SDT RA schemes with the benchmark 4/2-step RA schemes, we provide a spatio-temporal analytical framework to evaluate the RA schemes, which jointly models the preamble detection, Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) decoding, and data transmission procedures. Based on this analytical model, we derive the analytical expressions for the overall packet transmission success probability and average throughput in each RACH attempt. We also derive the average energy consumption in each RACH attempt. Our results show that 2-step SDT RA scheme provides the highest overall packet transmission success probability, and the lowest average energy consumption, but the performance gain decreases with the increase of device intensity.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to extend the wireless signal coverage and support the high performance communication. By intelligently adjusting the reflection coefficients of a large number of passive reflecting elements, the IRS can modify the wireless propagation environment in favour of signal transmission. Different from most of the prior works which did not consider any cooperation between IRSs, in this work we propose and study a cooperative double-IRS aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system under the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation channels. We investigate the capacity maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the passive beamforming matrices of the two cooperative IRSs. Although the above problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we transform and simplify the original problem by exploiting a tractable characterization of the LoS channels. Then we develop a novel low-complexity algorithm whose complexity is independent of the number of IRS elements. Moreover, we analyze the capacity scaling orders of the double-IRS aided MIMO system with respect to an asymptotically large number of IRS elements or transmit power, which significantly outperform those of the conventional single-IRS aided MIMO system, thanks to the cooperative power gain brought by the double-reflection link and the spatial multiplexing gain harvested from the two single-reflection links. Extensive numerical results are provided to show that by exploiting the LoS channel properties, our proposed algorithm can achieve a desirable performance with low computational time. Also, our capacity scaling analysis is validated, and the double-IRS system is shown to achieve a much higher rate than its single-IRS counterpart as long as the number of IRS elements or the transmit power is not small.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN) architecture is proposed for power-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) smart devices, where IRS is exploited to improve the performance of WPCN under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We formulate a hybrid access point (HAP) transmit energy minimization problem by jointly optimizing time allocation, HAP energy beamforming, receiving beamforming, user transmit power allocation, IRS energy reflection coefficient and information reflection coefficient under the imperfect CSI and non-linear energy harvesting model. On account of the high coupling of optimization variables, the formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to solve directly. To address the above-mentioned challenging problem, alternating optimization (AO) technique is applied to decouple the optimization variables to solve the problem. Specifically, through AO, time allocation, HAP energy beamforming, receiving beamforming, user transmit power allocation, IRS energy reflection coefficient and information reflection coefficient are divided into three sub-problems to be solved alternately. The difference-of-convex (DC) programming is used to solve the non-convex rank-one constraint in solving IRS energy reflection coefficient and information reflection coefficient. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed optimization algorithm in decreasing HAP transmit energy compared with other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been considered as a promising paradigm for enabling distributed training/learning in many machine-learning services without revealing users’ local data. Driven by the growing interests in exploiting FL in wireless networks, this paper studies the Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) assisted FL in which a group of end-devices (EDs) form a NOMA cluster to send their locally trained models to the cellular base station (BS) for model aggregation. In particular, we consider that the BS adopts wireless power transfer (WPT) to power the EDs (for their data transmission and local training) in each round of FL iteration, and formulate a joint optimization of the BS’s WPT for different EDs, the EDs’ NOMA-transmission for sending the local models to the BS, the BS’s broadcasting of the aggregated model to all EDs, the processing-rates of the BS and EDs, as well as the training-accuracy of the FL, with the objective of minimizing the system-wise cost accounting for the total energy consumption as well as the FL convergence latency. In spite of the strict non-convexity of the joint optimization problem, we analytically characterize the BS’s and all EDs’ optimal processing-rates, based on which we propose a layered algorithm for finding the optimal solutions for the joint optimization problem via exploiting monotonic optimization. Numerical results validate that our algorithm can achieve the optimal solution as LINGO’s global-solver (i.e., a commercial optimization package) while significantly reducing the computation-time. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that our NOMA assisted FL can reduce the system cost compared to the benchmark FL scheme with the fixed local training-accuracy by more than 70% and the conventional frequency division multiple access (FDMA) based FL by 78%.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we conceive the design of dynamic wireless networks assisted by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), where the connection states between users and IRSs are capable of being updated timely. Taking into account the time-varying states of the system, we further construct a long-term dynamic process. Our goal is to maximize the time average sum-rate of the dynamic system under the time average rate and power constraints of users, via jointly optimizing the power allocation at users and the reflecting coefficients at IRSs. With the aid of Lyapunov concept-based drift-plus-penalty (DPP) algorithm, the long-term optimization problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon time-average one. Subsequently, the fractional programming method based on Lagrangian dual transform is applied to optimize power allocation and reflecting coefficients in an iterative manner, and the closed-form solutions of power and reflecting coefficients can be obtained at each iteration. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Further performance comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm can maintain a balance between supply and demand for resource allocation and improve the fairness of users.}

In this context, any receiver (Rx) placed inside it can establish a strong communication link. Since the Rx location is not always known, it is desirable to investigate its random position effect to describe the link performance in a reliable manner. As in most cases, Rxs lie far away from the apex where the Tx is placed, we investigate the random location problem inside a truncated conic shape where the cone arises as a limiting case. To this end, we deduce a set of statistical metrics, including the random distance from the apex to a random point position. As an application, we focus on the outage performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications scenario susceptible to Nakagami-\nm\nfading and derive novel closed-form expressions for the composite model.}

A q\n-ary optimal (n,k,r)\n-LRC is an [n,k,d]\nlinear code over \\mathbb {F}_{q}\nsuch that every code symbol has locality r\n, and the minimum distance attains the well-known Singleton-like bound. In this paper, we study the maximal code length, code constructions and weight distributions of q\n-ary optimal LRCs with locality 2 and distance 5, which are of both practical and theoretical interest. Firstly, it is proved that when the code dimension is even or odd, corresponding maximal code lengths of such q\n-ary optimal LRCs are 3 \\cdot \\lfloor \\frac {q+1}{3} \\rfloor\nand 3 \\cdot \\left \\lfloor{ \\frac {q-1}{3} }\\right \\rfloor +5\n, respectively. Up to the equivalence of linear codes, we propose constructions of all the possible q\n-ary optimal LRCs with locality 2, distance 5 and maximal code length. Then, by characterizing the weight type hierarchy of codewords, we show that the weight distribution of any q\n-ary optimal LRC with locality 2, distance 5 and even code dimension can be uniquely determined and explicit expression of the weight distribution is given. Moreover, it is shown that all q\n-ary optimal LRCs with locality 2, distance 5 and even code dimension are maximally recoverable.}

This work proposes a novel deep-learning based decoding algorithm which is tailored for breaking TSs. In particular, when MP decoding fails due to TSs, there exist pairs of unsatisfied check nodes (CNs) which are connected through paths only with error variable nodes (VNs), i.e., VNs with erroneous hard-decision results. The proposed algorithm efficiently identifies the paths with error VNs between unsatisfied CNs with the aid of deep-learning techniques. Then, the decoding failures are resolved by repeating the MP decoding after re-initializing the channel outputs for the error VNs in the identified paths. In addition, by analyzing the behaviors of the deep-learning based algorithm, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, called adaptive-error-path (AEP) detector. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently break the TSs and significantly improve the error-floor performance in the low error-rate regime.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an optimization method for protograph-based spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes under window decoding (WD). Previous works on constructing SC-LDPC codes for WD typically focused on optimizing asymptotic performance metrics such as the WD threshold. However, in this paper, it is observed that the WD threshold is not an appropriate metric to sufficiently explain the finite-length behavior of SC-LDPC codes under WD. Thus, we propose a new performance metric, called the window mean parameter, based on a scaling analysis to capture the WD performance more accurately and formulate a code optimization algorithm that optimizes the proposed performance metric. Since the proposed metric depends on the window size, the optimization algorithm can provide a code family of SC-LDPC codes optimized for various target window sizes. Simulation results confirm that the improvement in the proposed metric leads to a finite-length performance improvement, resulting in one to two orders of the frame error rate gain over the conventional SC-LDPC codes for a wide range of window sizes. Furthermore, we investigate structural characteristics of the proposed codes to provide a supplementary explanation for the performance improvement, which also promotes a better understanding of SC-LDPC codes for WD.}

RM codes can be constructed based on the Plotkin construction. In this work, we consider concatenated codes based on the Plotkin construction, where extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are used as component codes. This leads to improved code parameters compared to RM codes. Moreover, this construction is more flexible concerning the attainable code rates. Additionally, new soft-input decoding algorithms are proposed that exploit the recursive structure of the concatenation and the cyclic structure of the component codes. First, we consider the decoding of the cyclic component codes and propose a low complexity hybrid ordered statistics decoding algorithm. Next, this algorithm is applied to list decoding of the Plotkin construction. The proposed list decoding approach achieves near-maximum-likelihood performance for codes with medium lengths. The performance is comparable to state-of-the-art decoders, whereas the complexity is reduced.}

These network codes, which we will refer to as permute-and-add network codes, involve simpler operations and are known to provide lower complexity solutions than scalar linear network codes. The complexity of these codes is determined by their degree which is the number of permutations applied on each incoming vector to compute an outgoing vector. Constructions of permute-and-add network codes for multicast networks are known. In this paper, we provide a new framework based on group algebras to design permute-and-add network codes for arbitrary (not necessarily multicast) networks. Our framework allows the use of any finite group of permutations (including circular shifts, proposed in prior works) and admits a trade-off between coding rate and the degree of the code. Further, our technique permits elegant recovery and generalizations of the key results on permute-and-add network codes known in the literature.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel approach to optimization of irregular nonbinary (NB) quasi-cyclic (QC)-LDPC codes over small alphabets. In this approach, first, the base parity-check matrices are constructed by a simulated annealing method, and then these matrices are labeled by the field elements while maximizing the so- called generalized girth of the Tanner graph. In order to analyze the performance of the constructed irregular NB LDPC codes, a new ensemble of irregular NB LDPC codes over the extensions of the binary Galois field is introduced. A finite-length random coding bound on the error probability of the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding over the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) input AWGN channel for the new code ensemble is derived. The frame error rate (FER) performance of the sum-product belief-propagation (BP) decoding of the constructed NB QC-LDPC block codes is compared to that of both the optimized binary QC-LDPC block codes in the 5G standard and the best known NB QC-LDPC codes as well as to the derived random coding bound on the ML decoding error probability. It is shown that the obtained bound predicts the behavior of BP decoding performance of practical NB QC-LDPC codes more accurately than the BP decoding thresholds do.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) approach for concatenated two-level multi-level coding (MLC). The proposed system is based on a concatenated forward error correction (FEC) scheme where outer codes are serially concatenated with inner two-level MLC. This concatenated two-level MLC scheme has recently been shown to have a potential for achieving better performance-complexity trade-offs than the conventional bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). Meanwhile, PAS has recently been demonstrated to offer remarkable performance gains as well as rate adaptivity. However, the majority of existing works on PAS assume the use of the binary reflected Gray code as a bit-labeling, and its application to coded modulation schemes with other bit-labelings, such as two-level MLC, may not be straightforward. In this paper, we devise a bit-labeling scheme and propose a new PAS structure for an efficient integration of PAS with two-level MLC systems. More specifically, we propose to generate signed amplitude symbols with the distribution matcher (DM) for maximizing both coding and shaping gains achieved by two-level MLC and PAS, respectively, while the conventional PAS generates unsigned amplitude symbols. It is demonstrated by simulation results that, with 256QAM and inner polar codes, the proposed two-level MLC with PAS simultaneously offers 75% reduction in the number of required inner encoding and soft-decision (SD) decoding operations for given outer and inner FEC code lengths, and up to 0.3 dB performance gain over the conventional PAS scheme.}

	abstract = {Space modulation techniques (SMTs) are multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitter system implementations that have shown to achieve favorable properties compared to existing MIMO technologies. This includes properties such as lower power consumption, cost, and enhanced error performance. As modern wireless standards have come to demand also more reliability and less latency, in recent work analyzing the reliability of SMTs, it was shown that existing SMT implementations do not effectively perform under degraded system conditions. Essentially, under certain failure conditions, parts of SMT systems become unusable although still effectively operational. As a result, affecting the best achievable spectral efficiency, and thus system data rate of the system. In this work, novel SMT implementations are presented and referred to as hybrid SMTs (HSMTs). HSMTs are designed to degrade in a manner that keeps use of operational hardware and maintains a higher spectral efficiency for longer duration. Four different HSMTs are presented namely; hybrid space shift keying (HSSK), hybrid spatial modulation (HSM), hybrid quadrature space shift keying (HQSSK), and hybrid quadrature spatial modulation (HQSM). Additionally, a reliability analysis framework for HSMTs is presented using two different analytical tools and all introduced models are comparatively studied.}

The presence of neighbouring FA nanomachines in the environment is taken into account by describing them as sources of negative molecules. The channel impulse responses of all the receivers are linked in a system of integral equations. The solution of the system with two receivers is obtained analytically. For a higher number of receivers the system of integral equations is solved numerically. It is also shown that the channel impulse response shape is distorted by the presence of the neighbouring FA interferers. For instance, there is a time shift of the peak in the number of absorbed molecules compared to the case without interference, as predicted by the proposed model. The analytical derivations are validated by means of particle based simulations.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a scheduling problem, in which several streams of status update packets with different priority levels are sent through a shared channel to their destinations. We introduce a notion of lexicographic age optimality , or simply lex-age-optimality , to evaluate the performance of multi-class status update policies. In particular, a lex-age-optimal scheduling policy first minimizes the Age of Information (AoI) metrics for high-priority streams, and then, within the set of optimal policies for high-priority streams, achieves the minimum AoI metrics for low-priority streams. We propose a new scheduling policy named Preemptive Priority, Maximum Age First, Last-Generated, First-Served (PP-MAF-LGFS), and prove that the PP-MAF-LGFS scheduling policy is lex-age-optimal. This result holds (i) for minimizing any time-dependent, symmetric, and non-decreasing age penalty function; (ii) for minimizing any non-decreasing functional of the stochastic process formed by the age penalty function; and (iii) for the cases where different priority classes have distinct arrival traffic patterns, age penalty functions, and age penalty functionals. For example, the PP-MAF-LGFS scheduling policy is lex-age-optimal for minimizing the probability of age violation of a high-priority stream and the time-average age of a low-priority stream. Numerical results are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings.}

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications under dense urban environments usually experience severe keyhole fading effect especially for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels, which degrades the capacity and outage performance due to the rank deficiency. To avoid these, the integration of MIMO and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is proposed to assist V2V communications in this paper. By using the methods of integral transforms, the outage probabilities are derived in closed-form for different HARQ-assisted schemes, including Type I-HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), and HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). With the results, meaningful insights are gained by conducting the asymptotic outage analysis. Specifically, it is revealed that full time diversity order can be achieved, while full spatial diversity order is unreachable as compared to MIMO-HARQ systems without keyhole effect. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic outage probability is a monotonically increasing and convex function of the transmission rate. More importantly, although HARQ-IR performs better than HARQ-CC owing to its higher coding complexity, this advantage becomes negligible in the large-scale array regime. Finally, the numerical results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations along with some in-depth discussions.}

	abstract = {Caching at the wireless edge nodes is a promising way to boost the spatial and spectral efficiency, for the sake of alleviating networks from content-related traffic. Coded caching originally introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen significantly speeds up communication efficiency by transmitting multicast messages simultaneously useful to multiple users. Most prior works on coded caching are based on the assumption that each user may request all content in the library. However, in many applications the users are interested only in a limited set of content that depends on their location. For example, assisted self-driving vehicles may access super High-Definition maps of the area through which they are travelling. Motivated by these considerations, this paper formulates the coded caching problem for location-based content with edge cache nodes. The considered problem includes a content server with access to ${\\mathsf N}$ location-based files (e.g., High-Definition maps), ${\\mathsf K}$ edge cache nodes located at different regions, and ${\\mathsf K}$ users (i.e., vehicles) each of which is in the serving region of one cache node and can retrieve the cached content of this cache node with negligible cost. Depending on the location, each user only requests a file from a location-dependent subset of the library. The objective is to minimize the worst-case load (i.e., the worst-case number of broadcasted bits from the content server among all possible demands). For this novel coded caching problem, we propose a highly non-trivial converse bound under uncoded cache placement (i.e., each cache node directly copies some library bits in its cache), which shows that a simple achievable scheme is optimal under uncoded cache placement. In addition, this achievable scheme is also proved to be generally order optimal within a factor of 3. Finally, we extend the coded caching problem for location-based content to the multiaccess coded caching topology originally proposed by Hachem et al. , where each user is connected to ${\\mathsf L}$ nearest cache nodes. When ${\\mathsf L}\\geq 2$ , we characterize the exact optimality on the worst-case load.}

We argue that, for the problem at hand, using Age of Information (AoI) for quantifying the staleness of a sample is conservative and therefore, study another freshness metric age penalty , which is defined as the time elapsed since the first transition out of the most recently observed state. We study two optimization problems: minimize average age penalty subject to an average sampling frequency constraint, and minimize average sampling frequency subject to an average age penalty constraint; both are Constrained Markov Decision Problems. We solve them using the Lagrangian MDP approach, where we also provide structural results that reduce the search space. Our numerical results demonstrate that the computed Markov policies not only outperform optimal periodic sampling policies, but also achieve sampling frequencies close to or lower than that of an optimal clairvoyant (non-causal) sampling policy, if a small age penalty is allowed.}

However, how to realize intelligent frequency, time, and energy resource allocation to support better performances is an important problem to be solved. In this paper, we study joint spectrum, energy, and time resource management for the EH-CR-NOMA IoT systems. Our goal is to minimize the number of data packets losses for all secondary sensing users (SSU), while satisfying the constraints on the maximum charging battery capacity, maximum transmitting power, maximum buffer capacity, and minimum data rate of primary users (PU) and SSUs. Due to the non-convexity of this optimization problem and the stochastic nature of the wireless environment, we propose a distributed multidimensional resource management algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Considering the continuity of the resources to be managed, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is adopted, based on which each agent (SSU) can manage its own multidimensional resources without collaboration. In addition, a simplified but practical action adjuster (AA) is introduced for improving the training efficiency and battery performance protection. The provided results show that the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm is about 4 times faster than that of DDPG, and the average number of packet losses (ANPL) is about 8 times lower than that of the greedy algorithm.}

To exploit the temporal correlation of the wireless channel and the time-frequency structure of OFDM signals, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with deep feedforward output layers is introduced, where the recurrent layers and feedforward output layers are designed to process time-domain and frequency-domain information respectively. Reservoir computing (RC), a special type of RNN, and extreme learning machine (ELM), a special type of feedforward neural network, are chosen as the corresponding building blocks to facilitate over-the-air training. An online training loss objective is introduced to recursively update the neural weights in real-time. We believe this is the first work in the literature to realize real-time machine learning for MIMO-OFDM symbol detection, i.e., conducting NN-based symbol detection on an OFDM symbol basis. We demonstrate that (1) the IEEE standardized WiFi training sequence can be directly applied as the real-time training sequence (2) the symbol detection performance can be further improved by using our theoretically derived pilot pattern. Evaluation results show that our RC-ELM-based symbol detection method outperforms traditional model-based techniques as well as state-of-the-art learning-based approaches in highly dynamic channel environments for real-time symbol detection.}

This paper proposes a unit-modulus over-the-air computation (UMAirComp) framework to facilitate efficient edge federated learning, which simultaneously uploads local model parameters and updates global model parameters via analog beamforming. The proposed framework avoids sophisticated baseband signal processing, leading to low communication delays and implementation costs. Training loss bounds of UMAirComp FL systems are derived and two low-complexity large-scale optimization algorithms, termed penalty alternating minimization (PAM) and accelerated gradient projection (AGP), are proposed to minimize the nonconvex nonsmooth loss bound. Simulation results show that the proposed UMAirComp framework with PAM algorithm achieves a smaller mean square error of model parameters’ estimation, training loss, and test error compared with other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed UMAirComp framework with AGP algorithm achieves satisfactory performance while reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude compared with existing optimization algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of UMAirComp in a vehicle-to-everything autonomous driving simulation platform. It is found that autonomous driving tasks are more sensitive to model parameter errors than other tasks since the neural networks for autonomous driving contain sparser model parameters.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the optimal signal detection problem with a particular interest in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The problem is NP-hard and can be solved optimally by searching the shortest path on the decision tree. Unfortunately, the existing optimal search algorithms often involve prohibitively high complexities, which indicates that they are infeasible in large-scale MIMO systems. To address this issue, we propose a general heuristic search algorithm, namely, hyper-accelerated tree search (HATS) algorithm. The proposed algorithm employs a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the optimal heuristic, and then use the estimated heuristic to speed up the underlying memory-bounded search algorithm. This idea is inspired by the fact that the underlying heuristic search algorithm reaches the optimal efficiency with the optimal heuristic function. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reaches almost the optimal bit error rate (BER) performance in large-scale systems, while the memory size can be bounded. In the meanwhile, it visits nearly the fewest tree nodes. This indicates that the proposed algorithm reaches almost the optimal efficiency in practical scenarios, and thereby it is applicable for large-scale systems.

	abstract = {In a cell-free wireless network, distributed access points (APs) jointly serve all user equipments (UEs) within their coverage area by using the same time/frequency resources. In this paper, we develop a novel downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) network architecture that enables all APs and UEs to dynamically self-partition into a set of independent cell-free subnetworks in a time-slot basis. For this, we propose several network partitioning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, to mitigate interference between different cell-free subnetworks, we develop a novel hybrid analog beamsteering-digital beamforming model that zero-forces interference among cell-free subnetworks and at the same time maximizes the instantaneous sum-rate of all UEs within each subnetwork. Specifically, the hybrid beamforming model is implemented by using a novel mixed DRL-convex optimization method in which analog beamsteering between APs and UEs is conducted based on DRL while digital beamforming is modeled and solved as a convex optimization problem. The DRL models for network clustering and hybrid beamsteering are combined into a single hierarchical DRL design that enables exchange of DRL agents’ experiences during both network training and operation. We also benchmark the performance of DRL models for clustering and beamsteering in terms of network performance, convergence rate, and computational complexity. Results show a significant rate enhancement due to the proposed hybrid beamforming scheme compared to its conventional all-digital counterpart. This performance enhancement becomes more significant as the number of network partitions increases. For DRL-based network clustering, the policy gradient (PG) algorithm offers the best possible performance in terms of stability and convergence rate while the state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) algorithm suffers from significant variance, slower convergence, and slightly inferior performance than other algorithms. For DRL-based beamsteering, the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with continuous action space shows the best performance. Also, online training of the agents with varying channel state information (CSI) is observed to increase the variance of the Q-values and decrease the convergence rate, with no significant effect on the average reward.

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been one promising solution to reduce the computation delay of wireless devices. Due to the high spectrum efficiency of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), this paper studies the single-user multi-edge-server MEC system based on downlink NOMA, aiming to minimize task computation delay by jointly optimizing the NOMA-based transmission duration (TD) and workload offloading allocation (WOA) among edge computing servers. This task computation delay minimization (CDM) problem is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. To solve the CDM problem efficiently, we decompose it into the sub-problem of determining the optimal WOA with a given TD and the top-problem of optimizing the TD. For the sub-problem, we first derive its some important properties and then design an efficient channel quality ranking based algorithm to obtain the optimal WOA. We solve the top-problem for the static-channel and dynamic-channel scenarios, respectively. For the static-channel scenario, we design an optimal algorithm which only apply once the golden section search method to obtain the optimal TD of first task and directly obtain the optimal offloading solution for any consequently arrived task with different workloads. For the dynamic-channel scenario where the channel qualities from the wireless device to the edge-computing servers are varying, it is critical to quickly determine the current task’s offloading solution under the current channel state and task workload, which is very challenging for the traditional optimization methods. In order to conquer this challenge, we propose the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm, which can obtain the near-optimal offloading solution instantly after enough learning. Finally, we validate through simulations the advantages of NOMA over frequency division multiple access (FDMA).}

	abstract = {Wireless distributed machine learning is envisaged to facilitate advanced learning services and applications in wireless networks consisting of devices with limited computing capability. Distributed machine learning algorithms are more vulnerable in wireless systems since information exchange in learning is limited by wireless resources and channel conditions. Moreover, their performance can be significantly degraded by attacks of the Byzantine devices, and information distorted by channel fading can be treated as Byzantine attacks. Consequently, protection of wireless distributed machine learning from Byzantine devices is paramount. Leveraging over-the-air computation, we put forth a novel wireless distributed stochastic gradient descent system which is resilient to Byzantine attacks. The proposed learning system is underpinned by two novel and distinct features which enable more accurate and faster distributed machine learning resilient to Byzantine attacks: (1) collecting training data in the PS to obtain its own training results and (2) grouping the distributed devices. We derive upper bounds of the mean square error of the global parameter when the proposed algorithms are used in the cases with and without Byzantine devices, and prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms with the derived bounds. The effectiveness of the algorithms is validated by showing the accuracy and convergence speed.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a popular edge learning approach that utilizes local data and computing resources of network edge devices to train machine learning (ML) models while preserving users’ privacy. Nevertheless, performing efficient learning tasks on the devices and achieving longer battery life are primary challenges faced by federated learning. In this paper, we are the first to study the application of heterogeneous computing (HC) and wireless power transfer (WPT) to federated learning to address these challenges. Especially, we propose a heterogeneous computation and resource allocation framework based on a heterogeneous mobile architecture to achieve effective implementation of FL. To minimize the energy consumption of smart devices and maximize their harvesting energy simultaneously, we formulate an optimization problem featuring multidimensional control, which jointly considers time splitting for WPT, dataset size allocation, transmit power allocation and subcarrier assignment during communications, and processor frequency of processing units (central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU)). However, the major obstacle is how to design a proper algorithm to solve this optimization problem efficiently. For this purpose, we decouple the optimization variables so as to achieve high efficiency in deriving its solution. Particularly, we first compute the optimal processor frequency and dataset size allocation via employing the Lagrangian dual method, followed by finding the closed-form solution to the optimal time splitting allocation, and finally attain the optimal subcarrier assignment as well as transmit power for transmissions through an iteration algorithm. To evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme, we set up four baseline schemes as comparison, and simulation results show that the proposed scheme converges quite fast and better enhance the energy efficiency of the wireless powered FL system compared with the baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach of utilizing the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for joint data modulation and signal beamforming in a multi-user downlink cellular network by leveraging the idea of backscatter communication. We present a general framework in which the RIS, referred to as modulating intelligent surface (MIS) in this paper, is used to: i\n) beamform the signals for a set of users whose data modulation is already performed by the base station (BS), and at the same time, ii\n) embed the data of a different set of users by passively modulating the deliberately sent carrier signals from the BS to the RIS. To maximize each user’s spectral efficiency, a joint non-convex optimization problem is formulated under the sum minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion. Alternating optimization is used to divide the original joint problem into two tasks of: i\n) separately optimizing the MIS phase-shifts for passive beamforming along with data embedding for the BS- and MIS-served users, respectively, and ii\n) jointly optimizing the active precoder and the receive scaling factor for the BS- and MIS-served users, respectively. While the solution to the latter joint problem is found in closed-form using traditional optimization techniques, the optimal phase-shifts at the MIS are obtained by deriving the appropriate optimization-oriented vector approximate message passing (OOVAMP) algorithm. Moreover, the original joint problem is solved under both ideal and practical constraints on the MIS phase shifts, namely, the unimodular constraint and assuming each MIS element to be terminated by a variable reactive load. The proposed MIS-assisted scheme is compared against state-of-the-art RIS-assisted wireless communication schemes and simulation results reveal that it brings substantial improvements in terms of system throughput while supporting a much higher number of users.}

In particular, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations, namely fully dynamic IRS beamforming (FDBF) , partially dynamic IRS beamforming (PDBF) , and static IRS beamforming (SBF) , to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. Moreover, we adopt a practical non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model, and leverage a power-splitting (PS) EH receiver architecture with multiple rectifiers to avoid the input radio frequency power to get stuck into the saturation regime. We aim to minimize the transmit energy consumption at the HAP by jointly optimizing the DL/UL time allocation, the HAP/devices transmit power, the PS factor, and IRS phase shifts, subject to a set of minimum throughput requirements for individual devices. To address the resulting non-convex optimization problems, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we study the case with the ideal linear EH model and two algorithms, namely SCA-based algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm, are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes and also unveil the importance of the joint design of IRS beamforming and PS rectifiers for achieving energy efficient WPCNs in practice.}

The considered networks suffers from interference caused by three node transmission in IBFD scheme and the mobility of vehicular user equipments (VUEs). The resource allocation problem is formulated to jointly optimize VUE association, resource block assignment (RA) and power allocation (PA), while satisfying the reliability and latency constraints at the same time. The formulated problem is a mixed integer non-linear problem with non-convex objective function and constraints. Finding globally optimal solution for this type of problem is still an open problem. To develop tractable solutions, the original problem is firstly simplified using derived equivalent expression for the objective function. The proposed method then decomposed it into RA and PA sub-problems. In each iteration, the PA sub-problem is solved for a set of given PA solution; while the solution for PA sub-problem is searched under determined RA results. The RA and PA sub-problems are solved iteratively until the converging condition is achieved. Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed method achieves Nash-stable equilibrium and local optimality for RA and PA sub-problems respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the derived performance analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literatures.}

Due to the fast-varying channel caused by high mobility, guaranteeing latency and reliability performance of the V2V links is a tremendous challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel resource allocation framework to support ultra-reliable low-latency V2V communications. The proposed framework includes both large-scale and small-scale resource optimizations. The large-scale resource allocation is performed at the central base station based on large-scale channel information periodically collected from vehicles. On the other hand, the small-scale resource allocation is performed at the vehicles according to instantaneous channel and queuing information. We develop optimal solutions for both resource allocation problems. With the proposed optimal solutions, the latency performance at the occurrence of extreme events is enhanced by enabling spectrum sharing among the vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the URLLC performance compared against the benchmark algorithm.}

	abstract = {Interactive applications with automated feedback will largely influence the design of future networked infrastructures. In such applications, status information about an environment of interest is captured and forwarded to a compute node, which analyzes the information and generates a feedback message. Timely processing and forwarding must ensure the feedback information to be still applicable; thus, the quality-of-service parameter for such applications is the end-to-end latency over the entire loop. By modelling the communication of a feedback loop as a two-hop network, we address the problem of allocating network resources in order to minimize the delay violation probability (DVP), i.e. the probability of the end-to-end latency exceeding a target value. We investigate the influence of the network queue states along the network path on the performance of semi-static and dynamic scheduling policies. The former determine the schedule prior to the transmission of the packet, while the latter benefit from feedback on the queue states as time evolves and reallocate time slots depending on the queue’s evolution. The performance of the proposed policies is evaluated for variations in several system parameters and comparison baselines. Results show that the proposed semi-static policy achieves close-to-optimal DVP and the dynamic policy outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

Further, at a distance of 40 m, for example, the path loss penalties for moderate and dense fog weather scenarios are 2 and 3 dB, respectively, compared with the clear weather. Furthermore, the combined impact of path loss and atmospheric turbulence affects the V2V-VLC performance significantly.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the modeling and design of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted optical communication systems, which can circumvent the line-of-sight (LOS) requirement in multi-link free space optical (FSO) systems. The FSO laser beams incident on the optical IRSs have a Gaussian power intensity profile and a nonlinear phase profile, whereas the plane waves in radio frequency (RF) systems have a uniform power intensity profile and a linear phase profile. Given these substantial differences, the results available for IRS-assisted RF systems are not applicable to IRS-assisted FSO systems. Therefore, we develop a new analytical channel model for point-to-point IRS-assisted FSO systems based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Our analytical model captures the impact of the size, position, and orientation of the IRS as well as its phase shift profile on the end-to-end channel. To allow the sharing of the optical IRS by multiple FSO links, we propose three different protocols, namely the time division (TD), IRS-division (IRSD), and IRS homogenization (IRSH) protocols. The proposed protocols address the specific characteristics of FSO systems including the non-uniformity and possible misalignment of the laser beams. Furthermore, to compare the proposed IRS sharing protocols, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) and the outage probability of IRS-assisted multi-link FSO systems in the presence of inter-link interference. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical channel model for IRS-assisted FSO systems and confirm that this model is applicable for both large and intermediate IRS-receiver lens distances. Furthermore, we show that for the proposed IRSD and IRSH protocols, inter-link interference becomes negligible if the laser beams are properly centered on the IRS and the transceivers are carefully positioned, respectively. Moreover, in the absence of misalignment errors, the IRSD protocol outperforms the other protocols, whereas in the presence of misalignment errors, the IRSH protocol performs significantly better than the IRSD protocol.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows multiple users to share link resource for higher spectrum efficiency. It can be applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) networks to provide convenient offloading computing service for ground users (GUs) with large-scale access. However, due to the line-of-sight (LoS) of UAV transmission, the information can be easily eavesdropped in NOMA-based UAV-MEC networks. In this paper, we propose a secure communication scheme for the NOMA-based UAV-MEC system towards a flying eavesdropper. In the proposed scheme, the average security computation capacity of the system is maximized while guaranteeing a minimum security computation requirement for each GU. Due to the uncertainty of the eavesdropper’s position, the coupling of multi-variables and the non-convexity of the problem, we first study the worst security situation through mathematical derivation. Then, the problem is solved by utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods with respect to channel coefficient, transmit power, central processing unit (CPU) computation frequency, local computation and UAV trajectory. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the benchmarks in terms of the system security computation performance.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the finite-order filter design problem for the source and multiple full-duplex (FD) relays in a cooperative communication system under frequency-selective fading channels. The goal is to optimize the source and relay filters such that the end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of minimum mean-squared error decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) can be maximized. The resultant design problem is very difficult since we need to deal with self interference (SI), inter-relay interference (IRI), and inter-symbol interference (ISI) at the same time. Novel designs are then proposed to overcome the difficulty in this work. Transforming the signals into the frequency domain and using some optimization techniques, we first theoretically derive the power spectrum of the source filter and the spectrums of the relay filters. Then, the finite-order design is developed to approach the derived spectrums. Based on the weighted least-square (WLS) criterion, the Steiglitz-McBride method is exploited to obtain the filter coefficients in finite lengths. Numerical results demonstrated that complete removal of SI may not be a good strategy; preserving a certain amount of SI at each relay instead provides better SINR performance.}

By deriving an analytical BEM OTFS system model, a low-order generalized complex exponential BEM (GCE-BEM) aided rough channel estimation is proposed at the initial stage with low pilot overhead, followed by equalization. Then, the refinement of channel estimation and equalization is conducted iteratively, in which a high-resolution GCE-BEM model with a large BEM order is adopted and the detected data symbols are exploited as pseudo-pilots, leading to higher estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed BEM OTFS receiver significantly outperforms the existing OTFS receivers in terms of the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation and bit error rate (BER), while featuring low pilot overhead. Results also show the near-optimal performance of the novel solution, i.e. , achieved BER is very close to the case of perfect channel estimation. The theoretical lower bound on MSE of channel estimation is derived to verify the effectiveness of the proposed BEM OTFS receiver, which is shown to be close to simulation results.}

	abstract = {We propose a cluster-based multi-carrier beam division multiple access (MC-BDMA) scheme to enable massive device terahertz (THz) communications with the dynamic-subarray hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture. This scheme is motivated by a limitation of conventional HBF architectures, i.e., the number of users cannot exceed the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. By exploiting the unique properties of THz channels, such as high distance-and-frequency dependence, high sparsity, and small angular spread, we propose multiple users in the same cluster to be supported by a single RF chain with distance-aware multi-carrier modulation. Moreover, we propose different clusters to be divided by BDMA that is accomplished through HBF design. In our proposed scheme, we first design a novel antenna selection and subarray partition algorithm for the dynamic-subarray HBF architecture to compensate for performance loss caused by diverse channels among users. We then design an algorithm for multi-carrier HBF which maximizes the achievable throughput and eliminates the inter-beam interference. Numerical results show that our proposed cluster-based MC-BDMA scheme with the dynamic-subarray HBF architecture provides an almost 100% spectral efficiency gain and a 60% energy efficiency gain over the conventional non-cluster HBF scheme in massive device communications.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter wave have been adopted as the enabling technologies for the 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) systems. A challenging problem introduced by the use of large antenna size and wide bandwidth is beam squint, i.e., spatial-wideband effect. Beam squint can significantly degrade the channel estimation performance for conventional channel estimators. Research effort on channel estimation under beam squint conditions has been very limited. For the few available work that attempts to address this problem, they require either all subcarriers or multiple symbols used as pilot for channel estimation, so large overhead becomes inevitable. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation method that only requires a small number of subcarriers. The channel estimation problem is formulated as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem. Initial parameter estimation is critical, which will affect the efficiency and convergence of the proposed algorithm. Using a densely-spaced antenna structure and consecutive subcarriers assignment approach, we can effectively avoid the aliasing effect and reduce the ambiguity during the initialization phase. A subcarrier assignment criterion is proposed to achieve the optimal performance. Closed-form expressions of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the achievable rate are derived to evaluate the performance. Both simulation results and theoretical analysis show that even with a small number of subcarriers, the estimation error closely approaches the CRLB, and its effect is negligible compared with the noise when evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio with a simple linear detector. Furthermore, the number of pilot subcarriers has little impact on the achievable rate.}

The proposed IS-GBSM can model spherical wavefront propagation, high delay resolution, and three-dimensional (3D) space-time-frequency non-stationarity of channels with time-space consistency, and thus can be applied to integrated communication and sensing systems. To capture the 3D non-stationarity with channel consistency, a new hybrid method combining geometric and parametric methods is developed. Based on the geometric method, i.e., visibility region (VR), the smooth and consistent appearance and disappearance of clusters during array-time evolution are modeled. With the help of the parametric method, a frequency-dependent path gain is introduced, and a visible factor based on uniform continuity theorem and bounded variation function is further proposed to capture the soft cluster power handover during cluster array-time evolution. Key channel statistics of the proposed IS-GBSM are derived and investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the space-time-frequency non-stationarity is modeled and time-space consistency is captured. Finally, the utility of the proposed IS-GBSM is verified by the excellent agreement between simulation results and measurement.}

The resulting optimization problem is formulated as an integer programming problem that is nonconvex and NP-hard. Consequently, the global optimal solution, even the local optimal solution, cannot be generally obtained. To overcome this challenge, this paper resorts to design a deep learning architecture based on graph neural network to finish the joint beam selection and link activation, with taking the network topology information into account. Meanwhile, we present an unsupervised Lagrangian dual learning framework to train the parameters of the GBLinks model. Numerical results show that the proposed GBLinks model can converge to a stable point with the number of iterations increases, in terms of the weighted sum rate. Furthermore, the GBLinks model can reach near-optimal solutions through comparing with the exhaustive scheme in small-scale ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks and outperforms GreedyNoSched and the SCA-based method. It also shows that the GBLinks model can generalize to varying network densities and network coverage regions of ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks.}

In this paper, we propose a general framework for the IRS-aided MIMO system designs under both single-user and multi-user setups, in which the diverse performance metrics including weighted mutual information and weighted MSE, and the realistic multiple weighted power constraint are taken into consideration. Leveraging the alternating optimization approach, the optimal IRS phase shifts are obtained in semi-closed forms. Specifically, based on the matrix-monotonic optimization theory, it is found that optimizing IRS phase shifts is essentially equivalent to tuning the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the MSE matrix. Then the proposed general framework is extended to a multi-user system by introducing a majorization-minimization (MM)-based method for IRS phase shift optimization. Simulation results show that our proposed optimal design brings significant enhancement on the chosen performance metric compared to the traditional MIMO systems without the IRS, and also significantly outperforms various benchmark designs in both single-user and multi-user systems.}

In addition, full-duplex (FD) cooperative non-orthogonal-multiple-access (C-NOMA) is invoked within each cell to improve the data rates of the UEs and to assist those at the cell edge. The UEs are categorized into two groups, namely, cell-center UEs (\nCUs\n) and cell-edge UEs (\nEUs\n). The\nCUs\nare the UEs located around the center of each cell. Meanwhile, the\nEUs\nare the UEs located at the edge of each cell, where the JT-CoMP is applied since they have less distinctive received power from two cells. In this paper, a framework to jointly optimize the power control and the UEs clustering of CoMP-assisted FD C-NOMA system is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the network sum-rate while guaranteeing the required quality-of-service of UEs. The formulated problem is a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear program that cannot be solved in a straightforward manner. To tackle this issue, the formulated problem is decomposed into an inner power allocation problem and an outer UEs clustering problem. For the inner problem, a computational-efficient solution is obtained. Meanwhile, the outer problem is reformulated as a one-to-one three-sided matching game. Then, a low-complexity near-optimal clustering algorithm is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that 1) the optimality of the power control solution; 2) the CoMP-assisted FD C-NOMA has a superior performance compared to CoMP-assisted half-duplex (HD) C-NOMA and CoMP NOMA schemes for moderate values of self-interference. It has been also shown that the proposed solution achieves around 96.5% of the average achievable network sum-rate of the optimal solution.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted edge caching has been emerged as a promising solution to alleviate network congestion, which can provide users with their desired contents with reduced latency. For achieving effective UAV-assisted edge caching, how to jointly design the trajectory and caching strategy is critical, which, however, is not straightforward due to the heterogeneous and uncertain demand in the network. In this paper, aiming at maximizing the reduced delay brought by the UAV-assisted caching, we propose a proactive joint strategy on trajectory and caching for the UAV, where the demand uncertainty is particularly studied. Specifically, by regarding the demand on each content as a random variable, we formulate the strategy design as a risk-averse stochastic optimization problem to make the network performance guaranteed under certain confidence level. Different from most existing works assuming the perfect distributional information is available to deal with the uncertainty, we develop a data-driven approach based on the first and second order statistics to achieve a distributionally robust (DR) solution, which can make the strategy trustworthy with guaranteed network performance even though the specific distributional information is unknown. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DR strategy.}

	abstract = {Radio spectrum is a scarce resource. To meet demands, new wireless technologies must operate in shared spectrum over unlicensed bands (coexist). We consider coexistence of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) License-Assisted Access (LAA) with incumbent Wi-Fi systems. Our scenario consists of multiple LAA and Wi-Fi links sharing an unlicensed band; we aim to simultaneously optimize performance of both coexistence systems. To do this, we present a technique to continuously estimate the Pareto frontier of parameter sets (traces) which approximately maximize all convex combinations of network throughputs over network parameters. We use a dimensionality reduction approach known as active subspaces to determine that this near-optimal parameter set is primarily composed of two physically relevant parameters. A choice of two-dimensional subspace enables visualizations augmenting explainability and the reduced-dimension convex problem results in approximations which dominate random grid search.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a resource allocation problem where several Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices send data to a base station (BS) with or without the help of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cellular network. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of all IoT devices by finding the optimal RIS and spreading factor (SF) for each device. Since these IoT devices lack prior information of the RISs or the channel state information (CSI), a distributed resource allocation framework with low complexity and learning features is required to achieve this goal. Therefore, we model this problem as a two-stage multi-player multi-armed bandit (MPMAB) framework to learn the optimal RIS and SF sequentially. Then, we put forth an exploration and exploitation boosting (E2Boost) algorithm to solve this two-stage MPMAB problem by combining the \\epsilon\n-greedy algorithm, Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm, and non-cooperation game method. We derive an upper regret bound for the proposed algorithm, i.e., \\mathcal {O}(\\log ^{1+\\delta }_{2} T)\n, increasing logarithmically with the time horizon T\n. Numerical results show that the E2Boost algorithm has the best performance among the existing methods and exhibits a fast convergence rate. More importantly, the proposed algorithm is not sensitive to the number of combinations of the RISs and SFs thanks to the two-stage allocation mechanism, which can benefit the high-density networks.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as an important transmission technology for numerous applications in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the application of RIS in energy harvesting (EH) based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network with finite block length (BL) codes, where a rotary wing type flying UAV communicates with the multiple single antenna IoT users with the aid of multiple RISs mounted on several skyscraper buildings. To transmit the signal to a particular IoT user, the UAV selects an RIS on the basis of either UAV-RIS (i.e., partial) or UAV-RIS-IoT (i.e., full) channel state information (CSI) and then transmits the signal through the selected RIS along with the direct link transmission. In particular, we derive (i) the expression for probability of RIS selection, (ii) the statistical distribution of instantaneously received information signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the IoT user. Based on the derived statistics, we analyze the performance of the considered system under finite BL codes in terms of the average outage probability, average block error rate (ABLER) and goodput averaged over entire flying duration. Moreover, the BLER performance with finite BL codes is also compared with the infinite BL codes scenario. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of various channel and system parameters like imperfect CSI, number of RISs and the number of reflecting elements at each RIS, location of IoT users, variable altitude of the UAV, and the severity of channel fading of UAV-RIS link on the system performance. Furthermore, we have obtained the optimum UAV location in each time slot which minimizes the ABLER per time slot over all the users in the network. The analytical results are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations.}

We first derive the closed-form approximate expressions for the achievable rate which holds for arbitrary numbers of base station (BS) antennas and RIS elements. Then, we utilize the derived expressions to provide some insights, including the asymptotic rate performance, the power scaling laws, and the impacts of various system parameters on the achievable rate.

	abstract = {TeraHertz (THz) communications can satisfy the high data rate demand with massive bandwidth. However, severe path attenuation and hardware imperfection greatly alleviate its performance. Therefore, we utilize the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology and investigate the RIS-aided THz communications. We first prove that the small-scale amplitude fading of THz signals can be accurately modeled by the fluctuating two-ray distribution based on two THz signal measurement experiments conducted in a variety of different scenarios. To optimize the phase-shifts at the RIS elements, we propose a novel swarm intelligence-based method that does not require full channel estimation. We then derive exact statistical characterizations of end-to-end signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, we present asymptotic analysis to obtain more insights when the SNDR or the number of RIS’s elements is high. Finally, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic capacity. The tight upper bounds of ergodic capacity for both ideal and non-ideal radio frequency chains are obtained. It is interesting to find that increasing the number of RIS’s elements can significantly improve the THz communications system performance. For example, the ergodic capacity can increase up to 25% when the number of elements increases from 40 to 80, which incurs only insignificant costs to the system.}

	abstract = {The performance of distributed computing is restricted by the slowest worker nodes, known as stragglers, in the system. Coded computation has emerged as an efficient technique to mitigate the straggler effects in distributed computing. Most existing works only considered the computation straggler for single-hop networks. However, in multi-hop networks, the straggler effects will occur not only on worker nodes but also on relay nodes. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous multi-hop network. The nodes in the network are heterogeneous, i.e., their computation capacities and transmission capacities are different. We propose a hierarchical coding scheme for such a network. Firstly, we reorganize it into a hierarchical network containing multiple layers. Each layer in the network consists of several groups. Then, a new hierarchical coding scheme is proposed, where coding is applied to each group to mitigate the stragglers. By taking both the computation time and transmission time into consideration, the overall task completion time is derived. To improve the performance of the network, heterogeneous hierarchical coded computation (HHCC) algorithm is proposed to provide an asymptotically optimal task allocation strategy. Compared with existing uniform uncoded, load balanced uncoded, and heterogeneous coded matrix multiplication schemes, HHCC has significant improvement.}

Apart from theoretical interests, finding this limit is also desirable since spatial-coupled code ensembles approach this MAP threshold due to phenomenon termed as threshold saturation . However finding this MAP threshold, in general, is known to be computationally prohibitive. This work proposes a tractable method for estimating the MAP threshold for various families of sparse-graph code ensembles over non-binary complex-input additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Towards this, we provide a method to approximate the extended belief propagation generalized extrinsic information transfer (EBP-GEXIT) chart and estimate the MAP threshold by applying the Maxwell construction to it. To illustrate the validity of our method, we study spatial coupling for serially-concatenated turbo-codes and numerically observe threshold saturation of these codes to the MAP thresholds estimated via our method.}

	abstract = {The coded caching problem with shared caches where the server is equipped with multiple transmit antennas is considered. In a shared cache network, several users share a cache, but each user can access only a single cache. The fundamental limits of coded caching are known for the above setting under centralized uncoded placement. In the centralized case, to achieve the gains offered by coded caching, one requires a sub-packetization level which increases exponentially with the number of caches. The dedicated cache networks too had a similar issue, and placement delivery arrays (PDAs) were introduced as a solution to address the sub-packetization bottleneck of coded caching in the dedicated cache network. Our objective is to design coded caching schemes for shared caches with lower sub-packetization requirements than the existing schemes. By leveraging the PDA constructions, we propose a procedure to obtain new coded caching schemes for shared caches with reduced sub-packetization levels than the known schemes in both single and multi-antenna settings. The advantage of the proposed procedure is that all the existing PDA constructions can be transformed into coded caching schemes for shared caches, thereby reducing the sub-packetization level requirement. In addition, the proposed procedure also recovers the optimal caching schemes given by Parinello et al. by using a PDA corresponding to the Maddah-Ali Niesen scheme.}

	abstract = {Matrix multiplication is a fundamental building block in various distributed computing algorithms. In order to multiply large matrices, it is common practice to distribute the computation into multiple tasks running on different nodes. In order to tolerate stragglers among such nodes, various coding schemes have been proposed by adding additional coded tasks. However, most existing coding schemes for matrix multiplication are constructed for only one matrix multiplication, while batch matrix multiplication is common in large-scale distributed computing workloads. In this paper, we propose Rook Coding (RC), a novel polynomial-based coding framework for computing the multiplication of\nn\npairs of matrices in batch. Designed to achieve lower encoding time in practice, we construct RC as polynomials of much simpler forms than existing coding schemes for batch matrix multiplication, achieving a recovery threshold of\nO(\nn\nlog\n2\n 3\n)\n. Compared to existing coding schemes, RC achieves a lower encoding complexity in practice, because of its simpler forms in the encoding polynomials. Through extensive experiments, we show that RC can save the time of the whole job thanks to its low overhead of encoding.}

	abstract = {While many communications media, such as wireless and certain classes of wireline channels, typically lead to bursty errors, most decoders are designed assuming memoryless channels. Consequently, communication systems generally rely on interleaving over tens of thousands of bits to match decoder assumptions. Even for short high rate codes, awaiting sufficient data in interleaving and de-interleaving is a significant source of unwanted latency. We construct an extension to the recently proposed Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) algorithm, which we call GRAND-MO for GRAND Markov Order. By foregoing interleaving and instead making use of the bursty nature of noise, low-latency communication is possible with block error rates outperforming their interleaved counterparts by a substantial margin. We establish that certain well-known binary codes with structured code-word patterns are ill-suited for use in bursty channels, but Random Linear Codes (RLCs) prove robust to correlated noise. We further demonstrate that by operating directly on modulated symbols rather than de-mapped bits, GRAND-MO achieves further performance and complexity gains by exploiting information that is lost in demodulation. As a result, GRAND-MO provides one potential solution for applications that require ultra-reliable low latency communication.}

Buffer-aided (BA) relays are considered where finite size buffers are added to relays. For this setup, we propose a novel BA relaying strategy that selects the node that must transmit over one epoch in a block fading environment. Selecting a node depends on the buffer state information of all relays and on the availability of the hops. Moreover, the proposed relaying scheme is controlled by an adjustable parameter that allows the system to achieve multiple levels of tradeoff between the average packet delay (APD) and the outage probability (OP). A Markov chain model is adopted to evaluate the system’s performance and simple closed-form expressions were derived for the APD and OP based on an asymptotic analysis. The performance analysis proves the ability of the suggested relaying scheme to achieve significant OP and APD gains with small buffer sizes. Two variants of the proposed relaying scheme are particularly appealing. The APD-prioritizing variant achieves the smallest APD of 2K\nwithout improving the diversity order. The second OP-prioritizing variant reaches the full diversity order of K+1\nwhile increasing the asymptotic APD to K(K+3)\n.}

	abstract = {The orbital angular momentum (OAM) wireless communication technique is emerging as one of potential techniques for the Sixth generation (6G) wireless communication system. The most advantage of OAM wireless communication technique is the natural orthogonality among different OAM states. However, one of the most disadvantages is the crosstalk among different OAM states which is widely caused by the atmospheric turbulence and the misalignment between the transmitting and receiving antennas. Considering the OAM-based multiple-input multiple-output (OAM-MIMO) transmission system with unaligned antennas, a new channel model is proposed for performance analysis. Moreover, the purity and crosstalk models of the OAM-MIMO transmission system with unaligned antennas are derived for the non-Kolmogorov turbulence. Furthermore, the error probability, bit error rate (BER) and capacity models are derived for OAM-MIMO transmission systems with unaligned antennas. To overcome the disadvantage caused by the unaligned antennas and non-Kolmogorov turbulence, a new optimization algorithm of OAM state interval is proposed to improve the capacity of the OAM-MIMO transmission system. Numerical results indicate that the capacity of OAM-MIMO transmission system is improved by the proposed optimization algorithm. Specifically, the capacity increment of the OAM-MIMO transmission system adopting the proposed optimization algorithm is up to 28.7% and 320.3% when the angle of deflection between the transmitting and receiving antennas is −24 dB and −5 dB, respectively.}

	abstract = {The one-dimensional (1-D) Golay complementary set (GCS) has many well-known properties and has been widely employed in communications engineering. The concept of 1-D GCS can be extended to the two-dimensional (2-D) Golay complementary array set (GCAS) where the 2-D aperiodic autocorrelations of constituent arrays sum to zero except for the 2-D zero shift. The 2-D GCAS includes the 2-D Golay complementary array pair (GCAP) as a special case when the set size is 2. In this paper, 2-D generalized Boolean functions are introduced and constructions of 2-D GCAPs, 2-D GCASs, and 2-D Golay complementary array mates based on generalized Boolean functions are proposed. Explicit expressions of 2-D Boolean functions for 2-D GCAPs and 2-D GCASs are given. Therefore, they are all direct constructions without the aid of other existing 1-D or 2-D sequences. Moreover, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) properties of the column sequences and row sequences of the constructed 2-D GCAPs and 2-D GCASs are investigated and the PAPRs are proved to be upper bounded.}

	abstract = {Pliable index coding (PICOD) has recently been regarded as a promising solution that exploits the coding advantage to improve communication efficiency of content-type systems (e.g., recommendation system), where clients are pliable and are interested in receiving any new message that they do not have. PICOD aims to find an effective coding strategy that satisfies the demands of all clients with the minimum number of transmissions. However, most of the previous works mainly provided theoretical understanding on PICOD in special instances based on greedy algorithms. In contrast, in this paper, we present a flexible sparse and low-rank matrix modeling approach to minimize the number of transmissions for the general PICOD problems. This is achieved by establishing generalized pliable alignment conditions to guarantee the requirements of all clients. As the resulting non-convex problem is highly intractable, we further develop an alternating pursuit framework to detect the rank of the matrix to be recovered by using the rank-increasing strategy. To address the feasibility-detection issues in the existing methods, we propose an alternating projection algorithm, which admits closed-form expressions and avoids excessive sparsity inducing. Moreover, we establish the global convergence of the alternating projection algorithm with random initial points. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed alternating pursuit algorithm significantly reduces the number of transmissions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The fifth-generation (5G) and beyond standards are being challenged by the diverse requirements of modern use cases. Multicarrier modulation techniques are one of the key components of the physical layer (PHY) design, which has immense potential to improve efficiency and reliability. In current state-of-the-art wireless technologies (i.e., NR and IEEE 802.11ax) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used which has many disadvantages such as peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), out-of-band emission (OOBE), and sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO). To overcome these drawbacks several alternate multicarrier modulation techniques are being considered, such as discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM), and orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS). In this paper, we develop the physical layer abstraction (PLA) of these candidate multicarrier techniques to evaluate their performance under various use cases and scenarios. The PLA is a commonly used technique to avoid time-consuming PHY simulations in system-level simulators. To improve the accuracy of PLA in different fading conditions, we derive a fitting parameter as a function of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) variance. The validation results show that performance can be accurately estimated through the proposed multicarrier PLA. Moreover, PLA techniques are at least thousands of times faster compared to PHY simulations.}

In JECD-OFDM-DCSK, only some subcarriers are activated and additional information bits are transmitted by the indices of these activated subcarriers, thereby improving the data rate while reducing the energy consumption. The energy efficiency, peak to average power ratio (PAPR) performance and system complexity of JECD-OFDM-DCSK are analyzed and then compared to other systems. The comparison results show JECD-OFDM-DCSK can obtain higher energy efficiency and better PAPR performance compared to its competitors at the cost of higher system complexity. Furthermore, the bit error rate (BER) expressions of JECD-OFDM-DCSK are derived in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath fading channels. Simulation results show that the BER performance of JECD-OFDM-DCSK outperforms that of other OFDM-based DCSK systems. Finally, JECD-OFDM-DCSK performs much better than other systems over the underwater acoustic (UWA) channel, which validates the robustness of JECD-OFDM-DCSK.}

	abstract = {Caching popular contents at edge networks (such as small-cell base stations) has been proposed to deal with the ever-growing mobile traffic. At the meantime, recommendation system is able to shape user demands for further prompting caching gain. In this paper, we study a multi-antenna multi-cell edge network employing transmit beamforming with caching-aware recommendation and user association. We first establish a framework for the joint problem of beamforming, user association, content caching and recommendation to minimize the content transmission delay of mobile users, by specifying a set of necessary conditions for all four component functions of the network. The resulting optimization problem corresponds to a non-convex, multi-timescale, and mixed-integer programming problem, which is hard to handle. To deal with the difficulty in solving the joint optimization problem by the direct formulation, we equivalently decompose it into three sub-problems. Then, we develop a computationally-efficient iterative algorithm to obtain the sub-optimal solution, where the three subproblems are tackled iteratively. Simulation results are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain lower transmission delay than baseline schemes.}

Hence, toward a better comprehension of neuronal information processing and communication from an information-energy standpoint, this paper presents the following novel results on the capacity-achieving distribution: 1) For the first time, the paper presents the probability mass function of the number of spikes observed in a given time window where inter-spike intervals follow the Inverse Gaussian distribution. To extend this result, the first and second moments of the underlying probability mass function will be determined. 2) The paper proves that the relationship between the underlying probability mass function and the marginal distribution of the intensity parameter is one-to-one when the parameter is a random variable. 3) Proof that a unique capacity-achieving distribution for the stimulus intensity exists in a discrete form with a finite number of mass points that varies with the energy budget. Then, the paper presents an algorithm that numerically computes a trade-off between the maximum transmit bits and the coding-duration energy expenditure. Subsequently, the optimal multiplier along with the optimal distribution and the corresponding capacity will be obtained.}

The method maximizes an achievable information rate, while simultaneously satisfying constraints on the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This allows control of the tradeoff between spectral containment, peak power, and communication rate. Evaluation on an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel shows significant reduction of ACLR and PAPR compared to a conventional baseline relying on quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and root-raised-cosine (RRC), without significant loss of information rate. When considering a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) multipath channel, the learned waveform and neural receiver enable competitive or higher rates than an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) baseline, while reducing the ACLR by\n10 dB\nand the PAPR by\n2 dB\n. The proposed method incurs no additional complexity on the transmitter side and might be an attractive tool for waveform design of beyond-5G systems.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO systems are intrinsic components of 5G and beyond. These systems rely on using beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. Current beam codebooks, however, generally consist of a large number of narrow beams that scan all possible directions, leading to large training overhead. Further, these codebooks do not normally account for hardware impairments or possible non-uniform array geometries, and their calibration process is expensive. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops an efficient online machine learning framework that learns how to adapt the codebook beam patterns to the specific deployment, surrounding environment, user distribution, and hardware characteristics. This is done by designing a novel complex-valued neural network architecture in which the neuron weights directly model the beamforming weights of the analog phase shifters, accounting for the key hardware constraints. This model learns the codebook beams through online and self-supervised training avoiding the need for explicit channel state information. This respects the practical situations where the channel is imperfect or hard to obtain. Simulation results highlight the capability of the proposed solution in learning environment and hardware aware beam codebooks, which reduce the training overhead and improve the robustness against possible hardware impairments.}

We formulate the MBS power allocation and UAV service zone selection problem as an Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the delay ignored system (DIS) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on Q-learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Then the proposed DRL-based scheme is extended in time delay system (TDS) to estimate the current optimal action with the outdated channel information. We also formulate the user scheduling as a 0-1 optimization problem and solve it by dividing into sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based resource scheduling scheme can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency compared with the existing schemes.}

This joint optimization problem can be solved suboptimally by the non-convex optimization techniques, which however usually require complicated mathematical transformations and are computationally intensive. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. To achieve a higher learning efficiency and a lower reward variance, we propose another algorithm based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) method. In these proposed algorithms, a reward impact adjustment approach is proposed to improve their learning efficiency and stability. Simulation results show that the two proposed algorithms can achieve comparable SU rate performance with much shorter running time, as compared to the existing non-convex optimization-based benchmark algorithm, and that the proposed SAC-based algorithm learns faster and achieves a higher average reward with lower variance, as compared to the proposed DDPG-based algorithm.}

We derive a closed-form network spectral efficiency lower bound by considering spatial correlation at the BS and IRS. We demonstrate the importance of modelling spatial correlation by simplifying this lower bound for uncorrelated channels to show that the IRS capability to modify the wireless medium now is significantly impeded. This lower bound, which is a function of only the long-term channel statistics, is also used to maximize the non-concave global energy efficiency metric by optimally allocating the transmit powers, and by designing the IRS phases. We derive closed-form updates for optimizing the transmit powers using Lagrangian dual, Quadratic, and Dinkelbach’s transforms. We then optimize the IRS phases by using the projected gradient ascent algorithm. We numerically show that increasing the number of IRS elements can help a FD mMIMO BS outperform its half-duplex counterpart, which otherwise under-performs due to its limited ability to cancel various FD interferences.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been regarded as a promising and revolutionary technology for future wireless communication systems owing to its capability of tailoring signal propagation environment in an energy/spectrum/ hardware-efficient manner. However, most existing studies on IRS optimizations are based on a simple and ideal reflection model that is impractical in hardware implementation, which thus leads to severe performance loss in realistic wideband/multi-band systems. To deal with this problem, in this paper we first propose a more practical and more tractable IRS reflection model that describes the difference of reflection responses for signals at different frequencies. Then, we investigate the joint transmit beamforming and IRS reflection beamforming design for an IRS-assisted multi-cell multi-band system. Both power minimization and sum-rate maximization problems are solved by exploiting popular second-order cone programming (SOCP), Riemannian manifold, minimization-majorization (MM), weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Simulation results illustrate the significant performance improvement of our proposed joint transmit beamforming and reflection design algorithms based on the practical reflection model in terms of power saving and rate enhancement.}

	abstract = {Owing to the factors such as controllable mobility, ready-to-use technology, low cost, easy implementation, and so on, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) possesses tremendous potential to be one of the primary candidates for next-generation (6G) wireless networks. This paper presents a UAV-assisted multiuser communication network where a multiple antenna UAV base station (BS) serves multiple single antenna ground users (GUs). UAV-BS uses a laser source-based charging mechanism to fulfill its power requirement and applies simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in the downlink in order to provide desired power to energy-constrained GUs. Also, a clustering-based hybrid multiple access technique is used that combines both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) signaling to transmit the information to all GUs, simultaneously. Due to the involved analytical complexity corresponding to the multiple antennas and users, we use a hybrid beamforming method for efficient communication. Next, we analyze the performance of the proposed framework in terms of user outage probabilities, their respective throughput, and average power harvested considering non-linear energy harvesting and derive expressions of these performance metrics. Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem where the throughput of one GU is maximized by optimally choosing the power allocation parameter while ensuring the desired target throughput at other GU in each cluster. We also illustrate how crucial is the optimal selection of the target rates to maximize the network performance. Simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of derived expressions and to highlight the dominance of hybrid beamforming and hybrid NOMA compared to conventional methods on the performance of the considered network.}

	abstract = {Most existing random access schemes for machine-type communications (MTC) simply adopt a uniform preamble selection distribution, irrespective of the underlying device activity distributions. Hence, they may yield unsatisfactory access efficiency. In this paper, we model device activities for MTC as multiple Bernoulli random variables following an arbitrary multivariate Bernoulli distribution which can reflect both dependent and independent device activities. Then, we optimize preamble selection and access barring for random access in MTC according to the underlying joint device activity distribution. Specifically, we investigate three cases of the joint device activity distribution, i.e., the cases of perfect, imperfect, and unknown joint device activity distributions, and formulate the average, worst-case average, and sample average throughput maximization problems, respectively. The problems in the three cases are challenging nonconvex problems. In the case of perfect joint device activity distribution, we develop an iterative algorithm and a low-complexity iterative algorithm to obtain stationary points of the original problem and an approximate problem, respectively. In the case of imperfect joint device activity distribution, we develop an iterative algorithm and a low-complexity iterative algorithm to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of an equivalent problem and a stationary point of an approximate problem, respectively. Finally, in the case of unknown joint device activity distribution, we develop an iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point. The proposed solutions are widely applicable and outperform existing solutions for dependent and independent device activities.}

	abstract = {In satellite-based Internet of Things (S-IoT) system, the timely status updating of terrestrial sensing user equipments (UEs) to satellite could be hampered by the long propagation delay, especially in massive machine type communications (mMTC). To guarantee the information freshness in S-IoT, a new performance indicator called age of information (AoI) is exploited to analyze the average AoI (AAoI) in the overload case of mMTC, and a grant free age-optimal (GFAO) random access protocol is proposed to lower the AAoI. Specifically, the closed-form expression of AAoI is derived by tracing the instantaneous AoI evolution of each UE through Markov analysis. Then, the proposed GFAO random access protocol is proved to achieve a minimum AAoI and a maximum throughput in S-IoT, by adjusting the number of access time slots in each transmission frame in the overload case of mMTC. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis, and show that there exists different optimal value of access time slots in system load region from 0.2 to 3, which can minimize AAoI and maximize throughput in the proposed GFAO random access protocol.}

	abstract = {A secure energy efficient approach is proposed to connect Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that operate with limited power resources. This is done by optimizing simultaneously the energy efficiency, the communication rate and the network security while limiting the potential data leakage and tracking the finite battery status evolution. The proposed model uses spatial diversity in addition to artificial jamming introduced by an intermediate device to forward the data from the sensors to the destination and to secure the communication links without draining the rechargeable batteries. The energy harvested by the source is also maximized without affecting the security level of the network. The outage secrecy capacity is derived to evaluate the security level. Furthermore, the system power stability is analyzed using Markov chains and statistical approaches to validate the efficiency of the proposed technique in maintaining the system in a self-sufficient mode and making it operate without the assistance of external power resources.}

We used the Acoustic-WiFi framework to develop a Power Saving Mode (PSM) scheme; A2PSM , and a smart contention resolution scheme; Harmony . In A2PSM , we propose an acoustic channel assisted power saving scheme for the Wi-Fi interface, which addresses the inefficiency of the existing power saving schemes in smart devices. In this scheme, we leverage the low power consumption of the acoustic interfaces to reduce the wakeup events of the Wi-Fi interface when it is in power saving mode. We develop a small-scale prototype testbed on real smartphones to evaluate the proposed A2PSM scheme. Experiments show that A2PSM could save up to more than 25% more power than the existing schemes. In Harmony , we address the overhead of the Wi-Fi backoff scheme (i.e., contention window countdown, DIFS) and reduce the overall collisions among the devices. Harmony uses the acoustic channel for contention resolution in Wi-Fi networks. We also evaluate Harmony using real testbed and simulation. Experiments using the testbed show a 40% gain in throughput over the 802.11 Wi-Fi backoff scheme, while simulation results show a gain of more than 27% for dense networks.}

The proposed design combines direct current optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) and a spatial multiplexing MIMO architecture. For such an ultra-high-speed line-of-sight (LOS) OWC link with low divergence laser beams, maintaining alignment is of high importance. In this paper, two types of misalignment error between the transmitter and receiver are distinguished, namely, radial displacement error and orientation angle error, and they are thoroughly modeled in a unified analytical framework assuming Gaussian laser beams, resulting in a generalized misalignment model (GMM). The derived GMM is then extended to MIMO arrays and the performance of the MIMO-OFDM OWC system is analyzed in terms of the aggregate data rate. Novel insights are provided into the system performance based on computer simulations by studying various influential factors such as beam waist, array configuration and different misalignment errors, which can be used as guidelines for designing short range Tb/s MIMO OWC systems.}

Quantum algorithms provide complexity advantage of a certain class of problems on a quantum computer with fewer physical resources as compared to their classical counterparts. The proposed algorithms make use of the quantum phase estimation (QPE) as its core computing component. We have introduced an analytical quantum framework to map from classical to quantum in the context of target detection. Target detection involves an appropriate choice of threshold based on the probability of detection or false alarm. We exploited the massive sensor array structure and invoked the random matrix theory to propose an optimal threshold. It also takes into account the quantum measurement noise in the framework. Numerical simulations are performed to ascertain the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results suggest near term applications of the quantum algorithm for large-scale linear systems.}

Significant developments in quantum technologies have outclassed their classical counterparts, thus envisioning the realization of a quantum internet.

In this paper, we study two secure network connectivity concerns, namely, privacy and anonymity , in quantum information retrieval systems. To this end, we propose a state-of-the-art single-server multi-user quantum anonymous private information retrieval (QAPIR) protocol. To actualize this, we utilize anonymous entanglement as a quantum resource. We show that the QAPIR protocol not only provides privacy but also introduces anonymity as an added layer of security in quantum networks. Furthermore, we also detail a comparative security analysis that establishes the desirable properties of our proposal.}

We propose an uncoordinated random jamming scheme in which those unscheduled sensors send jamming signals with a certain probability to defeat the eavesdroppers. With the aid of stochastic geometry theory and order statistics, we derive analytical expressions for the connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability to characterize transmission reliability and secrecy, respectively. Based on the obtained analytical results, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the sum secrecy throughput subject to both reliability and secrecy constraints, considering a joint design of the wiretap code rates for each scheduled sensor and the jamming probability for the unscheduled sensors. We provide both optimal and low-complexity sub-optimal algorithms to tackle the above problem, and further reveal various properties on the optimal parameters which are useful to guide practical designs. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed random jamming scheme is beneficial for improving the sum secrecy throughput, and the optimal jamming probability is the result of trade-off between secrecy and throughput. We also show that the throughput performance of the sub-optimal scheme approaches that of the optimal one when facing a stringent reliability constraint or a loose secrecy constraint.}

	abstract = {The fact that the millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel has sparse support in the spatial domain has motivated recent compressed sensing (CS)-based mmWave channel estimation methods, where the angles of arrivals (AoAs) and angles of departures (AoDs) are quantized using angle dictionary matrices. However, the existing CS-based methods usually obtain the estimation result through one-stage channel sounding that have two limitations: (i) the requirement of large-dimensional dictionary and (ii) unresolvable quantization error. These two drawbacks are irreconcilable; improvement of the one implies deterioration of the other. To address these challenges, we propose, in this paper, a two-stage method to estimate the AoAs and AoDs of mmWave channels. In the proposed method, the channel estimation task is divided into two stages, Stage I and Stage II. Specifically, in Stage I, the AoAs are estimated by solving a multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem. In Stage II, based on the estimated AoAs, the receive sounders are designed to estimate AoDs. The dimension of the angle dictionary in each stage can be reduced, which in turn reduces the computational complexity substantially. We then analyze the successful recovery probability (SRP) of the proposed method, revealing the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing one-stage CS-based methods. We further enhance the reconstruction performance by performing resource allocation between the two stages. We also overcome the unresolvable quantization error issue present in the prior techniques by applying the atomic norm minimization method to each stage of the proposed two-stage approach. The simulation results illustrate the substantially improved performance with low complexity of the proposed two-stage method.}

In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for IRS-assisted mm-wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. By leveraging the sparsity of mm-wave channels in the angular domain, we formulate the channel estimation problem as an \\ell _{1}\n-norm regularized optimization problem with fixed-rank constraints. To tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by capitalizing on alternating minimization and manifold optimization (MO), which yields a locally optimal solution. To further reduce the computational complexity of the estimation algorithm, we propose a compressive sensing- (CS-) based channel estimation approach. In particular, a three-stage estimation protocol is put forward where the subproblem in each stage can be solved via low-complexity CS methods. Furthermore, based on the acquired channel state information (CSI) of the cascaded channel, we design a passive beamforming algorithm for maximization of the spectral efficiency. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MO-based estimation (MO-EST) and beamforming algorithms significantly outperform two benchmark schemes while the CS-based estimation (CS-EST) algorithm strikes a balance between performance and complexity.}

	abstract = {As the requirements related to resolution or the data rate increase, most angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation problems can be assumed to be under a broadband signal model. In this paper, AoA estimation using a nonuniform planar array (NUPA), which aims to resolve more signals and reduce mutual coupling, is considered under a broadband signal model. The analysis is conducted in both the space and frequency domains, and a broadband co-array is proposed to improve the performance of the AoA estimation. The broadband co-array is generated as follows: First, the received broadband signal is decomposed into several narrowband signals, and the samples from different frequency bins are transformed to space-domain samples to generate a virtual array. Then, the second-order statistics of the virtual array are used to generate the broadband co-array. The virtual array can decrease the number of element pairs with small interelement spacing to reduce mutual coupling in AoA estimations. With the help of the virtual array, the following broadband co-array can greatly increase the degrees of freedom, resulting in more resolvable signals and lower Cramer-Rao bounds of AoA estimation. An optimization method based on sparse recovery is proposed to locate the array. The simulation results confirm the AoA estimation performance achieved by the designed NUPA.}

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly used pattern analysis method that maps high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space maximizing the data variance, that results in the promotion of separability of data. Inspired by the principle of PCA, a novel type of learning discriminative matrix information geometry (MIG) detectors in the unsupervised scenario are developed, and applied to signal detection in nonhomogeneous environments. Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices can be used to model the sample data, while the clutter covariance matrix is estimated by the geometric mean of a set of secondary HPD matrices. We define a projection that maps the HPD matrices in a high-dimensional manifold to a low-dimensional and more discriminative one to increase the degree of separation of HPD matrices by maximizing the data variance. Learning a mapping can be formulated as a two-step mini-max optimization problem in Riemannian manifolds, which can be solved by the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm. Three discriminative MIG detectors are illustrated with respect to different geometric measures, i.e., the Log-Euclidean metric, the Jensen–Bregman LogDet divergence and the symmetrized Kullback–Leibler divergence. Simulation results show that performance improvements of the novel MIG detectors can be achieved compared with the conventional detectors and their state-of-the-art counterparts within nonhomogeneous environments.}

For the VPS architecture, a hybrid precoding design (HPD) scheme, called VPS-HPD, is proposed to optimize the phases according to the channel state information by alternately optimizing the analog precoder and digital precoder. To reduce the computational complexity of the VPS-HPD scheme, a low-complexity HPD scheme for the VPS architecture (VPS-LC-HPD) including alternating optimization in three stages is then proposed, where each stage has a closed-form solution and can be efficiently implemented. To reduce the hardware complexity introduced by the large number of switches, we consider a group-connected VPS architecture and propose a HPD scheme, where the HPD problem is divided into multiple independent subproblems with each subproblem flexibly solved by the VPS-HPD or VPS-LC-HPD scheme. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the propose schemes and show that the proposed schemes can achieve satisfactory spectral efficiency performance with reduced computational complexity or hardware complexity.}

By adopting the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion, we develop two new transceiver design algorithms for such a system. The first one employs an iterative procedure to design the source, relay, feed-forward, and feedback matrices. The second algorithm is a non-iterative suboptimal approach which decomposes the optimization problem into two tractable subproblems and obtains the source and relay precoding matrices by solving the two subproblems sequentially. Simulation results validate the better MSE and bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed algorithms and show that the non-iterative suboptimal method has a negligible performance loss when the ratio of the source node transmission power to the relay node transmission power is small. In addition, the computational complexity analysis suggests that the second algorithm and one iteration of the first algorithm have the same order of complexity. As the first algorithm typically converges within a few iterations, both proposed algorithms exhibit a low complexity order.}

This paper studies the joint transceiver and IRS designs in IRS-assisted multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems under both perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI. Specifically, the transmit precoder, reflection coefficients at the IRS, and receive equalizer are jointly optimized to minimize the data detection mean square error (MSE), subject to the transmission power constraint and the modulus constraints for IRS reflection coefficients. The design problems, non-convex and challenging, are tackled under the framework of alternating optimization. For the design with perfect CSI, we successively optimize the IRS reflection coefficients given the precoder and present the closed-form optimal angle of one reflection coefficient given the others. For the robust design with imperfect CSI, we first average the detection MSE over channel uncertainties by using a generalized statistical CSI error model. Then, the averaged MSE is approximated by a more tractable upper bound. Subsequently, the robust design problem is elaborately transformed into a form similar to the problem with perfect CSI. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.}

In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided reinforcement learning (RL) based secure WBAN transmission scheme that enables the coordinator to jointly optimize the sensor encryption key and transmit power, as well as the IRS phase shifts against active eavesdropping. A Dyna architecture is designed to improve the learning efficiency with the simulated transmission experiences and safe exploration is applied to avoid the risky policies that result in severe data leakage. A deep RL based WBAN transmission scheme is proposed to further improve the secure transmission with lower eavesdropping rate, intercept probability, sensor energy consumption and transmission latency for the coordinators that support deep learning. We analyze the computational complexity and investigate the equilibrium of the secure transmission game between the coordinator and the eavesdropper to provide the performance bounds, which is verified via the simulation results, showing the efficacy of our proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {In the next generation of wireless systems, massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) offers high angular resolution for localization. By virtue of large number of antennas, Angle of Arrival (AoA) of User Terminals (UTs) can be estimated accurately. Measurements of Dense Multipath Channel (DMC) indicate multipath signals contribute up to 95% of total link power. This fact urges the necessity of studying the contribution of multipath signals accompanying dominant path in AoA estimation. We obtain a deterministic form for Cramer-Rao Lower Bound ( CRLB\n) in multi-user scenario when contribution of multipath signals is considered. We do this when the multipath signals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) with arbitrary distribution. Then, we redefine a localization efficiency function for multi-user scenario and optimize it with respect to (w.r.t) the number of antennas. When only a subset of available antennas is used, we prove that CRLB\ncan be minimized w.r.t which set is used. An antenna selection strategy that minimizes CRLB\nis proposed. As a benchmark, we apply the proposed antenna selection to MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm and study its efficiency. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our analysis and show significant improvement in efficiency when the proposed antenna selection is employed.}

	abstract = {The integration of aerial platforms to provide ubiquitous coverage and connectivity for densely deployed terrestrial networks is expected to be a reality in the emerging sixth-generation networks. Energy-effificient and secure transmission designs are two important components for integrated terrestrial-aerial networks (ITAN). Inlight of the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for significantly reducing the system power consumption and boosting information security, this paper proposes a multi-layer RIS-assisted secure ITAN architecture to defend against simultaneous jamming and eavesdropping attacks, and investigates energy-efficient hybrid beamforming for it. Specifically, with the availability of imperfect angular channel state information (CSI), we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework for the joint optimization of the user’s received decoder, the terrestrial and aerial digital precoder, and the multi-layer RIS analog precoder to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) performance. For the design of the received decoder, a heuristic beamforming scheme is proposed to convert the worst-case design problem into a min-max one and facilitate the developing a closed-form solution. For the design of the digital precoder, we propose an iterative sequential convex approximation approach via capitalizing the auxiliary variables and first-order Taylor series expansion. Finally, a monotonic vertex-update algorithm with a penalty convex-concave procedure (P-CCP) is proposed to obtain the analog precoder with satisfactory performance. Numerical results show the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework and architecture over various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface based backscatter communication (IRS-BackCom), in order to realize computational task offloading of energy-constrained mobile edge computing network in a self-sustainable manner. Specifically, the system operation is divided into two phases. In the first one, the ambient signal energy from a power beacon (PB) either provides the energy supply of local computing and energy harvesting circuits, or flows into the energy storage, when reaching the IRS. In the second one, the stored energy is used to enable IRS-BackCom for partial computational data offloading and energize local computing circuit. Based on this, the maximization problem of sum computational bits is formulated. By jointly optimizing the beamforming vector at the PB, the backscatter matrix at the IRS, the time scheduling of two-phase process, as well as the time of local computing, sum computational bits are maximized. In addition, this paper proposes element clustering to realize BackCom, so as to reduce the control and computation complexity of IRS. According to different operating mechanisms, two cluster operation modes are considered, namely independent cluster operation mode and joint cluster operation mode. Simulation results demonstrate the achievable sum computational bits by the proposed IRS-BackCom schemes.}

The existing approaches are almost zeroth order methods, and the few first order methods mainly ignore the allocation fairness, computational efficiency, and backhaul constraints. In this paper, we formulate the UAV placement problem as a constrained optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the fair coverage versus energy consumption while satisfying the backhaul constraints at different time nodes. To guarantee fair QoS allocation, we introduce a novel fairness index to ensure fair communication opportunity and the novel region coverage ratio to avoid excess QoS on covered spots. An accurate and efficient proximal stochastic gradient descent based alternating algorithm that iteratively executes two optimization steps is proposed to optimize the UAV locations, which enables the fast single point-based first order methods to solve the complex problems with constraints. Experiment results manifest that the proposed algorithm performs well both in synthetic data scenario and in real city scenario. Furthermore, the proposed first order algorithm is more efficient than the existing zeroth order algorithm, typically referring to the meta-heuristic method.}

	abstract = {Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based channel state information (CSI) estimation schemes are developed for filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) systems using offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM). Initially, an SBL-based channel estimation scheme is designed for a frequency-selective quasi-static single-input single-output (SISO)-FBMC system, relying on the interference approximation method (IAM). The IAM technique, although has low complexity, is only suitable for channels exhibiting mild frequency-selectivity. Hence, an alternative time-domain (TD) model based sparse channel estimation framework is developed for highly frequency-selective channels. Subsequently, the Kalman filtering (KF)-based IAM and its TD counterpart are developed for sparse doubly-selective CSI estimation in SISO-FBMC systems. These schemes are also extended to FBMC-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, for both quasi-static and doubly-selective channels, after demonstrating the special block and group-sparse structures of the IAM and TD-based models respectively, which are the characteristic features of such channels. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bounds (BCRLBs) and the time-recursive BCRLBs are derived for the proposed quasi-static as well as doubly-selective sparse CSI estimation models, respectively. Our numerical results closely match the analytical findings, demonstrating the enhanced performance of the proposed schemes over the existing techniques.}

The topic of THz communications became very important and appealing to the research community due to 6G wireless systems design and development in recent years. Many papers are getting published covering different aspects of wireless systems using the THz band. With this paper, our aim is looking back to the last decade and revisiting the old problems and pointing out what has been achieved in the research community so far. Furthermore, in this paper, open challenges and new research directions still to be investigated for the THz band communication systems are presented, by covering diverse topics ranging from devices, channel behavior, communication and networking, to physical testbeds and demonstration systems.

To characterize and analytically evaluate the AOSM, a comprehensive error performance analysis is presented with single antenna reception. We theoretically derive a tight upper-bound for the symbol error probability (SEP) in closed-form based on an improved union-bound. The exact explicit asymptotic formula of the SEP at high SNR is provided as well. These results demonstrate that the transmit-diversity of proposed AOSM-(multiple-input single-output) MISO scheme is not only successfully achieved, but also elevated to be equal to the number of antennas in each antenna group. Moreover, it also reveals an important performance trend: at high SNR, with a fixed number of transmit antennas and a given data-rate, the SEP performance of the AOSM-MISO scheme can be successively enhanced by utilizing less antennas groups and bigger size of the signal constellation, because of the increase in transmit-diversity. Furthermore, the PA-aided SM-MISO is a special case of our AOSM-MISO. We are the first to provide the exact transmit-diversity gain for this conventional system and show that the PA pre-scaling scheme only can not improve the transmit-diversity of SM. This result sharpens the empirical diversity approximation results proposed in the existing literature. Simulation results well validate the analytical derivations, and indicate that our AOSM system can effectively improve system performance with high transmit-diversity at low-complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a class of hybrid coupled serially concatenated codes (HC-SCC), in which coupling is achieved by re-encoding partial outputs from both the outer and the inner encoders. Firstly, we derive the exact density evolution (DE) equations over the binary erasure channels (BECs) for the HC-SCCs, which can be used to analyze the impact of the coupling ratios and the coupling memories on the performances of the HC-SCCs. Secondly, we present a genie-aided lower bound for the proposed HC-SCCs to estimate their error-floors. Thirdly, we use the DE equations to design randomly punctured HC-SCCs, including rate-compatible HC-SCCs. The analytical and the numerical results show that: 1) for comparable coupling memories, the iterative decoding thresholds of the proposed HC-SCC ensembles are better than those of the recently introduced spatially coupled serially concatenated code (SC-SCC) ensembles and the partially parity-coupled turbo code (PPC-TC) ensembles; 2) with outer coupling memory five and inner coupling memory five, the iterative decoding thresholds of the rate-compatible HC-SCCs over the BECs are 0.0003 away from the corresponding channel capacities for a wide range of coding rates; 3) simulation results over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and the BECs are provided to confirm the performance advantages of the HC-SCCs. Particularly, the simulation results show that the HC-SCCs admit lower error-floor than the SC-SCCs and the rate-compatible HC-SCCs perform better than the PPC-TCs, which are consistent with the results of DE analysis.}

	abstract = {We study the rack-aware storage system where all storage nodes are organized in racks and within each rack the nodes can communicate freely without taxing the system bandwidth. Rack-aware regenerating codes (RRCs) were proposed for minimizing the repair bandwidth for single erasures. In the initial setting of RRCs, the repair of a single node requires the participation of all the remaining nodes in the rack containing the failed node as well as a large number of helper racks containing no failures. Consequently, the repair may be infeasible in front of multiple node failures. In this work, a relaxed repair model that can tolerate multiple node failures by simultaneously reducing the intra-rack connections and cross-rack connections is proposed. A tradeoff between the storage and repair bandwidth under the relaxed repair model is derived, and parameters of the two extreme points on the tradeoff curve are characterized for the minimum storage and minimum bandwidth respectively. Moreover, two codes corresponding to the extreme points are explicitly constructed over the fields of size comparable to the code length and with the lowest sub-packetization. Finally, for the convenience of practical use, systematic encoding processes for the two codes are also established.}

This paper analyzes the characteristics of underwater acoustic networks (UANs) as well as the issues of existing OFCs applied in UANs. Aiming at these issues, two optimization objectives of OFCs are put forward for UANs. In addition, a recursive OFC with limited feedback (ROFC-LF) is presented for UANs. The ROFC-LF reduces the consumption of bandwidth and energy caused by the transmission of useless coding packets. Through limited feedback, the problem of low channel utilization in UANs with half-duplex communication is solved. Furthermore, a data transmission mechanism based on the ROFC-LF for UANs is presented. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed transmission mechanism based on the ROFC-LF scheme outperforms the existing OFC schemes in terms of overhead, computational complexity, coding efficiency and energy consumption. Consequently, the ROFC-LF is suitable for UANs with constrained resources.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the antenna selection (AS) problem in full-duplex (FD) cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, where a multi-antenna FD relay bridges the connection between the multi-antenna base station and NOMA far user. Specifically, two AS schemes, namely max-U1 and max-U2, are proposed to maximize the end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at either or both near and far users, respectively. Moreover, a two-stage AS scheme, namely quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning scheme, is designed to realize a specific rate at the far user while improving the near user’s rate. To enhance the performance of the QoS provisioning AS scheme, the idea of dynamic antenna clustering is applied at the relay to adaptively partition the relay’s antennas into transmit and receive subsets. The proposed AS schemes’ exact outage probability and achievable rate expressions are derived. To provide more insight, closed-form asymptotic outage probability expressions for the max-U1 and max-U2 AS schemes are obtained. Our results show that while the QoS provisioning AS scheme can deliver a near-optimal performance for static antenna setup at the relay, it provides up to 12% average sum rate gain over the optimum AS selection with fixed antenna setup.}

	abstract = {We investigate the optimal signal detection problem in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with the generalized spatial modulation (GSM) scheme, which can be formulated as a closest lattice point search (CLPS). To identify invalid signals, an efficient pruning strategy is needed while searching on the GSM decision tree. However, the existing algorithms have exponential complexity, whereas they are infeasible in large-scale GSM-MIMO systems. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a memory-efficient pruning strategy by leveraging the combinatorial nature of the GSM signal structure. Thus, the required memory size is squared to the number of transmit antennas. We further propose an efficient memory-bounded maximum likelihood (ML) search (EM-MLS) algorithm by jointly employing the proposed pruning strategy and the memory-bounded best-first algorithm. Theoretical and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal bit error rate (BER) performance, while its memory size can be bounded. Moreover, the expected time complexity decreases exponentially with increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the system’s excess degree of freedom, and it often converges to squared time under practical scenarios.}

Considering the nonlinear movement of the nanomachines, an extended Kalman filter is employed to estimate the distance from the transmitter. Furthermore, based on the predicted distance, to keep the number of received molecules for bit 1 at a stable level, we employ power control on the number of transmitted molecules based on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver and the residual molecules in the channel from the previous transmission. Finally, the optimal detection threshold is obtained by minimizing the error probability. It is verified that a fixed optimal detection threshold can be effective for the power control scheme in the mobile MC. The bit error rate (BER) performance of our scheme is verified via simulation results.}

It has been shown that orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation performs well in such high-mobility scenarios by transforming the time-varying channels into the delay-Doppler domain. In this paper, we develop a joint channel estimation and data detection algorithm for OTFS-based LEO satellite communications. Firstly, we adopt the powerful variational Bayesian inference (VBI) method for estimating the delay-Doppler channel vector, which contains the channel gain, the delay and the Doppler. Secondly, we exploit the unknown data symbols in an OTFS frame as ‘virtual pilots’ for improving the accuracy of channel estimation and detect them simultaneously. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves improved channel estimation mean square error and bit error rate performance than its conventional counterparts.}

In the considered system, fog access points (F-APs) and cache-enabled D2D (CE-D2D) users are equipped with local caches that alleviate traffic burden at the fronthaul and facilitate rapid delivery of the users’ contents. To this end, the CLNC scheme optimizes the coding decisions, transmission rates, and power levels of both F-APs and CE-D2D users, and RL scheme optimizes caching strategy. A joint content placement and delivery problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a goal to maximize system sum-rate. The problem is an NP-hard problem. To efficiently solve it, we first develop an innovative decentralized CLNC coalition formation (CLNC-CF) switch algorithm to obtain a stable solution for the content delivery problem, where F-APs and CE-D2D users utilize CLNC resource allocation. By considering statistics of channel and users’ content request into account, we then develop a multi-agent RL algorithm for optimizing the content placement at both F-APs and CE-D2D users. Simulation results show that the proposed joint CLNC-CF-RL framework can effectively improve the sum-rate by up to 30%, 60%, and 150%, respectively, compared to: 1) an optimal uncoded algorithm, 2) a standard rate-aware-NC algorithm, and 3) a benchmark classical NC with network-layer optimization.}

First, the new vector quantisation technique is based on a class of parametrised companders applied on each component of the normalised CSI vector. Our algorithm chooses a suitable compander in an intuitively simple way whenever empirical data are available. Then, the sequences of quantisation indices are compressed using a context-tree-based approach. Essentially, we update the estimate of the conditional distribution of the source at each instant and encode the current symbol with the estimated distribution. The algorithms have low complexity, are linear-time in both the spatial dimension and time duration, and can be implemented in an online fashion. We run simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in such scenarios.}

Unlike most existing studies on specific designs of improved receivers, this paper investigates information theoretic limits of all possible receivers. For independent and identically distributed (IID) complex Gaussian inputs, we obtain an exact characterization of information rate of ACO-OFDM with improved receivers for all SNRs. It is proved that the high-SNR gain of improved receivers asymptotically achieve 1/4 bits per channel use, which is equivalent to 3 dB in electrical SNR or 1.5 dB in optical SNR; as the SNR decreases, the maximum achievable SNR gain of improved receivers decreases monotonically to a non-zero low-SNR limit, corresponding to an information rate gain of 36.3%. For practically used constellations, we derive an upper bound on the gain of improved receivers. Numerical results demonstrate that the upper bound can be approached to within 1 dB in optical SNR by combining existing improved receivers and coded modulation. We also show that our information theoretic analyses can be extended to Flip-OFDM and PAM-DMT. Our results imply that, for the considered schemes, improved receivers may reduce the gap to channel capacity significantly at low-to-moderate SNR.}

Considering users’ privacy, model sharing-based federated learning (FL) that migrates model parameters but not private data from edge devices to a central cloud is particularly attractive for edge-intelligent networks. Due to multiple rounds of iterative updating of high-dimensional model parameters between base station (BS) and edge devices, the communication reliability is a critical issue of FL for edge-intelligent networks. We reveal the impacts of the errors generated during model broadcast and model aggregation via wireless channels caused by channel fading, interference and noise on the accuracy of FL, especially when there exists channel uncertainty. To alleviate the impacts, we propose a robust FL algorithm for edge-intelligent networks with channel uncertainty, which is formulated as a worst-case optimization problem with joint device selection and transceiver design. Finally, simulation results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology that is able to create a favorable wireless signal propagation environment by collaboratively reconfiguring the passive reflecting elements yet with low hardware and energy cost. In IRS-aided wireless communication systems, channel modeling is a fundamental task for communication algorithm design and performance optimization, which however is also very challenging since in-depth domain knowledge and technical expertise in radio signal propagations are required, especially for modeling the high-dimensional cascaded base station (BS)-IRS and IRS-user channels (also referred to as the reflected channels). In this paper, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (GAN)-based channel modeling framework to autonomously learn the reflected channel distribution, without complex theoretical analysis or data processing. The designed GAN (also named as IRS-GAN) is trained to reach the Nash equilibrium of a minimax game between a generative model and a discriminative model. For the single-user case, we propose to incorporate the special structure of the reflected channels into the design of the generative model. While for the multiuser case, we extend the IRS-GAN and present a multiuser IRS-GAN (abbreviated as IRS-GAN-M), where the distributions of the reflected channels associated with different users are learned simultaneously with reduced number of network parameters (as compared to the naive scheme that assigns a dedicated IRS-GAN for each user). Moreover, theoretical analysis is presented to prove that the minimax game in the IRS-GAN-M framework has a global optimum if the generative and discriminative models are given with enough capacity. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed IRS-GAN framework.}

	abstract = {Mobile services are becoming more diverse, making them have different demands on communications, computing, and caching (3C) resources in mobile systems. Unlike the traditional work that considers only one type of service, this paper designs a unified framework to characterize the different kinds of services, and jointly optimizes the 3C resources of the base station (BS) and mobile devices to provide differentiated quality of service (QoS) for diverse services. In the proposed framework, we model the task required by the mobile device to be generated at the BS, the mobile device, or both of them, which means the requested tasks are served through different paths, consuming different bandwidth, computing and caching resources. Since diverse services have different QoS, we formulate a multi-objective programming (MOP) to optimize the allocation of the 3C resources for minimizing the total delay while maximizing the number of executed tasks requested by the mobile devices. We transform the MOP problem as a multi-objective Markov decision process (MO-MDP) and design a multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MO-PPO) algorithm to solve the MO-MDP. The proposed MO-PPO first trains two sub-policies separately for the two objectives, and then combines them to search for Pareto dominating solutions. By alternately perform the separate training and the combination, we can finally obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions and the corresponding Pareto front. Simulation results show that the proposed MO-PPO outperforms traditional methods in finding a higher-quality set of Pareto optimal solutions and can more appropriately allocate 3C resources to different types of services.}

	abstract = {Optical communications systems’ performance is limited by physical layer nonlinearities inherent in some of their transmitter components. In order to overcome some of these limitations, several approaches utilizing artificial neural networks to digitally pre-distort the transmitted signal have been proposed in the last few years, alongside other more classical models. However, their performance was strongly dependent on the specific training sequence used. This work improves the performance of neural network-based direct learning approach for digital pre-distortion applications. The proposed method, which is based on the curriculum learning approach, aims to construct a training paradigm of gradually increasing complexity based on the statistical properties of the input signal, in order to achieve better convergence of the network. We prove that the proposed method defines a proper curriculum regardless of the training data distribution, considering the proposed wide-sense curriculum conditions and the case of binary weighting functions. A comparative analysis examines a pre-distorter for a coherent optical transmitter modelled by a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. An improvement of 4.8dB in terms of normalized mean-square error is demonstrated for the case of a 3-bits linear quantizer, compared to the conventional training scheme.}

	abstract = {The autoencoder empowered by artificial intelligence has shown considerable potential in solving channel state information (CSI) feedback problems in frequency-division duplexing systems. However, this method needs to completely change the existing feedback schemes, which is difficult to deploy in the next few years. This paper proposes an environment knowledge-aided codebook-based CSI feedback framework, which retains the existent codebook-based scheme while introducing environment knowledge to feedback process through neural networks (NNs) at the base station. Only an NN-based refining operation is added after the common standardized feedback approach. The NNs learn to automatically extract environment features and utilize the channel statistics through large volumes of recorded data. The NNs also use the partial correlation between bidirectional channels to further improve feedback performance. In addition, to deal with downlink channel estimation errors, we propose two strategies to reduce their effects using an NN-based denoise module. The proposed framework can be easily embedded in most existing codebook-based feedback methods, such as random vector quantization. Two channel datasets generated by QuaDRiGa and measured in practical systems are adopted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results show that the proposed method offers over 100% increase in the throughput compared with the baseline codebook because of more accurate feedback.}

	abstract = {In massive grant-free transmission, joint user activity detection (UAD) and channel estimation (CE) is essential for data recovery at the receiver, which has been extensively researched in frequency-flat fading scenarios. However, in practical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based systems, frequency-selective fading (FSF) leads to a significant increase in the number of channel coefficients to be estimated, imposing new challenges for the design of joint UAD and CE algorithms. Therefore, this paper investigates joint UAD and CE for OFDM-based massive grant-free transmission over FSF channels. Firstly, by employing the discrete cosine transform (DCT), the joint estimation problem is formulated as the compressed sensing (CS) problem with the reduced dimension of the DCT-domain channel response vector. Then, based on the low-dimension sparse channel model, we develop a hybrid message passing (HMP) algorithm under the constrained Bethe free energy (BFE) minimization framework to achieve efficient joint UAD and CE. To deal with the lack of the DCT-domain prior information in practical scenarios, we parameterize it as the Cauchy distribution or the Laplacian distribution and learn their parameters by the proposed HMP algorithm. Numerical results confirm the superior joint UAD and CE performance of the proposed algorithm over FSF channels.}

	abstract = {To accommodate the stringent requirements of massive connectivity and ultra-high throughput, both reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been perceived as the key techniques for future communication networks. In this paper, a versatile framework is conceived to boost transmit power efficiency for RIS-enabled multi-group NOMA networks in the presence of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) reception and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Particularly, a group-level SIC (GSIC) method is proposed to eliminate the decoded group’s interference together with the well-designed transceivers to mitigate the aggregated interference, including the intra-group interference, the residual interference caused by imperfect SIC, and the interference of NOMA users decoded later. According to the novel framework, a power minimization problem is formulated by collaboratively optimizing the transmit power and the phase shifts. To render the problem tractable, an alternating scheme is developed to optimize the transmit power and the phase shifts iteratively. Specifically, the transmit powers for the users in the same group are devised by a parallel iteration algorithm, whilst the phase shifts are optimized by a sequential rotation method. In simulations, it is shown that the proposed scheme requires less transmit power than various benchmark methods under the constraint of each user’s quality of service.}

	abstract = {Next-generation satellite systems targeting multi-Terabit-per-second throughput require surmounting layers of design challenges. For feeder links, extremely high frequency (EHF) band is desired to overcome spectrum limitations and reduce equipment size. Multiple gateways are utilized to aggregate their bandwidths and serve as site diversity, mitigating the increased susceptibility of the EHF band to atmospheric attenuation. Toward this, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is well suited for feeder links that share the same time, frequency, and polarization resources. This paper provides novel extension of MIMO-enabled feeder links when clustering more than two gateways and mounting more than two antennas onboard geostationary multibeam satellite, exploiting line-of-sight MIMO on uplinks and downlinks. Arsenal of countermeasures against inter-antenna interference and weather impairments is designed to maximize gains in signal-to-noise ratio, spatial multiplexing, and spatial diversity. Comparisons between offered sum rates and theoretical MIMO capacity are provided when gateway clusters form linear versus circular patterns. Methodology for gateway diversity is developed and analyzed when deploying redundant MIMO feeder links that handle rerouted traffic. Algorithms for ground-based channel state information (CSI) acquisition are designed and implemented in receiver architecture that tackles strong practical impairments. Numerical studies reveal that MIMO-enabled feeder links offer greatly enhanced overall network availability compared with state-of-the-art single-input single-output (SISO) solutions.}

As the existing analysis was conducted under some ideal assumptions for simplicity, the asynchronous scenario is analyzed under rigorous assumptions in this paper so that important insights are revealed for practical systems. Specifically, the average symbol error rate (SER) formulas are derived for a two-user system with arbitrary\nM\n-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (\nM\n-QAM) over Rayleigh fading channels. These solutions are shown to have higher accuracies compared to the existing solutions. Furthermore, a novel iterative detection algorithm is proposed, i.e., the parallel T-SIC method, which is more efficient and effective compared to the iterative T-SIC method. Insightful discussion is conducted in terms of the potentials of the concerned iterative detection method. Simulation results show that the most significant improvement of the iterative detection reflects on the SER for the strongest user, and the reduction is always within 50% of the SER compared to the primary detection. The gains obtained by the iterative detection is negligible for higher order\nM\n-QAM cases.}

In this paper, we consider a multi-cluster CoMAC network, whose performance is affected by the inter-cluster interference and the non-uniform fading. To minimize the sum mean squared error of signals aggregated at different fusion centers (FCs), we propose a transceiver design for multi-cluster CoMAC. Specifically, we adopt a uniform-forcing transmitter design to formulate the receiver design as a quadratic sum-of-ratios problem with nonconvex quadratic constraints. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to find its optimal solution with a given error tolerance. To solve the problem in a decentralized way, we develop a distributed algorithm based on the primal decomposition theory. Each subproblem is solved by using the successive convex approximation method. Further combining Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal solution structure of each subproblem, based on which we can find the solution with lower complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed transceiver design.}

	abstract = {Symbol-level precoding (SLP), which converts the harmful multi-user interference (MUI) into beneficial signals, can significantly improve symbol-error-rate (SER) performance in multi-user communication systems. While enjoying symbolic gain, however, the complicated non-linear symbol-by-symbol precoder design suffers high computational complexity exponential with the number of users, which is unaffordable in realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity grouped SLP (G-SLP) approach and develop efficient design algorithms for typical max-min fairness and power minimization problems. In particular, after dividing all users into several groups, the precoders for each group are separately designed on a symbol-by-symbol basis by only utilizing the symbol information of the users in that group, in which the intra-group MUI is exploited using the concept of constructive interference (CI) and the inter-group MUI is also effectively suppressed. In order to further reduce the computational complexity, we utilize the Lagrangian dual, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the majorization-minimization (MM) method to transform the resulting problems into more tractable forms, and develop efficient algorithms for obtaining closed-form solutions to them. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed G-SLP strategy and design algorithms dramatically reduce the computational complexity without causing significant performance loss compared with the traditional SLP schemes.}

Their dynamic and low-power configuration enables coverage extension, massive connectivity, and low-latency communications. Due to a large number of unknown variables referring to the RIS unit elements and the transmitted signals, channel estimation and signal recovery in RIS-based systems are the ones of the most critical technical challenges. To address this problem, we focus on the RIS-assisted wireless communication system and present two joint channel estimation and signal recovery schemes based on message passing algorithms in this paper. Specifically, the proposed bidirectional scheme applies the Taylor series expansion and Gaussian approximation to simplify the sum-product procedure in the formulated problem. In addition, the inner iteration that adopts two variants of approximate message passing algorithms is incorporated to ensure robustness and convergence. Two ambiguities removal methods are also discussed in this paper. Our simulation results show that the proposed schemes show the superiority over the state-of-art benchmark method. We also provide insights on the impact of different RIS parameter settings on the proposed schemes.}

However, this requires an appropriate power allocation that often has a high computational complexity, which might be inadequate for practical and large systems. To this end, adaptive power allocation techniques can provide good performance with low computational cost. This work presents novel robust and adaptive power allocation technique for RS-based multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In particular, we develop a robust adaptive power allocation based on stochastic gradient learning and the minimization of the mean-square error between the transmitted symbols of the RS system and the received signal. The proposed robust power allocation strategy incorporates knowledge of the variance of the channel errors to deal with imperfect CSIT and adjust power levels in the presence of uncertainty. An analysis of the convexity and stability of the proposed power allocation algorithms is provided, together with a study of their computational complexity and theoretical bounds relating the power allocation strategies. Numerical results show that the sum-rate of an RS system with adaptive power allocation outperforms RS and conventional MU-MIMO systems under imperfect CSIT.}

	abstract = {The integration between the satellite network and the terrestrial network will play a key role in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) of mobile cellular networks thanks to the wide coverage and bandwidth offered by satellite networks. To leverage this integration, we propose a proactive traffic offloading scheme in an integrated multi-satellite terrestrial network (IMSTN) that considers the future networks’ heterogeneity and predicts their variability. Our proposed offloading scheme hinges on traffic prediction to answer the stringent requirements of data-rate, latency and reliability imposed by heterogeneous and coexisting services and traffic namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). However, the fulfilment of these requirements during offloading in dynamic IMSTN comes at the expense of significant energy consumption and introduces inherently supplementary latency. Therefore, our offloading scheme aims to balance the fundamental trade-offs first between energy consumption and the achievable data-rate and second between energy consumption and latency while meeting the respective needs of the present traffic. Our findings prove the importance of the cooperation between the multi-satellite network and the terrestrial network conditioned by traffic prediction to enhance the performance of IMTSN in terms of latency and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {Satellite networks (SNs) are heterogeneous networks composed of typical functional domains, such as communication domains, observation domains, etc. Since the resources are independent among domains, and are highly dynamic with the movement of satellites, it is extremely difficult to capture the potential interaction relationship among various resources, even less to realize the coordinated scheduling of cross-domain resources in large-scale SNs. Motivated by these factors, we firstly propose a multi-aspect expanded hypergraph (MAEH) to accurately depict the Spatio-temporal features of resources in various domains as well as functional property, which is presented by different aspects. Particularly, the “aspect” can involve a group of resources with a similar feature in a hyperedge rather than a bilateral relationship between two individuals, thus the MAEH can dramatically reduce the redundant connections. By exploiting the MAEH, we model the multi-domain resource allocation problem in the form of mixed-integer linear programming to maximize the completed tasks. Through the topological nested characteristic of the MAEH, we propose a two-stage scheme to accomplish the resource allocation rapidly with lower computational complexity and to improve the resource utilization ratio efficiently. Simulation results validate that compared with the optimal performance, the executive time of the proposed scheme is average fivefold less under 4% extra communication resource cost. Besides, the resource utilization ratio improves over 15% by cross-domain collaboration.}

	abstract = {Aeronautical Ad-hoc Networks (AANETs) have been proposed as the promising complement to terrestrial networks for promoting the global interconnection to provide in-flight network service, emergency communication, vessel traffic service, etc. However, the large network scale of AANETs may induce severe synchronization overhead when the traditional topology-based networking algorithms are adopted. Moreover, the high-dynamic topology and changeable flight routes make the existing position-based routing algorithms suffer loop routing and forwarding failure. Motivated by these problems, this paper aims at developing efficient and low-cost networking and routing algorithms relying on the concept of dynamic virtual topology which organizes the disordered topology of AANETs into a structural and simplified one. The basic idea is that each connected aircraft is assigned with a unique and sequentially increased Virtual Identifier (VID) and thus all the connected aircrafts are organized into a virtual cluster consisting of one trunk and several branches. An event-driven synchronization mechanism is leveraged for maintaining the virtual topology as well as relieving the communication burden imposed by periodical broadcasting. By jointly considering the geographic locations and the virtual locations of aircrafts, we formulate the routing problem in AANETs as a weighted distance minimization problem, and further propose a novel routing algorithm, namely Trunk-Branch Cooperation aided Routing (TBCR) algorithm. Specifically, TBCR employs the geographic greedy forwarding strategy for enhancing its flexibility and boosts the routing efficiency by adopting the loop-free virtual topology based local forwarding. For extending the networking and routing algorithms to the global range, a multi-domain routing solution is also provided. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed Virtual Topology based Networking (VTN) cooperated with TBCR can reduce at least 30% average end-to-end transmission delay in large-scale AANETs and provide more than 90% lower synchronization overhead than the existing solutions.}

	abstract = {The increasing demands of power supply and data rate for mobile devices promote the research of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Optical SWIPT, as known as simultaneous light information and power transfer (SLIPT), has the potential for providing high-capacity communication and high-power wireless charging. However, SLIPT technologies based on light-emitting diodes have low efficiency due to energy dissipation over the air. Laser-based SLIPT technologies need strict positioning accuracy and scanning resolution, which may lead to the increase of costs and complexity. In this paper, we propose a mobile SLIPT scheme based on spatially separated laser resonator (SSLR) and intra-cavity second harmonic generation. The power and data are transferred via separated frequencies, while they share the same self-aligned resonant beam path, without the needs of receiver positioning and beam steering. We establish the analysis model of the resonant beam power and its second harmonic power. Numerical results show that the proposed system can achieve watt-level battery charging power and above 10-bit/s/Hz achievable rate at 6-m distance, which satisfies the requirements of most indoor mobile devices.}

	abstract = {We consider a free-space optical (FSO) communication link for packet-based transmissions over a turbulence fading channel. The modulation format is on-off keying (OOK) and a unique-word (UW) composed by a known synch pattern is periodically inserted in the data stream to identify the start of frame. Since an avalanche photo-diode (APD) is used for direct detection of the OOK symbols, the photocurrent signal provided by the APD is plagued by a mixture of thermal and shot noise with signal-dependent power. Our goal is the detection of the UW position in the received stream, along with the estimation of the unknown channel attenuation and noise variances. The aforementioned problem has recently been studied by ignoring any information conveyed by data symbols surrounding the UW. In this work, further investigation is conducted in order to determine the maximum likelihood (ML) solution that, in addition to the UW, exploits all the information-bearing symbols belonging to the observation window. The relevant Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is also evaluated to establish the ultimate accuracy achievable in the estimation process. Since the true ML estimator leads to a computationally intractable multi-dimensional optimization problem, we develop suitable approximations that enable accurate frame synchronization with affordable complexity. We also present an iterative solution to refine the channel and noise power estimates provided by the UW detection procedure. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed synchronization and estimation schemes with respect to existing alternatives.}

	abstract = {Artificial noise (AN), aiming to disturb the eavesdropper while avoiding the influence on the legitimate receiver, has arisen as an excellent technology for improving the physical-layer security of wireless communications. In order to challenge AN, zero-forcing elimination (ZFE) has been introduced as a possible countermeasure to mitigate the AN for the eavesdropper at the cost of more available receive antennas. In this contribution, from the perspective of eavesdroppers, we further conceive a class of efficient null-space elimination (NSE) schemes in order to reduce the number of receive antennas while enhancing the detection quality compared to original ZFE. Furthermore, the performance of secrecy rate as well as bit-error rate (BER) is quantified for both ZFE and NSE schemes through theoretical derivation, while the influence of imperfect channel state information (CSI) is also evaluated. The performance comparison of the above-mentioned schemes illustrates that NSE can provide more robust performance for eavesdroppers over ZFE, with lower hardware requirements as well as moderate complexity increase.}

	abstract = {With potential applications to short-packet communication, we address communication of low-latency messages in fast-fading channels under the presence of a reactive jammer. Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a full-duplex (FD) jammer capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and subsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable communication amidst a strong adversary, we propose non-coherent fast-forward full-duplex relaying scheme wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to fast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the countermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the constellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing non-coherent constellation for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the cooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an optimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim and the helper such that the symbol-error-probability at the base station is minimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose several strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper’s data-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed constellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade jamming. Finally, we also prove the scheme’s efficacy in deceiving the countermeasure detectors at the jammer.}

In this paper, combined with intelligent reflect surface (IRS), we jointly optimize base station beamforming and IRS reflected beamforming to counter smart attackers, thereby improving system security. Considering that attackers can flexibly choose their attack methods, such as jamming or eavesdropping, we make the base station intelligent by using reinforcement learning, which can predict the attack methods of attackers and choose whether to add artificial noise into the transmitted signals. At the same time, the interaction between the base station and the smart attackers are established as a non-cooperative game, the Nash equilibrium of the game is derived. Based on this, the base station anti-smart attackers strategy based on Deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed, which can restrain the attack of the attacker to improve the security of the system. It can be verified from the simulation results that the proposed anti-smart attackers strategy can effectively enhance the secrecy rate of the wireless communication system, resist the attacker’s attack, and intelligently transmit artificial noise to improve system security.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed as a key enabler to improve the coverage of the signals and mitigate the frequent blockages in millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. However, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition is one of the major challenges for the practical deployment of the RIS. The passive RIS without any baseband processing capabilities brings difficulty on the channel estimation (CE), since the individual channels or the cascaded one can be estimated only at base station (BS) via uplink training or mobile station (MS) via downlink training. In order to facilitate the CSI acquisition, we focus on the hybrid RIS architecture, where a small number of elements are active and able to receive and process the pilot signals at the RIS. The CE is performed in two stages by following the atomic norm minimization to recover the channel parameters, i.e., angles of departure (AoDs), angles of arrival (AoAs), and propagation path gains. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can outperform the passive RIS CE under the same training overhead. Furthermore, we also study the theoretical performance limits in terms of mean square error (MSE) via Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analyses.}

We consider the joint design of user clustering, transmit beamforming, and power allocation to minimize the total transmit power while meeting the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio targets. We decompose this challenging mixed-integer programming problem into three separate subproblems to solve. We propose a low-complexity learning-based user clustering algorithm, which is a modified version of mean shift clustering with a new channel correlation based clustering metric. The proposed clustering algorithm determines the clusters to trade-off between spatial dimension and power dimension offered by respective MIMO and NOMA for user multiplexing. We then design zero-forcing transmit beamformers to eliminate inter-cluster interference and optimize power allocation to minimize the total transmit power. We provide two case studies for both co-located and distributed massive MIMO systems in spatially highly correlated prorogation environments. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm forms NOMA clusters based on the available degrees of freedom in the system to effectively use both spatial and power dimensions, which results in a substantial performance improvement over MIMO-only methods or other existing clustering methods in such environments.}

More precisely, eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding is adopted for the FTN transmission of data bits modulated by single-carrier time-domain index modulation (IM). While the FTN scheme increases the spectral efficiency and data rate by increasing the density of transmit symbols, the time-domain IM works towards the same objective while maintaining symbol sparsity. We analytically derive the constrained capacity of the proposed system. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better bit error ratio (BER) performance than the conventional FTN-IM scheme, particularly for the scenario of a higher packing ratio. With the proposed scheme, a 2.5 dB performance gain is observed at the BER of 10 −4 , where the packing ratio is 0.7 and the roll-off factor is 0.5 in the channel-uncoded scenario. We further analyze our scheme’s performance by characterizing its minimum Euclidean distance and inter-symbol interference. Furthermore, we present a three-stage serially concatenated iterative detection architecture for the proposed EVD-FTN-IM signaling scheme. It is demonstrated in our simulations that a near-capacity BER performance is achievable in the proposed turbo-coded FTN-IM scheme.}

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a Deep neural network-assisted Particle Filter-based (DePF) approach to address the Mobile User (MU) joint synchronization and localization (sync&loc) problem in ultra-dense networks. In particular, DePF deploys an asymmetric time-stamp exchange mechanism between the MUs and the Access Points (APs), which, traditionally, provides us with information about the MUs’ clock offset and skew. However, information about the distance between an AP and an MU is also intrinsic to the propagation delay experienced by the exchanged time-stamps. In addition, to estimate the angle of arrival of the received synchronization packets, DePF draws on the multiple signal classification algorithm that is fed with the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) experienced by the sync packets. The CIR is also leveraged to determine the link condition, i.e. Line-of-Sight (LoS) or Non-LoS. Finally, to perform joint sync&loc, DePF capitalizes on particle Gaussian mixtures that allow for a hybrid particle-based and parametric Bayesian Recursive Filtering (BRF) fusion of the aforementioned pieces of information and, thus, jointly estimates the position and clock parameters of the MUs. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art schemes, especially that of the extended Kalman filter- and linearized BRF-based joint sync&loc. In particular, only drawing on the synchronization time-stamp exchange and CIRs from a single AP, for 90% of the cases, the absolute position and clock offset estimation error remain below 1 meter and 2 nanoseconds, respectively.}

	abstract = {As a promising technology with disruptive innovation, user-centric network can meet the data traffic demand and user service demand in the future mobile networks. It completely transforms the traditional cell-centric paradigm into user-centric paradigm, requiring the deployment of a large number of access points (APs). However, the massive deployment of APs leads to issues such as high hardware cost, huge power consumption and complex interference management. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), as another promising technology, can expand signal coverage, suppress interference, reduce hardware cost and power consumption. Inspired by this, we propose a novel RIS assisted user-centric network that uses RIS to replace some low utilization APs to reduce cost as well as power consumption, and deploy more RIS to achieve energy-efficient user-centric communication. In order to take full advantages of RIS, we jointly optimize passive beamforming at RIS and power control at AP to maximize the energy efficiency of the network. Since this problem is intractable and non-convex, an effectively alternating optimization algorithm, capitalizing on fractional programming and successive lower-bound maximization is proposed. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms reference algorithms in terms of energy efficiency and sum rate.}

We develop a new, low complexity, greedy algorithm for the combinatorial AP scheduling problem, with an optimality guarantee theoretically established via showing that a lower bound of the sum UL-DL SE is sub-modular. We also consider pilot sequence reuse among the UEs to limit the channel estimation overhead. In CF systems, all the APs estimate the channel from every UE, making pilot allocation problem different from the cellular case. We develop a novel algorithm that iteratively minimizes the maximum pilot contamination across the UEs. We compare the performance of our solutions, both theoretically and via simulations, against a full duplex (FD) multi-cell mMIMO system. Our results show that, due to the joint processing of the signals at the central processing unit, CF-mMIMO with dynamic HD AP-scheduling significantly outperforms cellular FD-mMIMO in terms of the sum SE and 90% likely SE. Thus, DTDD enabled HD CF-mMIMO is a promising alternative to cellular FD-mMIMO, without the cost of hardware for self-interference suppression.}

In order to acquire more in-depth environmental information, as well as, to flexibly take into account existing real-life infrastructure, we propose a novel three-dimensional conformal IRS architecture consisting of reflective unit cells distributed on curved surfaces. We model the training signal as a third-order canonical polyadic tensor and construct a tensor factorization problem. Given specific conditions on the allocated temporal-frequency training resources, we develop four channel estimation approaches, i.e., least squares, direct, wideband direct and wideband subspace methods, by leveraging tensor techniques and nonlinear system solvers. By fully exploiting the characteristics of conformal IRSs, we propose two decoupling modes to precisely recover the multipath parameters without ambiguities, which cannot be supported by the traditional IRS planar topologies. We implement scatterer mapping and user positioning tasks based on precise parameter estimates. Simulation results indicate that the proposed conformal IRS structure and estimation schemes can recover the channel state information with remarkable accuracy, thereby offering a centimeter-level resolution of environment mapping.}

	abstract = {The downlink channel estimation requires a huge pilot overhead in the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted communication system. By exploiting the powerful learning ability of the neural network, the machine learning (ML) technique can be used to estimate the high-dimensional channel from a few received pilot signals at the user. However, since the training dataset collected by the single user only contains the information of part of the channel scenarios of a cell, the neural network trained by the single user is not able to work when the user moves from one channel scenario to another. To solve this challenge, we propose to leverage the distributed machine learning (DML) technique to enable the reliable downlink channel estimation. Specifically, we firstly build a downlink channel estimation neural network shared by all users, which can be collaboratively trained by the BS and the users with the help of the DML technique. Then, we further propose a hierarchical neural network architecture to improve the channel estimation accuracy, which can extract different channel features for different channel scenarios. Simulation results show that compared with the neural network trained by the single user, the proposed DML based neural networks can achieve better estimation performance with the reduced pilot overhead for all users from different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Considering a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless powered Internet of Things (WP IoT) network. To address the energy-limitation issue, IoT devices in such a network can be wirelessly powered by a power station (PS) first and then connect with an access point (AP) using their own harvested energy. The RIS helps enhance energy and information receptions in the downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) and uplink wireless information transfer (WIT), respectively. This work unveils the impact of phase shift error (PSE) and transceiver hardware impairment (THI) on the considered network. Our investigation starts with a scenario where only the impact of the PSE on system under study is considered, then moves toward a scenario with the compound effect of both PSE and THI. A maximization problem of the system sum throughput is formulated to evaluate the overall performance for these two scenarios, subject to the constraints of the adjustable RIS phase shifts, the statistical PSE and the transmission time scheduling. To handle the non-convexity of the formulated problem due to those coupled variables, we first adopt the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to derive the optimal time scheduling in closed-form. Next, we recast the stochastic PSE into the deterministic counterpart for its tractability. Then, we adopt a successive convex approximation (SCA) to iteratively derive the optimal WIT’s phase shifts, and element-wise block coordinate decent (EBCD) and complex circle manifold (CCM) methods to iteratively derive the optimal WET’s phase shifts. Finally, we complete our solution approach for the scenario with both PSE and THI. Simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed scheme and the benefits induced by the RIS in comparison to benchmark schemes.}

This paper characterizes this blocking correlation and derives its impact on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of a mmWave cellular network. We first present an exact analysis of a 1D network and highlight the impact of blocking correlation in the derived expressions. Gaining insights from the 1D analysis, we develop an analytical framework for a 2D network where we characterize the sum interference at the user by considering the correlation between the blocking of serving and interfering links. Using this, we derive the SINR coverage probability. Via simulations, we demonstrate that including blockage correlation in the analysis is required for accurate characterization of the system performance, in particular when the blocking objects tend to be large.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance wireless communication performance cost-effectively. The existing literature has mainly considered IRS being deployed near user terminals to improve their performance. However, this approach may incur a high cost if IRSs need to be densely deployed in the network to cater to random user locations. To avoid such high deployment cost, in this paper we consider a new IRS aided wireless network architecture, where IRSs are deployed in the vicinity of each base station (BS) to assist in its communications with distributed users regardless of their locations. Besides significantly enhancing IRSs’ signal coverage, this scheme helps reduce the IRS-associated channel estimation overhead as compared to conventional user-side IRSs, by exploiting the nearly static BS-IRS channels over short distance. For this scheme, we propose a new two-stage transmission protocol to achieve IRS channel estimation and reflection optimization for uplink data transmission efficiently. In addition, we propose effective methods for solving the user-IRS association problem based on long-term/statistical channel knowledge and the selected user-IRS-BS cascaded channel estimation problem. Finally, all IRSs’ passive reflections are jointly optimized with the BS’s multi-antenna receive combining to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all users for data transmission. Numerical results show that the proposed co-site-IRS empowered BS scheme can achieve significant performance gains over the conventional BS without co-site IRS and existing schemes for IRS channel estimation and reflection optimization, thus enabling an appealing low-cost and high-performance BS design for future wireless networks.}

However, as an inescapable obstacle, adjacent space interference from neighboring satellites unavoidably leads to the loss of the performance of SACs. To uncover the impacts of space interference, in this paper, a SAC system including a satellite (S), an aerial platform (D), and a space interference (I) is considered. Specifically, S operates in a circular orbit and I, which is randomly distributed in the neighboring space around S, produces a jamming signal to interfere with the information delivery between S and D. Considering the randomness of S and I and employing geometric probability theory, an approximate and asymptotic outage probabilities of the considered SAC system are studied. Moreover, the multi-interference scenario is investigated accordingly. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate our proposed analysis and some insightful conclusions are achieved to reveal the effects of spatially random space interference on SAC.}

Thus, considering the randomness of R and D and employing geometric probability theory, the exact and asymptotic outage probability (OP) of S-R, S-D, and R-D links is studied, and then the end-to-end outage performance of CSATN is investigated accordingly by using approximation method.

We call this improved R-ABP decoding the threshold-and-CRC-aided R-ABP (TCA-R-ABP) decoding. The simulation results show that our proposed TCA-R-ABP algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for many 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) and polar codes.

	abstract = {Spatial modulation (SM) is one special type of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique whose advantage is that only one radio-frequency (RF) chain is needed. Recently, the so-called cross Z-complementary pair (CZCP) was proposed as the SM training sequence. Optimal channel estimation performance over frequency-selective channels can be achieved since the CZCPs have the specific zero correlation zone (ZCZ) for auto-correlation and cross-correlation sums. However, the ZCZ width of the CZCP is theoretically upper bounded by half sequence length. In this paper, the CZCP is extended to the cross Z-complementary set (CZCS) to have larger ZCZ width which can be used in SM to combat larger delay spread. Several generic constructions of CZCSs with large ZCZ widths and flexible lengths are proposed in this paper. Even the perfect CZCS, whose ZCZ width has the maximum value, can be obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CZCS-based training sequence can tolerate large delay spreads to improve the channel estimation performance in SM.}

	abstract = {Faster-than-Nyquist signaling (FTNS) has already been shown to increase the communication capacity on certain channels such as additive white Gaussian noise and block flat multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh fading channels. The following issues, however, remain unresolved: 1) whether FTNS enables a capacity increase in generalized MIMO Rayleigh fading channels that are selective in time, frequency, and space; and 2) how channel selectivities affect the capacity and if present, the FTN capacity gain. To address the issues, this paper firstly investigates the ergodic capacity of MIMO-FTN transmission over triply-selective fading channels. We derive a low-complexity approximate capacity formula and also show how it degenerates in other channel models, such as doubly-selective single-input single-output fading channels, which can be considered as the special cases of triply-selective fading channels. The capacity evaluation results obtained under different channel conditions show that: 1) MIMO-FTN outperforms MIMO-Nyquist in terms of capacity; 2) the FTN gains are nearly consistent, while the FTN gains obtained in the frequency-selective fading channels are slightly higher than those obtained in the flat fading channels.}

	abstract = {Random interleavers are widely employed in digital communication systems to combat channel fading and burst errors. In applications such as grant-free access by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, accurately identifying a specific irregular interleaving pattern within an interleaver period is vital to both terminal recognition and data recovery. In this work, we investigate effective approaches for random interleaving pattern identification in Reed-Solomon (RS) coded data streams. We first propose an algorithm of low computational complexity to detect positions of code symbols belonging to the same RS codeword group (RSCG) under modest bit error rate. We further develop another low-complexity algorithm to successfully identify random interleaving patterns for RS code symbols within each RS codeword under moderate to high error rate applications. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results corroborate to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a quantized feedback scheme to maximize the goodput of a finite blocklength communication scenario over a quasi-static fading channel. It is assumed that the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI) and sends back the CSI to the transmitter over a resolution-limited error-free feedback channel. With this partial CSI, the transmitter is supposed to select the optimum transmission rate, such that it maximizes the overall goodput of the communication system. This problem has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime, however, no solution has so far been presented for finite blocklength. Here, we study this problem in two cases: with and without constraint on reliability. We first formulate the optimization problems and analytically solve them. Iterative algorithms that successfully exploit the system parameters for both cases are presented. It is shown that although the achievable maximum goodput decreases with shorter blocklengths and higher reliability requirements, significant improvement can be achieved even with coarsely quantized feedback schemes.}

Minimization of the total user dissatisfaction in a multi-channel cellular network leads to a non-convex problem. By utilizing a combinatorial structure in the problem, we first propose a polynomial time joint admission control and channel allocation algorithm which is provably (almost) optimal. This scheme assumes that the base station (BS) knows the multimedia frame statistics of the streams. In a more practical setting, where these statistics are not available a priori at the BS, a learning based scheme with provable guarantees is developed. This learning based scheme is related to regret minimization in multi-armed bandits with non-i.i.d. and delayed reward (cost). All these algorithms require none to minimal feedback from the user equipment to the base station regarding the states of the media player buffer at the application layer, and hence, are of practical interest.}

	abstract = {The recent advances and unprecedented ubiquity of computation-intensive applications such as virtual reality and mobile augmented reality force new approaches to handle the accompanying challenges. Ultra-Dense Network (UDN) as a leading direction in 5G and beyond offers an opportunistic degree of freedom to be exploited where a massive number of low-power and low-cost Small Cells (SCs) are deployed. In particular, integrating Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) within the SCs at the edge of the cellular network paves the way to tackle several challenges including the processing of computation-intensive tasks with low latency. To exploit the full potentials of UDNs and ECSs, we deploy multiple associations of SCs to the same user while partitioning and offloading its computation-intensive task to the integrated ECSs therein. In this regard, we formulate a mathematical framework using tools from stochastic geometry to evaluate the average processing delay per user. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our analytical results under different system parameters. Results show the existence of an optimal order of multiple-association. In addition, we propose a novel offline task division approach which significantly reduces the overall delay.}

	abstract = {The differential chaos shift keying with code index modulation (CIM-DCSK) using Walsh codes can increase the data rate, but error rate performance degrades over practical multipath channel with high delay spread. To tackle this drawback, this paper proposes a parallel CIM-DCSK (PT-CIM-DCSK), where the first time slot is used to transmit the chaotic reference sequence, and the second slot is used to transmit the multiple sequences carrying data bits. In particular, multiple\nq\nchaotic sequences are added for data transmission in parallel, and each sequence is modulated by CIM-DCSK with\nm\nc\nbits. By exploiting the quasi-orthogonal characteristics of permuted chaotic signals, the interference between\nq\nsequences can be remarkably suppressed. In this way, given the data rate, PT-CIM-DCSK can achieve a larger length of Walsh segment than the CIM-DCSK, since its parallel transmission compensates the rate. In addition, the error performance of the proposed scheme over the multipath Rayleigh fading channel is theoretically analyzed. The theoretical and consistent simulation results demonstrate that the PT-CIM-DCSK can obtain significant performance gains over the conventional CIM-DCSK, and the gain can be up to 5 dB in multipath fading channel with high delay. This is because the larger Walsh segment of PT-CIM-DCSK provides the enhanced robustness against multipath effect. The performance superiority of the proposed scheme is further verified in practical ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless industrial scenarios, which suggests promising for low-cost and low-complexity wireless communication applications.}

The objective is to minimize the probability that an incorrect lattice point is found, subject to a constraint on inter-node communication. Algorithms with a single as well as an unbounded number of rounds of communication are considered for the case\nn=2\n. For the algorithm with a single round, expressions are derived for the error probability as a function of the total number of communicated bits. We observe that the error exponent depends on the lattice structure and that zero error requires an infinite number of communicated bits. In contrast, with an infinite number of allowed communication rounds, the nearest lattice point can be determined without error with a finite average number of communicated bits and a finite average number of rounds of communication. In two dimensions, the hexagonal lattice, which is most efficient for communication and compression, is found to be the most expensive in terms of communication cost.}

	abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are required to operate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. For this, the AVs equipped with Joint Radar-Communications (JRC) functions can enhance the driving safety by utilizing both radar detection and data communication functions. However, optimizing the performance of the AV system with two different functions under uncertainty and dynamic of surrounding environments is very challenging. In this work, we first propose an intelligent optimization framework based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to help the AV make optimal decisions in selecting JRC operation functions under the dynamic and uncertainty of the surrounding environment. We then develop an effective learning algorithm leveraging recent advances of deep reinforcement learning techniques to find the optimal policy for the AV without requiring any prior information about surrounding environment. Furthermore, to make our proposed framework more scalable, we develop a Transfer Learning (TL) mechanism that enables the AV to leverage valuable experiences for accelerating the training process when it moves to a new environment. Extensive simulations show that the proposed transferable deep reinforcement learning framework reduces the obstacle miss detection probability by the AV up to 67% compared to other conventional deep reinforcement learning approaches. With the deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning approaches, our proposed solution can find its applications in a wide range of autonomous driving scenarios from driver assistance to full automation transportation.}

	abstract = {The vigorous developments of the Internet of Things make it possible to extend its computing and storage capabilities to computing tasks in the aerial system with the collaboration of cloud and edge, especially for artificial intelligence (AI) tasks based on deep learning (DL). Collecting a large amount of image/video data, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can only hand over intelligent analysis tasks to the back-end mobile edge computing (MEC) server due to their limited storage and computing capabilities. How to efficiently transmit the most correlated information for the AI model is a challenging topic. Inspired by task-oriented communication in recent years, we propose a new aerial image transmission paradigm for the scene classification task. A lightweight model is developed on the front-end UAV for semantic block transmission with the perception of images and channel states. To achieve the tradeoff between transmission latency and classification accuracy, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to explore the semantic blocks which have the greatest contribution to the back-end classifier under various channel states. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve classification accuracy by more than 4% under the same conditions, compared to other semantic saliency learning methods.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM), a fundamental transmission scheme, promises high throughput and robustness against multipath fading. However, these benefits rely on the efficient detection strategy at the receiver and come at the expense of the extra bandwidth consumed by the cyclic prefix (CP). We use the iterative orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm in this paper as the prototype of the detector because of its remarkable potential for interference suppression. However, OAMP is computationally expensive for the matrix inversion per iteration. We replace the matrix inversion with the conjugate gradient (CG) method to reduce the complexity of OAMP. We further unfold the CG-based OAMP algorithm into a network and tune the critical parameters through deep learning (DL) to enhance detection performance. Simulation results and complexity analysis show that the proposed scheme has significant gain over other iterative detection methods and exhibits comparable performance to the state-of-the-art DL-based detector at a reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we design a highly efficient CP-free MIMO-OFDM receiver architecture to remove the CP overhead. This architecture first eliminates the intersymbol interference by buffering the previously recovered data and then detects the signal using the proposed detector. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the designed receiver offers a higher spectral efficiency than traditional receivers. Finally, over-the-air tests verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme in realistic environments.}

The differentiated demands of the service requests are reflected by their delay- and cost-sensitive factors. We first construct a VNF P&R problem to jointly minimize a weighted sum of service delay and resource consumption cost, which is NP-complete. Then, the joint VNF P&R problem is decoupled into two iterative subtasks: placement subtask and routing subtask. Each subtask consists of multiple concurrent parallel sequential decision processes. By invoking the deep deterministic policy gradient method and multi-agent technique, an MADRL-P&R framework is designed to perform the two subtasks. The new joint reward and internal rewards mechanism is proposed to match the goals and constraints of the placement and routing subtasks. We also propose the parameter migration-based model-retraining method to deal with changing network topologies. Corroborated by experiments, the proposed MADRL-P&R framework is superior to its alternatives in terms of service cost and delay, and offers higher flexibility for personalized service demands. The parameter migration-based model-retraining method can efficiently accelerate convergence under moderate network topology changes.}

	abstract = {Recently, semantic communication has been brought to the forefront because deep learning (DL)-based methods, such as Transformer, have achieved great success in semantic extraction. Although semantic communication has been successfully applied in sentence transmission to reduce semantic errors, the existing architecture is usually fixed in terms of codeword length and inefficient and inflexible for varying sentence lengths. In this study, we exploit hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to reduce the semantic transmission error further. We combine semantic coding (SC) with Reed-Solomon (RS) channel coding and HARQ (called SC-RS-HARQ). SC-RS-HARQ exploits the superiority of SC and the reliability of conventional methods successfully. Although SC-RS-HARQ can be easily applied in existing HARQ systems, we also develop an end-to-end architecture called SCHARQ to pursue enhanced performance. Numerical results demonstrate that SCHARQ significantly reduces the required number of bits for semantic sentence transmission and the sentence error rate. We also attempt to replace error detection from cyclic redundancy check to a similarity detection network called Sim32 to allow the receiver to reserve wrong sentences with similar semantic information and conserve transmission resources.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has emerged as the most sought-after modulation technique in a high mobility scenario. Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is an attractive code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Recently a code-domain NOMA approach for OTFS, named OTFS-SCMA, is proposed. OTFS-SCMA is a promising framework that meets the demands of high mobility and massive connectivity. This paper presents a channel estimation technique based on the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) approach for OTFS-SCMA in the uplink. The channel estimation task is formulated as a CSC problem following a careful rearrangement of the OTFS input-output relation. We use an embedded pilot-aided sparse-pilot structure that enjoys the features of both OTFS and SCMA. The existing channel estimation techniques for OTFS in multi-user scenarios for uplink demand extremely high overhead for pilot and guard symbols, proportional to the number of users. The proposed method maintains a minimal overhead equivalent to a single user without compromising on the estimation error. The results show that the proposed channel estimation algorithm is very efficient in bit error rate (BER), normalized mean square error (NMSE), and spectral efficiency (SE).}

	abstract = {Massive random access plays a central role in supporting the Internet of Things (IoT), where a subset of a large population of users simultaneously transmit small packets to a central base station. While there has been much research on the design of protocols for massive access in the uplink, the problem of providing message acknowledgments back to the users has been somewhat neglected. Reliable communication needs to rely on two-way communication for acknowledgement and retransmission. Nevertheless, because of the many possible subsets of active users, providing acknowledgments requires a significant amount of bits. Motivated by this, we define the problem of massive ARQ (Automatic Retransmission reQuest) protocol and introduce efficient methods for joint encoding of multiple acknowledgements in the downlink. The key idea towards reducing the number of bits used for massive acknowledgments is to allow for a small fraction of false positive acknowledgments. We analyze the implications of this approach and the impact of acknowledgment errors in scenarios with massive random access. Finally, we show that these savings can lead to a significant increase in the reliability when retransmissions are allowed since it allows the acknowledgment message to be transmitted more reliably using a much lower rate.}

To heighten the performances of edge vehicles, we propose a vehicle grouping pairing method, which utilizes vehicles near the MEC to assist edge vehicles as full-duplex relays. For promoting transmission security, we employ artificial noise to interrupt eavesdropping vehicles. Furthermore, we derive the approximate expression of the secrecy outage probability of the system. The combined optimization of vehicle task division, power allocation, and transmit beamforming is formulated to minimize the total delay of task completion for edge vehicles.

Mobility brings two major problems to a MIMO-OFDM system: inter carrier interference (ICI) and channel aging . In practice, it is common to allot multiple contiguous subcarriers to a user as well as schedule multiple users on each subcarrier. Motivated by this, we consider a general subcarrier allocation scheme and derive expressions for the ICI power, uplink signal to interference plus noise ratio and the achievable uplink sum-rate, taking into account the ICI and the multi-user interference due to channel aging. We show that the system incurs a near-constant ICI power that depends linearly on the ratio of the number of users per subcarrier to the number of subcarriers per user, nearly independently of how the UEs distribute their power across the subcarriers. Further, we exploit the coherence bandwidth of the channel to reduce the length of the pilot sequences required for uplink channel estimation. We consider both zero-forcing and maximal-ratio combining at the receiver and compare the respective sum-rate performances. In either case, the subcarrier allocation scheme considered in this paper leads to significantly higher sum-rates compared to previous work, owing to the near-constant ICI property as well as the reduced pilot overhead.}

	abstract = {The current cellular systems are conventional cell-centric based architectures, and thus the inter-cell interference greatly affects the quality of service (QoS) of users located at the border of those service areas. For that reason, future wireless systems will rely on a cell-less deployment by using an alternative promising network infrastructure known as cell-free (CF) technology. Here, in contrast to the current networks, there are no concepts of cells or cell boundaries since it is a disruptive paradigm where a large number of geographically distributed access points (APs) simultaneously and jointly serve a much smaller number of user terminals (UTs) to fulfill the exponentially increasing number of users. Therefore, this paper aims to contribute on this field and considers the design of hybrid analog/digital multi-user equalizer for broadband millimeter wave (mmWave) CF massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, using a distributed beamforming approach (processing is distributed by APs and central unit (CU)) to reduce the fronthaul requirements. First, only a low complexity analog precoder is applied to the transmitter, while a joint design of APs hybrid equalizer and CU combiner are considered by minimizing the average mean square error (MSE) between the transmitted and CU estimated signals. To achieve this joint design, a cyclic minimization method is used to iterate between APs hybrid equalizer and CU combiner, where the information is exchanged between APs and CU based on a set of error variances to improve detection performance. The simulation results show that the proposed precoder and the hybrid linear equalizer can achieve performance results very close to those of the fully digital system. Moreover, just two iterations of the proposed algorithm are already enough to match the full centralized approach performance.}

We model this system by considering spatially-correlated Rician-faded channels and their estimation errors. The users, consequently, perform imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). We derive a lower bound on the spectral efficiency (SE) of this system. We then optimize the non-convex global energy efficiency (GEE) metric, which is a fractional function of the optimization variables. We solve this problem by considering a low-complexity alternating minimization maximization approach, which splits a complex joint problem into multiple simpler convex surrogate sub-problems. We propose a novel surrogate function to exploit this framework, and analytically show that it satisfies the desirable properties of a valid surrogate function. We numerically show that 1) reusing the pilots in each cell, when the channel has sufficiently hardened, provides higher SE than using orthogonal pilots in all cells and 2) the proposed GEE algorithm provides similar GEE as that of an existing joint optimization framework, but with much less complexity.}

We consider simple scheduling and coding schemes, considering both lossless and lossy encoding, and modeling the resulting process as a fork-join queue with different arrival processes. We analyze the full distribution of two relevant metrics for the two-path case: the packet delay and the Peak Age of Information (PAoI), which measures the freshness of the information at the receiver. The results show interesting trade-offs between the update frequency, latency, PAoI, and level of compression, with interesting implications for system designers.}

	abstract = {Over the past few years, the use of wireless sensor networks in a range of Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios has grown in popularity. Since IoT sensor devices have restricted battery power, a proper IoT data aggregation approach is crucial to prolong the network lifetime. To this end, current approaches typically form a virtual aggregation backbone based on a connected dominating set or maximal independent set to utilize independent transmissions of dominators. However, they usually have a fairly long aggregation delay because the dominators become bottlenecks for receiving data from all dominatees. The problem of time-efficient data aggregation in multichannel duty-cycled IoT sensor networks is analyzed in this paper. We propose a novel aggregation approach, named LInk-delay-aware REinforcement (LIRE), leveraging active slots of sensors to explore a routing structure with pipeline links, then scheduling all transmissions in a bottom-up manner. The reinforcement schedule accelerates the aggregation by exploiting unused channels and time slots left off at every scheduling round. LIRE is evaluated in a variety of simulation scenarios through theoretical analysis and performance comparisons with a state-of-the-art scheme. The simulation results show that LIRE reduces more than 80% aggregation delay compared to the existing scheme.}

This paper investigates the task scheduling problem for delay-aware IoT applications in civil aircraft-augmented space-air-ground integrated networks (CAA-SAGIN), where the normalized sky access platforms (SAPs) can collect and forward the terrestrial tasks. Specifically, we first propose an access control scheme for a non-preemptive priority queuing system and a transmission control scheme with cross-layer optimization. Secondly, considering the uncertain distribution of the transmission numbers and generated data, we formulate a robust two-stage stochastic optimization problem of delay minimization. With the proposed robust task scheduling with risk aversion (RTS-RA) algorithm, the original problem can be decomposed into two subproblems, which can be further transformed into tractable semi-definite program (SDP) problems respectively. Simulation results show that the cross-layer optimization scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between delay and throughput. Also, the RTS-RA algorithm outperforms the exiting offloading schemes in terms of end-to-end delay, transmitted data, and energy consumption with lower computational complexity.}

In this paper, we consider the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem of binary symbols transmitted over a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channel, where finding the optimal solution is exponentially hard using classical computers. Here, we apply the QAOA for the ML detection by encoding the problem of interest into a level-\np\nQAOA circuit having\n2p\nvariational parameters, which can be optimized by classical optimizers. This level-\np\nQAOA circuit is constructed by applying the prepared Hamiltonian to our problem and the initial Hamiltonian alternately in\np\nconsecutive rounds. More explicitly, we first encode the optimal solution of the ML detection problem into the ground state of a problem Hamiltonian. Using the quantum adiabatic evolution technique, we provide both analytical and numerical results for characterizing the evolution of the eigenvalues of the quantum system used for ML detection. Then, for level-1 QAOA circuits, we derive the analytical expressions of the expectation values of the QAOA and discuss the complexity of the QAOA based ML detector. Explicitly, we evaluate the computational complexity of the classical optimizer used and the storage requirement of simulating the QAOA. Finally, we evaluate the bit error rate (BER) of the QAOA based ML detector and compare it both to the classical ML detector and to the classical minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detector, demonstrating that the QAOA based ML detector is capable of approaching the performance of the classical ML detector.}

In this work, we aim to provide relay communication to the blocked or low-quality terrestrial networks via an aerial relay. Nevertheless, major issues of the considered system are the worrying security and limited service time. Thus, we study a novel aerial relay system via collaborative beamforming (CB) by exploiting a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (UVAA) to achieve a secure and energy-efficient communication for remote ground users (GUs). Specifically, we formulate a secure and energy-efficient communication multi-objective optimization problem (SECMOP) to circumvent the effects of the known and unknown eavesdroppers and minimize the propulsion energy consumption of UAVs, by optimizing the hovering positions and excitation current weights of UAVs and the scheduling for communicating with the remote GUs. The formulated SECMOP is challenging and proven to be NP-hard. Thus, we propose an improved evolutionary computation method with several enhanced designs to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed IMODAOM against various benchmark algorithms. Moreover, we find that the UVAA-based relay can achieve substantial energy consumption reduction as compared to the multi-hop relay scheme.}

The beam alignment (BA) procedure specified for 5th Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) has been designed to be fast and precise in the presence of non-malicious interference and noise. A smart jammer might exploit this weakness and may launch an attack during the BA phase in order to degrade the accuracy of beam selection and, thus, adversely impacting the end-to-end performance and quality-of-service experienced by the users. In this paper, we study the effects of a jamming attack at MMW frequencies during the BA procedure used to perform initial access for idle users and adaptation/recovery for connected users. We show that the BA procedure adopted in 5G NR is extremely vulnerable to a smart jamming attack and, consequently, we propose a countermeasure based on the idea of randomized probing, which consists of randomly corrupting the probing sequence transmitted by the BS in order to reject the jamming signal at the UE via a subspace-based technique based on orthogonal projections and jamming cancellation. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show the very satisfactory accuracy of the proposed anti-jamming approach.}

We show that though this scheme cannot achieve the capacity of the TW-FD-GC, the codeword length that achieves desired decoding error probability is extremely short. Then, we further prove that the proposed scheme is secure by itself, i.e., the achievable rate region of the proposed scheme is also an achievable secrecy rate region of the two-way full-duplex Gaussian wiretap channel (TW-FD-GWTC). In addition, for the TW-FD-GWTC, numerical result shows that the secrecy sum rate of our proposed scheme can be as large as those achieved by existing schemes in the literature for some cases. Next, we extend the proposed scheme to the TW-FD-GC with Gaussian state interference non-causally known by the corresponding transmitter. We show that the interference can be perfectly canceled by this extended scheme. Finally, we prove that this extended scheme is also secure by itself, and numerical result shows that this extended scheme may perform better than the existing ones in the literature.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the joint secrecy and delay guarantees based on opportunistic jamming and link selection in a wireless relay system consisting of a source, a destination, multiple buffer-aided relays and a passive eavesdropper wiretapping over both hops. Based on the information of link state and buffer status, we design a novel transmission scheme based on link selection and jammer selection, which dynamically grants transmission links different priorities for packet delivery, such that the constraints on both secrecy outage probability and packet delay are jointly satisfied. To understand the performance of the new scheme, we then apply the bitmap technique and Markov chain theory to develop a complete theoretical framework for the modelling of three fundamental metrics, namely reliability outage probability, packet discarding probability and secrecy/delay constrained throughput (SDT). Finally, we provide extensive simulation and numerical results to validate our theoretical modelling, as well as to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is superior to the benchmarks in terms of SDT.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is one of the main challenges for implementing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communication system with a large number of antennas at the base station (BS) because RIS is equipped with many passive reflective elements without active transmitting/receiving and signal processing abilities. In this paper, we focus on the channel estimation in a general RIS-aided multi-user mmWave communication system. Specifically, a novel two-phase channel estimation scheme consisting of on-line and off-line phases is proposed to estimate the BS-RIS channel, RIS-user channel, and BS-user channel, respectively. Inspired by the characteristics of few scatterers in mmWave communication systems, the antenna domain channels are converted into the virtual angular domain channels by using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Thus, the estimation problem can be formulated as a compressed sensing (CS) problem, and solved by using efficient vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm with expectation-maximization (EM) to learn unknown parameters and obtain the estimates simultaneously. Simulation results show that, the above algorithm with two choices of prior distributions in the proposed mmWave RIS-aided multi-user system has fast convergence speed and desirable estimation performance.}

However, maximum likelihood (ML) formulation of RSS-based localization problem is non-convex, non-linear, and discontinuous, and cannot be solved using standard optimization techniques. We propose techniques that converts the ML objective function into an invex (invariant convex) function and solve them using gradient descent. We also employ coordinate descent to solve the invex problem in a completely distributed manner without any synchronization requirements. The coordinate descent-based technique can be implemented on the sensor nodes as it has low computational complexity and scales very well to large networks. We prove the convergence theoretically, derive the convergence rate, and provide a detailed computational complexity and communication overhead analysis of the techniques. We perform extensive performance analysis and compare our techniques with centralized and distributed localization methods, and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed techniques in terms of convergence rate, localization accuracy, and execution time.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology and can be used to assist communication systems by adaptively manipulating the wireless environment. In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded channel estimation algorithm for the RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. Inspired by the channel compression idea, we can obtain a sub-sampled channel by turning off a fraction of RIS elements and then extrapolate it to the complete one, by which the pilot overhead is greatly reduced. The problem of channel extrapolation is transformed into recovering the physical parameters of the cascaded channel from the partial channel observations and is then formulated by the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. In order to circumvent the curse of high dimensional matrices inversion in the vector-matrix system, we further introduce the tensor structure into the SBL framework. Specially, by leveraging of the channel sparsity over the angle domain and delay domain, we derive the virtual channel expression in tensor form and model a Kronecker-structured prior distribution for the virtual channels. The multi-domain sparse properties of the virtual channel tensor can be effectively captured by a group of low-dimensional hyper-parameters, and thus reduce the computational complexity. In addition, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived for the proposed channel extrapolation. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {With the exponential growth of data traffic in wireless networks, edge caching has been regarded as a promising solution to offload data traffic and alleviate backhaul congestion, where the contents can be cached by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and user terminal (UT) with local data storage. In this article, a cooperative caching architecture of UAV and UTs with scalable video coding (SVC) is proposed, which provides the high transmission rate content delivery and personalized video viewing qualities in hotspot areas. In the proposed cache-enabling UAV-D2D networks, we formulate a joint optimization problem of UT caching placement, UAV trajectory, and UAV caching placement to maximize the cache utility. To solve this challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the optimization problem is decomposed into three sub-problems. Specifically, we obtain UT caching placement by a many-to-many swap matching algorithm, then obtain the UAV trajectory and UAV caching placement by approximate convex optimization and dynamic programming, respectively. Finally, we propose a low complexity iterative algorithm for the formulated optimization problem to improve the system capacity, fully utilize the cache space resource, and provide diverse delivery qualities for video traffic. Simulation results reveal that: i) the proposed cooperative caching architecture of UAV and UTs obtains larger cache utility than the cache-enabling UAV networks with same data storage capacity and radio resource; ii) compared with the benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves cache utility and reduces backhaul offloading ratio effectively.}

By means of the theoretical analysis, the achievable rate and computation efficiency (CE) are derived. Then, the optimization problem for the CE maximization under the constraints of the minimum rate, maximum power consumption and local CPU frequency is formulated, where the joint design of the hybrid beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming at the RIS as well as the local resource allocation of each user is carried out. An effective iterative algorithm based on the penalized inexact block coordinate descent (BCD) method is proposed to obtain the computation-efficient RA scheme. Next, a low-complexity suboptimal RA scheme based on the BCD method is proposed, and corresponding algorithm is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes are effective, and high CE can be attained. Moreover, the second scheme can achieve the CE performance close to the first scheme but with lower complexity. Besides, it is effective to deploy the RIS scheme in mmWave-MEC system, which can strike a balance between the CE and energy consumption when compared to the conventional relay schemes.}

In this work, we develop a hybrid analog/digital precoding technique in the massive MIMO LEO SATCOM downlink, which reduces the onboard hardware complexity and power consumption. In the proposed scheme, the analog precoder is implemented via a more practical twin-resolution phase shifting (TRPS) network to make a meticulous tradeoff between the power consumption and array gain. In addition, we consider and study the impact of the distortion effect of the nonlinear power amplifiers (NPAs) in the system design. By jointly considering all the above factors, we propose an efficient algorithmic approach for the TRPS-based hybrid precoding problem with NPAs. Numerical results show the EE gains considering the nonlinear distortion and the performance superiority of the proposed TRPS-based hybrid precoding scheme over the baselines.}

	abstract = {This article presents two novel digital predistortion (DPD) based architectures that jointly mitigate the inphase/quadrature (IQ) modulator impairments and the power amplifier (PA) nonlinear distortion in wireless transmitters. The proposed architectures are multibit cartesian and complex delta-sigma modulator-based joint DPDs, called CDSM-JDPD and CXDSM-JDPD, respectively, which enable using low-cost digital-to-analog converters (DACs) while offering versatile linearization capabilities to combat the coexisting distortions of the PA and the IQ modulator. The proposed approach alleviates the need for reverse modeling and implementation of extra hardware to separately deal with frequency-dependent IQ impairments. Moreover, the CXDSM-JDPD enhances the linearization performance and relaxes the high oversampling ratio (OSR) requirement by quantizing the signal more efficiently. Furthermore, the presented concepts inherently support the use of low-resolution DACs, which offers a tremendous advantage in designing and implementing low-cost and energy-efficient radio transmitters. Extensive set of hardware-in-the-loop RF verification measurements with a commercial PA are provided, including two timely 5G New Radio (NR) scenarios at NR bands n3 and n78, while covering channel bandwidths up to 100 MHz and varying the OSR and the DAC bit resolution. The obtained results demonstrate the excellent linearization capabilities of the proposed solutions and their superiority compared to other DSM-based DPD approaches.}

Hence, developing appropriate V2V communication systems and standardization require realistic V2V propagation channel models. However, most existing V2V channel modeling studies focus on car-to-car channels; only a few investigate truck-to-car (T2C) or truck-to-truck (T2T) channels. In this paper, a hybrid geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed for T2X (T2C or T2T) channels in freeway environments. Next, we parameterize this GBSM from the extensive channel measurements. We extract the multipath components (MPCs) by using a joint maximum likelihood estimation (RiMAX) and then determine the cluster types based on their evolution patterns. We classify the determined clusters into line-of-sight, single-bounce reflections from static interaction objects (IOs), single-bounce reflections from mobile IOs, multiple-bounce reflections, and density multipath components (DMCs). Particularly, we model multiple-bounce reflections as double clusters following the COST 273/COST2100 method. This paper presents the complete parameterization of the channel model. We validate this model by comparing the delay spread and the angular spreads of arrival/departure obtained from the proposed model with the measurement data.}

Directional communication is an intrinsic attribute of THz wireless networks and the knowledge of direction should be harvested continuously to maintain link quality. Direction discovery can potentially impose an immense burden on the network that limits its communication capacity exceedingly. To utterly mitigate direction discovery overhead, we propose a novel technique called spectrum shaping capable of measuring direction, power, and relative distance of propagation paths via a single measurement. We demonstrate that the proposed technique is also able to measure the transmitter antenna orientation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed design in several scenarios and show that the introduced technique performs similar to a large array of antennas while attaining a much simpler hardware architecture. Results show that the spectrum shaping with only two antennas placed 0.5 mm, 5 mm, and 1 cm apart performs direction of arrival estimation similar to a much more complex uniform linear array equipped with 7, 60, and 120 antennas, respectively.}

The above performance factors are also benchmarked with the case that only a point-to-point (P2P) link without RIS is considered (denotes as as P2P-HI and P2P-ID systems for HI and ideal hardware conditions, respectively). All obtained formulas are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. It is observed that the RIS-HI system significantly outperforms the P2P-HI system at low transmit power regime, while the performance of the RIS-ID system is always better than that of P2P-ID system. On the other hand, HIs show more severe effect for higher data transmission rates or high modulation orders.}

	abstract = {Wireless powered multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable high-performance computation of energy-constrained wireless devices (WDs) in internet of things (IoT) systems. However, to overcome the severe path loss of both energy transfer and data communications, wireless powered MEC suffers from high operating power consumption. To achieve sustainable and economic system operation, this paper focuses on developing energy-efficient online data processing strategy for wireless powered MEC systems under stochastic fading channels. In particular, we consider a hybrid access point (HAP) transmitting RF energy to and processing the sensing data offloaded from multiple WDs. Under an average power constraint of the HAP, we target at maximizing the long-term average data sensing rate of the WDs while maintaining task data queue stability. To this end, we formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to control the energy transfer and task data processing in sequential time slots. Without the knowledge of future channel fading, it is very challenging to determine the sequential control actions that are tightly coupled by the battery and data buffer dynamics. To solve the problem, we propose a Lyapunov optimization-based online algorithm named LEESE, which decomposes the multi-stage stochastic problem into per-slot deterministic optimization problems. We show that each per-slot problem can be equivalently transformed into a convex optimization problem. To facilitate online implementation in large-scale MEC systems, instead of solving the per-slot problem with off-the-shelf convex algorithms, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method that produces a close-to-optimal solution in less than 0.04% of the computation delay. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LEESE algorithm can provide 18% higher data sensing rate than the representative benchmark methods considered, while incurring sub-millisecond computation delay suitable for real-time control under fading channel.}

	abstract = {The simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is capable of providing full-space coverage of smart radio environments. This work investigates STAR-RIS aided downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multi-cell networks, where the energy of incident signals at STAR-RISs is split into two portions for transmitting and reflecting. We first propose a fitting method to model the distribution of composite small-scale fading power as the tractable Gamma distribution. Then, a unified analytical framework based on stochastic geometry is provided to capture the random locations of RIS-RISs, base stations (BSs), and user equipments (UEs). Based on this framework, we derive the coverage probability and ergodic rate of both the typical UE and the connected UE. In particular, we obtain closed-form expressions of the coverage probability in interference-limited scenarios. We also deduce theoretical expressions in conventional RIS aided networks for comparison. The analytical results show that optimal energy splitting coefficients of STAR-RISs exist to simultaneously maximize the system coverage and ergodic rate. The numerical results demonstrate that: 1) STAR-RISs are able to meet different demands of UEs located on different sides; 2) STAR-RISs with appropriate energy splitting coefficients outperform conventional RISs in the coverage and the rate performance.}

	abstract = {For many applications envisioned for the Internet of Things (IoT), it is expected that the sensors will have very low costs and zero power, which can be satisfied by meta-material sensor based IoT, i.e., meta-IoT. As their constituent meta-materials can reflect wireless signals with environment-sensitive reflection coefficients, meta-IoT sensors can achieve simultaneous sensing and transmission without any active modulation. However, to maximize the sensing accuracy, the structures of meta-IoT sensors need to be optimized considering their joint influence on sensing and transmission, which is challenging due to the high computational complexity in evaluating the influence, especially given a large number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a joint sensing and transmission design method for meta-IoT systems with a large number of meta-IoT sensors, which can efficiently optimize the sensing accuracy of the system. Specifically, a computationally efficient received signal model is established to evaluate the joint influence of meta-material structure on sensing and transmission. Then, a sensing algorithm based on deep unsupervised learning is designed to obtain accurate sensing results in a robust manner. Experiments with a prototype verify that the system has a higher sensitivity and a longer transmission range compared to existing designs, and can sense environmental anomalies correctly within 2 meters.}

We consider a source equipped with multiple antennas and a single radio-frequency (RF) chain. We propose a low complexity rule that does joint antenna selection (AS) at source and passive beamforming at IRS. We derive new expressions for probability of outage in WET under perfect and estimated channel knowledge and for both single and multiple users. We derive intuitive expressions for outage probability with large number of IRS elements and for line-of-sight scenarios. For a system with\nM\nantennas at source and\nN\npassive elements at IRS, we show that diversity order equals\nM+N\n. Extensions to subset AS, discrete phase-shift design, and performance under limited scattering are also presented. Our numerical results show that the proposed AS rule yields near-optimal performance while requiring only\nM+N\npilot transmissions compared to the\nM+MN\npilot transmissions required by the optimal AS rule in literature. We elucidate that we can trade-off active RF chains at source with passive elements at IRS to obtain improved performance both in terms of outage probability and power transfer efficiency. And 3-bit IRS is sufficient to obtain good performance at lower complexity.}

	abstract = {Plane spiral orbital angular momentum (PSOAM) mode-groups (MGs) and multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) serve as two emerging techniques for achieving high spectral efficiency (SE) in the next-generation networks. In this paper, a PSOAM MGs based multi-user MIMO-NOMA system is studied, where the base station transmits data to users by utilizing the generated PSOAM beams. For such scenario, the interference between users in different PSOAM mode groups can be avoided, which leads to a significant performance enhancement. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system subject to the constraints of the total transmission power and the minimum data rate. This designed optimization problem is non-convex owing to the interference among users, and hence is quite difficult to tackle directly. To solve this issue, we develop a dual layer resource allocation algorithm where the bisection method is exploited in the outer layer to obtain the optimal EE and a resource distributed iterative algorithm is exploited in the inner layer to optimize the transmit power. Besides, an alternative resource allocation algorithm with Deep Belief Networks (DBN) is proposed to cope with the requirement for low computational complexity. Simulation results verify the theoretical findings and demonstrate the proposed algorithms on the PSOAM MGs based MIMO-NOMA system can obtain a better performance comparing to the conventional MIMO-NOMA system in terms of EE.}

Each code block of SR-staircase codes is obtained by encoding rearranged preceding code blocks and new information blocks, where the rearrangement involves sub-blocks decomposition and transposition. The proposed codes can be constructed to have each code block size of\n1/q\nto that of the conventional staircase codes while having the same rate and component codes, for any positive integer\nq\n. In this regard, we can use strong algebraic component codes to construct SR-staircase codes with a similar or the same code block size and rate as staircase codes with weak component codes. We characterize the decoding threshold of the proposed codes under iterative bounded distance decoding (iBDD) by using density evolution. We also derive the conditions under which they achieve a better decoding threshold than that of staircase codes. Further, we investigate the error floor performance by analyzing the contributing error patterns and their multiplicities. Both theoretical and simulation results show that the designed SR-staircase codes outperform staircase codes in terms of waterfall and error floor while the performance can be further improved by using a large coupling width.}

It turns out that AID is far less accurate than ROVA in practice. This paper proposes codeword information density (CID), which modifies AID to improve its accuracy and leads to a lower-complexity implementation of ROVA. The paper includes an analytical expression for the random variable describing the correct decoding probability computed by ROVA and uses this expression to characterize how the probabilities of correct decoding, undetected error, and negative acknowledgement behave as a function of the selected threshold for reliable decoding. This paper examines both the complexity and the simulation time of ROVA, CID, AID, and the Fricke and Hoeher approximation to ROVA. This paper also derives an expression for the union bound on the frame error rate for zero-terminated trellis codes with punctured symbols and uses it to optimize the order of symbol transmission in an incremental retransmission scheme. This paper concludes by comparing the performance of an incremental retransmission scheme using ROVA as a stopping condition to one that uses a CRC as a stopping condition.}

We develop an efficient decoding algorithm that combines pipeline decoding and layered scheduling for the decoding of SC-PLDPCH-CCs, and analyze the latency and complexity of the decoder. To estimate the decoding thresholds of SC-PLDPCH-CCs, we first propose a layered protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm to evaluate the thresholds of spatially coupled PLDPC-Hadamard terminated codes (SC-PLDPCH-TDCs) with a moderate coupling length. With the use of the proposed layered PEXIT method, we develop a genetic algorithm to find good SC-PLDPCH-TDCs in a systematic way. Then we extend the coupling length of these SC-PLDPCH-TDCs to form good SC-PLDPCH-CCs. Results show that our constructed SC-PLDPCH-CCs can achieve comparable thresholds to the block code counterparts. Simulations illustrate the superiority of the SC-PLDPCH-CCs over the block code counterparts and other state-of-the-art low-rate codes in terms of error performance.

	abstract = {Light nodes in blockchains improve the scalability of the system by storing a small portion of the blockchain ledger. In certain blockchains, light nodes are vulnerable to a data availability (DA) attack where a malicious node makes the light nodes accept an invalid block by hiding the invalid portion of the block from the nodes in the system. Recently, a technique based on LDPC codes called Coded Merkle Tree (CMT) was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect a DA attack by randomly requesting/sampling portions of the block from the malicious node. However, light nodes fail to detect a DA attack with high probability if a malicious node hides a small stopping set of the LDPC code. To mitigate this problem, Yu et al. used random LDPC codes that achieve large minimum stopping set size with high probability. Although effective, these codes are not necessarily optimal for this application, especially at short code lengths, which are relevant for low latency systems, IoT blockchains, etc.. In this paper, we focus on short code lengths and demonstrate that a suitable co-design of specialized LDPC codes and the light node sampling strategy can improve the probability of detection of DA attacks. We consider different adversary models based on their computational capabilities of finding stopping sets in LDPC codes. For a weak adversary model, we devise a new LDPC code construction termed as the entropy-constrained PEG (EC-PEG) algorithm which concentrates stopping sets to a small group of variable nodes. We demonstrate that the EC-PEG algorithm coupled with a greedy sampling strategy improves the probability of detection of DA attacks. For stronger adversary models, we provide a co-design of a sampling strategy called linear-programming-sampling (LP-sampling) and an LDPC code construction called linear-programming-constrained PEG (LC-PEG) algorithm. The new co-design demonstrates a higher probability of detection of DA attacks compared to approaches in earlier literature.}

	abstract = {Binary quasi-reversible BCH codes whose defining set contains consecutive elements from negative to positive integers have received considerable attention in recent years due to their efficient decoding suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper combines the concept of the weight and quasi-reversible structures to introduce two subclasses of BCH codes: odd-like/even-like quasi-reversible BCH codes. The step-by-step decoding of these codes is developed as follows: First, the weight evaluation of a received polynomial is able to judge whether the number of errors is odd or even, which helps to simplify the decoding processes. Second, based on Chiò’s pivotal condensation process which can be easily implemented in a parallel computing architecture, the determinant calculation of the band matrix instead of Peterson’s matrix in column-echelon form is faster. Third, a newly proposed non-monic error-locator polynomial is sparser than the conventional ones. As a consequence, the theoretical analysis and experimental results validate potential benefits in requiring fewer finite field additions and multiplications used in the decoding of binary odd-like/even-like quasi-reversible BCH codes up to half the minimum distance when compared with the narrow-sense BCH codes with small error-correcting capability.}

These codes are constructed by applying spatial coupling on parallel concatenated codes (PCCs) with a fraction of information bits repeated q\ntimes. GSC-PCCs can be seen as a generalization of the original spatially-coupled parallel concatenated codes proposed by Moloudi et al. , 2017. To characterize the asymptotic performance of GSC-PCCs, we derive the corresponding density evolution equations and compute their decoding thresholds. The threshold saturation effect is observed and proven. Most importantly, we rigorously prove that the rate- R\nGSC-PCC ensemble with 2-state convolutional component codes achieves at least a fraction 1-\\frac {R}{R+q}\nof the capacity of the binary erasure channel (BEC) for repetition factor q\\geq 2\nand this multiplicative gap vanishes as q\ntends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first class of SC-TCs that are proven to be capacity-achieving. Further, the connection between the strength of the component codes, the decoding thresholds of GSC-PCCs, and the repetition factor is established. The superiority of the proposed codes with finite blocklength is exemplified by comparing their error performance with that of existing SC-TCs via computer simulations.}

	abstract = {The demand for higher broadband speeds is ever increasing whereas the deployment of full fibre to the premises is slower than initially predicted and remains costly. Solutions exploiting the existing, ubiquitous, copper network and increasing its capacity would be highly beneficial in the near term. One approach is to use surface wave (SW) transmission mode to transmit signals over the existing copper cabling network. We present proof-of-concept experimental SW data transmission on twisted pair cables. A surface wave launcher for low GHz carrier frequency operation is designed and optimised. Experimentally, we demonstrate data rates in excess of 12 Gb/s in a 1.15-3.25 GHz band over a 6.1 m twisted pair cable with an average bit error rate of\n2.25×\n10\n−5\n, without coding or feedback implementation. Furthermore, higher frequency bands are tested with data rates up to 3.4 Gb/s displaying their potential for surface wave transmission. S-parameter measurements allow capacity estimations of SW data transmission on longer cable lengths using water-filling algorithms. Our calculations predict over 13 Gb/s capacity on a 100 m cable using a 3.5 GHz transmission bandwidth, this may be further extended by further increases to the bandwidth used for SW transmission.}

	abstract = {In this study, we present a unifying framework for future reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted space shift keying (SSK) systems; we additionally propose two novel transmission schemes. The key strategies surrounding this concept, namely power-sensing RIS-SSK and partitioned RIS-SSK, grant knowledge of the activated transmitter (Tx) antenna index at the RIS, which, when using SSK, allows us to adjust the reflection phases. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated in terms of the theoretical average bit error rate (ABER), and the effect of non-ideal transceivers. The performance is then compared to that of a reference RIS-SSK scheme, and a complexity analysis is provided. The obtained results, verified by extensive computer simulations, demonstrate that the partitioned and power-sensing RIS-SSK schemes achieve a higher ABER than the reference one. Moreover, hardware impairments clearly have a critically degrading impact on the system performance for all schemes, and should be carefully taken into account in future communication systems.}

	abstract = {Massive machine-type communications protocols have typically been designed under the assumption that coordination between users requires significant communication overhead and is thus impractical. Recent progress in efficient activity detection and collision-free scheduling, however, indicates that the cost of coordination can be much less than the naive scheme for scheduling. This work considers a scenario in which a massive number of devices with sporadic traffic seek to access a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base-station (BS) and explores an approach in which device activity detection is followed by a single common feedback broadcast message, which is used both to schedule the active users to different transmission slots and to assign orthogonal pilots to the users for channel estimation. The proposed coordinated communication scheme is compared to two prevalent contention-based schemes: coded pilot access, which is based on the principle of coded slotted ALOHA, and an approximate message passing scheme for joint user activity detection and channel estimation. Numerical results indicate that scheduled massive access provides significant gains in the number of successful transmissions per slot and in sum rate, due to the reduced interference, at only a small cost of feedback.}

	abstract = {Magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) is a promising memory technology due to its high density, non-volatility, and high endurance. However, achieving high memory fidelity incurs high write-energy costs, which should be reduced for large-scale deployment of MRAMs. In this paper, we formulate a biconvex optimization problem to optimize write fidelity given energy and latency constraints. The basic idea is to allocate non-uniform write pulses depending on the importance of each bit position. The fidelity measure we consider is mean squared error (MSE), for which we optimize write pulses via alternating convex search (ACS). We derive analytic solutions and propose an alternating water-filling algorithm by casting the MRAM’s write operation as communication over parallel channels. Hence, the proposed alternating water-filling algorithm is computationally more efficient than the original ACS while their solutions are identical. Since the formulated biconvex problem is non-convex, both the original ACS and the proposed algorithm do not guarantee global optimality. However, the MSEs obtained by the proposed algorithm are comparable to the MSEs by complicated global nonlinear programming solvers. Furthermore, we prove that our algorithm can reduce the MSE exponentially with the number of bits per word. For an 8-bit accessed word, the proposed algorithm reduces the MSE by a factor of 21. We also evaluate MNIST dataset classification supposing that the model parameters of deep neural networks are stored in MRAMs. The numerical results show that the optimized write pulses can achieve 40% write-energy reduction for the same classification accuracy.}

In this paper, we propose the designs of the microfluidic transmitter and receiver with quadruple concentration shift keying (QCSK) modulation and demodulation functionalities. To do so, we first present an AND gate design, and then apply it to the QCSK transmitter and receiver design. The QCSK transmitter is capable of modulating two input signals to four different concentration levels, and the QCSK receiver can demodulate a received signal to two outputs. More importantly, we also establish a mathematical framework to theoretically characterize our proposed microfluidic circuits. Based on this, we first derive the output concentration distribution of our proposed AND gate design, and provide the insight into the selection of design parameters to ensure an exhibition of desired behavior. We further derive the output concentration distributions of the QCSK transmitter and receiver. Simulation results obtained in COMSOL Multiphysics not only show the desired behavior of all the proposed microfluidic circuits, but also demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed mathematical framework.}

For the first time, the maximum-length sequences (also called as m-sequences) are used to create 2-D CH matrices with a reduced number of “jump” columns. The two new constructions carry the desirable properties of maximum rendezvous diversity (MRD) and even channel use (ECU) and, more importantly, have the shortest periods in their categories of constructions. Another contribution is on the embedment of optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) to eliminate “stay” columns in the RDSML-CH matrices, thus resulting in the first and only family of the asynchronous CH sequences that can asymptotically achieve the theoretical period lower bound. To support the RDSML-CH construction, a new shortened RDS algorithm for creating the OOCs with smaller weight-to-length ratios than the existing ones is proposed. Numerical and simulation analyses show that the two new constructions have a good balance of short period, MRD, ECU, short time-to-rendezvous (TTR) mean, small TTR variance, and short maximum-TTR, thus more suitable for practical CR wireless networks than the existing constructions.}

	abstract = {Real-time monitoring has received considerable attention recently due to its potential in automatic driving, tele-surgery, and factory automation in the 6G era. In remote estimation or reconstruction of stochastic processes, the statistical properties of stochastic processes to be monitored play a central role. Among the stochastic processes interested by real-time applications, the Brownian motion, also known as the Wiener processes is a typical one. In this paper, we are interested in how to monitor Brownian motions efficiently, timely, and reliably. To achieve this goal, we reveal that the real-time estimation error is jointly determined by the quantization error and freshness of data samples. Based on this observation, we present an optimal joint sampling and quantization scheme that efficiently balances the quantization distortion and the age-of-information (AoI). Furthermore, we find that the error accumulation will lead to infinite distortion as monitoring time increases. To overcome this, a multi-layer error correction method is presented for infinite-time monitoring, in which bounded distortion can be achieved with limited data rate. Finally, to conquer the accumulation of transmission errors in unreliable channels, we present an error correction mechanism based on periodic feedback. Diffusion approximation is then adopted to determine the optimal feedback rate and interval.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider Internet of Things (IoT) based mobile edge computing (MEC) system. IoT devices are controlled by access points (APs), which do not have access to any licensed spectrum. This puts limitations on IoT devices’ offloading capability and hence effectively reduces the number of computed bits. Under such scenario, we consider spectrum sharing, where IoT networks get access to licensed spectrum by helping a primary network (owns licensed spectrum) in cooperative relaying. We aim to maximize sum of the primary network’s communication rate and IoT networks’ total number of computed bits by jointly optimizing relay selection, licensed spectrum allocation, local computation, and offloading sequence selection. Moreover, we consider important constraints, e.g., the guaranteed rate for the primary network, IoT devices’ available energy, and available licensed spectrum resource blocks (RBs). We observe that the optimization problem is combinatoric in nature, which becomes more complicated when IoT devices’ scheduling order comes into the formulation. From our analysis, we devise an optimal and computationally efficient algorithm. In the result section, we compare with relevant benchmark systems and show the efficacy of our proposed model. Moreover, we also show how IoT and primary networks benefit from spectrum sharing.}

	abstract = {Linear prediction and entropy coding are widely used in speech, audio, video, and other coding systems. Rate-distortion optimization (RDO) is another relevant coding technique, which is especially useful when the encoder performance depends on tunable parameters from distinct coding subsystems. This work presents a RDO strategy for variable-rate encoders that use linear prediction and entropy coding. The method is suitable when the signal to be compressed is short-term stationary and the prediction order varies over signal segments. The second contribution of this paper is to customize the method to the compression of time-domain OFDM-based cellular radio signals. The method enables a 4G / 5G packet-based fronthaul to flexibly trade-off rate and distortion depending on the amount of information to be transmitted and, consequently, benefit from multiplexing gain. Simulation results with LTE signals show that the proposed method achieves improved performance with a relatively low computational cost, while operating with time-domain signals under different traffic scenarios.}

	abstract = {The polar receiver architecture is a receiver design that captures the envelope and phase information of the signal rather than its in-phase and quadrature components. Several studies have demonstrated the robustness of polar receivers to phase noise and other nonlinearities. Yet, the information-theoretic limits of polar receivers with finite-precision quantizers have not been investigated in the literature. The main contribution of this work is to identify the optimal signaling strategy for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with polar quantization at the output. More precisely, we show that the capacity-achieving modulation scheme has an amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) structure. Using this result, the capacity of the AWGN channel with polar quantization at the output is established by numerically optimizing the probability mass function of the amplitude. The capacity of the polar-quantized AWGN channel with b_{1}\n-bit phase quantizer and optimized single-bit magnitude quantizer is also presented. Our numerical findings suggest the existence of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds, above which the number of amplitude levels of the optimal APSK scheme and their respective probabilities change abruptly. Moreover, the manner in which the capacity-achieving input evolves with increasing SNR depends on the number of phase quantization bits.}

As opposed to treating pilot contamination interference as noise (TIN), we study the performance of decoding the pilot contamination interference. We model pilot-sharing users as an interference channel (IC) and study the performance of schemes that decode this interference partially based on rate-splitting (RS), and compare the performance to schemes that decode the interference in its entirety based on simultaneous unique decoding (SD) or non-unique decoding (SND). For RS, we non-uniquely decode each layer of the pilot contamination interference and use one common power splitting coefficient per IC. Additionally, we establish an achievable region for this RS scheme. Solving a maximum symmetric rate allocation problem based on linear programming (LP), we show that for zero-forcing (ZF) with spatially correlated/uncorrelated channels and with a practical number of BS antennas, RS achieves significantly higher spectral efficiencies than TIN, SD and SND. Furthermore, we numerically examine the impact of increasing the correlation of the channel across antennas, the number of users as well as the degree of shadow fading. In all cases, we show that RS maintains significant gain over TIN, SD and SND.}

	abstract = {A new source model, which consists of an intrinsic state part and an extrinsic observation part, is proposed and its information-theoretic characterization, namely its rate-distortion function, is defined and analyzed. Such a source model is motivated by the recent surge of interest in the semantic aspect of information: the intrinsic state corresponds to the semantic feature of the source, which in general is not observable but can only be inferred from the extrinsic observation. There are two distortion measures, one between the intrinsic state and its reproduction, and the other between the extrinsic observation and its reproduction. Under a given code rate, the tradeoff between these two distortion measures is characterized by the rate-distortion function, which is solved via the indirect rate-distortion theory and is termed the semantic rate-distortion function of the source. As an application of the general model and its analysis, the case of Gaussian extrinsic observation is studied, assuming a linear relationship between the intrinsic state and the extrinsic observation, under a quadratic distortion structure. The semantic rate-distortion function is shown to be the solution of a convex programming problem with respect to an error covariance matrix, and a reverse water-filling type of solution is provided when the model further satisfies a diagonalizability condition.}

In this paper, we provide tight and easily computable inner and outer bounds for a general two-user IM/DD IC under peak and average optical intensity constraints. The bounds enable characterizing the asymptotic sum-rate capacity in the strong and weak interference regimes, as well as the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) in the symmetric case. Using the obtained bounds, the GDoF of the IM/DD IC is shown to have a ‘W’ shape similar to the Gaussian IC with power constraints. The obtained bounds are also evaluated numerically in different interference regimes to show their tightness, and used to study the performance of on-chip and indoor OWC systems.}

Network coding resists the active eavesdroppers that cannot obtain all the data flows, but highly relies on the wiretap channel states that are rarely known in wireless networks. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based random linear network coding scheme for drone-aided cellular systems to address eavesdropping. In this scheme, the network coding policy, including the encoded packet number, the packet and power allocation, is chosen based on the measured jamming power, previous transmission performance and BS channel states. A virtual model generates simulated experiences to update Q-values besides real experiences for faster policy optimization. We also propose a deep RL version and design a hierarchical architecture to further accelerate the policy exploration and improve the anti-eavesdropping performance, in terms of the intercept probability, the latency, the outage probability and the energy consumption. We analyze the computational complexity, drone deployment, secure coverage area and the performance bound of the proposed schemes, which are verified via simulation results.}

	abstract = {Satellite based spectrum sensing is studied for a system consisting of multiple satellites and a gateway (GW), where these satellites perform spectrum sensing and send mass spectrum-sensing data to the GW. To address the challenges of mass spectrum-sensing data and limited transmission capacity of the links from spectrum-sensing satellites to the GW, we propose a method called joint anomalous data repairing and deep convolutional neural network based spectrum reconstruction (ADRD-SR), which can reconstruct the original spectrum-sensing data from the incomplete data. Specifically, the GW preprocesses the incomplete data using the anomalous data repairing algorithm. A deep convolutional neural network is constructed and well trained, then it is activated to reconstruct the preprocessed spectrum data. Additionally, to sustain good reconstruction performance by tracing the dynamical spectrum-sensing data, we design a real-time evaluation oriented spectrum reconstruction framework, through seeking the events when the mean absolute error (MAE) becomes larger than a predefined threshold. Furthermore, the ADRD-SR method can reduce the MAE by more than 68% over the conventional reconstruction methods. Moreover, the reconstructed spectrum data can be used to assist spectrum sensing, and the corresponding probability of correct detection is only degraded by 5% even when 75% of the data is discarded.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates different precoding strategies for rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) in the downlink of multi-cell visible light communication (VLC) networks. Since classical Shannon capacity formula does not hold for VLC, we first provide a lower bound on the channel capacity for RSMA in such interfering networks. Then, we formulate a spectral efficiency maximization problem to jointly find the optimal rate-splitting and transmit precoding. Beside that, since cell-edge users suffer from additional inter-cell interference, we propose to design the precoders of different RSMA signals utilizing coordinated beamforming (CB). Subsequently, aiming to improve the performance of the CB design for RSMA, while maintain a reduced complexity, we introduce two enhanced precoding strategies for RSMA. To the best of the authors’ knowledge such a contribution has not been considered before in the open literature. It is shown in the paper that the formulated optimization problem is non-convex and a sub-optimal, yet, a low complexity solution can be obtained efficiently using semi-definite relaxation combined with successive convex approximation. Through analytical results, we illustrate the flexibility and superiority of the proposed precoding strategies for RSMA over conventional coordinated space division multiple access and non-orthogonal multiple access for different scenarios and network loads.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamic power allocation for a visible light communication (VLC) cellular system consisting of two coordinating attocells, each equipped with one access-point (AP). The coordinated multipoint (CoMP) between the two cells is introduced to assist users experiencing high inter-cell-interference (ICI). Specifically, the coordinated zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is used to cancel the ICI at the users located near the centers of the cells, whereas the joint transmission (JT) is employed to eliminate the ICI at the users located at the edge of both cells and to improve their receptions as well. Furthermore, two multiple access techniques are invoked within each cell, namely, non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) and cooperative non-orthogonal-multiple-access (C-NOMA). Hence, two multiple access techniques are proposed for the considered multi-user multi-cell system, namely, the CoMP-assisted NOMA scheme and the CoMP-assisted C-NOMA scheme. For each scheme, two power allocation frameworks are formulated each as an optimization problem, where the objective of the former is maximizing the network sum data rate while guaranteeing a certain quality-of-service (QoS) for each user, whereas the goal of the latter is to maximize the minimum data rate among all coexisting users. The formulated optimization problems are not convex, and hence, difficult to be solved directly unless using heuristic methods, which comes at the expense of high computational complexity. To overcome this issue, optimal and low complexity power allocation schemes are derived. In the simulation results, the performance of the proposed CoMP-assisted NOMA and CoMP-assisted C-NOMA schemes are compared with those of the CoMP-assisted orthogonal-multiple-access (OMA) scheme, the C-NOMA scheme and the NOMA scheme, where the superiority of the proposed schemes are demonstrated. Finally, the performance of the proposed schemes and the considered baselines is evaluated while varying various system parameters.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and device-to-device (D2D) communication are two promising technologies for improving transmission reliability between transceivers in communication systems. In this paper, we consider the design of reliable communication between the access point (AP) and actuators for a downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) system in the industrial IoT (IIoT) scenario. We propose a two-stage protocol combining IRS with D2D communication so that all actuators can successfully receive the message from AP within a given delay. The superiority of the protocol is that the communication reliability between AP and actuators is doubly augmented by the IRS-aided first-stage transmission and the second-stage D2D transmission. A joint optimization problem of active and passive beamforming is formulated, which aims to maximize the number of actuators with successful decoding. We study the joint beamforming problem for cases where the channel state information (CSI) is perfect and imperfect. For each case, we develop efficient algorithms that include convergence and complexity analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity and role of IRS with a well-optimized reflection matrix, and the D2D network in promoting reliable communication. Moreover, the proposed protocol can enable reliable communication even in the presence of stringent latency requirements and CSI estimation errors.}

Based on only local channel state information, conjugate beamforming is used under both proper and improper Gaussian signalings. To accomplish the mission of cfm-MIMO in providing fair service to all users, the problem of power allocation to maximize the geometric mean (GM) of users’ rates (GM-rate) is considered. A new scalable algorithm, which iterates linear-complex closed-form expressions and thus is practical regardless of the scale of the network, is developed for its solution. The problem of quality-of-service (QoS) aware network energy-efficiency is also addressed via maximizing the ratio of the GM-rate and the total power consumption, which is also addressed by iterating linear-complex closed-form expressions. Intensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the ability of the GM-rate based optimization to achieve multiple targets such as a uniform QoS, a good sum rate, and a fair power allocation to the APs.}

	abstract = {Underlay device-to-device (D2D) communications improve the spectral efficiency by simultaneously allowing direct communication between D2D-users on the same channels as cellular-users (CUs). However, most related works consider perfect channel-state-information (CSI) with single-antenna transmissions and usually assign each channel to one D2D pair. In this work, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the aggregate rate of all D2D pairs and CUs in single and multiple antenna configurations under imperfect CSI, by optimizing channel and power resources. Our formulation guarantees probability of outage below a specified threshold and fairness in channel allocation across D2D pairs. The resulting problem is a stochastic-mixed-integer-non-convex problem, we solve it approximately by alternating between power-allocation and channel-assignment sub-problems. The stochastic objective and outage constraints are addressed by the concept of order-of-statistics in the single-antenna case and the Bernstein-type inequality in the multiple-antenna configuration. The power-allocation sub-problem is solved by exploiting a quadratic-transformation, while the channel-assignment sub-problem is solved by integer relaxation. Furthermore, two computationally efficient algorithms are proposed to approximately solve the problem in a partially decentralized manner. We also establish convergence guarantees for the different algorithms proposed in this work. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.}

We consider downstream communication over a Rician block-fading channel, from a multi–antenna basestation to a number of single-antenna users. Multi-user interference is eliminated by applying zero-forcing precoding. Using a realistic rectifier model, we compare EH and ID performances of linear precoding (LP) and modified Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). We add low-complexity algorithms to these precoders that optimize the user ordering and the constellation rotations. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the amplitude ratio\nρ\nASK\nof the constellation on the energy-rate trade-off. Compared to the same precoders without optimization, optimizing the user ordering, rotations and\nρ\nASK\nconsiderably reduces the transmit power required to achieve a harvested power of −30 dBm or an average mutual information of\n(\nlog\n2\nM)/2\n. Both with and without optimizations, THP outperforms LP in terms of EH and ID, but THP exhibits much larger gains when optimizations are applied.}

We thus revise the basic concepts of the timeliness and the accuracy and propose their formal definitions in the case of non real-time applications characterized by a possibility of non-causal signal reconstruction at the destination. In particular, we link the concept of accuracy to the canonical first-order auto-regressive model of the signal, while the timeliness is defined by the time difference to reference samples of the signal. We compare the proposed semantic metrics in the case of different buffer management strategies and using numerical examples we show that the optimality of the transmission strategy changes when the real-time or non real-time applications are considered.}

	abstract = {Energy-efficient time synchronizations for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been put under the spotlight for years. A promising technique among which is the timestamp-free approach where no timestamps are required to establish the synchronization, thereby sparing the transmissions of the timing messages for conserving significant transmission energy. In this paper, we first investigate the feasibility of adopting timestamp-free time synchronization in practical resource-constrained WSNs; we then identify the issue of inaccuracy in maintaining the pre-defined response interval which affects the foundations of most existing timestamp-free schemes. Based on the investigation and our previously proposed reverse asymmetric time synchronization framework, we further propose an asymmetric timestamp-free time synchronization scheme with two estimation methods tailored for resource-constrained WSNs. We as well introduce the centralized and distributed multi-hop extension methods for the proposed scheme to cover diverse multi-hop scenarios. Experimental results on a real WSN testbed consisting of TelosB motes running TinyOS demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves high energy efficiency while maintaining microsecond-level time synchronization accuracy compared to three other conventional schemes.}

On standard processors, it can take hours to reconcile the required number of quantum signals. This problem is exacerbated for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite CV-QKD, where the satellite flyover time is less than a few minutes. A potential solution is massive parallelisation of the classical reconciliation where a large-code block is subdivided into many shorter blocks for individual decoding. However, the penalty of this procedure on the important final secured key rate is non-trivial to determine and hitherto has not been formally analysed. In this work, we fill this important knowledge gap via detailed analyses and experimental verification of a CV-QKD sliced reconciliation protocol that uses large block-length low-density parity-check decoders. Our new solution results in a significant increase in the final key rate relative to non-optimised reconciliation. In addition, it allows for the acquisition of quantum secured messages between terrestrial stations and LEO satellites within a flyover timescale even using off-the-shelf processors. Our work allows for optimised global quantum networks secured via fundamental physics.}

Conventional anti-jamming methods such as frequency hopping-based anti-jamming schemes are not effective against reactive jammers, especially the agile ones that jam immediately after sensing transmissions. Deceiving-based anti-jamming methods have a great potential in harnessing reactive jammers and securing communication channels for legitimate users. However, in deceiving-based anti-jamming methods, reaching the optimal power and channel allocation is complicated due to the unavailability of the jammers’ channel information. In this paper, we propose deceiving-based anti-jamming schemes against reactive jammers employing reinforcement learning. Moreover, we consider both cases where a reactive jammer can jam a channel or all the channels utilized by legitimate users. In the latter case, we model the interaction between users and the jammer as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game and prove equilibrium. In addition, we study different scenarios where the interacting environment is static or dynamic in terms of channel gains. Simulation results show that in static environments, the proposed methods achieve the optimal values of the total received power and Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio with an accuracy of 95%. Moreover, in dynamic environments, the proposed methods provide high performance in terms of the considered evaluation metrics.}

We show a critical observation that CSI models are different before and after IRS deployment, thus the optimization problem could be decomposed and solved via a two-stage framework. For case a), in the first stage, universal upper bounds of outage probabilities only related to the location of IRS are derived which can be optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA) method. In the second stage, we develop an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize beamformer and phase shifts iteratively. For case b), we propose a Max-Min SR scheme based on two-stage framework, where the location of IRS is optimized based on the worst location of Eve.

We consider a practical scenario where mutual interference exists between the primary users and cognitive users. To achieve high physical layer security with low implementation complexity, we propose three pure user scheduling schemes, namely, selection combining (SC) scheme, threshold-based switched diversity (tSD) scheme and switch-and-examine combining with post-selection (SECps) scheme. To further improve physical layer security, we present an extension of our SC framework to a jammer aided multiuser network and propose a jammer aided SC (JSC) scheme. We derive the closed-form intercept probability (IP), outage probability (OP) and effective secrecy throughput (EST) expressions for SC, tSD, SECps and JSC schemes over Nakagami- m\nchannels to analyze the system performance. Numerical results show that among the three pure multiuser scheduling schemes, the SC scheme achieves the best secrecy performance with the highest complexity, the SECps scheme obtains the worst secrecy performance with the lowest complexity. In addition, the secrecy performance of JSC scheme is better than that of SC scheme in the high SNR region.}

	abstract = {Physical layer security is a useful tool to prevent illegal wiretapping to confidential information. In this paper, we consider a generalized model of conventional physical layer security, referred as hierarchical information accessibility (HIA). A main feature of the HIA model is that a network has a hierarchy in information access, wherein decoding feasibility is determined by each user’s priority. Under this HIA model, we formulate a sum secrecy rate maximization problem with regard to precoding vectors. This problem is challenging since multiple non-smooth functions are involved into the secrecy rate to fulfill the HIA conditions and also the problem is non-convex. To address the challenges, we approximate the minimum function by using the LogSumExp technique, thereafter obtain the first-order optimality condition. One key observation is that the derived condition is cast as a functional eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvalue is equivalent to the approximated objective function of the formulated problem. Accordingly, we show that finding a principal eigenvector is equivalent to finding a local optimal solution. To this end, we develop a novel method called generalized power iteration for HIA (GPI-HIA). Simulations demonstrate that the GPI-HIA significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the secrecy rate.}

	abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of defending against spoofing attacks without a secret key. We address the problem using the Physical-Layer-Authentication (PLA) because of its high security, low overhead, and high compatibility. However, many PLA schemes have the following limitations: quantization errors, local optimums, and performance loss due to the change in the communication environment. In this paper, two phase-noise-based PLA schemes are proposed to address the limitations of the prior schemes. We denote the first scheme as the Multiple Phase Noises PLA (MPP) scheme, which realizes the PLA by using multiple phase noise innovations. Note that since the MPP scheme avoids using any quantization algorithm, it outperforms the prior schemes on the authentication performance. We denote the second scheme as the Enhanced Multiple Phase Noises PLA (EMPP) scheme, which introduces an artificial random phase to the transmitted symbols at the transmitter to further improve the authentication performance. The theoretical analyses of the proposed schemes over fading channels are provided, where the closed-form expressions are derived. Theoretical comparisons between the proposed schemes and prior schemes are provided. The theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed schemes. In comparison with the prior schemes, the MPP scheme achieves 13% authentication-performance gain without demodulation-performance loss, while the EMPP scheme achieves 42% authentication-performance gain with merely 16% demodulation-performance loss.}

	abstract = {Proactive eavesdropping was used recently to efficiently intercept a suspicious wireless communication link, by jamming the suspicious destination node. However, While jamming helps weaken the suspicious link, it does not improve the eavesdropping channel from the source node to the legitimate eavesdropper. This work proposes to use intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to enhance proactive eavesdropping, by jointly affecting both the suspicious and eavesdropping channels, and is the first to employ the cooperative passive beamforming in the double-IRS aided monitoring system. By considering the cooperative two single-reflection links and especially the double-reflection link, we jointly design the passive phase shift matrices of double IRSs to optimize the eavesdropping capability. Due to the coupled variables caused by double-IRS cooperation and the intractable unit modulus constraints of IRS elements, the non-convex optimization problem is difficult to solve. We first divide the problem into two subproblems, and apply the idea of minimization majorization to make each subproblem convex. We obtain the solution of reflective coefficient matrix in closed form, and then propose an alternating algorithm with low complexity to obtain the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of cooperative passive beamforming design over the traditional single-IRS and jamming assisted eavesdropping schemes.}

This paper investigates optimum location-based RIS selection policies in RIS-aided wireless networks to maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio for product-scaling and sum-scaling path-loss models where the received power scales with the product and sum of the transmitter-to-RIS and RIS-to-receiver distances, respectively. These scaling laws cover the important cases of end-to-end path-loss models in RIS-aided wireless systems. The random locations of all available RISs are modeled as a Poisson point process. To quantify the network performance, the outage probabilities and average rates attained by the proposed RIS selection policies are evaluated by deriving the distance distribution of the chosen RIS node as per the selection policies for both product-scaling and sum-scaling path-loss models. We also propose a limited-feedback RIS selection framework to achieve distributed network operation. The outage probabilities and average rates obtained by the limited-feedback RIS selection policies are derived for both path-loss models as well. The numerical results show notable performance gains obtained by the proposed RIS selection policies.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provide an interface between the electromagnetic world of wireless propagation environments and the digital world of information science. Simple yet sufficiently accurate path loss models for RISs are an important basis for theoretical analysis and optimization of RIS-assisted wireless communication systems. In this paper, we refine our previously proposed free-space path loss model for RISs to make it simpler, more applicable, and easier to use. The impact of the antenna’s directivity of the transmitter, receiver, and the unit cells of the RIS on the path loss is explicitly formulated as an angle-dependent loss factor. The refined model gives more accurate estimates of the path loss of RISs comprised of unit cells with a deep sub-wavelength size. Based on the proposed model, the properties of a single unit cell are evaluated in terms of scattering performance, power consumption, and area, which allows us to unveil fundamental considerations for deploying RISs in high frequency bands. Two fabricated RISs operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band are utilized to carry out a measurement campaign. The measurement results are shown to be in good agreement with the proposed path loss model. In addition, the experimental results suggest an effective form to characterize the power radiation pattern of the unit cell for path loss modeling.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for millimeter wave (mmWave) networks. In this paper, we utilize tools from stochastic geometry to study the performance of a RIS-assisted mmWave cellular network. Specifically, the locations of the base stations (BSs) and the midpoints of the blockage are modeled as two independent Poisson point processes (PPPs), where the blockages are modeled by a Boolean model and a fraction of the blockages are coated with RISs. The particular characteristics of mmWave communications, i.e., directional beamforming and different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, are incorporated into our analysis. We derive analytical expressions for the success probability and the area spectral efficiency. The success probability under the special case where the blockage parameter is sufficiently small is also derived. Numerical results demonstrate that better coverage performance and higher energy efficiency can be achieved by a large-scale deployment of RISs. In addition, the tradeoff between the BS and RIS densities is investigated and the results show that the RISs can indeed enable the traditional networks to improve the success probability, especially for the cell-edge region, with limited power consumption.}

	abstract = {Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) is one of the essential services in 5G networks and beyond. The coexistence of URLLC alongside other services, namely, enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), calls for developing spectrally efficient multiplexing techniques. In this work, we study the problem of scheduling URLLC traffic in a downlink system in the presence of eMBB traffic. Based on the proposed superposition/puncturing scheme, a resource allocation problem is formulated with the objective to minimize the rate loss of the eMBB service and URLLC packet segmentation loss while satisfying the eMBB and URLLC quality of service (QoS) constraints. The resulting problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is generally very hard to solve in polynomial time. Hence, we reformulate the problem as a one-to-one pairing problem and we derive its feasibility region as well as the optimal solutions for the power and spectral resource allocation. Subsequently, we propose a low complexity algorithm to support the many-to-many pairing. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher URLLC packet admission rate and lower rate loss for eMBB. For instance, the URLLC packet admission rate, unlike baseline methods, is shown to be preserved under the proposed method even at higher URLLC load. It is shown that at least 30% more URLLC users can be served without degrading their QoS, while keeping the impact on eMBB rate minimal. Detailed numerical evaluation is presented to quantify the benefits of the proposed method.}

In this paper, a distributed RIS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) NOMA systems with discrete phase shifts are studied, where the channel directions from base station to paired users can be manipulated with the assistance of RISs by employing the concept of signal alignment. In order to ensure base station can flexibly serve some users with NOMA and others users with spatial division multiple access, a unified precoder and decoder are provide to cancel inter-cluster interference. Subsequently, the channel statistics over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels are derived for near and far users. In particular, considering the cascade channel gain may exists two different cases, Beaulieu series is further adopted to characterize their corresponding cumulative distribution function. In what follows, the outage probability and ergodic rate for three situations within one cluster are derived by utilizing the obtained channel statistics, respectively. Based on the derived results, we also analyze the diversity order and high signal-to-noise ratio slope to provide essential insights into the considered systems. Finally, simulation results are presented to reveal that: 1) selecting the setting of 3-bits resolution can realize a near-aligned performance for our proposed systems; 2) the cascade channel statistic caused by RIS can be evaluated with any number of RIS element and any channel gain via Beaulieu series.}

However, acquiring accurate channel state information in wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems with hybrid transceiver architectures is even challenging, especially in high-mobility scenarios with severe Doppler effects. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition-based method to estimate the time-varying and frequency-selective (TVFS) mmWave MIMO channels. Specifically, by exploiting the sparse scattering nature of TVFS channels, we model the frequency-domain received signal as a third-order tensor that admits a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition format. Then, we analyze the uniqueness condition of the proposed CP decomposition-based channel estimation problem and propose a novel estimator to acquire TVFS channel parameters including angle of departure/arrival (AoD/AoA), time delay, path gain, and the Doppler shift. To address the sophisticated coupling among unknown parameters, we further propose a joint AoD and Doppler shift estimation (JADE) algorithm that provides reliable initial and iteratively refined estimates. The derived analysis and simulation results verify that the proposed JADE algorithm achieves higher estimation accuracy and guarantees the superiority of the proposed TVFS channel estimator over existing schemes.}

For a secondary transmitter that is subject to the stochastic and general interference-outage constraint and the peak transmit power constraint, we present a novel joint antenna selection and power adaptation rule. It addresses the twin goals of improving the spectral efficiency and reducing the power consumed of an underlay secondary system with low hardware complexity and cost. We prove that the rule maximizes the energy-efficiency (EE) of the secondary system. Its form differs from all other rules considered in the literature. We then present an insightful geometrical characterization of the optimal power of the selected antenna in terms of the channel gains within the secondary system and between the secondary and primary systems. Our approach leads to several special cases, which are themselves novel, and novel analytical insights about the performance and structure of the optimal rule. We also present an iterative subgradient-based algorithm and a simpler non-iterative bound-based algorithm to compute the rule’s parameters. The rule achieves a markedly higher EE compared to conventional approaches, and serves as a new fundamental benchmark for antenna selection in underlay spectrum sharing.}

Different from traditional studies for NOMA-MEC networks, we aim at minimizing the total cost of CCHN while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) of secondary users (SUs). We adopt the mechanism of time division multiple access (TDMA) when several NOMA groups use the same spectrum, and consider both the waiting delay and transmission delay during data offloading with the optimization of transmission order of NOMA groups. We formulate the considered problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP). We show that the transmit power and the allocated computing resource for each SU can be derived when the transmission time and transmission order of the NOMA groups are given. Based on this, the considered problem can be decomposed into a transmission time and order optimization subproblem, a cellular resource block (CRB) selection subproblem and a cognitive radio (CR) router selection subproblem. To solve the transmission time and order optimization subproblem, we first simplify the delay constraint via theoretic analysis, and then propose a binary segmentation (B-Seg) algorithm and a transmission order adjustment (TOA) algorithm to find the optimal transmission time and transmission order of NOMA groups, respectively. To solve the CRB selection subproblem and the CR router selection subproblem, a bigger requirement first (BRF) algorithm and a game-based iteration (GBI) algorithm are respectively proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the system performance.}

	abstract = {To reduce the computational complexity and channel estimation overhead for multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, we consider a joint design of the hybrid precoders at the base station and the passive precoders at the IRSs to maximize the ergodic spectral efficiency by exploiting the twin-timescale channel state information (CSI). Specifically, the digital precoder is designed according to the instantaneous CSI of a reduced-dimensional assist channel matrix, while the IRS passive reflection coefficient matrices and the analog precoder are optimized using the statistical CSI of all links. However, such a design problem is challenging to solve due to the non-convexity and the twin timescale. This work proposes efficient algorithms to jointly design the precoders, where the update of the IRS reflection coefficient matrices is independent of the hybrid precoders and the design of the analog precoder is independent of the digital precoder. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and provide the application scenes of the fully-connected and subarray-connected architectures. The results also show that the ergodic spectral efficiency for the fully-connected architecture using the twin-timescale CSI can approach that using the existing CSI schemes with less channel estimation overhead and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Being a key technology for beyond fifth-generation wireless systems, joint communication and radar sensing (JCAS) utilizes the reflections of communication signals to detect foreign objects and deliver situational awareness. A cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is uniquely suited to form a mobile bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with its serving base station (BS) to sense over large areas with superb sensing resolutions at no additional requirement of spectrum. This paper designs this novel BS-UAV bistatic SAR platform, and optimizes the flight path of the UAV to minimize its propulsion energy and guarantee the required sensing resolutions on a series of interesting landmarks. A new trajectory planning algorithm is developed to convexify the propulsion energy and resolution requirements by using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent. Effective trajectories are obtained with a polynomial complexity. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed trajectory planning algorithm outperforms significantly its alternative that minimizes the flight distance of cellular-aided sensing missions in terms of energy efficiency and effective consumption fluctuation. The energy saving offered by the proposed algorithm can be as significant as 55%.}

	abstract = {Constructing efficient low-rate error-correcting codes with low-complexity encoding and decoding has become increasingly important for applications involving ultra-low-power devices such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To this end, schemes based on concatenating the state-of-the-art codes at moderate rates with repetition codes have emerged as practical solutions deployed in various standards. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for concatenating outer polar codes with inner repetition codes which we refer to as polar coded repetition. More specifically, we propose to transmit a slightly modified polar codeword by deviating from Arıkan’s standard 2 \\times 2\nKernel in a certain number of polarization recursions at each repetition block. We show how this modification can improve the asymptotic achievable rate of the standard polar-repetition scheme, while ensuring that the overall encoding and decoding complexity is kept almost the same. The achievable rate is analyzed for the binary erasure channel (BEC) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Moreover, we show that the finite-length performance of the polar coded repetition scheme under cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder over AWGN channel is better than the uncoded polar-repetition scheme at the cost of a slight increase in decoding complexity. We also compare the proposed scheme, in terms of performance and complexity, with other low-rate solution based on polar codes in the literature.}

	abstract = {The paper explores simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) communication. A base-station (BS) transmits information to the cell-edge users which are assisted by the STAR RIS in such a way that two users, one placed in front of and other behind the RIS, are served by reflection and transmission, respectively. The energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) configurations of the STAR RIS are considered for analysis. Owing to the close-placement of RIS elements and rectangular geometry of RIS, the Rician distributed RIS channels are assumed to be spatially-correlated. The new expression for the joint moment of spatially-correlated Rician channels is derived. Both, infinite and finite block-length transmissions are analyzed in this work. For infinite block-length transmission, the expressions for outage probability and channel capacity are derived, whereas for finite block-length transmission, the expressions for block error rate (BLER), system goodput and channel capacity are derived. To get further insights, the expression for asymptotic outage probability is also derived. Furthermore, the effects of various parameters, including RSMA power splitting factor, reflection coefficients, inter-element spacing, distances between STAR RIS and users, finite block-length parameters, imperfect channel state information (CSI), etc., are examined.}

	abstract = {The age of information (AoI) is a new metric to measure the timeliness of various status update systems, and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) transmission scheme is usually applied to ensure higher timeliness. However, little research considers encoding delay, propagation delay, decoding delay and feedback delay in the HARQ-based coded status update system. To the best of our knowledge, in this paper, the HARQ-based Spinal coded timely status update system with all the practical delay elements is considered for the first time. We derive the average AoI expression of the system and analyze the monotony of the AoI expression to give an average AoI upper bound. Then we optimize the HARQ transmission scheme to minimize the AoI. To decrease the complexity of the optimization algorithm, we separate it into two steps. First, we optimize the puncturing pattern of Spinal codes and propose a transmission scheme under incremental tail transmission puncturing (ITTP) pattern. Second, we optimize the number of symbols in each round under the ITTP transmission scheme, and propose the optimal transmission scheme under the coarse-grained ITTP pattern. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme can significantly decrease the AoI compared to the baseline transmission schemes.}

Specifically, the Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (THP) and the hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) of the base station are jointly optimized with the linear digital receivers of mobile users. The triangular feedback matrix of the THP is optimized and the optimal solution is derived in closed form based on a matrix inequality. Moreover, in order to tackle the nonconvexity of the constant-modulus constraints imposed on the analog TPC, the Majorization-Minimization (MM) based reconfigurable optimization framework is proposed, which strikes a trade-off between the implementation complexity and system performance in a reconfigurable manner. Explicitly, our MM-based reconfigurable optimization framework is capable of optimizing the analog TPC in a dynamically reconfigurable manner on an element-by-element, column-by-column, row-by-row or block-by-block basis. Moreover, an MM-based reconfigurable algorithm is proposed for the optimization of the phase shifting matrix at RIS, which also suffers from constant-modulus constraints. In the proposed MM-based reconfigurable algorithm, the RIS can be partitioned into a series of subarrays for striking different performance vs. complexity tradeoffs. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed nonlinear hybrid transceiver optimization techniques.}

A minimax optimization technique is developed to derive their coefficients resulting in uniform absolute or relative error. These approximations and bounds constitute a powerful tool for the statistical performance analysis as they enable the evaluation of the ergodic capacity of various communication systems that experience small-scale fading together with the lognormal shadowing effect and allow for simplifying the complicated integrals encountered when evaluating the ergodic capacity in different communication scenarios. Simple and tight closed-form solutions for the ergodic capacity of many classic and timely application examples are derived using the logarithmic approximations. The high accuracy of the proposed approximations is verified by numerical comparisons with existing approximations and with those obtained directly from numerical integration methods.}

	abstract = {The evolution of 5G and Beyond networks has enabled new applications with stringent end-to-end latency requirements, but providing reliable low-latency service with high throughput over public wireless networks is still a significant challenge. One of the possible ways to solve this is to exploit path diversity, encoding the information flow over multiple streams across parallel links. The challenge presented by this approach is the design of joint coding and scheduling algorithms that adapt to the state of links to take full advantage of path diversity. In this paper, we address this problem for a synchronous traffic source that generates data blocks at regular time intervals (e.g., a video with constant frame rate) and needs to deliver each block within a predetermined deadline. We first develop a closed-form performance analysis in the simple case of two parallel servers without any buffering and single-packet blocks, and propose a model for the general problem based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We apply policy iteration to obtain the coding and scheduling policy that maximizes the fraction of source blocks delivered within the deadline: our simulations show the drawbacks of different commonly applied heuristic solutions, drawing general design insights on the optimal policy.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed in wireless communications, and the performance can be enhanced with the assistance of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). However, the finite energy of UAVs greatly limits the endurance and becomes a bottleneck for IRS-UAV communications. In this paper, an integrated IRS-UAV communication scheme is proposed where the IRS is mounted on the UAV to connect the base station and the ground user. We present two schemes to maximize the spectrum efficiency (SE) and the energy efficiency (EE) of the system by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, passive beamforming and UAV trajectory. First, to tackle the SE maximization problem, we divide it into three subproblems to optimize the variables iteratively. For the active and passive beamforming, the closed-form solutions can be directly derived. The suboptimal trajectory design can be obtained by utilizing the successive convex approximation. Furthermore, considering the limited on- broad energy of UAV, a scheme to maximize the EE is proposed. The optimal active beamforming and the passive beamforming can be similarly obtained. For the non-convex fractional programming of trajectory optimization, it can be solved via the Dinkelbach’s method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective for the IRS-UAV networks to maximize the SE and EE, respectively.}

According to the policy, an arriving fresh packet preempts the possible packet of the same source in the system. Furthermore, we derive the MGFs of the AoI and peak AoI for the globally preemptive and non-preemptive policies, for which only the average AoI and peak AoI have been derived earlier. Finally, we use the MGFs to derive the average AoI and peak AoI in a two-source M/G/1/1 queueing model under each policy.

For satisfying the diversity requirements of different types of links, i.e., low delay for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connections and ultra-reliability for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connections, we formulate a joint power, spectrum and vehicle local computing ratio allocation problem to minimize the delay of V2I links whilst satisfying the V2V reliability constraint. For solving the formulated problem, a Feasible Region Transformation Method is firstly developed to convert the probabilistic V2V reliability requirement into a computable constraint. In addition, a Robust Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) Modified Method is proposed to give the computable expression for the V2I throughput. Then, a parallel Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework is designed for the resource allocation in V2X networks, where one is the transmit power control unit and the other is the local computing ratio allocation unit. After that, a Feedback-oriented Learning Method is proposed to train the parallel DNN-based resource allocation framework, in which the output of DNN is used as feedback to dynamically revise the training loss function along with the training process. Afterwards, the Hungarian method is employed to obtain the optimal spectrum matching. Finally, we conduct the simulations to show that the proposed learning-based algorithm has better performance compared with other general algorithms.}

	abstract = {Communication efficiency is of importance for wireless federated learning systems. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient strategy for federated learning over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channels (MACs). The proposed strategy comprises two components. When sending a locally computed gradient, each device compresses a high dimensional local gradient to multiple lower-dimensional gradient vectors using block sparsification. When receiving a superposition of the compressed local gradients via a MIMO-MAC, a parameter server (PS) performs a joint MIMO detection and the sparse local-gradient recovery. Inspired by the turbo decoding principle, our joint detection-and-recovery algorithm accurately recovers the high-dimensional local gradients by iteratively exchanging their beliefs for MIMO detection and sparse local gradient recovery outputs. We then analyze the reconstruction error of the proposed algorithm and its impact on the convergence rate of federated learning. From simulations, our gradient compression and joint detection-and-recovery methods diminish the communication cost significantly while achieving identical classification accuracy for the case without any compression.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for distributed machine learning that uses the data and the computational power of user devices while maintaining user privacy (e.g., position and motion track). It has been proved a promising way to help the learning-based millimeter wave (mmWave) system achieve efficient link configuration. However, FL systems have an inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks during training, and this has not received attention in current FL-based beam selection research. The goal of a backdoor attacker is to implant a backdoor in the model such that at test time, the model will mispredict a certain family of inputs, and corrupt the performance of the trained model on specific sub-tasks. We study backdoor attacks in an FL-based beam selection system based on a deep neural network that utilizes user location information. Specifically, we propose a backdoor attack scheme that can be configured in the real world. The attacker’s trigger is an obstacle placed in certain locations. When the model encounters an input with these obstacles, the backdoor will be triggered, and the model will output the beam specified by the attacker. Through experiments, we show that the proposed attack can achieve a high attack success rate in a system without a defense mechanism. Moreover, we show that the traditional norm-clipping defense method cannot effectively defend against our attack. Furthermore, we propose a new backdoor attack defense method and verify the effectiveness of this scheme through experiments. In addition, we propose a backdoor detection method: the federated noise titration method, which can diagnose whether the model has a backdoor.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel deep learning-aided scheme dubbed\nPRρ\n-net for improving the bit error rate (BER) of the Time Reversal (TR) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system with imperfect Channel State Information (CSI). The designed system employs Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) with explicit feedback in a scenario where the CSI is subject to estimation and quantization errors. Imperfect CSI causes a drastic increase in BER of the FDD-based TR-UWB MIMO system, and we tackle this problem by proposing a novel neural network-aided design for the conventional precoder at the transmitter and equalizer at the receiver. A closed-form expression for the initial estimation of the channel correlation is derived by utilizing transmitted data in time-varying channel conditions modeled as a Markov process. Subsequently, a neural network-aided design is proposed to improve the initial estimate of channel correlation. An adaptive pilot transmission strategy for a more efficient data transmission is proposed that uses channel correlation information. The theoretical analysis of the model under the Gaussian assumptions is presented, and the results agree with the Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulation results indicate high performance gains when the suggested neural networks are used to combat the effect of channel imperfections.}

	abstract = {Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based physical layer communication techniques have attracted considerable interest. Although their potential to enhance communication systems and superb performance have been validated by simulation experiments, little attention has been paid to the theoretical analysis. Specifically, most studies in the physical layer have tended to focus on the application of DNN models to wireless communication problems but not to theoretically understand how does a DNN work in a communication system. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively analyze why DNNs can achieve comparable performance in the physical layer comparing with traditional techniques, and also drive their cost in terms of computational complexity. To achieve this goal, we first analyze the encoding performance of a DNN-based transmitter and compare it to a traditional one. And then, we theoretically analyze the performance of DNN-based estimator and compare it with traditional estimators. Third, we investigate and validate how information is flown in a DNN-based communication system under the information theoretic concepts. Our analysis develops a concise way to open the “black box” of DNNs in physical layer communication, which can be applied to support the design of DNN-based intelligent communication techniques and help to provide explainable performance assessment.}

	abstract = {The heterogeneous characteristics of wireless mobile networks within the Internet of things (IoT) create authentication challenges due to the large number of devices with diverse requirements and capabilities. Physical layer authentication (PLA) can provide solutions for this heterogeneous environment using wireless channel attributes. In the paper, an adaptive lightweight physical layer authentication (ALPLA) scheme is proposed using machine learning (ML). Antenna diversity at the receiver is exploited to increase the number of features to achieve a high authentication rate (AR). A one-class classifier support vector machine (OCC-SVM) is used with the magnitude and real and imaginary parts of the received signal at each receive antenna as features. One-class classification is a ML technique for outlier and anomaly detection which uses only legitimate training data. The sounding reference signal (SRS) in the 5G uplink radio frame is employed to obtain the features. The proposed scheme is evaluated in an urban environment under different mobility conditions. Results are presented which show that this scheme provides a high AR with sufficient antenna diversity. Further it is superior to other approaches in the literature.}

	abstract = {As one of the key technologies in 5G networks, Carrier Aggregation (CA) is studied in this paper. In CA, Component Carriers (CCs) can be activated and deactivated depending on multiple factors, e.g., energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS) demand of users. We propose CC management strategies where each User Equipment (UE) minimizes its average delay and at the same time minimizes its power consumption while considering that CCs can be activated and deactivated only at certain times, as in real-world CA implementations. We first model the problem as a centralized multi-objective optimum CC management problem. Since centralized approaches would impose a large overhead on the system, we then develop a semi-distributed solution by modeling the problem as a stochastic game and propose a multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) based CC management algorithm to solve the stochastic game. We finally compare the proposed approaches with single CC activation and all-CC activation baseline schemes. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms outperform the all-CC algorithm in terms of UE power consumption and have the capability of transmitting a number of bits with delay close to the all-CC scheme. Meanwhile, our DDQN-based algorithm decreases the UE power consumption by about 20% with respect to the all-CC scheme.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a mobile edge computing (MEC) network where multiple cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offload their computation tasks to multiple ground base stations (GBSs). In practice, the UAVs are generally unable to master stochastic information of task arrival and channel changes in advance, which may cause a severe issue in terms of energy consumption. Therefore, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the average weighted sum energy consumption, by jointly optimizing UAV-GBS associations, communication and computation resource allocation, and three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories, during which a velocity-triggered penalty term (VTPT) is designed to suppress a large amount of the energy consumption of the UAVs. To handle the stochastic problem, we propose an online resource allocation and trajectory optimization algorithm with outer and inner structures. The outer structure transforms the original problem to a deterministic one by applying the Lyapunov-based optimization framework. The inner structure solves the obtained deterministic problem via the Lagrange duality method and the successive convex approximation technique, based on the block coordinate descent framework. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) VTPT dramatically decreases the UAVs’ energy consumption, and 2) the proposed algorithm not only reduces the energy consumption but also ensures the computation queue stability compared with other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Beamforming design is an important technique for enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, related research based on the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture is still limited. In this paper, we investigate the partially-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user ISAC systems. Instead of the commonly used beampattern related metric, the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is employed as the sensing performance metric for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. We aim to minimize the CRB while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for individual communication users by jointly optimizing the digital and analog beamformers. Subsequently, we propose an alternating optimization based framework, which is significantly different from the conventional methods based on the approximation of the optimal fully-digital beamformer with a hybrid one. We also consider an alternative formulation of optimizing the SINR of radar echo signals. Based on optimal receive beamformer design, we transform the SINR based joint transmitter and receiver optimization problem to a series of problems sharing a similar form with the CRB based transmitter optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed designs provide significant performance gains in DOA estimation over the existing beampattern approximation based design.}

	abstract = {In 5G vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, the scarcity of spectrum resources and the inefficiency of resource allocation make vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications that require stringent latency and high reliability still a challenge. Existing relevant literatures either focus on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, or consider scenarios where the vehicle roles (transmitter or receiver) are fixed in V2V communications, or study the resource allocation within a single cell. What’s more, considering the high-speed movement of vehicles across the coverage regions of multiple cells, the above resource allocation problem becomes even more challenging. Toward this end, we consider in this paper a multi-cell 5G V2X system where V2V links and V2I links coexist and the vehicle roles are not fixed, and propose a sparse code multiple access-based centralized resource allocation scheme, so as to address the above challenges. In view of the fact that our formulated maximizing packet reception ratio problem is a combinatorial optimization problem and is NP-hard, we design a three-stage heuristic yet joint alternating optimization approach to obtain a suboptimal solution. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed scheme in multiple perspectives.}

	abstract = {The fundamental intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment problem is studied for IRS-aided downlink multi-user communication system, where IRSs are arranged to be deployed in a specific area for enhancing the desired signal and suppressing interference. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all locations in a specific area by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the access point (AP) as well as the placement and reflective beamforming at the IRS. The formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved directly. To draw essential insights, we first consider the single-user case and the optimal solution is derived in closed-form. The result shows that the optimal locations are in the connecting line between the AP and user, and the IRSs can be optimally deployed along the connecting line. Besides, a hybrid offline and online design scheme is developed for the multi-user case, where an area discretization strategy and deep neural network (DNN)-based curve fitting technique are proposed for optimizing the IRS locations in the offline manner. Then, an online iterative algorithm is presented to solve the transmit and received beamformig vectors, respectively. Numerical results show that the performance gain is increased by optimizing the IRS locations.}

	abstract = {We consider time-frequency-packed systems in an additive white Gaussian noise scenario. With respect to systems employing time packing, thus introducing intentional intersymbol interference only, a further improvement of the spectral efficiency is obtained by packing the adjacent carriers closer in frequency. The adoption of a multiuser detector can allow coping with the resulting intentional intercarrier interference. The optimal detector for time-frequency-packed systems has a complexity that increases exponentially with the number of interferers in both time and frequency dimensions and thus becomes unmanageable. We propose a suboptimal receiver, which is derived by using the framework based on factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm, with a complexity that is linear in the number of adjacent carriers and takes also advantage of a multi-user channel shortener to further reduce the complexity. We assess the performance by means of computer simulations and show that, when compared with other suboptimal receivers available in the literature and with the optimal detector, the proposed receiver results very promising in terms of trade-off between performance and computational complexity.}

However, since ultra-reliability and low latency (URLLC) requirements are a key component of 5G advanced services, provisioning such services present stringent challenges for IAB multi-hop network design. To fulfill the URLLC requirements in the IAB network, we propose a cross-layer design on routing and resource allocation under the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5G standards. We first formulate a routing problem for the IAB multi-hop network, which minimizes the latency while satisfying the reliability requirement. Subsequently, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to solve the resource allocation and routing problem based on the local information of each agent (IAB node) in the environment. Afterward, we propose a novel entropy-based RL algorithm with federated learning (FL) mechanism to improve the overall performance as well as accelerate the convergence speed. Via the simulation, the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms from the latency and reliability perspective, respectively. Meanwhile, the convergence speed with the proposed algorithm also improves by using FL.}

In this work, we treat multihop connections over queuing networks with tributary flows and non-preemptive service: packets cannot be discarded because they are utilized for other system objectives, such as data analytics. Without preemption, the key tool for optimizing AoI is then the scheduling policy between the different data flows at each intermediate node. This is the subject of our analysis, along with the impact of packet erasure on the age. We derive upper and lower bounds for the average AoI considering several queuing policies in arbitrary network topologies, and present the results in different scenarios. Network topology, tributary traffic load, and link characteristics such as packet erasure generate complex trade-offs, which affect the optimal operation point and the age performance. The scheduling strategy at each node can also affect performance and fairness among users, particularly at critical bottleneck links, which have a significant impact on the overall performance of the whole network.}

	abstract = {Entanglement routing establishes remote entanglement connection between two arbitrary nodes, which is one of the most important functions in quantum networks. The existing routing mechanisms mainly improve the robustness and throughput facing the failure of entanglement generations, which, however, rarely include the considerations on the most important metric to evaluate the quality of connection, entanglement fidelity. To solve this problem, we propose purification-enabled entanglement routing designs to provide fidelity guarantee for multiple Source-Destination (S-D) pairs in quantum networks. In our proposal, we first consider the single S-D pair scenario and design an iterative routing algorithm, Q-PATH, to find the optimal purification decisions along the routing path with minimum entangled pair cost. Further, a low-complexity routing algorithm using an extended Dijkstra algorithm, Q-LEAP, is designed to reduce the computational complexity by using a simple but effective purification decision method. Finally, we consider the common scenario with multiple S-D pairs and design a greedy-based algorithm considering resource allocation and re-routing process for multiple routing requests. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms not only can provide fidelity-guaranteed routing solutions, but also has superior performance in terms of throughput, fidelity of end-to-end entanglement connection, and resource utilization ratio, compared with the existing routing scheme.}

The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) scheme is employed to overcome severe Doppler effect caused by high mobility. The closed-form expression is derived for the maximum secrecy rate of unicast transmission with high privacy. Furthermore, the positive secure capacity probability (PSCP) of unicast transmission is also obtained and analyzed. Our analytical results show that compared with high-mobility eavesdroppers, low-mobility eavesdroppers pose a greater threat to unicast secrecy. Moreover, when the outage probability of unicast is greater than 1/2, more time frequency (TF) resources should be allocated to unicast, in order to guarantee the security performance of unicast.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the performance of short packet communications in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We start our investigation by examining the fading wiretap channel, where the communication is overheard by multiple non-colluding single antenna eavesdroppers. A closed-form expression for the average secrecy throughput is derived, when the transmitter has a single antenna. The Monte-Carlo simulations show a close match of the analytical expression with the numerical results. Moreover, the optimal blocklength value that maximizes the secrecy throughput is determined, when the communication is observed by single and multiple eavesdroppers. We then extend our analysis for the case of a multiple-antenna transmitter and consider artificial noise (AN) to confuse the eavesdroppers. A closed-form expression for the average secrecy throughput is obtained for the scenario of a two-antenna transmitter and two eavesdroppers with a single antenna. The results demonstrate the validity of the approximation when compared with Monte-Carlo simulations. The results further reveal that an increased number of antennas at the transmitter is associated with higher average secrecy throughput and applying AN helps to eliminate the harm of the eavesdroppers.}

	abstract = {The promising physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme enjoys low computational complexity and provides a lightweight solution for the wireless transmission security problem. However, the ideal but impractical assumptions are made on the priori knowledge in the traditional PLA schemes, which fail because the priori knowledge can be interfered by the impersonation attacks. Hence, a blind PLA scheme featured by the composite radio sample characteristics, active monitoring slots, and blind hypotheses tests is proposed in this paper. In particular, the intrinsic location-specific channel response integrated with the transmitter-specific signal knowledge is sampled during the active monitoring slots and is used to conduct minimum error (ME) and Neyman-Pearson (NP) hypothesis tests. The authentication reliability is enhanced significantly by jointly using the ME and NP criteria. For both the stationary and the non-stationary signal cases, our theoretical analysis shows that the temporal channel variations, the spatial channel correlations and the spectral bandwidth contribute to improve the authentication reliability. Our simulation results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PLA scheme, but also indicate the possible scenarios in which ME outperforms NP, and NP outperforms ME.}

	abstract = {Owing to their intrinsic advantages of seamless coverage and of high data rate, space-air-ground communications networks (SAGCN) are recognized as one of the emerging technologies for the future wireless communications systems. However, the broadcasting nature of wireless communications inevitably imposes security issues on SAGCN. In this paper, we consider the uplink of the full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided three-layer SAGCN, comprising of ground Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) terminals, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite, where eavesdroppers are intercepting the information transmitted. In order to ensure a secure uplink transmission, a joint UAV deployment and power allocation scheme is conceived for maximizing the secrecy rate of the SAGCN, subject to the following constraints: i) UAV’s power, ii) the UAV deployment area, and iii) the secrecy rate, which are imposed on the different layers. More explicitly, once we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the secrecy rate, we decouple the variables and decompose the original problem into multiple subproblems in a tractable manner. Then, we simplify the subproblems with the aid of slack variables and solve them relying on the successive convex approximation method. Following this, initialization schemes are designed to exploit the one-direction greedy method for diverse environment settings, for speeding up the convergence of the iterative algorithm proposed. Finally, simulation results reveal that the convergence can be achieved within a small number of iterations by the proposed initialization scheme, while the algorithm conceived is capable of attaining a substantial improvement of the secrecy rate for the SAGCN.}

	abstract = {Sinusoidal frequency estimation in the presence of white Gaussian noise plays a major role in many engineering fields. Significant research in this area has been devoted to the fine tuning stage, where the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of the observation data are interpolated to acquire the residual frequency error\nε\n. Iterative interpolation schemes have recently been designed by employing two\nq\n-shifted spectral lines symmetrically placed around the DFT peak, and the impact of\nq\non the estimation accuracy has been theoretically assessed. Such analysis, however, is available only for some specific algorithms and is mostly conducted under the assumption of a vanishingly small frequency error, which makes it inappropriate for the first stage of any iterative process. In this work, further investigation on DFT interpolation is carried out to examine some issues that are still open. We start by evaluating the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for frequency recovery by interpolation of two\nq\n-shifted spectral lines and assess its dependence on\nε\nand\nq\n. Such a bound is of primary importance to check whether existing schemes can provide efficient estimates at any iteration or not. After determining the optimum value of\nq\nfor a given\nε\n, we eventually derive the maximum likelihood (ML) DFT interpolator. Since the latter exhibits the best performance at any step of the iteration process, it might attain the desired accuracy just at the end of the first iteration, which is especially advantageous in terms of computational load and processing time.}

	abstract = {For high mobility communication scenario, the recently emerged orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation introduces a new delay-Doppler domain signal space, and can provide better communication performance than traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. This article focuses on the joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD) for hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) aided millimeter wave (mmWave) OTFS systems. Firstly, a new transmission structure is designed. Within the pilot durations of the designed structure, partial HRIS elements are alternatively activated. The time domain channel model is then exhibited. Secondly, the received signal model for both the HRIS over time domain and the base station over delay-Doppler domain are studied. Thirdly, by utilizing channel parameters acquired at the HRIS, an HRIS beamforming design strategy is proposed. For the OTFS transmission, we propose a JCEDD scheme over delay-Doppler domain. In this scheme, message passing (MP) algorithm is designed to simultaneously obtain the equivalent channel gain and the data symbols. On the other hand, the channel parameters, i.e., the Doppler shift, the channel sparsity, and the channel variance, are updated through expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By iteratively executing the MP and EM algorithm, both the channel and the unknown data symbols can be accurately acquired. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed JCEDD scheme.}

This work exploits principles commonly found in the ultra-low-power, backscatter communication literature, offering multi-element array functionalities to a single-antenna receiver. A small number of simple, switching backscattering tags deployed in space, emulate a distributed, multi-element antenna array by copying a transmitter’s signal to distinct frequency bands. A receiver can then obtain independent observations of the same signal by discriminating said bands. Using the backscatter tag-based array, the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation problem is addressed without the cost of multiple RF front ends or hardware modifications, at either end of a wireless communication link. The feasibility of the idea was examined through both simulations and experimental deployments. An absolute error of\n≈20\ndegrees was observed when utilizing 5 custom-built backscattering tags, while simulations showed that more than 10 tags can offer error of less than 5 degrees.}

In the context of an asymmetric game, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access ALOHA system based on multi-agent reinforcement learning tools that can help each user to find its best strategies of improving the rates of successful action choices. While taking into account not only collisions, but also fading, we analyze the mean rewards of actions under general settings and focus on the case that involves two different groups of users. To characterize the behaviors of accessing strategies, we apply multi-agent action value methods that consider either greedy or non-greedy actions, combined with an acceleration gradient descent. Our results show that in the proposed system, users employing the greedy action-based methods can be randomly divided into two groups of users and increase the rates of successful action choices. Interestingly, in relatively limited channels, such greedy methods turn many of users to be with a state of barring-access. In this case, the proposed acceleration, non-greedy action methods are shown to reduce such unfairness, at a loss of successful action rates.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising candidate for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, as the RIS technology provides a new solution to control the propagation channel in order to improve the efficiency of a wireless link through enhancing the received signal power. In this paper, we propose RIS-assisted receive quadrature space shift keying (RIS-RQSSK), which enhances the spectral efficiency of an RIS-based index modulation (IM) system by using the real and imaginary dimensions independently for the purpose of IM. Therefore, the error rate performance of the system is improved as all RIS elements reflect the incident transmit signal toward both selected receive antennas. At the receiver, a low-complexity but effective greedy detector (GD) can be employed which determines the maximum energy per dimension at the receive antennas. A max-min optimization problem is defined to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) components at both selected receive antennas; an analytical solution is provided based on Lagrange duality. In particular, the multi-variable optimization problem is shown to reduce to the solution of a single-variable equation, which results in a very simple design procedure. In addition, we investigate the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed RIS-RQSSK system and derive a closed-form approximate upper bound on the ABEP. We also provide extensive numerical simulations to validate our derivations. Numerical results show that the proposed RIS-RQSSK scheme substantially outperforms recent prominent benchmark schemes. This enhancement considerably increases with an increasing number of receive antennas.}

	abstract = {This work proposes a framework to design a cost-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based energy-neutral (EN) system deployed to harvest data from a set of internet-of-things (IoT) nodes. The energy-neutrality refers to the zero-sum balance between energy harvested, stored, and consumed during operation, which is a game-changer when a connection to the electricity grid is not available/feasible. This involves employing an off-grid charging station (CS) comprising of photovoltaic (PV) panels and batteries that provide enough energy to recharge the UAV-based aerial access points (AAPs). The investment cost is determined by the number of AAPs, PV panels, and ground battery units. Its minimization cannot be achieved using conventional optimization tools due to the non-tractable form of the CS load. Therefore, a novel wave-based method is proposed to represent the load profile as a proportional function of the required number of AAPs, so as to directly relate the CS design to the trajectory optimization. Compared to baseline scenarios, the proposed trajectory design can halve the time and energy consumption; the investment cost varies with the time and season of service; the off-grid CS is particularly advantageous in rural areas, while in urban areas its cost is comparable to that of a grid-connected alternative.}

	abstract = {Modern millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems rely on beam alignment to deliver sufficient beamforming gain to close the link between devices. We present a novel beam selection methodology for multi-panel, full-duplex mmWave systems, which we call Steer, that delivers high beamforming gain while significantly reducing the full-duplex self-interference coupled between the transmit and receive beams. Steer does not necessitate changes to conventional beam alignment methodologies nor additional over-the-air feedback, making it compatible with existing cellular standards. Instead, Steer uses conventional beam alignment to identify the general directions beams should be steered, and then it makes use of a minimal number of self-interference measurements to jointly select transmit and receive beams that deliver high gain in these directions while coupling low self-interference. We implement Steer on an industry-grade 28 GHz phased array platform and use further simulation to show that full-duplex operation with beams selected by Steer can notably outperform both half-duplex and full-duplex operation with beams chosen via conventional beam selection. For instance, Steer can reliably reduce self-interference by more than 20 dB and improve SINR by more than 10 dB, compared to conventional beam selection. Our experimental results highlight that beam alignment can be used not only to deliver high beamforming gain in full-duplex mmWave systems but also to mitigate self-interference to levels near or below the noise floor, rendering additional self-interference cancellation unnecessary with Steer.}

	abstract = {High-throughput satellite communication systems are growing in strategic importance thanks to their role in delivering broadband services to mobile platforms and residences and/or businesses in rural and remote regions globally. Although precoding has emerged as a prominent technique to meet ever-increasing user demands, there is a lack of studies dealing with congestion control. This paper enhances the performance of multi-beam high throughput geostationary satellite systems under congestion, where the users’ quality of service (QoS) demands cannot be fully satisfied with limited resources. In particular, we propose congestion control strategies, relying on simple power control schemes. We formulate a multi-objective optimization framework balancing the system sum-rate and the number of users satisfying their QoS requirements. Next, we propose two novel approaches that effectively handle the proposed multi-objective optimization problem. The former is a model-based approach that relies on the weighted sum method to enrich the number of satisfied users by solving a series of the sum-rate optimization problems in an iterative manner. The latter is a data-driven approach that offers a low-cost solution by utilizing supervised learning and exploiting the optimization structures as continuous mappings. The proposed general framework is evaluated for different linear precoding techniques, for which the low computational complexity algorithms are designed. Numerical results manifest that our proposed framework effectively handles the congestion issue and brings superior improvements of rate satisfaction to many users than previous works. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms show low run-time and make them realistic for practical systems.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the two-hop active relaying for dynamic magnetic induction based underwater wireless sensor networks (MI-UWSNs). Specifically, we firstly propose the two-hop active relaying schemes with unidirectional (UD) and tri-directional (TD) active relays, respectively, by considering the angular misalignment in practical underwater MI environments. Then, the statistical properties of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the proposed two-hop UD and TD active relaying schemes are rigorously analyzed and the corresponding closed-form expressions of the probability density functions are derived according to the distribution of the angular misalignment. Based on the statistical SNRs, we develop the analytical expressions of the ergodic achievable rate and the average bit-to-error rate for the two-hop UD and TD active relaying schemes employing the amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward strategies. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our theoretical analyses and demonstrate that the proposed two-hop TD active relaying scheme performs the best among all comparative schemes.}

	abstract = {In multi-access edge computing (MEC), most existing task software caching works focus on statically caching data at the network edge, which may hardly preserve high reusability due to the time-varying user requests in practice. To this end, this work considers dynamic task software caching at the MEC server to assist users’ task execution. Specifically, we formulate a joint task software caching update (TSCU) and computation offloading (COMO) problem to minimize users’ energy consumption while guaranteeing delay constraints, where the limited cache size and computation capability of the MEC server, as well as the time-varying task demand of users are investigated. This problem is proved to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard, so we transform it into two sub-problems according to their temporal correlations, i.e., the real-time COMO problem and the Markov decision process-based TSCU problem. We first model the COMO problem as a multi-user game and propose a decentralized algorithm to address its Nash equilibrium solution. We then propose a double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based method to solve the TSCU policy. To reduce the computation complexity and convergence time, we provide a new design for the deep neural network (DNN) in DDQN, named state coding and action aggregation (SCAA). In SCAA-DNN, we introduce a dropout mechanism in the input layer to code users’ activity states. Additionally, at the output layer, we devise a two-layer architecture to dynamically aggregate caching actions, which is able to solve the huge state-action space problem. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms existing schemes, saving over 12% energy, and converges with fewer training episodes.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications recently appeared as a game-changing technology for next-generation wireless communications due to its unprecedented ability to reform the propagation environment. One of the main aspects of using RISs is the exploitation of the so-called passive beamforming (PB), which is carried out by adjusting the reflection coefficients (mainly the phase shifts) of the individual RIS elements. However, practically, this individual phase shift adjustment is associated with many issues in hardware implementation, limiting the RIS achievable gain. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, phase shift-free and novel PB scheme by only optimizing the on/off states of the RIS elements while fixing their phase shifts. The proposed PB scheme is shown to achieve the same scaling law (quadratic growth with the RIS size) for the signal-to-noise ratio as in the classical phase shift-based PB scheme, yet, with far less sensitivity to spatial correlation and phase errors. We provide a unified mathematical analysis that characterizes the performance of the proposed PB scheme and obtain the outage probability for the considered RIS-assisted system. Based on the provided computer simulations, the proposed PB scheme is shown to have a clear superiority over the classical one under different performance metrics.}

	abstract = {Designing solar-enabled and power grid connected, ‘dual-powered’, cellular networks is challenging due to the double stochasticity arising from energy harvest and user traffic, resulting in spatio-temporally varying traffic-energy imbalances. Improper strategy to optimize the power grid connectivity results in generation of significant carbon footprint. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to mathematically capture the traffic-energy imbalances in such a dual-powered network and propose to improve the temporal network energy utilization by exploiting these imbalances through a cooperative energy sharing mechanism among the base stations (BSs), via the grid infrastructure itself. The cooperative communication system is designed and optimized independently from two perspectives, namely, grid energy procurement and carbon emission minimization (in carbon free ‘energy producer’ mode) and operator revenue maximization (in ‘energy prosumer’ mode). The energy producer mode involves the BSs, without the flexibility to procure energy and acting as distributed energy source to the power grid. The energy prosumer mode provides additional flexibility of grid energy procurement to the BSs in addition to energy sharing and selling. For a given capital expenditure (CAPEX), both the optimization problems are reformulated into convex quadratic problems and closed form expressions for the optimal quanta of energies to be shared/procured through/from the grid are obtained. The optimal CAPEX for the proposed modes of network operation are obtained via linear revenue maximization problem formulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative energy framework significantly improves the temporal network energy utilization, thereby reducing the grid energy procurement and providing significant revenue gains compared to the state-of-art.}

	abstract = {Flying base stations (FlyBSs) can serve space-time varying heterogeneous traffic in the areas, where a deployment of conventional static base stations is uneconomical or unfeasible. We focus on energy consumption of the FlyBSs serving moving users. For such scenario, rotary-wing FlyBSs are not efficient due to a high energy consumption while hovering at a fixed location. Hence, we consider airship-based FlyBSs. For these, we derive an analytical relation between the sum capacity of the users and the energy spent for flying. We show theoretical bounds of potential energy saving with respect to a relative sum capacity guarantee to the users for single FlyBS. Then, we generalize the problem towards multiple FlyBSs and we propose an algorithm minimizing the energy consumption of the FlyBSs serving moving users under a constraint on the minimum relative sum capacity guarantee. The proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumed by the airship-based FlyBSs for flying by dozens of percent at a cost of only a marginal and controlled degradation in the sum capacity. For example, if the degradation in the sum capacity up to 1% is allowed, 55.4%, 67.5%, and 90.7% of the energy is saved if five, three, and one FlyBSs are deployed, respectively.}

	abstract = {The convergence of radar sensing and communication applications in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) and low terahertz (THz) bands has been envisioned as a promising technology, since it incorporates high-rate data transmission of hundreds of gigabits per second (Gbps) and mm-level radar sensing in a spectrum- and cost-efficient manner, by sharing both the frequency and hardware resources. However, the joint radar sensing and communication (JRC) system faces considerable challenges in the mmWave and low-THz scale, due to the peculiarities of the propagation channel and radio-frequency (RF) front ends. To this end, the waveform design for the JRC systems in mmWave and low-THz bands with ultra-broad bandwidth is investigated in this paper. Firstly, by considering the JRC design based on the co- existence concept, where both functions operate in a time-domain duplex (TDD) manner, a novel multi-subband quasi-perfect (MS-QP) sequence, composed of multiple perfect subsequences on different subbands, is proposed for target sensing, which achieves accurate target ranging and velocity estimation, whilst only requiring cost-efficient low-rate analog-to-digital converters (A/Ds) for sequence detection. Furthermore, the root index of each perfect subsequence is designed to eliminate the influence of strong Doppler shift on radar sensing. Finally, a data-embedded MS-QP (DE-MS-QP) waveform is constructed through time-domain extension of the MS-QP sequence, generating null frequency points on each subband for data transmission. Unlike the co- existence-based JRC system in TDD manner, the proposed DE-MS-QP waveform enables simultaneous interference-free sensing and communication, whilst inheriting all the merits from MS-QP sequences. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed waveforms regarding the communication and sensing performances, hardware cost as well as flexibility of the resource allocation between the dual functions.}

	abstract = {Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can function as aerial base stations to provide flexible and reliable communication services for massive ground devices (GDs). It is quite a challenging task to analyze such multi-UAV networks when considering practical mutually exclusive relationships among UAVs. Based on the tools of stochastic geometry, we in this paper develop a theoretical framework for modeling and analyzing aerial networks with UAVs following Matérn hard-core point process (MHCPP). As the tractable probability generating functional (PGFL) of repulsive point processes is unavailable, we employ an approximate approach based on the Poisson point process to analyze the cumulative interference and the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of a typical GD. By considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and none-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications, we obtain the approximation expressions of the network coverage probability and average rate. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed framework.}

In the proposed mixed-bouncing based model, the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission, single-bouncing transmission, and multi-bouncing transmission are simultaneously modeled. A new parameter, i.e., cluster density index, is defined and developed. The influence of communication scenarios, frequency, UAV’s height, and distance between transceivers on cluster density index is also analyzed. To capture the S-T-F non-stationarity, a mixed-bouncing based S-T-F non-stationary algorithm is developed based on the birth-death (BD) process and frequency-dependent factor for the first time. In the developed algorithm, the non-stationarity is captured from the perspectives of both single-clusters and twin-clusters. Meanwhile, the impact of UAV-related parameters, such as the UAV’s height and 3D moving velocity, on the non-stationary modeling is considered. Based on the simulation results, the impact of cluster density index on the important channel statistical properties, such as S-T-F correlation function (STF-CF) and Doppler power spectral density (PSD), is explored. Finally, the simulation results match well with the measurement and ray-tracing (RT)-based results, validating the accuracy of the proposed model.}

The proposed model takes into account the non-linear behavior of SPA in the initial iterations using a quadratic approximation, and dynamically adjusts the operating point of the model in accordance to the statistical properties of TS messages. This is in contrast to the existing linear state-space models which linearly approximate the non-linear behavior of SPA at around the operating point of zero in all iterations. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the higher accuracy of the proposed model in estimating the error floor of LDPC codes compared to the linear state-space model. We also make connections to the semi-analytical code-dependent technique proposed by Richardson for the error floor estimation of LDPC codes, and demonstrate that the proposed state-space model not only is a fully-analytical code-independent counterpart to that method, but also has less complexity and, in some cases, more accuracy.}

	abstract = {Coded caching is an emerging technique to reduce the data transmission load during the peak-traffic times. In such a scheme, each file in the data center or library is divided into a number of packets to pursue a low broadcasting rate based on the designed placements at each user’s cache. However, the implementation complexity of this scheme increases with the number of packets. It is crucial to design a scheme with a small subpacketization level, while maintaining a relatively low transmission rate. Recently, a combinatorial structure called placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as an effective tool to design coded caching schemes with a relatively low subpacketization level. This paper proposes a novel PDA construction by selecting proper orthogonal arrays (POAs), which generalizes the existing construction but with a more flexible memory size. Based on the proposed PDA construction, an effective transform is further proposed to enable a coded caching scheme to achieve a smaller subpacketization level. Moreover, two new coded caching schemes with the coded placement are derived. It is shown that the proposed schemes can yield a lower subpacketization level or transmission rate over the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new linear-equation ordered-statistics decoding (LE-OSD). Unlike the OSD, LE-OSD uses high reliable parity bits rather than information bits to recover codeword estimates, which is equivalent to solving a system of linear equations (SLE). Only test error patterns (TEPs) that create feasible SLEs, referred to as the valid TEPs, are used to obtain codeword estimates. We introduce several constraints on the Hamming weight of TEPs to limit the overall decoding complexity. Furthermore, we analyze the block error rate (BLER) and the computational complexity of the proposed approach. It is shown that LE-OSD has a similar performance to OSD in terms of BLER, which can asymptotically approach Maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with proper parameter selections. Simulation results demonstrate that the LE-OSD has a significantly reduced complexity compared to OSD, especially for low-rate codes, that usually require high decoding order in OSD. Nevertheless, the complexity reduction can also be observed for high-rate codes. In addition, we further improve LE-OSD by applying the decoding stopping condition and the TEP discarding condition. As shown by simulations, the improved LE-OSD has a considerably reduced complexity while maintaining the BLER performance, compared to the latest OSD approaches from literature.}

	abstract = {This article introduces a novel communication paradigm for the unsourced, uncoordinated Gaussian multiple access problem. The major components of the envisioned framework are as follows. The encoded bits of every message are partitioned into two groups. The first portion is transmitted using a compressive sensing scheme, whereas the second set of bits is conveyed using a multi-user coding scheme. The compressive sensing portion is key in sidestepping some of the challenges posed by the unsourced aspect of the problem. The information afforded by the compressive sensing is employed to create a sparse random multi-access graph conducive to joint decoding. This construction leverages the lessons learned from traditional IDMA into creating low-complexity schemes for the unsourced setting, while also accounting for inherent randomness. Under joint message-passing decoding, the proposed scheme offers good performance at a low computational complexity.

	abstract = {A novel recursive list decoding (RLD) algorithm for Reed-Muller (RM) codes based on successive permutations (SP) of the codeword is presented. A low-complexity SP scheme applied to a subset of the symmetry group of RM codes is first proposed to carefully select a good codeword permutation on the fly. Then, the proposed SP technique is integrated into an improved RLD algorithm that initializes different decoding paths with random codeword permutations, which are sampled from the full symmetry group of RM codes. Finally, efficient latency and complexity reduction schemes are introduced that virtually preserve the error-correction performance of the proposed decoder. Simulation results demonstrate that at the target frame error rate of 10−3 for the RM code of length 256 with 163 information bits, the proposed decoder reduces 6% of the computational complexity and 22% of the decoding latency of the state-of-the-art semi-parallel simplified successive-cancellation decoder with fast Hadamard transform (SSC-FHT) that uses 96 permutations from the full symmetry group of RM codes, while relatively maintaining the error-correction performance and memory consumption of the semi-parallel permuted SSC-FHT decoder.}

	abstract = {The problem of computing the Hamming weight distribution of linear codes is considered in this paper. A novel method to enumerate all codewords up to a certain Hamming weight for binary linear block codes in general and in particular for the punctured, shortened, precoded polar codes is introduced. The proposed approach performs a recursive decomposition of the codes using construction X4 that is typically used to combine codes of different lengths. This allows to enumerate the low-weight codewords of the overall code as combinations of the low-weight codewords of the component codes. Numerical results show that the proposed approach can efficiently compute the exact partial weight distribution of the 5G New Radio punctured/shortened polar codes with CRC11 and pure polar codes. In the former and latter cases, the low-weight codeword number is up to 106 and 108, respectively. Besides, randomly punctured and shortened polar codes and randomly precoded polar codes are also considered. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first method able to solve these problems.}

	abstract = {The successive cancellation (SC) process in which symbols are decoded sequentially by processing some intermediate information is an essential component of various decoding algorithms used for polar codes and their variants. In some decoding schemes, we may need to redo this process from some specific symbol or from the first symbol. This operation is called rewinding. Rewinding the SC process seems trivial if we have access to all intermediate log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) and partial sums. However, as the block length increases, retaining all of the intermediate information becomes inefficient and impractical. Rewinding the SC process in a memory-efficient way is a problem that we address in this paper. As we store a fraction of all the intermediate information in the memory-efficient scheme, we may not be able to rewind the SC process to the target symbol index. The reason is that some of the stored intermediate information needed to decode the target symbol may have been overwritten. To recompute the lost information, we may need to rewind the process further. Before proposing the formal scheme for the rewinding process, we explore the known properties of the SC process based on the binary representation of the bit indices. Then, we introduce a new operator used for grouping the bit indices. This special grouping helps us in finding the closest bit index to the target index for rewinding. We also analytically prove that this approach gives access to the untouched intermediate information stored in the memory which is essential in resuming the SC process. Finally, we adapt the proposed approach to multiple rewinds and apply it to SC-flip decoding and shifted-pruning-based list decoding. The numerical evaluation of the proposed solution shows a significant reduction of ≥50% in the complexity of the additional decoding attempts at medium and high SNR regimes for SC-flip decoding and less for shifted-pruning based list decoding.}

	abstract = {An online shaping technique for high performance communication over Gaussian channels with Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and receiver Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) noise is presented. The technique uses online transmitter precoding over Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) constellation, designed to shape the symbols distribution so that peak power constraint at the channel output is satisfied. An iterative decoder shares information between a modified M-BCJR module, which computes online the trellis transition probabilities of the shaped distribution, and turbo decoder. The result is a reduction in the required Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB) of the receiver ADC. We show that the transmitter precoding performs channel equalization without using any filter. At the limit of very high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) a complete channel inversion is possible so that the receiver signal spectrum becomes almost flat. Theoretical bounds are analytically derived which enable to assess the possible gain using the proposed method. For data rates of 200 Gbps and 400 Gbps over printed circuit board, simulations show that the shaping scheme enables reduction in the ENOB requirement as high as 1.43 bit and 1.78 bit, respectively, compared to uniform 4-PAM transmission with turbo equalization at the receiver side.}

In these systems, one usually needs to split the data set into disjoint files and design several output functions to complete a computational task. Li et al. provided some CDC schemes achieving optimal communication load. However, as the number of computing nodes increases, the numbers of input files and output functions of such schemes grow too fast to be applied in practice. In this paper, several infinite families of cascaded CDC schemes, where each output function is computed multiple times, are constructed by taking advantage of symmetric designs. Most importantly, the numbers of input files and output functions of each new scheme are linear with the number of computing nodes and the communication load of each new scheme approximates to that of the CDC scheme derived by Li et al. when the number of nodes becomes large.}

	abstract = {In conventional molecular communication (MC) systems, the signaling molecules used for information transmission are stored, released, and then replenished by a transmitter (TX). However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX is challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications, e.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC system, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we propose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside the channel and utilizes signaling molecules already present inside the system. The signaling molecules can assume different states which can be switched by external stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, the TX modulates information into the state of the signaling molecules. In particular, we exploit the group of photochromic molecules, which undergo light-induced reversible state transitions, for media modulation. We study the usage of these molecules for information transmission in a three-dimensional duct system, which contains an eraser, a TX, and a receiver for erasing, writing, and reading of information via external light, respectively. We develop a statistical model for the received signal which accounts for the distribution of the signaling molecules in the system, the initial states of the signaling molecules, the reliability of the state control mechanism, the randomness of irrepressible, spontaneous state switching, and the randomness of molecule propagation. We adopt a maximum likelihood detector and show that it can be reduced to a threshold based detector. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal threshold value and the resulting bit error rate (BER), respectively. Both the statistical model and BER results are verified by computer simulations. Our results reveal that media modulation enables reliable information transmission, validating it as a promising alternative to MC based on molecule emitting TXs.}

	abstract = {The use of 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is seen as a promising approach to significantly reduce the power consumption and hardware cost of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers. However, the nonlinear distortion due to 1-bit quantization fundamentally changes the optimal communication strategy and also imposes a capacity penalty to the system. In this paper, the capacity of a Gaussian MIMO channel in which the antenna outputs are processed by an analog linear combiner and then quantized by a set of zero threshold ADCs is studied. A new capacity upper bound for the zero threshold case is established that is tighter than the bounds available in the literature. In addition, we propose an achievability scheme which configures the analog combiner to create parallel Gaussian channels with phase quantization at the output. Under this class of analog combiners, an algorithm is presented that identifies the analog combiner and input distribution that maximize the achievable rate. Numerical results are provided showing that the rate of the achievability scheme is tight in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, a new 1-bit MIMO receiver architecture which employs analog temporal and spatial processing is proposed. The proposed receiver attains the capacity in the high SNR regime.}

	abstract = {In optical fiber communication, due to the random variation of the environment, the state of polarization (SOP) fluctuates randomly with time leading to distortion and performance degradation. The memory-less SOP fluctuations can be regarded as a two-by-two random unitary matrix. In this paper, for what we believe to be the first time, the capacity of the polarization drift channel under an average power constraint with imperfect channel knowledge is characterized. An achievable information rate (AIR) is derived when imperfect channel knowledge is available and is shown to be highly dependent on the channel estimation technique. It is also shown that a tighter lower bound can be achieved when a unitary estimation of the channel is available. However, the conventional estimation algorithms do not guarantee a unitary channel estimation. Therefore, by considering the unitary constraint of the channel, a data-aided channel estimator based on the Kabsch algorithm is proposed, and its performance is numerically evaluated in terms of AIR. Monte Carlo simulations show that Kabsch outperforms the least-square error algorithm. In particular, with complex, Gaussian inputs and eight pilot symbols per block, Kabsch improves the AIR by 0.20 to 0.30 bits/symbol throughout the range of studied signal-to-noise ratios.}

	abstract = {Symbol detection (SD) plays an important role in a digital communication system. However, most SD algorithms require channel state information (CSI), which is often difficult to estimate accurately. As a consequence, it is challenging for these SD algorithms to approach the performance of the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) algorithm. To address this issue, we employ both semi-supervised learning and ensemble learning to design a flexible parallelizable approach in this paper. First, we prove theoretically that the proposed algorithms can arbitrarily approach the performance of the MLD algorithm with perfect CSI. Second, to enable parallel implementation and also enhance design flexibility, we further propose a parallelizable approach for multi-output systems. Finally, comprehensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the designed algorithms. In particular, the proposed algorithms approach the performance of the MLD algorithm with perfect CSI, and outperform it when the CSI is imperfect. Interestingly, a detector constructed with received signals from only two receiving antennas (less than the size of the whole receiving antenna array) can also provide good detection performance.}

This paper studies an end-to-end design of downlink MU-MIMO systems which include pilot sequences, limited feedback, and precoding. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) framework which jointly optimizes the feedback information generation at users and the precoder design at a base station (BS). Each procedure in the MU-MIMO systems is replaced by intelligently designed multiple deep neural networks (DNN) units. At the BS, a neural network generates pilot sequences and helps the users obtain accurate channel state information. At each user, the channel feedback operation is carried out in a distributed manner by an individual user DNN. Then, another BS DNN collects feedback information from the users and determines the MIMO precoding matrices. A joint training algorithm is proposed to optimize all DNN units in an end-to-end manner. In addition, a training strategy which can avoid retraining for different network sizes for a scalable design is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DL framework compared to classical optimization techniques and other conventional DNN schemes.}

	abstract = {With the full development of intelligent mobile communications, wireless mixed reality (MR) provides a more visually immersive experience and stronger interaction with environments than virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). However, the asymmetric characteristic of wireless MR traffic creates a huge challenge to current mobile networks. Dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) is considered as a promising technology to improve wireless MR users’ quality of experience (QoE) due to its potentials and advantages in delivering asymmetric traffic. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a QoE-driven distributed multidimensional resource allocation (MRA) supplemented by inter-cell interference (ICI) mitigation scheme for wireless MR in multi-cell D-TDD systems. First, to improve QoE of MR users, we formulate the joint optimization of subframe configuration, channel assignment and computation offloading as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A novel fully-decentralized multi-agent deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Then, to mitigate ICI, a water filling based power control algorithm is investigated to minimize the total power of each small base station and its associated MR users. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme improves QoE of MR users in a realizable way as compared to existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Cell-free millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications have been proposed as promising enablers for the next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we study the user association and hybrid beamforming in cell-free mmWave systems without full channel state information (CSI) acquisition. We consider a cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where multiple remote radio heads (RRHs) are distributed to communicate with users via analog beamforming, and connected to a centralized baseband unit (BBU) through fronthaul links which executes digital beamforming. We aim to jointly design user association, hybrid beamforming, and fronthaul compression with the aid of uplink training. A train-and-design framework is developed to achieve this goal. In particular, we first propose a two-stage uplink training approach to assist RRH-level design, during which the analog beamforming and user association are obtained. After that, digital beamforming and fronthaul compression are optimized at BBU based on the training results. Two performance metrics are considered in this paper, i.e. weighted sum-rate maximization and max-min fairness. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed train-and-design framework for both sum-rate maximization and max-min fairness performance metrics. It is shown that the proposed algorithms can achieve comparable performance to the full-digital beamformer.}

	abstract = {This paper studies cached-aided multicast transmissions in fronthaul fog radio access networks (F-RANs). While index coding and cached-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are techniques commonly used for utilizing cache contents to save transmit energy, there is a lack of general framework to integrate them. This work proposes index-coded NOMA and dynamic coded-NOMA to investigate energy performance of the integration of index coding and NOMA under whole-file and subfile caching, respectively. Besides, dynamic cache space allocation is applied to both caching schemes, which allocates cache sizes to the fog access points (F-APs) according to their large-scale channel conditions. For index-coded NOMA, the general grouping problem is proved to be NP-hard and optimal solutions for some special cases are given. Furthermore, efficient heuristic grouping algorithms are proposed. For dynamic coded-NOMA, we obtain the closed-form minimum transmit energy. The numerical results validate the good performance of our proposed algorithms. Index-coded NOMA and dynamic coded-NOMA have comparable performance and both of them save much energy than the existing schemes. When there are 12 F-APs under small-cache scenarios, index-coded NOMA saves energy by 70.3% compared to traditional NOMA.}

The schemes belong to the class of grant-free coded random access protocols and are tailored to massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) base station processing. High reliability is obtained owing to an intra-frame spatial coupling effect, triggered by a simple device access protocol combined with acknowledgements (ACKs) from the base station. To provide system design guidelines, analytical bounds on error floor and latency are also derived. The proposed schemes are particularly interesting to address the challenges of massive machine-type communications in the framework of next generation massive multiple access systems.}

The ITS deployed in the transmitter architecture can reduce the power consumption in signal beamforming at the base station (BS), and the IRS can help the information transfer from the ITS-aided transmitter to the users. We first maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the users by jointly designing the beamforming vector at the BS and the phase shifts of ITS and IRS. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an effective algorithm in which the Lagrangian dual transform, the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm and the quadratic transform (QT) method are adopted to simplify the objective function. Then, the bisection search and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm are considered to design the optimal beamforming vector and phase shifts of ITS and IRS, respectively. Furthermore, the paper explores the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem to emphasize the value of the ITS-assisted transmitter in terms of power savings. Finally, we compare the simulation results to various state-of-the-art techniques to see how much better the proposed algorithm is in terms of WSR and EE.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) uplink (UL) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) system is investigated which targets to achieve better rate performance and enhanced coverage capability for multiple users. The considered UL RSMA model splits the rate for each user by dividing their message into multiple parts and hence exploits all the necessary degrees of freedom to achieve maximum capacity region and high user fairness. In particular, we focus on the sum-rate maximization for considered UL RSMA system subject to joint optimization of power allocation to the UL users and beamforming design, i.e., active receive beamforming at the base-station (BS) and passive beamforming at multiple RISs. To efficiently mitigate high inter-node interference in multi-user scenario, we first provided a low-complex user pairing scheme based on k-means clustering and then develop an effective low-cost alternating optimization framework to solve the joint optimization problem sub-optimally by decoupling the problem into different sub-problems of power allocation and beamforming design. Specifically, the sub-problems of power allocation and beamforming design are solved using successive convex approximation, Riemannian manifold and fractional programming techniques. Later, the unified solution based on block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed. Extensive numerical simulations validate that the user-clustering effectively significantly improves the performance gain and the considered RSMA system outperforms the conventional multiple schemes in terms rate and user-fairness. Also, the exploitation of spatial correlation among each RIS elements i.e., non-diagonal phase-matrices at each RIS achieve better performance that conventional diagonal phase-matrices setting.}

	abstract = {We investigate the age-limited capacity of the Gaussian many channel with total N\nusers, out of which a random subset of K_{a}\nusers are active in any transmission period, and a large-scale antenna array at the base station (BS). In an uplink scenario where the transmission power is fixed among the users, we consider the setting in which both the number of users, N\n, and the number of antennas at the BS, M\n, are allowed to grow large at a fixed ratio \\zeta = {M}/{N}\n. Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, we derive the achievability bound under maximal ratio combining. As the number of active users, K_{a}\n, increases, the achievable spectral efficiency is found to increase monotonically to a limit \\log _{2}\\left ({1+\\frac {M}{K_{a}}}\\right)\n. Further extensions of the analysis to the zero-forcing receiver as well as imperfect CSI are provided, demonstrating the channel estimation penalty in terms of the mean squared error in estimation. Using the age of information (AoI) metric, first coined by Kaul et al., as our measure of data timeliness or freshness, we investigate the trade-offs between the AoI and spectral efficiency in the context massive connectivity with large-scale receiving antenna arrays. As an extension of Liu and Yu, based on our large system analysis, we provide an accurate characterization of the asymptotic (finite system size) spectral efficiency as a function of the number of antennas and the number of users, the attempt probability, and the AoI. It is found that while the spectral efficiency can be made large, the penalty is an increase in the minimum AoI obtainable. The proposed achievability bound is further compared against recent massive MIMO-based massive unsourced random access (URA) schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we aim to improve the connectivity, scalability, and energy efficiency of machine-type communication (MTC) networks with different types of MTC devices (MTCDs), namely Type-I and Type-II MTCDs, which have different communication purposes. To this end, we propose two transmission schemes called connectivity-oriented machine-type communication (CoM) and quality-oriented machine-type communication (QoM), which take into account the stochastic geometry-based deployment and the random active/inactive status of MTCDs. Specifically, in the proposed schemes, the active Type-I MTCDs operate using a novel Bernoulli random process-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) architecture. Next, utilizing multi-user power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA), each active Type-I MTCD can simultaneously communicate with another Type-I MTCD and a scalable number of Type-II MTCDs. In the performance analysis of the proposed schemes, we prove that the true distribution of the received power at a Type-II MTCD in the QoM scheme can be approximated by the Singh-Maddala distribution. Exploiting this unique statistical finding, we derive approximate closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) and sum-throughput of massive MTC (mMTC) networks. Through numerical results, we show that the proposed schemes provide a considerable sum-throughput gain over conventional mMTC networks.}

	abstract = {Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to meet the ever-increasing computation demands of smart applications. To provide satisfactory computation performance, it is of significant importance to conduct computation offloading in IoV. In this paper, we investigate a multi-vehicle IoV system assisted by MECs with limited computation resources, where vehicles with complex applications can offload their subtasks to MEC servers. Applications are modeled as interdependent subtasks with general random task graphs, different from existing works with independent ones. To maximize the average logarithmic data processing rate (LDPR), the computation offloading problem is formulated as a time-average optimization with long-term constraints, which results from variable vehicle number, various applications and time-varying communication channels. To reduce the cooperation overhead, we propose a multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (Ly-MAPPO) which requires local observation only to solve the subproblems achieved by Lyapunov optimization technique in real time. In addition, to improve the performance of the Ly-MAPPO algorithm, Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is introduced to extract inter-dependencies between subtasks. Extensive simulations show that the GCN embedded Ly-MAPPO outperforms other baseline algorithms, e.g., greedy algorithm and gene algorithm, etc., for different traffic loads and computation resources in MEC servers.}

The VNFs are generally deployed on common off-the-shelf servers and statistically share computational resources. Due to the inherent integer constraints, the corresponding VNF mapping and scheduling issue is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we consider the mapping and scheduling of VNFs for a given network service, for which a flexible job shop scheduling problem is formulated to optimize the max-min fairness while ensuring the delay requirements of different service chains. Specifically, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method based on offline proximal policy optimization, which dynamically determines the mapping and scheduling decision based on the state of unfinished service chains. The proposed algorithm is scalable to the number of service chains and can be enhanced by Monte Carlo tree search. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional random forest and the greedy algorithms in terms of both service fairness and acceptance ratio.}

	abstract = {We consider a resource-constrained IoT network, where multiple users make on-demand requests to a cache-enabled edge node to send status updates about various random processes, each monitored by an energy harvesting sensor. The edge node serves users’ requests by deciding whether to command the corresponding sensor to send a fresh status update or retrieve the most recently received measurement from the cache. Our objective is to find the best actions of the edge node to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of the received measurements upon request, i.e., average on-demand AoI, subject to per-slot transmission and energy constraints. First, we derive a Markov decision process model and propose an iterative algorithm that obtains an optimal policy. Then, we develop an asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithm – termed relax-then-truncate – and prove that it is optimal as the number of sensors goes to infinity. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed relax-then-truncate approach significantly reduces the average on-demand AoI compared to a request-aware greedy policy and a weighted AoI policy, and also depict that it performs close to the optimal solution even for moderate numbers of sensors.}

UAVs can move in 3-dimensional (3D) at a constant acceleration, where a central server is responsible for synchronization and cooperation among UAVs. The effect of accelerated movement in UAV is necessary to be considered. Unlike most existing works, we examine the effects of variable speed on kinetics and radio resource allocations. For the proposed system model, we define two different time scales. In the frame, the acceleration of each UAV is specified, and in each slot, radio resources are allocated. Our goal is to formulate a multi-objective optimization problem where the total data rate is maximized, and the total communication power consumption is minimized simultaneously. To handle this multi-objective optimization, we first apply the scalarization method and then apply multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). We improve this solution method by adding two critic networks together with two-stage resource allocation.}

	abstract = {Remote entanglement distribution plays a crucial role in large-scale quantum networks, and the key enabler for entanglement distribution is quantum routers (or repeaters) that can extend the entanglement transmission distance. However, the performance of quantum routers is far from perfect yet. Amongst the causes, the limited quantum memories in quantum routers largely affect the rate and efficiency of entanglement distribution. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a new modeling for the maximization of entanglement distribution rate (EDR) on a memory-limited path, which is then transformed into entanglement generation and swapping sub-problems. We propose a greedy algorithm for short-distance entanglement generation so that the quantum memories can be efficiently used. As for the entanglement swapping sub-problem, we model it using an Entanglement Graph (EG), whose solution is yet found to be at least NP-complete. In light of it, we propose a heuristic algorithm by dividing the original EG into several sub-problems, each of which can be solved using dynamic programming (DP) in polynomial time. By conducting simulations, the results show that our proposed scheme can achieve a high EDR, and the developed algorithm has a polynomial-time upper bound and reasonable average runtime complexity.}

	abstract = {Short packet communications play key roles in the Internet-of-Things. Conventional Shannon’s coding theorem is not applicable for short packet communications, and the achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime is related to the blocklength and the decoding error probability. Contrary to conventional physical layer security, wireless information surveillance assumes that the communication users are suspicious users and the eavesdroppers are legitimate monitors, and proactive eavesdropping via jamming has been proposed to improve the eavesdropping performance. Existing works on proactive eavesdropping ignored the scenario when the suspicious users adopt the short packet communications. Thus, this paper tries to develop effective proactive eavesdropping schemes suitable for the short packet suspicious communications. Under the truncated channel inversion power allocation and the modified constant power allocation policies at the suspicious source, the problems of jamming power allocation for maximizing the monitoring success probability subject to the average transmit power constraint at the monitor are investigated. Based on the Dinkelbach-type algorithm, the Lagrange duality method and a novel tractable approximate expression for the decoding error probability, we derive suboptimal solutions to the problems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions compared to various benchmark algorithms in existing literature.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider deploying an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance the downlink (DL) energy transfer and uplink (UL) information transmission efficiency for secure multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). We aim to maximize the secrecy throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the DL/UL time allocation, the energy transmit covariance matrix of hybrid access point (AP), the information transmit beamforming matrix of users and the phase shifts of IRS in DL/UL, subject to constraints of energy/information transmit power at the hybrid AP/users and that of unit-modulus IRS phase shifts for DL/UL. To tackle the non-convex problem, we first transform the original problem into an equivalent form based on the mean-square error (MSE) method given time allocation, and then apply the alternating algorithm to update the optimization variables iteratively. Specifically, the energy covariance matrix and the information beamforming matrix are obtained based on the dual subgradient method. For the IRS phase shifts, we investigate two IRS beamforming reflection setups, namely different DL/UL IRS beamforming and identical DL/UL IRS beamforming. For the former case, the second-order cone programming technique and the Majorization-Minimization algorithm/element by element iterative algorithm are applied to obtain the DL and UL IRS phase shifts, respectively. For the latter case, the IRS phase shifts are obtained by the successive convex approximation technique. To further reduce the computational complexity of the single-user system, we derive the closed-form solutions of IRS phase shifts in each iteration for the two different reflection setups. Simulation results show that all the proposed algorithms can greatly improve the secrecy throughput compared to the conventional system without IRS.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology which can be integrated with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve the secrecy performance. In this paper, we propose two IRS-aided schemes to enhance the security of NOMA networks for the internal and external eavesdropping, respectively. First, to deal with an internal untrusted user, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming, while meeting the quality of service (QoS) demand of the untrusted user, decoding order constraints, and unit modulus constraints of IRS elements. Furthermore, considering a worse scenario with both internal and external eavesdroppers, we minimize the transmit power of legitimate signals with both users’ QoS demands satisfied. In this way, the confidential information leakage will be mitigated and more transmit power can be allocated as artificial jamming to attenuate the eavesdropping. To tackle the non-convex optimization, the original problem in each scheme is first decomposed into two subproblems, which are approximated into convex ones via the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, by means of alternating optimization, the suboptimal solutions to the original problems can be obtained. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes against the challenging internal and external eavesdropping by combining IRS and NOMA.}

In this paper, we contribute to this effort by exploring optimal array geometric structures of direct position determination (DPD) systems, inspired by sensor placement problems that predominantly focus on two-step localization and have not yet been extended to DPD. Specifically, we research an optimal array placement and orientation strategy for two-dimensional (2-D) DPD systems that use sensors equipped with uniform linear arrays (ULA) to localize an agent. The A-optimality criterion in Bayesian optimal (experimental) design theory is invoked to formulate this problem. We use an optimization subproblem that optimizes array orientations when array locations are arbitrary but fixed to tackle this high-dimensional optimization problem. Then the optimization problem is converted into a typical optimal angular separation problem in two-step localization. Experimental results show that judiciously designed array geometric structures can lead to significant performance improvements.}

Based on the Ungerboeck observation model, a detection algorithm with appealing complexity properties can be derived. However, since the underlying factor graph contains cycles, the sum-product algorithm (SPA) yields a suboptimal algorithm. In this paper, we develop and evaluate efficient strategies to improve the performance of the factor graph-based symbol detection by means of neural enhancement. In particular, we consider neural belief propagation and generalizations of the factor nodes as an effective way to mitigate the effect of cycles within the factor graph. By applying a generic preprocessor to the channel output, we propose a simple technique to vary the underlying factor graph in every SPA iteration. Using this dynamic factor graph transition, we intend to preserve the extrinsic nature of the SPA messages which is otherwise impaired due to cycles. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can massively improve the detection performance, even approaching the maximum a posteriori performance for various transmission scenarios, while preserving a complexity which is linear in both the block length and the channel memory.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been selected as a baseline waveform for long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation new radio (5G NR). Fast-convolution (FC)-based frequency-domain signal processing has been recently considered as an effective tool for transmitter and receiver side subband filtering of OFDM-based waveforms. However, for the original continuous FC-based model, the filtering can, in general, be configured in time-direction only with the granularity of half subframe, corresponding to 7, 14, or 28 symbols with 15kHz, 30kHz, or 60kHz subcarrier spacing, respectively. In this paper, we present a symbol-synchronous FC-processing scheme flexibly allowing filter re-configuration with the time resolution equal to one OFDM symbol while supporting tight carrier-wise filtering for 5G NR in mixed-numerology scenarios with adjustable subcarrier spacings, center frequencies, and subband bandwidths, as well as providing co-existence with LTE. Proposed approach segments each stream of time-domain OFDM symbols into overlapping processing blocks of fixed size. Symbol synchronous processing is achieved by dynamically adjusting the overlap between the processing blocks while aligning the payload part of the processing blocks with the boundaries of the OFDM symbols. The proposed scheme is demonstrated to support the envisioned use cases of 5G NR and provide a flexible starting point for sixth generation (6G) development.}

For this system, we derive closed-form uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions by considering i) radio-frequency (RF) impairments at the APs and UEs; ii) dynamic resolution analog-to-digital converter/digital-to-analog converter (ADC/DAC) architecture at the APs and low-resolution ADC/DACs at the UEs; and iii) spatially-correlated Rician channels. We then maximize the non-convex global energy efficiency metric by using the block minorization-maximization technique, which decomposes the main optimization into multiple convex surrogate sub-problems. We analytically show that the SE gain obtained with downlink training is limited for practical CF systems with RF and ADC/DAC impairments, Rician channel and pilot contamination. We also extensively investigate the impact of FD interferences on the downlink training gain.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as a promising technology with great potential to boost wireless networks. Affected by the “double fading” effect, however, conventional passive RIS cannot bring considerable performance improvement when users are not close enough to RIS. Recently, active RIS is introduced to combat the double fading effect by actively amplifying incident signals with the aid of integrated reflection-type amplifiers. In order to reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption due to massive active components in the conventional fully-connected active RIS, a novel hardware-and-energy efficient sub-connected active RIS architecture has been proposed recently, in which multiple reconfigurable electromagnetic elements are driven by only one amplifier. In this paper, we first develop an improved and accurate signal model for the sub-connected active RIS architecture. Then, we investigate the joint transmit precoding and RIS reflection beamforming (i.e., the reflection phase-shift and amplification coefficients) designs in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems. Both sum-rate maximization and power minimization problems are solved by leveraging fractional programming (FP), block coordinate descent (BCD), second-order cone programming (SOCP), alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. Extensive simulation results verify that compared with the conventional fully-connected structure, the proposed sub-connected active RIS can significantly reduce the hardware cost and power consumption, and achieve great performance improvement when power budget at RIS is limited.}

	abstract = {Mutualistic cooperative ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) have been proposed to improve the spectrum and energy efficiencies of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, where a primary link (from a primary transmitter to a primary receiver) and an AmBC link (from an IoT device to the same primary receiver) form a mutualism relationship. We note that hardware impairments (HIs), which are unavoidable in practical systems and may significantly affect the transmission rates of the primary and AmBC links and their mutualism relationships, have been largely ignored in the study of mutualistic cooperative AmBC networks. In this paper, we study a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network with HIs at all the active transceivers and a non-linear energy harvesting circuit at each IoT device. We derive closed-form rate expressions for both the AmBC and primary links and theoretically prove that the mutualism relationship between the AmBC and primary links is maintained under HIs, i.e., the rate of the primary link in the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network is still higher than that without the AmBC link. To maximize the weighted sum rate of all links in a cooperative AmBC network under HIs, we propose two resource allocation schemes for two scenarios with a single link and multiple AmBC links, respectively. For the single AmBC link case, we derive the optimal transmit power of the primary transmitter and the optimal power reflection coefficient of the IoT device in closed forms. For the scenario with multiple AmBC links, the weighted-sum-rate maximization problem is transformed into a convex one and solved with convex optimization tools. Computer simulations validate our theoretical results and that our proposed schemes outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of the weighted sum rate.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of minimising latency in computation offloading with digital twin (DT) wireless edge networks for industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment via ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) links. The considered DT-aided edge networks provide a powerful computing framework to enable computation-intensive services, where the DT is used to model the computing capacity of edge servers and optimise the resource allocation of the entire system. The objective function is comprised of local processing latency, URLLC-based transmission latency and edge processing latency, subject to both communication and computation resources budgets. In this regard, the minimum latency is obtained by jointly optimising the transmit power, user association, offloading portions, the processing rate of users and edge servers. The formulated problem is highly complicated due to complex non-convex constraints and strong coupling variables. To deal with this computationally intractable problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which decomposes the original problem into three sub-problems and resolve this problem in the fashion of alternating optimisation approach combined with an inner convex approximation framework. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the latency compared with other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Conventional radars repeat the transmission of the same waveform after a predefined interval of time called pulse-repetition-interval (PRI). This technique helps estimate the range and Doppler shift of the targets and suppress clutter. However, in dual-function radar communication (DFRC), a different symbol waveform is transmitted after each PRI. Depending on the number of targets, radar receiver output yields several peaks representing different targets’ ranges. Each peak comes with its side-lobes called range-side-lobes (RSL). In DFRC, due to different symbol waveform transmission, peaks and RSLs do not remain coherent, making Doppler shift estimation and clutter suppression challenging tasks. In most of the available literature, iterative receive filters have been designed for DFRC to minimize RSLs and achieve coherent output for different waveforms. However, the proposed receive filter does not guarantee coherent output for more than two waveforms. In contrast, we proposed two novel closed-form algorithms to design receive filters for DFRC that guarantee coherent output response for several waveforms and suppress RSLs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed receivers achieve full coherency, and the RSLs are significantly lower than the conventional method. Furthermore, the advantage of achieving coherent output response is shown in target detection and bit-error-rate improvement.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can be employed in a cell-free system to create favorable propagation conditions from base stations (BSs) to users via configurable elements. However, prior works on RIS-aided cell-free system designs mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which may incur substantial overhead due to extremely high dimensions of estimated channels. To mitigate this issue, a low-complexity algorithm via the two-timescale transmission protocol is proposed in this paper, where the joint beamforming at BSs and RISs is facilitated via alternating optimization framework to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. Specifically, the passive beamformers at RISs are optimized through the statistical CSI, and the transmit beamformers at BSs are based on the instantaneous CSI of effective channels. In this manner, a closed-form expression for the achievable weighted sum-rate is derived, which enables the evaluation of the impact of key parameters on system performance. To gain more insights, a special case without line-of-sight (LoS) components is further investigated, where a power gain on the order of\nO(M)\nis achieved, with\nM\nbeing the BS antennas number. Numerical results validate the tightness of our derived analytical expression and show the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm. Findings illustrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm with two-timescale CSI is comparable to that with instantaneous CSI in low or moderate SNR regime. The impact of key system parameters such as the number of RIS elements, CSI settings and Rician factor is also evaluated. Moreover, the remarkable advantages from the adoption of the cell-free paradigm and the deployment of RISs are demonstrated intuitively.}

	abstract = {The intelligent omni-surface (IOS) is a dynamic metasurface that has recently been proposed to achieve full-dimensional communications by realizing the dual function of anomalous reflection and anomalous refraction. Existing research works provide only simplified models for the reflection and refraction responses of the IOS, which do not explicitly depend on the physical structure of the IOS and the angle of incidence of the electromagnetic (EM) waves. Therefore, the available reflection-refraction models are insufficient to characterize the performance of full-dimensional communications. In this paper, we propose a complete and detailed circuit-based reflection-refraction model for the IOS, which is formulated in terms of the physical structure and equivalent circuits of the IOS elements, as well as we validate it with the aid of full-wave EM simulations. Based on the proposed circuit-based model for the IOS, we analyze the asymmetry between the reflection and transmission coefficients. Moreover, the proposed circuit-based model is utilized for optimizing the hybrid beamforming of IOS-assisted networks and hence improving the system performance. To verify the circuit-based model, the theoretical findings, and to evaluate the performance of full-dimensional beamforming, we implement a prototype of IOS and deploy an IOS-assisted wireless communication testbed to experimentally measure the beam patterns and to quantify the achievable rate. The obtained experimental results validate the theoretical findings and the accuracy of the proposed circuit-based reflection-refraction model for IOSs.}

	abstract = {We provide the first-ever performance evaluation of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To investigate the trade-off between performance and overhead, we apply embedded pilot-aided and superimposed pilot-based channel estimation methods. We then derive a closed-form expression for the individual user downlink and uplink spectral efficiencies (SEs) as a function of the numbers of APs, users and delay-Doppler domain channel estimate parameters. Based on these analytical results, we also present new scaling laws that the AP’s and user’s transmit power should satisfy, to sustain a desirable quality of service. It is found that when the number of APs,\nM\na\n, grows without bound, we can reduce the transmit power of each user and AP proportionally to\n1/\nM\na\nand\n1/\nM\n2\na\n, respectively, during the uplink and downlink phases. We compare the OTFS performance with that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) at high-mobility conditions. Our findings reveal that, OTFS modulation with embedded pilot-based channel estimation provides up to 20-fold gain over the OFDM counterpart in terms of 95%-likely per-user downlink SE. Finally, with superimposed pilot-based channel estimation, the increase in the uplink sum SE is more pronounced when the channel delay spread is increased.}

We derive novel probability density and distribution functions of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the multihop link employing channel-assisted (CA) and fixed-gain (FG) amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying for each hop by considering independent but not identically distributed (i.ni.d)\nα\n-\nμ\nfading channel with pointing errors.

To achieve the maximum sum rate of proposed communication scenario, a non-convex problem considering IRS association results, hovering altitude of UAV, and the phase shift design of multi-IRS is formulated. From the IRS association problem, we can find that the IRS association results are coupled to the decoding order of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To tackle this, a mathematical interference expansion scheme is developed to decouple it and transform it to convex by binary relaxation method. The non-convexity of hovering altitude optimization problem is solved by logarithm operation, approximation, and auxiliary matrices. For the phase shift optimization problem of multi-IRS, we propose a gradient approximation based initial scheme and develop a univariate optimization based approach on the basis to achieve the users sum rate improvement in multi-IRS. In the end, we compare the proposed scheme with baseline scheme to present the superiority of this work under various network settings. The internal reasons for the variation of simulation results are also analyzed.}

	abstract = {In an adaptive or non-cooperative communication system, the blind identification of channel coding is an indispensable procedure for recovering the message from the intercepted coding data. Due to the wide applications of convolutional codes, the blind identification problem of convolutional codes has also received extensive studies. In this paper, we consider the blind identification problem of convolution encoder parameters in the general\nk/n\nrate case. To improve the blind identification accuracy of existing hard decision based solutions, a novel soft information based blind identification algorithm is designed in this paper. Specifically, a Soft Gaussian-Jordan Elimination Through Pivoting (Soft-GJETP) algorithm is firstly proposed to calculate the rank of the received data matrix. In contrast to the existing hard decision based GJETP algorithm, this Soft-GJETP algorithm formulates the soft information of the received data, then defines three reliability metrics and derives updating rules for this soft information. In this way, the diagonals of the received data matrix have fewer errors in Soft-GJETP algorithm. Furthermore, a soft decision strategy is proposed with a weight-dependent threshold. Employing this strategy, the dependent columns can be distinguished with higher accuracy. Finally, simulation results and comparisons are given to illustrate the performances of our proposed methods.}

For\n(n,k)\nRS codes, where\nn\nis the code length and\nk\nis the code dimension, the proposed decoding algorithm has both the best asymptotic computational complexity\nO(nlog(n−k)+(n−k)\nlog\n2\n(n−k))\nand the smallest constant factor achieved to date.

When decoding the (4096, 3584) RS code defined over\nF\n2\n12\n, the new algorithm is 10 times faster than a conventional syndrome-based method.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a block polarization (BP) scheme as a framework to study polar-coded hybrid automatic repeat request (Polar-HARQ) under bit-interleaved polar-coded modulation (BIPCM). The BP scheme of BIPCM can combine multiple independent polar subcodes to form a longer polar code under the block polarization between polar subcodes. The BP scheme of HARQ further carries out block polarization based on the BP scheme of BIPCM, which can combine multiple transmitted BP schemes of BIPCM together to form a longer polar code. When the underlying channels are non-uniform, such as the polarization effect of high-order modulation will lead to non-uniform reliabilities, it is not suitable to use the fixed sequence (e.g., the polarization weight (PW) sequence or Polar sequence in the 5G standard) to construct polar codes. The underlying channels on each polar subcode have uniform reliability by dividing different blocks according to the reliabilities of the underlying channel. Based on this characteristic of BP scheme, we propose a rate-allocation (RA) method to study fast code construction of BP scheme. The key idea of the proposed RA method is finding out the equivalent channel whose average symmetric capacity equals the target transmission rate. The allocated rates are computed according to the symmetric capacities of split channels under the block polarization between polar subcodes. Then the ranking of bit indices within each polar subcode can be obtained by fixed sequence. In this way, the RA code construction is concise and robust for diverse configurations which are the desired features for practical implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed BP scheme under RA construction can achieve almost identical performance as the Gaussian approximation construction with much lower complexity.}

A crucial parameter in coded caching is subpacketization, which is the number of parts a file is to be split into for coding purposes. The Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme has order-optimal rate, but the subpacketization is exponential in the number of users for certain memory regimes. In contrast, coded caching schemes designed using placement delivery arrays (PDAs) can have linear subpacketization with a penalty in rate. In this work, we propose several constructions of efficient PDAs through lifting, where a base PDA is expanded by replacing each entry by another PDA. By proposing and using the notion of Blackburn-compatibility of PDAs, we provide multiple lifting constructions with increasing coding gains. We compare the constructed coded caching schemes with other existing schemes for moderately high number of users and show that the proposed constructions are versatile and achieve a good rate-memory tradeoff at low subpacketizations.}

We further combine our approach with an ordered statistics decoding (OSD) post-processing step, which effectively leverages the bit-error rate optimization deriving from the use of the binary cross-entropy loss function. We show that a single specialized BP-RNN decoder combines better than BP with the OSD post-processing step. Moreover, combining OSD post-processing with the diversity brought by the use of multiple BP-RNN decoders, provides an efficient way to bridge the gap to maximum likelihood decoding.}

Random linear network coding (RLNC) is another popular technique to enhance the efficiency and reliability of wireless communications. In this paper, in order to explore the potential of RLNC in full-duplex relay networks, we investigate two fundamental perfect RLNC schemes and theoretically analyze their completion delay performance. The first scheme is a straightforward application of conventional perfect RLNC studied in wireless broadcast, so it involves no additional process at the relay. Its performance serves as an upper bound for all perfect RLNC schemes. The other scheme allows sufficiently large buffer and unconstrained linear coding at the relay. It attains the optimal performance and serves as a lower bound for all RLNC schemes. For both schemes, closed-form formulae to characterize the expected completion delay at a single receiver as well as for the whole system are derived. Numerical results are also demonstrated to validate the theoretical characterizations, and compare the two fundamental schemes with the existing one.}

Fast-changing file features, such as fast-changing file popularities and fast-changing file contents (data freshness), represent a challenge for proactive caching if cache content update is much slower, which decreases the efficiency and usability of caching. We present a dynamic caching scheme that updates local user caches and optimizes the use of caching resources. The developed scheme index-code the updates with the delivery messages. The developed scheme is presented for a network with one cache-enabled server, that has a pool of files, communicating with\nK\ncache-enabled receivers with requests limited to the server’s file pool. The developed scheme assumes partial knowledge of features variation. Asynchronous file delivery is assumed as a result of non-flexible receivers’ request timing. We show that the file delivery messages can be used to proactively and constantly update the receivers’ finite caches by index-coding the update messages with delivery messages at no additional rate-cost. We also show that this mechanism reduces the downloaded traffic and can be used to reduce other QoS metrics.}

	abstract = {The introduction of space-time block code (STBC) can efficiently increase the diversity of original spatial modulation (SM). However, the spectral efficiency of STBC will be reduced gradually with the increase of the transmit antennas. In this contribution, we conceive a novel quasi-orthogonal space-time block coded spatial modulation (QOSTBC-SM) design for multiple-input and multiple-out (MIMO) transmission by reaping their respective benefits, while improving the spectral efficiency compared to conventional space-time block coded spatial modulation (STBC-SM). More specifically, in the proposed QOSTBC-SM structure, the information bits are conveyed via the active antenna index, as well as the QOSTBC blocks at the transmitter, while at the receiver, a low-complexity detection scheme is proposed. Furthermore, a closed-form union bound of the bit error rate (BER) is also quantified by theoretical derivation. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that QOSTBC-SM is capable of outperforming the conventional counterpart as STBC-SM with higher spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {We consider a coded compressed sensing approach for the unsourced random access and replace the outer tree code proposed by Amalladinne et al. (2020) with the list recoverable code capable of correcting\nt\nerrors. A finite-length random coding bound for such codes is derived. The numerical experiments in the single-antenna quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel show that transition to list recoverable codes correcting\nt\nerrors improves the performance of the coded compressed sensing scheme by 7–10 dB compared to the tree code-based scheme. We propose two practical constructions of outer codes. The first is a modification of the tree code called\nt\n-tree code. It utilizes the same code structure, and a key difference is a decoder capable of correcting up to\nt\nerrors. The second is based on the Reed–Solomon codes and Guruswami–Sudan list decoding algorithm. The first scheme provides energy efficiency very close to the random coding bound when the decoding complexity (number of decoding paths) is unbounded. But when we restrict the number of decoding paths with a practical value, the second scheme outperforms the first one. Both schemes improve the performance of a tree code-based scheme for a small and moderate number of active users.}

Therefore, the topic of analyzing Age of Information (AoI) has aroused new research interest. This paper contributes to new results in this area by systematically analyzing the AoI of two types of Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) techniques that have been newly standardized in the Release-16 5G New Radio (NR) specifications, namely reactive HARQ and proactive HARQ. Under a code-based status update system with non-trivial coding delay, transmission delay, propagation delay, decoding delay, and feedback delay, we derive unified closed-form average AoI and average Peak AoI expressions for reactive HARQ and proactive HARQ, respectively. Based on the obtained explicit expressions, we formulate an AoI minimization problem to investigate the age-optimal codeblock assignment strategy in the finite block-length (FBL) regime. Through case studies and analytical results, we provide comparative insights between reactive HARQ and proactive HARQ from a perspective of freshness of information. The numerical results and optimization solutions show that proactive HARQ draws its strength from both age performance and system robustness, thus enabling the potential to provide new system advancement of a freshness-critical status update system.}

	abstract = {Real-time environment monitoring is a key application in Industrial Internet of Things, where sensors proactively collect and transmit environmental data to the controller. However, due to limited wireless resources, keeping sensors’ sampled data fresh at the controller is critical. This work aims to investigate the trade-off between the sensor’s data-sampling frequency and long-term data transmission energy consumption while maintaining information freshness. Leveraging the entropic risk measure (ERM), we jointly minimize the global transmission energy’s mean and variance subject to probabilistic constraints on information freshness. Furthermore, while jointly saving the model training energy, we adopt the federated learning (FL) paradigm and propose an FL-based two-stage iterative optimization framework to optimize the aforementioned objective. Specifically, we iteratively learn the sampling frequency via Bayesian optimization and minimize the long-term ERM of the global energy consumption via Lyapunov optimization. Numerical results show that the proposed FL-based scheme saves substantial executing energy with less performance loss. Quantitatively, compared with the centralized learning baseline, the proposed FL-based framework saves up to 69% model training energy at the expense of a mere increased objective outcome, i.e., 6.3% in the global data transmission energy consumption (\n9.936×\n10\n−5\nin ERM) under 0.4% bias from the global optimal data-sampling frequency.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hold great potential to support a wide range of applications due to the high maneuverability and flexibility. Compared with single UAV, UAV swarm carries out tasks efficiently in harsh environment, where the network resilience is of vital importance to UAV swarm. The network topology has a fundamental impact on the resilience of UAV network. It is discovered that scale-free network topology, as a topology that exists widely in nature, has the ability to enhance the network resilience. Besides, increasing network throughput can enhance the efficiency of information interaction, improving the network resilience. Facing these facts, this paper studies the throughput of UAV network with scale-free topology. Introducing the hybrid network structure combining both ad hoc transmission mode and cellular transmission mode into UAV network, the throughput of UAV network is improved compared with that of pure ad hoc UAV network. Furthermore, this work also investigates the optimal setting of the hop threshold for the selection of ad hoc or cellular transmission mode. It is discovered that the optimal hop threshold is related with the number of UAVs and the parameters of scale-free topology. This paper may motivate the application of hybrid network structure into UAV network.}

The decoder produces a joint reconstruction of target signals with the mean squared error distortion below a given threshold. It is assumed that the observed sources can be expressed as the sum of target signals and corruptive noises which are independently generated from two symmetric multivariate Gaussian distributions. The minimum compression rate of this network versus the distortion threshold is referred to as the rate-distortion function, for which an explicit lower bound is established by solving a minimization problem. Our lower bound matches the well-known Berger-Tung upper bound for some values of the distortion threshold.

	abstract = {We examine here what type of predictive modelling, classification, or regression, using neural networks (NN), fits better the task of soft-demapping based post-processing in coherent optical communications, where the transmission channel is nonlinear and dispersive. For the first time, we present possible drawbacks in using each type of predictive task in a machine learning context, considering the nonlinear coherent optical channel equalization/soft-demapping problem. We study two types of equalizers based on the feed-forward and recurrent NNs, for several transmission scenarios, in linear and nonlinear regimes of the optical channel. We point out that even though from the information theory perspective the cross-entropy loss (classification) is the most suitable option for our problem, the NN models based on the cross-entropy loss function can severely suffer from learning problems. The latter translates into the fact that regression-based learning is typically superior in terms of delivering higher Q-factor and achievable information rates. In short, we show by empirical evidence that loss functions based on cross-entropy may not be necessarily the most suitable option for training communication systems in practical scenarios when overfitting- and vanishing gradients-related problems come into play.}

We propose a variational learning based end-to-end SCMA network model termed as V-SCMA. In our model, SCMA codebooks are generated by a deep neural network (DNN) encoder. Motivated by the idea of variational learning, we derive the posterior probability of SCMA codeword send by each user from the point view of binary coding using the variational method. Then, we design an SCMA decoding network to learn this process of approaching the real posterior probability. The SCMA decoding network designed by us is a truncated recurrent neural network, which is simpler than other networks. In addition, a novel loss function is proposed to optimize V-SCMA. Compared with previous works, the new loss function is a tighter variational lower bound which improves the BER performance. Simulation results show that the proposed V-SCMA offers a better bit error rate (BER) performance and a lower computational complexity than conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {In massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, a challenging problem is how to predict channel state information (CSI) (i.e., channel prediction) accurately in mobility scenarios. However, a practical obstacle is caused by CSI non-stationary and nonlinear dynamics in temporal domain. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal neural network (STNN) to achieve better performance by carefully taking into account the spatio-temporal characteristics of CSI. Specifically, STNN uses its encoder and decoder modules to capture the spatial correlation and temporal dependence of CSI. Further, the differencing-attention module is designed to deal with the non-stationary and nonlinear temporal dynamics and realize adaptive feature refinement for more accurate multi-step prediction. Additionally, an advanced training scheme is adopted to reduce the discrepancy between STNN training and testing. Evaluated on a realistic channel model with enhanced mobility and spherical waves, experimental results show that STNN can effectively improve the accuracy of prediction and perform well with respect to different signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Visualization and testing for unit root illustrate STNN is able to learn CSI time-varying patterns by alleviating series non-stationarity.}

The overhead of CSI feedback occupies substantial uplink bandwidth resources, especially when the number of transmit antennas is large. Deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback refers to CSI compression and reconstruction by a DL-based autoencoder and can greatly reduce feedback overhead. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art research on this topic is provided, beginning with basic DL concepts widely used in CSI feedback and then categorizing and describing some existing DL-based feedback works. The focus is on novel neural network architectures and utilization of communication expert knowledge to improve CSI feedback accuracy. Works on joint design of CSI feedback with other communication modules are also introduced, and some practical issues, including bitstream generation, multirate feedback, imperfect feedback, NN complexity, training dataset collection, online training, and standardization effect, are discussed. At the end of the paper, some challenges and potential research directions associated with DL-based CSI feedback in future wireless communication systems are identified.}

Then, we develop the SC-SD algorithm to reduce the computational complexity by deciding the detection order from the output of the SC-DNN, the zero-forcing (ZF) detector, and the transmit power. We further reduce the complexity of the SC-SD by defining partial layers without searching. For multi-stream MIMO, where a large number of parameters in neural networks should be trained, we propose a partitioned training procedure to achieve a reasonable computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the SC-SD almost achieves the performance of the maximum likelihood (ML) in MIMO system but is much faster than the classic SD algorithm.}

	abstract = {Broadcast/multicast communication systems are typically designed to optimize the outage rate criterion, which neglects the performance of the fraction of clients with the worst channel conditions. Targeting ultra-reliable communication scenarios, this paper takes a complementary approach by introducing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) rate as the expected rate of a worst-case fraction of clients. To support differential quality-of-service (QoS) levels in this class of clients, layered division multiplexing (LDM) is applied, which enables decoding at different rates. Focusing on a practical scenario in which the transmitter does not know the fading distribution, layer allocation is optimized based on a dataset sampled offline. The optimality gap caused by the availability of limited data is bounded via a generalization analysis, and the sample complexity is shown to increase as the designated fraction of worst-case clients decreases. Considering this theoretical result, meta-learning is introduced as a means to reduce sample complexity by leveraging data from previous deployments. Numerical experiments demonstrate that LDM improves spectral efficiency even for small datasets; that, for sufficiently large datasets, the proposed mirror-descent-based layer optimization scheme achieves a CVaR rate close to that achieved when the transmitter knows the fading distribution; and that meta-learning can significantly reduce data requirements.}

	abstract = {This paper studies machine learning-assisted optimal receivers for a communication system with memory, which can be modelled by a trellis diagram. The prerequisite of the optimal receiver is to obtain the likelihoods of the received samples under different state transitions. We propose to learn the trellis diagram real-time using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by a pilot sequence. This approach, termed as the online learning trellis diagram (OLTD), requires neither the channel state information (CSI) nor statistics of the noise, and can be incorporated into the classic Viterbi and the BCJR algorithm. In a channel with non-Gaussian noise, the OLTD method can significantly outperform the model-based methods that use Gaussian assumption. It requires much less training overhead than the state-of-the-art ANN-assisted methods. As an illustrative example, the OLTD-based BCJR is applied to a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) receiver trained only by a 256-sample pilot sequence. Moreover, the OLTD-based BCJR can accommodate for turbo equalization. As an interesting by-product, we propose an enhancement to the BLE standard by introducing a bit interleaver to its physical layer; the resultant improvement of the receiver sensitivity can make it a better fit for some Internet of Things (IoT) communications.}

	abstract = {Conventional multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) mainly focused on Gaussian signaling, independent and identically distributed (IID) channels, and a limited number of users. It will be laborious to cope with the heterogeneous requirements in next-generation wireless communications, such as various transmission data, complicated communication scenarios, and unprecedented massive user access. Therefore, this paper studies a generalized MU-MIMO (GMU-MIMO) system with more generalized and practical constraints, i.e., practical channel coding, non-Gaussian signaling, right-unitarily-invariant channels (covering Rayleigh fading channel matrices, certain ill-conditioned and correlated channel matrices, etc.), and massive users and antennas. These generalized assumptions bring new challenges in theory and practice. For example, there is no accurate constrained capacity region analysis for GMU-MIMO. In addition, it is unclear how to achieve constrained-capacity-optimal performance with practical complexity. To address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed to derive the constrained capacity region of GMU-MIMO and design a constrained-capacity-optimal transceiver, which jointly considers encoding, modulation, detection, and decoding. Group asymmetry is developed to group users according to their rates, which makes a tradeoff between user rate allocation and implementation complexity. Specifically, the constrained capacity region of group-asymmetric GMU-MIMO is characterized by using the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) optimality of orthogonal/vector approximate message passing (OAMP/VAMP) and the relationship between mutual information and MMSE. Furthermore, a theoretically optimal multi-user OAMP/VAMP receiver and practical multi-user low-density parity-check (MU-LDPC) codes are proposed to achieve the constrained capacity region of group-asymmetric GMU-MIMO. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MU-LDPC coded GMU-MIMO systems achieve asymptotic performance within 0.2 dB from the theoretical sum capacity. Moreover, their finite-length performances are about 1~2 dB away from the associated sum capacity of GMU-MIMO.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we adopt a three-stage based uplink channel estimation protocol with reduced pilot overhead for an reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, in which both the base station (BS) and the RIS are equipped with a uniform planar array (UPA). Specifically, in Stage I, the channel state information (CSI) of a typical user is estimated. To address the power leakage issue for the common angles-of-arrival (AoAs) estimation in this stage, we develop a low-complexity one-dimensional search method. In Stage II, a re-parameterized common BS-RIS channel is constructed with the estimated information from Stage I to estimate other users’ CSI. In Stage III, only the rapidly varying channel gains need to re-estimated. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to multi-antenna UPA-type users, by decomposing the estimation of a multi-antenna channel with\nJ\nscatterers into estimating\nJ\nsingle-scatterer channels for a virtual single-antenna user. An orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based method is proposed to estimate the angles-of-departure (AoDs) at the users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly achieves high channel estimation accuracy, which approaches the genie-aided upper bound in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.}

	abstract = {Novel hybrid beamformer designs are conceived for a multi-user multi-cell (MUMC) mmWave system relying on base station (BS) coordination and total transmit power minimization subject to realistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at each mobile station (MS). Initially, a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based approach is developed for a centralized MUMC system to determine the fully digital beamformer having perfect CSI. Subsequently, a Bayesian learning (BL) technique is harnessed for decomposing the fully-digital (FD) solution into its analog and digital components for constructing a hybrid transceiver. Next, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based distributed hybrid beamformer is designed for the same system, which requires only local CSI and limited information exchange among the BSs, thus avoiding the excessive signalling overheads required by the centralized approach. Then we further extend both the centralized and the above distributed hybrid designs to construct robust beamformers that minimize the worst-case transmit power with imperfect CSI. Our robust beamforming techniques leverage the S-lemma, which is eminently suitable for the infinitely many constraints arising from the associated CSI uncertainty. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed centralized and distributed methods over the system having no coordination.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are two appealing technologies in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications. The challenge of combining these two technologies lies in joint design for active beamforming (at the base-station (BS)/users) and passive beamforming (at the IRSs). In this paper, we consider a multi-IRS-aided multi-user MIMO scenario and propose a novel space-orthogonal scheme by applying zero-forcing techniques. Specifically, we first propose a multi-IRS-based zero-interference criterion, under which multi-user interference can be eliminated regardless of the IRS’s phase shifts. Based on this criterion, we decompose the precoder/decoder matrix into a product of two matrices, with one of them devised for interference cancellation and the other one of them devised for achievable rate maximization. Next, an approximate space-orthogonal technique referred to as partial zero-forcing (IRS-PZF) is proposed for proposed for devising the former matrix whose objective is to cancel the multi-user interference; while two efficient phase-shift schemes are proposed for the IRS passive beamforming, namely, water-filling segment matching (WSM) and phase iterative evolution (PIE), which balance between performance and complexity. Finally, we calculate the latter matrix of the precoder/decoder by applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) for the effective BS-user channels, so as to maximize the users’ achievable rates. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme compared with the benchmarks.}

Focusing on a special class of network topology – chordal networks – we investigate algorithmic aspects of the TIM problem under adversarial topology perturbation. In particular, given the adversarial perturbation with respect to edge insertion/deletion, we propose a dynamic graph coloring algorithm that allows for a constant number of re-coloring updates against each inserted/deleted edge to achieve the information-theoretic optimality. This is a sharp reduction of the general graph re-coloring, whose optimal number of updates scales as the size of the network, thanks to the delicate exploitation of the structural properties of chordal graph classes.}

	abstract = {The ever-growing demands on wireless connectivity, especially with the emergence of various data-intensive low-latency applications, require novel multiplexing solutions capable of reliably supporting high rates at low latency. Non-orthogonal time division duplex (TDD) coupled with multiuser detection can meet these emerging needs, provided that accurate channel state information is available. This paper proposes a new pilot-free TDD frame structure that allows designing highly effective multiuser decoders and precoders for uplink and downlink multicell systems, in an unsupervised manner. The key idea is that each user repeats and permutes its uplink data using a pre-assigned permutation code. Invoking canonical correlation analysis (CCA) at the serving BS on the two deinterleaved uplink blocks yields high quality CCA-based beamformers capable of both recovering the uplink and precoding the downlink user signals in a way that effectively mitigates interference. The paper includes a pilotless synchronization framework that leverages CCA to recover the timing and frequency offsets in an asynchronous multiuser MIMO setup, without using pilots. Simulations are used to study the performance of the proposed approach on a large-scale network with multiple users and cells, while laboratory experiments with a small-scale network of software radios are used to demonstrate that the approach works well in practice under common hardware imperfections.}

Differential M\n-ary phase shift keying is one of the most appealing NC schemes due to its implementation simplicity in realistic scenarios. However, the analytical constellation design for multiuser scenarios is intractable, as discussed in this paper. We propose to solve this problem by using optimization techniques relying on evolutionary computation. We design two approaches, namely Gaussian-approximated optimization and Monte-Carlo based optimization. They can provide both individual constellations for each user equipment and a bit mapping policy to minimize the bit error rate. We perform a complexity analysis and propose strategies for its reduction. We propose a set of constellations for different number of users and constellation sizes, and evaluate the link-level performance of some illustrative examples to verify that our solutions outperforms the existing ones. Finally, we show via simulations that NC outperforms the coherent schemes in high mobility and/or low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the robust resource allocation design for secure communication in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. A multi-antenna dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users and senses for targets simultaneously, where already identified targets are treated as potential single-antenna eavesdroppers. The DFRC BS scans a sector with a sequence of dedicated beams, and the ISAC system takes a snapshot of the environment during the transmission of each beam. Based on the sensing information, the DFRC BS can acquire the channel state information (CSI) of the potential eavesdroppers. Different from existing works that focused on the resource allocation design for a single snapshot, in this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework that jointly optimizes the communication and sensing resources over a sequence of snapshots with adjustable durations. Besides, artificial noise (AN) is exploited by the BS for joint sensing and physical layer security provisioning. To this end, we jointly optimize the duration of each snapshot, the beamforming vector, and the covariance matrix of the AN for maximization of the system sum secrecy rate over a sequence of snapshots while guaranteeing a minimum required average achievable rate and a maximum information leakage constraint for each legitimate user. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem, where we account for the imperfect CSI of both the legitimate users and the potential eavesdroppers. To make the problem tractable, we derive a bound for the uncertainty region of the potential eavesdroppers’ small-scale fading based on a safe approximation, which facilitates the development of a block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm for obtaining an efficient suboptimal solution. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the physical layer security of ISAC systems compared to three baseline schemes. Moreover, compared to the conventional multi-stage approach for ISAC system design, the proposed approach based on variable-length snapshots not only facilitates a highly-directional offline sensing beam design but also allows us to flexibly prioritize communication or sensing depending on the application scenario.}

This paper designs the networked telemetry system, where data is transmitted through the inter-satellite-links (ISL) of the low earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites. Furthermore, the resource allocation problem for the networked telemetry system is decomposed using the block coordinate descent method into the access scheduling and the subchannel-power coordinate allocation subproblems, which are iteratively solved to optimize the resource allocation scheme.

A Fog Node (FN) closer to the network edge may have less powerful computing resources compared to the cloud, but the processing of computational tasks in FN limits long-distance transmission. How should the tasks be distributed between fog and cloud nodes? We formulate a universal non-convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem minimizing task transmission- and processing-related energy with delay constraints to answer this question. It is transformed with Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and decomposed using the primal and dual decomposition techniques. Two practical algorithms called Energy-EFFicient Resource Allocation (EEFFRA) and Low-Complexity (LC)-EEFFRA are proposed and their effectiveness is tested for various network and traffic scenarios. Using EEFFRA/LC-EEFFRA can significantly decrease the number of computational requests with unmet delay requirements when compared with baseline solutions (from 48% to 24% for 10 MB requests). Utilizing Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) minimizes energy consumption (by one-third) while satisfying delay requirements.}

In the context of underwater sensor networks (USNs), VLC is particularly suitable to establish connectivity between “data mule” autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and sensor nodes since communications is enabled only when the sensor node and mule AUV are in close proximity. In this paper, we consider a USN scenario where a solar-powered AUV gathers data from the sensor nodes using VLC signaling. We formulate a three-dimensional trajectory optimization for solar-powered AUVs with the goal of maximizing the harvested energy under constraints imposed by the data transmission. The optimization constraints include the minimum required data transfer rate, therefore a corresponding transmission distance, between the sensors and the AUV. We formulate the problem as a bilevel optimization problem. The lower-level objective function is in the form of traveling salesman problem which determines the optimum sequence order of the sensor nodes to be visited while the upper-level objective function is the optimization of the trajectory between each pair of adjacent nodes for the given order of node visits. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed trajectory significantly prolongs the mission time and autonomous operation of the AUV without the need to return to home base. Furthermore, since the proposed trajectory optimization is reactive to ocean currents, it brings reductions in the energy consumption of the AUVs.}

	abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of improving compatibility in the tag-based Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) without sacrificing robustness of the PLA schemes. The prior PLA schemes for improving compatibility often sacrifice robustness or introduce extra communication overhead and security vulnerabilities. The main objective of our approach is to reduce the modification ratio of the source message given the tag length via an encoding approach. Based on a tag-encoding function, we propose two encoded tag-based schemes for the scenario of a single block and the scenario of multiple blocks, respectively, which are named as the Encoded Tag-based PLA scheme for Single Block (ET-SB) and the Encoded Tag-based PLA scheme for Multiple Blocks (ET-MB), respectively. We theoretically analyze the performance of the proposed schemes over fading channels and derive the closed-form expressions of the performance analyses. We implement the proposed schemes and conduct extensive performance comparisons through simulations. Our simulation results show that the closed-form expressions of the theoretical results of the proposed schemes perfectly match the corresponding simulation results. When the SNR is 10 dB, the compatibility of the ET-SB and ET-MB schemes improves to 15.63% and 23.45%, respectively, compared to the prior scheme.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security enhancement by combining intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and energy harvesting (EH) jammer for the uplink transmission. Specifically, we propose an IRS-aided secure scheme for the uplink transmission via an EH jammer, to fight against the malicious eavesdropper. The proposed scheme can be divided into an energy transfer (ET) phase and an information transmission (IT) phase. In the first phase, the friendly EH jammer harvests energy from the base station (BS) aided by IRS. We maximize the harvested energy of jammer by obtaining the closed-form solution to the phase-shift matrix of IRS. In the second phase, the user transmits confidential information to the BS while the jamming is generated to confuse the eavesdropper without affecting the legitimate transmission. The phase-shift matrix of IRS and time switching factor are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate. To tackle the non-convex problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems. The one of IRS can be approximated to convex with fixed time switching factor. Then, the time switching factor can be solved by Lagrange duality. Thus, the solution to the original problem can be obtained by alternately optimizing these two sub-problems. Simulation results show that the proposed Jammer-IRS assisted secure transmission scheme can significantly enhance the uplink security.}

We specifically address the JCAS challenges stemming from the full-duplex operation in monostatic orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radars and from the co-existence of multiple simultaneous beams for communications and sensing purposes. To this end, we first formulate and solve beamforming optimization problems for hybrid beamforming based multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output JCAS systems. The cost function to be maximized is the beamformed power at the sensing direction while constraining the beamformed power at the communications directions, suppressing interuser interference and cancelling full-duplexing related self-interference (SI). We then also propose new transmitter and receiver beamforming solutions for purely analog beamforming based JCAS systems that maximize the beamforming gain at the sensing direction while controlling the beamformed power at the communications direction(s), cancelling the SI as well as eliminating the potential reflection from the communication direction and optimizing the combined radar pattern (CRP). Both closed-form and numerical optimization based formulations are provided. We analyze and evaluate the performance through extensive numerical experiments, and show that substantial gains and benefits in terms of radar transmit gain, CRP, and SI suppression can be achieved with the proposed beamforming methods.}

	abstract = {Besides improving communication performance, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are also promising enablers for achieving larger sensing coverage and enhanced sensing quality. Nevertheless, in the absence of a direct path between the base station (BS) and the targets, multi-target sensing is generally very difficult, since IRSs are incapable of proactively transmitting sensing beams or analyzing target information. Moreover, the echoes of different targets reflected via the IRS-assisted virtual links arrive at the BS from the same direction. In this paper, we study a wireless system comprising a multi-antenna BS and an IRS for multi-target sensing, where the beamforming vector and the IRS phase shifts are jointly optimized to improve the sensing performance. To meet the different sensing requirements, such as a minimum received power and a minimum sensing frequency, we propose three novel IRS-assisted sensing schemes: Time division (TD) sensing, signature sequence (SS) sensing, and hybrid TD-SS sensing. For TD sensing, the sensing tasks are performed in sequence over time. In contrast, the novel SS sensing scheme senses all targets simultaneously and establishes a relationship between the target directions and SSs. To strike a flexible balance between the beam pattern gain and sensing efficiency, we also propose a general hybrid TD-SS sensing scheme with target grouping, where targets belonging to the same group are sensed simultaneously via SS sensing, while the targets in different groups are assigned to orthogonal time slots. By controlling the number of groups, hybrid TD-SS sensing can provide a more flexible balance between beam pattern gain and sensing frequency. Moreover, we propose a two-layer penalty-based algorithm to solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem for the joint design of the BS beamformers, IRS phase shifts, and target grouping. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid scheme in achieving a flexible trade-off between beam pattern gain and sensing frequency. Our results also reveal that the power leakage in unintended directions is larger for tighter interference constraints.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a recent yet revolutionary development in communications systems. Particularly applicable to millileter wave (mmWave) systems, these surfaces can increase localization performance and decrease vulnerability to environmental influences, all by adjusting the incoming signals’ phase. At the same time, manufacturing ideal hardware to be deployed at the transceivers is not feasible nor practical. These non-linearities in hardware, collectively known as hardware impairments (HWIs), cause signal degradation and adversely affect localization. In this paper, the effect of HWIs on RIS-aided localization is examined. Towards that, the mean squared error (MSE) of the user’s position is found through a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and its functionality is verified by the position error bounds (PEB), derived from Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Our numerical results show that active RISs mitigate the deteriorating effect of HWIs on the user’s PEB. Based on our outcome, increasing the inter-RISs space generally creates more resolvable paths and leads to improved localization.}

The multi-antenna EH base station (BS) is equipped with a limited-capacity battery. Though employing the multi-antenna at the BS provides the channel diversity, this leads to the co-channel interference which makes the resource allocation problem hard to solve. For this challenging scenario, we first consider off-line policies based on full channel state information (CSI) and energy arrival information (EAI) to obtain the best performance for any feasible resource allocation policies. We propose an iterative algorithm using generalized linear fractional programming to obtain an optimal policy. To achieve a low-complexity sub-optimal policy, we propose another iterative algorithm using the successive convex approximation. Based on the off-line policies, we develop on-line policies in which only statistical CSI and EAI are available. The complexity of the proposed policies is derived. Finally, simulation results evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches and show that the proposed polices outperform the benchmark.}

In this paper, we investigate a novel dual-functional full-duplex relay aided radar-communication system where the phased-array radar is employed at the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. A joint transceiver design is proposed to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all detection directions at the radar receiver under communication quality-of-service and total energy constraints. The formulated optimization problem is particularly challenging due to the highly nonconvex objective function and constraints. Based on the problem structure, we equivalently decompose it into the radar-energy and relay-energy minimization problems under SINR requirements. To solve the radar-energy minimization problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the radar transmit power and receiver. The relay-energy minimization problem can be simplified into an equivalent quadratic programming problem by introducing an insightful unitary matrix. Then, the closed-form expression for the AF relay beamforming matrix can be derived, which is jointly determined by the channel condition of relay communication and the detection direction of the radar. After that, we introduce the overall transceiver design algorithm to the original problem and discuss its optimality and computational complexity. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms.}

In this paper, we leverage non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to support more users for the ISAC network, with the precoding well designed to guarantee the security. Specifically, we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem to maximize the sum secrecy rate for multiple users via artificial jamming, where the superimposed signal for NOMA users can be concurrently employed for the target detection. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is transformed into a convex one based on successive convex approximation (SCA), where the Taylor’s approximation and second-order cone (SOC) constraint are further applied.

The proposed receiver exploits the inherent channel sparsity and the channel-agnostic structure of matrices involved in the LMMSE receiver, and has only a log-linear complexity. It provides exactly the same solution, and hence the same bit error rate (BER), as that of the conventional LMMSE receiver with a cubic order of complexity. We also derive, by using the Taylor series expansion and the results from random matrix theory, a tight closed-form approximation for the post-processing signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) expression of the proposed receiver. This expression is derived by assuming imperfect receive channel state information.

Thus, this study proposes a frequency hopping-aided FMCW-based RadCom system along with the corresponding radar detection and communication signal demodulation approaches. The proposed system can significantly improve the transmission rate with slight radar performance degradation. In addition, both the radar and communication subsystems of the proposed RadCom system are analyzed. Consequently, a symbol interleaving approach that can mitigate radar performance degradation is proposed. Furthermore, the interference is shown to not degrade the radar performance significantly because of frequency hopping. However, to address the issue of the interference significantly degrading communication performance, interference avoidance and mitigation approaches using scheduling and interference rejection combining, respectively, are proposed. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed RadCom system. The results validate the analysis and demonstrate that the proposed RadCom system can provide radar detection performance that is almost identical to conventional FMCW radar with a high transmission rate. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed interleaving and interference management methods.}

	abstract = {A novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided hybrid reflection/transmitter design is proposed for achieving information exchange in cross-media communications. In pursuit of the balance between energy efficiency and low-cost implementations, the cloud-management transmission protocol is adopted in the integrated multi-media system. Specifically, the messages of devices using heterogeneous propagation media, are firstly transmitted to the medium-matched AP, with the aid of the RIS-based dual-hop transmission. After the operation of intermediate frequency conversion, the access point (AP) uploads the received signals to the cloud for further demodulating and decoding process. Based on time division multiple access (TDMA), the cloud is able to distinguish the downlink data transmitted to different devices and transforms them into the input of the RIS controller via the dedicated control channel. Thereby, the RIS can passively reflect the incident carrier back into the original receiver with the exchanged information during the preallocated slots, following the idea of an index modulation-based transmitter. Moreover, the iterative optimization algorithm is utilized for optimizing the RIS phase, transmit rate and time allocation jointly in the delay-constrained cross-media communication model. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-based scheme can improve the end-to-end throughput than that of the AP-based transmission, the equal time allocation, the random and the discrete phase adjustment benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Combining non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could achieve better performance for wireless networks. However, effective resource allocation for quality of service (QoS) provision among all users still remains as a great challenge for multi-cluster NOMA-UAV networks. In this paper, we propose a NOMA-UAV scheme, where a UAV is deployed as the mobile base station to serve ground users. To meet the QoS requirements of all users with limited resource, the user clustering and optimal routing are first developed by the K-means algorithm and genetic algorithm, respectively. Then, the sum throughput is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmission power, hovering locations and transmission duration of UAV. To solve this non-convex problem with coupled variables, we decompose it into three subproblems. Among them, the power and location optimizations are also non-convex, which can be transformed into convex ones by successive convex approximation. The duration optimization is a linear programming which can be solved directly. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve these three subproblems alternately. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}
