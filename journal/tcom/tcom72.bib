	abstract = {A locally repairable code is called Singleton-optimal if it achieves the Singleton-type bound. Such codes are of great theoretic interest in the study of locally repairable codes. One of the major problems in this topic is to determine the maximum length of a\nq\n-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable code with fixed locality and minimum distance. Unlike classical MDS codes, the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes is very sensitive to the minimum distance and locality. Thus, determining the maximum length of the Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes is more challenging and complicated. In literature, many efforts are paid to solve this problem especially for small distance and locality regime. Moreover, most of works also requires that\n(r+1)|n\nand the recovery sets are disjoint so as to simplify the argument, where\nr\nis locality and\nn\nis the code length. In this paper, we derive some upper bounds on the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes with minimum distance\n5,6\nand 7 without the constraint that\n(r+1)|n\nand the recovery sets are disjoint.It turns out that even without this constraint we still obtain better upper bounds for codes with small locality and distance compared to known results. Furthermore, based on our upper bounds for codes with small distance and locality, we propose the propagation rule to derive some upper bounds for codes with relatively large distance and locality assuming that\n(r+1)|n\nand recovery sets are disjoint.}

	abstract = {Anytime code is a new class of error-correcting code that has very long coding memory and is decodable with flexible decoding window size (decoding delay). It is designed for real-time reliable applications, such as tracking and controlling unstable systems. In this paper, we construct a family of rate-compatible (RC) Anytime code ensembles with code rate from 0 to 1 based on spatially coupled repeat-accumulate (SC-RA) codes and apply them to the automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) communication with incremental redundancy. Using density evolution (DE) analysis, we prove that each element code within the RC family has superior Anytime-reliable properties over the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. In addition, we develop an expanding-window IR-HARQ (incremental redundancy hybrid automatic-repeat-request) scheme for the proposed RC Anytime codes. Simulation results testify that our proposed RC Anytime codes have better decoding performance than the prior-art RC Anytime codes. Furthermore, when combined with the proposed expanding-window IR-HARQ scheme, our proposed RC Anytime codes show significant advantages over the conventional RC low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and RC polar codes in the conventional CRC-based IR-HARQ communication systems.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new joint source-channel coding (JSCC) for short-packet communications, especially for the uplink from the sensor to the base station. At the transmitter, the sensing information is first encoded by a two-stage description, referred to as classified enumerative (CE) coding, and then encoded by a random multiple-rate code. The two-stage CE coding describes a binary sequence by its type class indicator and its rank in the associated type class, which can approach the entropy for biased sources. The random multiple rate coding transforms the variable-length output of the CE coding into a fixed-length channel input, allocating lower energy to lower-rate component codes. At the receiver, the sensing information can be recovered by a trial-and-error (for type classes) decoding either serially or parallelly. The serial decoding has a low implementation complexity, while the parallel decoding has a low decoding delay. To alleviate the mis-correction probability and stop the decoding earlier, we turn to the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) coding. To predict the performance of the proposed JSCC scheme, we present the weighted random-coding union (RCU) bounds based on the conventional RCU bound. The proposed JSCC scheme is universal in the sense that it does not require knowledge of source statistics. Simulation results show that the performance matches well with the presented bounds, validating our analysis. Simulation results also show that the proposed JSCC scheme can outperform the double polar JSCC scheme (exhibiting a coding gain of up to 0.3 dB) and can approach the JSCC bounds (exhibiting a gap of less than 0.5 dB).}

These constructions show that the theoretic bound on the repair bandwidth of the partially cooperative repair model is tight for the minimum storage cases. Notably, these codes with optimal repair bandwidth may have smaller sub-packetization compared with the known codes for this model.}

Error correction codes have been proposed to alleviate this problem at the cost of coding complexity for the master node. In this work, we aim to reduce this coding complexity and propose a novel family of binary locally repairable codes (BLRC) to encode the distributed tasks in a linear matrix-vector multiplication problem. In comparison to the widely used maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, our proposed codes (i) eliminate the costly multiplication operations from the encoding and decoding processes, (ii) allow for low-complexity recovery within the local groups. We analyze the complexity of our proposed codes and through simulations show that compared to MDS codes, our codes reduce the overall encoding plus computation plus decoding time by more than 35% in many practical scenarios.}

This paper designs CRC polynomials for rate-\n(n−1)/n\nZT and TB CCs with short blocklengths. This paper considers both standard rate-\n(n−1)/n\nCC polynomials and rate-\n(n−1)/n\ndesigns resulting from puncturing a rate-\n1/2\ncode. The CRC polynomials are chosen to maximize the minimum distance\nd\nmin\nand minimize the number of nearest neighbors\nA\nd\nmin\n. For the standard rate-\n(n−1)/n\ncodes, utilization of the dual trellis proposed by Yamada et al. lowers the complexity of CRC-aided serial list Viterbi decoding (SLVD). CRC-aided SLVD of the TBCCs closely approaches the RCU bound at a blocklength of 128. This paper compares the FER performance (gap to the RCU bound) and complexity of the CRC-aided standard and punctured ZTCCs and TBCCs. This paper also explores the complexity-performance trade-off for three TBCC decoders: a single-trellis approach, a multi-trellis approach, and a modified single-trellis approach with pre-processing using the wrap around Viterbi algorithm.}

We also obtained kernels which admit low complexity processing by the recently proposed recursive trellis algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of polar codes with the obtained kernels compared with shortened polar codes and polar codes with small kernels.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a deterministic sampling decoding strategy for multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems is studied, which performs probabilistic searching according to a probability threshold in the lattice Gaussian distribution. Motivated by model probabilistic twin (MPT), the randomness in obtaining the target decoding solution is overcome by the proposed probabilistic searching decoding (PSD) algorithm, which brings considerable decoding gains in both performance and complexity. Specifically, the decoding radius of PSD is derived while the decoding complexity in terms of the number of visited nodes during the searching is also upper bounded, leading to an explicit decoding trade-off. Meanwhile, we generalize PSD by the mechanism of candidate protection so that it enjoys a flexible performance between the suboptimal successive interference cancelation (SIC) decoding and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoding by adjusting the initial search size K\n. Methods for further optimization and complexity reduction of the proposed PSD algorithm are also given. Finally, simulation results based on MIMO detection are presented to confirm the tractable and flexible decoding trade-off of the proposed PSD algorithm.}

We consider a system where these two nodes are connected through an error-prone timeslotted channel, and a relay node is also present to assist the transmission. We consider both the sensor and the relay as intermittently and independently active nodes, whose activity rate may be adjusted, resulting in different levels of freshness and corresponding energy costs. To this end, the activity pattern can either follow a Bernoulli random process or a periodic duty cycle with adjustable duration. After computing the expected AoI and the complete Peak Age of Information (PAoI) distribution for both cases, we consider a fully distributed game theoretic duty cycle optimization, in which the two nodes independently tune their own activity rate, finding a balance between freshness and cost. The equilibrium of the resulting game is found to be both efficient from the perspective of the resulting performance and computationally lightweight for a distributed robust control implementation.}

	abstract = {In a recent paper it has been shown that to model a diffusive molecular communication (MC) channel with multiple fully absorbing (FA) receivers, these can be interpreted as sources of negative particles from the other receivers’ perspective. The barycenter point is introduced as the best position where to place the negative sources. The barycenter is obtained from the spatial mean of the molecules impinging on the surface of each FA receiver. This paper derives an expression that captures the position of the barycenter in a diffusive MC channel with multiple FA receivers. In this work, a heuristic model inspired by Newton’s law of gravitation is found to describe the barycenter, and the result is compared with particle-based simulation (PBS) data. Since the barycenter depends on the distance between the transmitter and receiver and the observation time, the condition that the barycenter can be assumed to be at the center of the receiver is discussed. This assumption simplifies further modeling of any diffusive MC system containing multiple FA receivers. The resulting position of the barycenter is used in channel models to calculate the cumulative number of absorbed molecules and it has been verified with PBS.}

While it is crucial to explore effective ways to exploit pilots, one can also take advantage of the data symbols to improve detection performance. Thus, this paper introduces an online attention-based approach, namely RC-AttStructNet-DF, that can efficiently utilize pilot symbols and be dynamically updated with the detected payload data using the decision feedback (DF) mechanism. Reservoir computing (RC) is employed in the time domain network to facilitate efficient online training. The frequency domain network adopts the novel 2D multi-head attention (MHA) module to capture the time and frequency correlations, and the structural-based StructNet to facilitate the DF mechanism. The attention loss is designed to learn the frequency domain network. The DF mechanism further enhances detection performance by dynamically tracking the channel changes through detected data symbols. The effectiveness of the RC-AttStructNet-DF approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments in MIMO-OFDM and massive MIMO-OFDM systems with different modulation orders and under various scenarios.}

A major challenge against the scalability of current approaches is their communication overhead, which is quadratic in the number of users. Towards addressing this challenge, we present SCALR, a communication-efficient collaborative learning framework for training logistic regression models. To do so, we introduce a novel coded computing mechanism, by decoupling the communication-intensive encoding operations from real-time training, and offloading the former to a data-independent offline phase, where the communicated variables are independent from training data. As such, the offline phase can be executed proactively during periods of low network activity. Communication complexity of the data-dependent (online) training operations is only linear in the number of users, greatly reducing the quadratic state-of-the-art. Our theoretical analysis presents the information-theoretic privacy guarantees, and shows that SCALR achieves the same performance guarantees as the state-of-the-art, in terms of adversary resilience, robustness to user dropouts, and model convergence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate up to 80\\times reduction in online communication overhead, and 6\\times speed-up in the wall-clock training time compared to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {In federated learning (FL), distributed clients can collaboratively train a shared global model while retaining their own training data locally. Nevertheless, the performance of FL is often limited by the slow convergence because of poor communications links when FL is deployed over wireless networks. Due to the scarceness of radio resources, it is crucial to select appropriate clients and allocate communication resource accurately for enhancing FL performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, a joint optimization problem of client selection and resource allocation is formulated, aiming to minimize the total time consumption of each round in FL over a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled wireless network. Specifically, considering the staleness of local FL models, we propose an age of update (AoU) based novel client selection scheme. Subsequently, the closed-form expressions for resource allocation are derived by monotonicity analysis and dual decomposition method. In addition, a server-side artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to predict the FL models of clients who are not selected at each round to further improve FL performance. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed schemes over FL performance, average AoU and total time consumption.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) is envisioned as a promising technique to break through the Shannon limit. However, semantic inference and semantic error correction have not been well studied. Moreover, error correction methods of existing SemCom frameworks are inexplicable and inflexible, which limits the achievable performance. In this paper, to tackle this issue, a knowledge graph (KG) is exploited to develop SemCom systems. Two cognitive semantic communication frameworks are proposed for the single-user and multiple-user communication scenarios. Moreover, a simple, general, and interpretable semantic alignment algorithm for semantic information detection is proposed. Furthermore, an effective semantic correction algorithm is proposed by mining the inference rule from the KG. Additionally, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to recover semantic information. For the multi-user cognitive SemCom system, a message recovery algorithm is proposed to distinguish the messages of different users by matching the knowledge level and the context at the destination. Extensive simulation results conducted on a public dataset demonstrate that our proposed single-user and multi-user cognitive SemCom systems are superior to benchmark communication systems in terms of the data compression rate and communication reliability. Finally, we present realistic single-user and multi-user cognitive SemCom systems results by building a software-defined radio prototype system.}

	abstract = {With the widespread application of 5G technology in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), dividing nodes into different network slices according to delay tolerance requirements can facilitate reasonable resource allocation and guarantee quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we investigate the network slice resource allocation algorithm with delay tolerance based on traffic prediction. A traffic prediction algorithm is proposed combining convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention mechanism and bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) to obtain the spatiotemporal features. Based on the predicted traffic, the problem of minimizing the usage of physical resource blocks (PRBs) is studied, and a two-layer structure resource allocation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Specifically, Dueling Double DQN (D3QN) is used to allocate PRBs between slices, and a heuristic algorithm is used to allocate PRBs among nodes in the slice. Furthermore, we consider the joint optimization problem of PRBs and power. In light of the coupling between PRBs and power aggravates the high dimension of the action space, we propose a resource allocation algorithm which using the branch structure to decoupling the action space. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can satisfy the QoS and outperform the baseline algorithms.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating channel in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. We propose two variational expectation maximization (VEM) based channel estimation algorithms, which exploit the angular domain sparsity of RIS-assisted mmWave channel. To fully capture this sparsity, both within and across UEs, we construct a novel column-wise coupled Gaussian prior. The first proposed structured-mean-field-based VEM (SMF-VEM) algorithm uses the proposed prior, and calculates the posterior distribution of the unknown channel by assuming that it belongs to a set of multivariate distributions. This algorithm inverts a high-dimensional matrix in its posterior update, and consequently does not scale well for a large number of RIS elements and base station antennas, which are commonly used in practical systems. The second proposed fast mean field-based VEM (FMF-VEM) algorithm reduces complexity by assuming a fully-factorized posterior. It also bounds the variational objective to remove the residue coupling between the channel and phase matrices. Using extensive numerical investigations for a practical RIS mmWave system, and by using multiple metrics, we show that the proposed i) SMF- and FMF-VEM algorithms outperform several of their state-of-the-art counterparts; and ii) FMF-VEM has a much lower time complexity than SMF-VEM.}

The UEs are assumed to be mobile, and their channels consequently age. The channels are spatially-correlated and Rician faded, with a phase-shifted line-of-sight (LoS) component, and the BS employs maximum ratio (MR) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) precoders. A closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression is derived for the MR precoder, which is then used to develop a novel low-complexity optimal power allocation algorithm for the BS to maximize the global energy efficiency (GEE) metric. For the MMSE precoder, whose closed-form SE expression is difficult to derive, an iterative stochastic optimization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm, which is designed to have closed-form power update expressions, converges faster to the optimal solution than a conventional technique, which numerically calculates the SE. These low-complexity practically-implementable algorithms are developed by applying the epigraph, Lagrangian dual and quadratic transformations. We numerically show that RSMA outperforms spatial division multiple access when channels age faster, have a low Rician factor, and have a low correlation.}

Moreover, unlike available literature, the analysis considers that the RIS reflection constraints are not enforced separately on each reflecting element, but the RIS is characterized by a single reflection constraint that is jointly enforced on all the reflecting elements. This allows for a wider set of feasible RIS reflection matrices, which leads to better performance, which is theoretically analyzed. Then, two provably convergent energy efficiency maximization algorithms with polynomial complexity are developed, which optimize the reflection coefficients of the RIS, the mobile users’ transmit powers, and the linear filters at the base station. Numerical results are illustrated to quantify the performance of the proposed methods and identify the operating points in which active or nearly-passive RISs should be preferred from the energy efficiency standpoint.}

	abstract = {A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework for finite blocklength (FBL) transmission is proposed. Considering the different communication requirements of Internet of Things devices (IoTDs), a novel design to achieve high-rate and low-error is proposed. Two operating protocols for STAR-RIS are considered, namely energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS). 1) For STAR-RIS with ES, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to handle the highly-coupled mixed integer programming problem. More particularly, a low-complexity received-signal-strength-based device pairing scheme is proposed. Based on the given device pair, the closed-form solutions for the power allocation problem are obtained. The transmitting and reflecting coefficient optimization problem is solved by exploiting the successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation methods. 2) For STAR-RIS with MS, a double-layer penalty-based (DLPB) algorithm is proposed to tackle the newly introduced binary amplitude constraints. Numerical results reveal that: i) the proposed AO and DLPB algorithms can converge within a few iteration times; ii) the FBL transmission performance can be improved by employing the proposed STAR-RIS framework compared with conventional transmitting/reflecting-only RISs; iii) NOMA is capable of enhancing FBL rate while guaranteeing the reliability constraints compared with orthogonal multiple access.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a wireless network enabled by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which observe physical processes and transmit status updates to a monitor node over an error-prone communication channel. The communication scenarios are classified into two modes based on monitor types: UAV-to-UAV (U2U) and UAV-to-network (U2N) scenarios. Specifically, the U2N scenario is capable of covering a larger area compared to U2U scenario with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the U2U scenario constructs communication links more quickly, resulting in lower latency and higher rates. To evaluate the timeliness of the UAV-aided network, we utilize the age of information (AoI) as a fundamental indicator. AoI measures the time delay between the most recent data generation and the current moment. To compensate for the error-prone channel, this study employs a combination of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocols, which include fixed-redundancy HARQ (FR-HARQ) and infinite incremental redundancy HARQ (IIR-HARQ) protocols. Furthermore, the average and peak Age of Information (AAoI and PAoI) of UAV-aided networks are derived for both U2U and U2N scenarios, and the theoretical expressions agree with simulation results. Additionally, FR-HARQ performs a better time performance than IIR-HARQ, and such observation van be verified through simulations.}

We propose a novel optimization framework for path planning, based on dynamic programming. We develop an optimum backward-forward algorithm that jointly optimizes the hovering locations for each ground node, and the visiting order to those locations. Our algorithm minimizes the total energy consumption of the UAV over its trajectory. Our framework is compatible with various probabilistic wireless communication channel models, and can also be applied to different cost functions, including minimising the total flying time, and allowing for bi-directional communications. We also develop a lower complexity algorithm that approximates the optimum UAV trajectory by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems, and iterating back and forth between the two. This alternating algorithm has polynomial time complexity, and we show that it produces a near-optimum UAV trajectory, with as little deviation as 5% to 15% from the average energy consumption of the optimum algorithm.}

	abstract = {The utilization of Multi-path TCP (MPTCP) has been demonstrated to provide superior transport-layer support for data center networks (DCNs) due to its exceptional resource utilization and load-balancing capabilities. However, the substantial path diversity can make it challenging to utilize network resources to their full potential in DCNs. This paper focuses on studying the resource allocation issue of MPTCP from a resource optimization perspective. Based on theoretical analysis, we propose FMPTCP, which uses a feedback-based congestion control algorithm (FCC) and a feedback-based multi-path routing algorithm (FMP) to jointly achieve high bandwidth utilization and low round-trip time (RTT) in DCNs. The FCC algorithm utilizes probabilistic explicit congestion notification (ECN) to provide feedback on path congestion degree, and uses a gradient descent method to adjust the congestion window for optimal resource utilization and load balancing under a fixed routing topology. On the other hand, the FMP algorithm employs a hop-by-hop feedback mechanism to notify in-network congestion and path delay information, allowing for transparent multi-path routing for MPTCP flows. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that FMPTCP enables effective network resource utilization, which not only enhances overall throughput but also reduces transmission latency for DCNs.}

It is urgent for Video Streaming Service Providers (VSSPs) to guarantee the Quality of Experience (QoE) via the sliced resources from Network Service Providers (NSPs). In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-cache pricing-based network slicing approach for video streaming delivery. Specifically, the NSP slices the bandwidth and caching space jointly, and then reorganizes these resources flexibly to various VSSPs to maximize the QoE of all users. We design a bandwidth-cache pricing policy to solve the slicing problem, in which there is a trade-off between the bandwidth-cache resources in terms of QoE. We first quantitatively analyze the QoE for various resource bundles by adopting the diffusion approximation. Based on the derived QoE, we propose the heterogeneous auction, a framework for bandwidth-cache slicing with dynamic ascending prices. Specifically, the auction increases the prices of the demanded resource bundles submitted by active bidders. Later, we prove that optimal social surplus and incentive compatible can be realized. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed auction achieves better performance than conventional homogeneous auctions.}

However, the traditional terrestrial networks are confronted with the high-cost and inflexible challenges especially in the remote area and emergency applications. In order to solve these challenges, we consider a heterogeneous aerial network (HetAN), where some low-altitude base stations (LBSs) are deployed as access points for wireless coverage and a high-altitude base station (HBS) hovers as the hub for backhaul of LBSs. Furthermore, we apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to uplink transmission for the terrestrial users, which enable massive connectivity in the IoE. To maximize connectivity and throughput, we jointly optimize the LBSs’ deployment, power control, channel allocation, and rate control by fully exploiting the potential of the HetAN in wide-area coverage. For solving the formulated problem efficiently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the methods of graph theory, bionic algorithm, and theoretical analysis. Simulation results are provided to reveal the influence of the control variables on network performance and indicate that our algorithm can greatly improve the connectivity and throughput with the other schemes.}

	abstract = {Clock recovery and channel parameter estimation are essential functions for reliable communications over a free-space optical (FSO) link. Thanks to its large bandwidth, FSO ensures high-speed transmissions with data rates similar to those enabled by optical fiber links. In such a case, synchronization procedures that operate at symbol rate are highly desirable, since signal oversampling would require expensive and power consuming analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this work we investigate the problem of bit synchronization and channel estimation in an FSO link that employs on-off keying (OOK) signaling and is plagued by a mixture of thermal noise, shot noise and background radiation. In doing so we resort to the least-square (LS) estimation principle and look for some feedforward solution that can operate in a non-data-aided (NDA) fashion using symbol-spaced samples. Since the true LS estimator leads to a computationally intractable multi-dimensional optimization problem, we develop suitable approximations that can be implemented with affordable complexity. The accuracy of the proposed schemes is assessed through computer simulations and compared with the relevant modified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB). Thanks to their ability to operate at symbol rate, they represent a promising solution for blind synchronization in high-speed FSO communications.}

	abstract = {To achieve the maximum information transfer and face a possible eavesdropper, the samples transmitted in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols are to be drawn from a continuous Gaussian distribution. As a matter of fact, in practical implementations the transmitter has a finite (power) dynamics and the Gaussian sampling can be only approximated. This requires the quantum protocols to operate at small powers. In this paper, we show that a suitable probabilistic amplitude shaping of a finite set of symbols allows to approximate at will the optimal channel capacity also for increasing average powers. We investigate the feasibility of this approach in the framework of CV-QKD, propose a protocol employing discrete quadrature amplitude modulation assisted with probabilistic amplitude shaping, and we perform the key generation rate analysis assuming a wiretap channel and lossless homodyne detection.}

	abstract = {As the array dimension of massive MIMO systems increases to unprecedented levels, two problems occur. First, the spatial stationarity assumption along the antenna elements is no longer valid. Second, the large array size results in an unacceptably high power consumption if high-resolution analog-to-digital converters are used. To address these two challenges, we consider a Bussgang linear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE)-based channel estimator for large scale massive MIMO systems with one-bit quantizers and a spatially non-stationary channel. Whereas other works usually assume that the channel covariance is known at the base station, we consider a plug-in BLMMSE estimator that uses an estimate of the channel covariance and rigorously analyze the distortion produced by using an estimated, rather than the true, covariance. To cope with the spatial non-stationarity, we introduce dithering into the quantized signals and provide a theoretical error analysis. In addition, we propose an angular domain fitting procedure which is based on solving an instance of non-negative least squares. For the multi-user data transmission phase, we further propose a BLMMSE-based receiver to handle one-bit quantized data signals. Our numerical results show that the performance of the proposed BLMMSE channel estimator is very close to the oracle-aided scheme with ideal knowledge of the channel covariance matrix. The BLMMSE receiver outperforms the conventional maximum-ratio-combining and zero-forcing receivers in terms of the resulting ergodic sum rate.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman Filter (KF)-based uplink (UL) joint communication and sensing (JCAS) scheme, which can significantly reduce the range and location estimation errors due to the clock asynchronism between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). Clock asynchronism causes time-varying time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO), leading to major challenges in uplink sensing. Unlike existing technologies, our scheme does not require knowing the location of the UE in advance, and retains the linearity of the sensing parameter estimation problem. We first estimate the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) of multipaths and use them to spatially filter the CSI. Then, we propose a KF-based CSI enhancer that exploits the estimation of Doppler with CFO as the prior information to significantly suppress the time-varying noise-like TO terms in spatially filtered CSIs. Subsequently, we can estimate the accurate ranges of UE and the scatterers based on the KF-enhanced CSI. Finally, we identify the UE’s AoA and range estimation and locate UE, then locate the dumb scatterers using the bi-static system. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme. The localization root mean square error of the proposed method is about 20 dB lower than the benchmarking scheme.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a game-changing technology to improve wireless network performance by intelligently manipulating and customizing the physical propagation environment. Such capability is especially important for the application of smart cities as it increases wireless service offers and quality to end-users. In this paper, we aim to maximize the number of served users in a challenging RIS-aided smart city street by jointly optimizing the multislot scheduling, precoding, and passive RIS-based beamforming design under quality of service and power constraints. Multislot scheduling is introduced in order to benefit from additional time diversity and thus better exploit the available degrees of freedom. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming, which is NP-hard. To solve the problem with affordable complexity, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on binary variable relaxation, alternating optimization, and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over the design without RIS and the design without scheduling, especially in the presence of a large number of users. In addition, results illustrate that by introducing a quality of service margin, the proposed design can improve its robustness to outdated channel state information in mobility scenarios.}

	abstract = {Current backscatter channel estimators employ an inefficient silent pilot transmission protocol, where tags alternate between silent and active states. To enhance performance, we propose a novel approach where tags remain active simultaneously throughout the entire training phase. This enables a one-shot estimation of both the direct and cascaded channels and accommodates various backscatter network configurations. We derive the conditions for optimal pilot sequences and also establish that the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator attains the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Next, we propose new pilot designs to avoid pilot contamination. We then present several linear estimation methods, including least square (LS), scaled LS, and linear minimum mean square error (MMSE), to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme. We also derive the analytical MMSE estimator using our proposed pilot designs. Furthermore, we adapt our method for cellular-based passive Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks with multiple tags and cellular users. Extensive numerical and simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, at least 10 dBm and 12 dBm power savings compared to the prior art are achieved when estimating the direct and cascaded channels. These findings underscore the practical benefits and superiority of our proposed approach.}

	abstract = {The employment of extremely large antenna arrays and high-frequency signaling makes future 6G wireless communications likely to operate in the near-field region. In this case, the spherical wave assumption which takes into account both the user angle and distance is more accurate than the conventional planar one that is only related to the user angle. Therefore, the conventional planar wave based far-field channel model as well as its associated estimation algorithms need to be reconsidered. Here we first propose a distance-parameterized angular-domain sparse model to represent the near-field channel. In this model, the user distance is included in the dictionary as an unknown parameter, so that the number of dictionary columns depends only on the angular space division. This is different from the existing polar-domain near-field channel model where the dictionary is constructed on an angle-distance two-dimensional (2D) space. Next, using this model, joint dictionary learning and sparse recovery based channel estimation methods are proposed for both line of sight (LoS) and multi-path settings. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms, recovery conditions and computational complexity are studied. Our analysis shows that with the decrease of distance estimation error in the dictionary, the support set of the angular-domain sparse vector can be exactly recovered under certain Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) based conditions. The high storage burden and dictionary coherence issues that arise in the polar-domain 2D representation are also well addressed. Finally, simulations in multi-user communication scenarios support the superiority of the proposed near-field channel sparse representation and estimation over the existing polar-domain method in channel estimation error.}

For a Gaussian signal model, we propose a novel iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based RL decoding method tailored to the attributes of sparse recovery, termed MCMC-RLD-SR. The proposed iterative MCMC-RLD-SR algorithm incorporates two stages, i.e., rough estimation and fine estimation. The rough estimation is a process of figuring out support candidates for the sparse signal via the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling method, which prevents a nonconvergence issue inherent in the CS problem when applying sampling. The fine estimation is a process of acquiring an estimate of the sparse signal through the Gibbs sampling method based on the support candidates from the rough estimation stage. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges by favor of the proposed iterative two-stage sampling structure, and analyze the signal recovery error by the proposed algorithm. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed MCMC-RLD-SR algorithm can effectively solve CS problems with much less computational complexity than conventional CS algorithms. Furthermore, even when the signal is not sparse, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve a reliable signal recovery performance.}

	abstract = {We present a simulation framework for evaluating the performance of cooperative reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) based systems, which may ultimately deploy an arbitrary number of RISs to overcome adverse propagation-related effects, such as cascaded fading. The physical model underlying the proposed framework considers the (optional) presence of a dominant signal path between the source and RIS, and then between each subsequent stage of the communication link to the destination. Accompanying the dominant signal component is a non-isotropic scattered signal contribution, which accounts for angular selectivity within the cascaded RIS stages between the source and destination. The simulation of the time-correlated scattered signal, reflected by the illuminated reflective elements, is achieved using autoregressive modelling. As a by-product of our analysis, significant insights are drawn which enable us to characterize the amplitude and phase properties of the received signal, and the associated complex autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for the product of multiple Rician channels. For both single and cooperative RIS systems, the outage probability (OP), and important second-order statistics, such as the level crossing rate (LCR) and average outage duration (AOD), are analyzed for a variety of system configurations, accounting for practical limitations, such as phase errors. It is shown that by using multiple RISs cooperatively, the AOD is reduced at a lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) compared to single RIS-assisted transmission under the same operating conditions. Lastly, increased channel variations (i.e., higher maximum Doppler frequencies) are shown to decrease the AOD in the case of absent phase errors; yet, this improvement is not observed when phase errors are present.}

ISAC waveform design is critical in ISAC system. However, the difference of the performance metrics between sensing and communication brings challenges for the ISAC waveform design. This paper applies the unified performance metrics in information theory, namely mutual information (MI), to measure the communication and sensing performance in multicarrier ISAC system. In multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) ISAC system, we first derive the sensing and communication MI with subcarrier correlation and spatial correlation. Then, we propose optimal waveform designs for maximizing the sensing MI, communication MI and the weighted sum of sensing and communication MI, respectively. The optimization results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Our work provides effective closed-form expressions for waveform design, enabling the realization of MIMO-OFDM ISAC system with balanced performance in communication and sensing.}

	abstract = {As a symbol-level precoding scheme, constructive interference precoding (CIP) has been demonstrated its superiority in multi-antenna orthogonal multiple access (OMA). By utilizing both the channel state information (CSI) and data symbols, harmful multi-user interference can be converted into useful reception power via the well-designed CIP. When CIP meets non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) whose bottleneck is usually at the weaker user, this paper is the first to propose CIP to enhance the downlink MISO-NOMA networks, by making the desired signal of the stronger user in a typical NOMA pair constructive to the weaker user. In our CIP-NOMA scheme, we properly design the CIP precoder for transmit power minimization at the base station (BS), subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of NOMA users. We further derive its closed-form solutions with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and optimally obtain the desired CIP precoders. Moreover, as compared to conventional NOMA schemes, we theoretically prove that once two NOMA users possess distinct channel gains, our optimized CIP-NOMA scheme always uses lower transmit power to reach the SINR thresholds. To be robust against the channel estimation errors, we extend our CIP-NOMA scheme to the scenario of imperfect CSI, by further addressing the hidden CSI errors. Specifically, we first introduce some auxiliary variables to separate the coupled vectors, and then use S-Procedure and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) to further transform them into convex ones. Extensive simulations verify that our CIP-NOMA scheme greatly outperforms the benchmarks with both perfect and imperfect CSI.}

In this paper, we use stochastic geometry to provide a performance analytical framework for AIRS swarm-assisted mmWave cellular networks, where each base station (BS) has an AIRS swarm to assist downlink communications. To capture the swarm property of AIRSs and the dependence between AIRS swarms and BSs, the AIRSs in each swarm are uniformly and randomly distributed in a finite circular area centered on their assisting BS. Incorporating different LoS/non-LoS propagation characteristics, a two-step user association policy is proposed to pursue an efficient communication link between the BS and its users with the assistance of AIRS swarm. We derive the coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) by considering three types of interference which are directly from interfering BSs, reflected by active AIRSs of other swarms and reflected by the assisting AIRS for the typical user, respectively. The results reveal that AIRS swarms enhance both coverage and ASE performance and have the optimal height and density that maximize the coverage probability in mmWave cellular networks.}

	abstract = {The non-linear distortion caused by non-ideal radio frequency (RF) components especially the power amplifier (PA) limits the applications of higher order modulation and degrades power utilization efficiency. To improve the achievable rate in modern systems, it becomes critical to overcome the non-linear distortion so that we can maximize the opportunity of using higher order modulation such as 256QAM, 1024QAM and even 4096QAM at high transmission power. In this paper, we introduce an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled non-linearity compensation scheme (AI-NC) to avoid the “model deficit” problem. The introduced AI-NC adapts the Echo State Network (ESN) to enable fast online training without additional training overhead. Furthermore, it is general enough to be used for any types of power amplifiers (PAs) with different non-linearity characteristics and different channel environments. It can also be used for the communication system using multiple antennas and supporting multiple users simultaneously. Simulation results and hardware-based tests show that the proposed AI-NC can drastically improve the link performance and/or coverage of higher order modulations in practice.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm for enhancing wireless information transmission (WIT) and wireless power transfer (WPT) cost-effectively in the future. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided full-duplex (FD) wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where a hybrid node (HN) operating in FD mode sends information signals to multiple devices in the downlink (DL), and meanwhile receives energy signals from a power station (PS) in the uplink (UL), both of which are assisted by an IRS. Our objective is to boost the weighted sum throughput by jointly optimizing the active transmit beamformer at the PS and HN, along with the passive reflection coefficients of the IRS. To deal with the formulated non-convex optimization problem with intricately coupled design variables, most of existing works employ the alternating optimization (AO) method, whose performance, however, is closely related to parameter initialization. In contrast, we develop two novel penalty-based algorithms for the single-device and multi-device cases, respectively. In particular, our proposed rank-one constraint reformulation method of matrix proves to be efficient, especially for the case where the objective function is a higher-order function of the IRS phase shifts. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes, and also unveil the necessity of the joint design of passive IRS beamforming and resource allocation for achieving better WPCN performance. Moreover, we draw useful insights into the fine-tuning of IRS deployment location in the studied WPCN.}

	abstract = {With the combination of extra-large arrays and high frequencies, near-field transmissions have become prevalent, challenging the validity of classical channel representations typically derived under the plane wavefront assumption. In this paper, we investigate the angular-domain representation of line-of-sight (LoS) extra-large MIMO (XL-MIMO) channels, considering the impact of spherical wavefront effects. First, we demonstrate the structured sparsity of LoS XL-MIMO channels in the angular domain. Leveraging this sparsity, we propose an effective spatial bandwidth channel representation method, which characterizes near-field LoS XL-MIMO channels as a superposition of multiple plane wave components, enabling us to capture the spherical wavefront effect in a low-dimensional angular channel. Subsequently, we introduce an angular-domain transceiver architecture based on this low-dimensional channel representation. This architecture could significantly facilitate the implementation of LoS XL-MIMO systems. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the effective spatial bandwidth identification method and analyze the impact of various array geometries on the effective spatial bandwidth. Additionally, the availability of the angular-domain processing architecture is validated.}

	abstract = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a promising technology to reconfigure the radio propagation environment in the full space. Prior works on STAR-RISs have mostly considered the energy splitting operation protocol, which has high hardware complexity in practice. Moreover, the full and instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is always assumed available for designing the STAR-RIS nearly passive beamforming, which, however, is practically difficult to obtain due to the large number of STAR-RIS elements. To address these issues, we study the mode switching design in STAR-RIS aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication systems. Moreover, two efficient two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocols are proposed for different channel setups to maximize the respective average achievable sum-rate. Specifically, 1) for the case of line-of-sight (LoS) dominant channels, we propose the beamforming-then-estimate (BTE) protocol, where the long-term STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients are optimized based on the statistical CSI only, while the short-term power allocation at the base station (BS) is designed based on the estimated effective fading channels of all the users; 2) for the case of rich scattering environments, we propose an alternative partition-then-estimate (PTE) protocol, where the BS first determines the long-term STAR-RIS surface-partition strategy based on the path-loss information only, with each subsurface being assigned to one user; and then the BS estimates the instantaneous subsurface channels associated with the users and designs its power allocation and STAR-RIS phase-shifts accordingly. For the two proposed transmission protocols, we further propose efficient algorithms to solve the respective long-term and short-term optimization problems. Moreover, we show that both proposed transmission protocols substantially reduce the channel estimation overhead as compared to the existing schemes based on full instantaneous CSI. Last, simulation results validate the superiority of our proposed transmission protocols as compared to various benchmarks. It is shown that the BTE protocol outperforms the PTE protocol when the number of STAR-RIS elements is large and/or the LoS channel components are dominant, and vice versa.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a Turbo basis expansion modeling (BEM) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) scheme is proposed for high-mobility communications subject to either Doppler-shift or Doppler-spread channel. It consists of superimposed pilot power and BEM order optimization and Turbo BEM OTFS receiver. The signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is derived as functions of OTFS system parameters and several channel information (i.e., channel correlation matrix, noise variance, etc.). The optimal superimposed pilot power ratio is then derived with a closed-form solution by calculating the first derivative of derived SINR. BEM order is specially optimized for each channel, instead of simply increasing or reducing it. The Turbo BEM OTFS receiver is proposed with an exchange of soft information between BEM channel estimation, signal detection, and data decoding, leading to high reliability. By using superimposed pilots for initial BEM channel estimation, the proposed Turbo BEM OTFS scheme has zero dedicated pilot overhead, resulting in high spectral efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed OTFS scheme outperforms the existing OTFS schemes in terms of bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency. Extrinsic information exchange transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and simulation results also exhibit the fast convergence speed of proposed OTFS scheme.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation in hybrid massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is challenging as only low-dimensional channel measurement can be obtained at the receiver while the true channel is high-dimensional. In the compressed sensing (CS) based channel estimation algorithms, a well-designed measurement matrix will contribute to better estimation performance. Therefore, a temporal correlation-based self-adaptive measurement matrix design (TC-SAMMD) method is proposed, and the corresponding frame structure and channel estimation technique are developed in this paper. Specifically, pilots are transmitted twice during each block, and the process of channel estimation contains three steps: time-varying channel estimation by Kalman filtering, self-adaptive measurement matrix design, and two pilots-based channel estimation via the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TC-SAMMD method outperforms conventional measurement matrix design approaches in terms of the channel estimation error, thanks to the “adaptiveness” to the channel’s characteristics in consecutive blocks. Besides, it is shown that the TC-SAMMD strategy with a full-ranged innovation noise can effectively mitigate the performance degradation caused by the angle shifts.}

	abstract = {The problem of computing batches of matrix multiplications in distributed computing systems with stragglers is studied. Unlike existing works in the literature, the matrices in a batch are assumed to be sparse, and the sparsity levels for matrices in different batches can be different. A novel coding scheme, called generalized sparse code (GSC), is proposed, in which the matrices are partitioned into smaller chunks that are re- grouped and encoded by respective sparse codes. The expected runtime of the proposed GSC scheme is analyzed, based on which a task assignment problem associated with the proposed GSC is formulated and solved. The solution follows the reverse water-filling principle, by which an efficient worker assignment algorithm whose worst-case time complexity equal to the total number of workers can be developed. Simulation results validate the advantage of the proposed GSC over four existing schemes, including entangled polynomial codes (EP), generalized cross-subspace alignment (GCSA), Lagrange coded computing (LCC) codes and factored Luby transform (FLT) codes at all sparsity levels. As a potential application of the proposed GSC, the problem of computing a batch of matrix multiplications with similarity is discussed.}

	abstract = {Mainstream wireless communication networks mostly adopt the layered protocol encapsulation mechanism, which inevitably introduces natural redundancy into protocols. To fully exploit the abundant natural redundancy in protocols (NRP), this paper provides a novel cross-frame and cross-layer perspective for channel coding and decoding (CCD). First, a generalized CCD architecture is developed for the first time to describe the NRP and artificial redundancy in channel codes (ARC) uniformly. The concept of equivalent code rate is proposed correspondingly to evaluate the potential gain of NRP. Second, we summarize the types of NRP, and for each of them, factor graphs and sum-product algorithms (SPAs) are adopted to model and solve the correlation between it and ARC. On this basis, the joint decoding of multi-class NRP and ARC is further considered, and a general SPA-based joint protocol-channel decoding (JPCD) scheme is presented. Finally, tests on the 802.11n TCP/IP/MAC protocol stack demonstrate that the JPCD scheme can significantly improve the decoding performance of both the packet header and payload with a relatively small computational cost. Our work shows great promise in reducing error retransmission, bandwidth overhead, and the difficulty of source recovery.}

Both the encoding and the successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding can be implemented over the constructed coding tree. For code construction, we propose a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-dependent method and two SNR-independent methods, all of which evaluate the reliabilities of leaf nodes and then select the most reliable leaf nodes as the active nodes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed codes can have comparable performance to the 5G polar codes. To reduce the decoding latency, we propose a partitioned successive cancellation (PSC)-based decoding algorithm, which can be implemented over a sub-tree obtained by pruning the coding tree. Numerical results show that the PSC-based decoding can achieve similar performance to the conventional SC-based decoding.}

Some of the new synthesis technologies lead to repetition noise, consisting of sticky insertions and deletions in the resulting messages. In this paper, we address reconstruction algorithms for multiple trace communication channels with repetition (sticky insertion and deletion) noise. We prove correctness and analyze failure rates, both analytically and on simulated data. We identify a failure mechanism related to alternating stretches in the design sequence that leads to a potential bias in the data derived from reads (traces) and used for reconstruction. To minimize this effect we introduce alternating length limited codes (ALL codes) and analyze some of their properties.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a well-known technique by which several wireless devices transmit by analog amplitude modulation to achieve a sum of their transmit signals at a common receiver. The underlying physical principle is the superposition property of the radio waves. Since such superposition is analog and in amplitude, it is natural that AirComp uses analog amplitude modulations. Unfortunately, this is impractical because most wireless devices today use digital modulations. It would be highly desirable to use digital communications because of their numerous benefits, such as error correction, synchronization, acquisition of channel state information, and widespread use. However, when we use digital modulations for AirComp, a general belief is that the superposition property of the radio waves returns a meaningless overlapping of the digital signals. In this paper, we break through such beliefs and propose an entirely new digital channel computing method named ChannelComp, which can use digital as well as analog modulations. We propose a feasibility optimization problem that ascertains the optimal modulation for computing arbitrary functions over-the-air. Additionally, we propose pre-coders to adapt existing digital modulation schemes for computing the function over the multiple access channel. The simulation results verify the superior performance of ChannelComp compared to AirComp, particularly for the product functions, with more than 10 dB improvement of the computation error.}

By controlling the signaling pathway and molecule exchange between cell devices, synthetic biology provides the MC community with tools and techniques to achieve various signal processing functions. In this paper, we propose a design framework to realize any order concentration shift keying (CSK) systems based on simple and reusable single-input single-output cells. The design framework also exploits the distributed computation on multicellular consortia with spatial segregation, which has advantages in system scalability, low genetic manipulation, and signal orthogonality. We also create a small library of simple logic engineered cells and apply them to implement binary CSK (BCSK) and quadruple CSK (QCSK) systems to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed design framework. The simplicity of our engineered cells allows for their reuse in other systems beyond CSK. Importantly, we establish a mathematical framework to theoretically characterize our proposed distributed multicellular systems. Specially, we divide a system into fundamental building blocks, from which we derive the impulse response of each block and the cascade of the impulse responses leads to the end-to-end response of the system. Simulation results obtained from the agent-based simulator BSim not only validate our CSK design framework but also demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed mathematical analysis.}

	abstract = {Due to long-term reliability, wireless control systems (WCSs) have attracted significant interest recently. However, mission-critical control requires stringent ultra-reliability and low-latency communication (URLLC) with massive data delivery, which are major challenges for conventional wireless networks. This paper investigates downlink URLLC in WCS, where the semantic communication is adopted at the control center to extract task-oriented semantic information from original large-sized data. To efficiency, the control center utilizes the rate splitting policy to deliver semantic information through private messages, while the semantic knowledge is transmitted through one common message. We aim to maximize the weighted sum semantic information transmission rate by jointly optimizing the semantic information extraction, delivery duration, rate splitting, and transmit beamforming, subject to several practical constraints, including recovery accuracy, quality of service requirements, communication latency and computation delay. By the problem decomposition, two sub-problems are obtained, where the closed-form solution for the semantic information extraction is derived at each step. Due to the complexity of the multivariable coupling in the channel dispersion, we propose fractional transformation methods for rate splitting design. Numerical results confirm that the RSMA and semantic communication design can complement each other for multiplexing gains enhancement and latency reduction to achieve overloaded connections.}

	abstract = {In this paper, for a general full-duplex wireless MapReduce distributed computing network, we investigate the minimization of the communication overhead for a given computation overhead. The wireless MapReduce framework consists of three phases: Map phase, Shuffle phase and Reduce phase. Specifically, we model the Shuffle phase into a cooperative X network based on a more general file assignment strategy. Furthermore, for this cooperative X network, we derive an information-theoretic upper bound on the sum degree of freedom (SDoF). Moreover, we propose a joint interference alignment and neutralization (IAN) scheme to characterize the achievable SDoF. Especially, in some cases, the achievable SDoF coincides with the upper bound on the SDoF, hence, the IAN scheme provides the optimal SDoF. Finally, based on the SDoF, we present an information-theoretic lower bound on the normalized delivery time (NDT) and achievable NDT of the wireless distributed computing network, which are less than or equal to those of the existing networks. The lower bound on the NDT shows that 1) there is a tradeoff between the computation load and the NDT; 2) the achievable NDT is optimal in some cases, hence, the proposed IAN scheme can reduce the communication overhead effectively.}

	abstract = {In this study, a joint blind frame synchronization and decoding method is proposed based on the normalized syndrome satisfaction probability (NSSP) provided by the soft Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes decoder. To reduce complexity, a stopping criterion is introduced into the iterative process through the convergence of NSSP evolution patterns. In addition to achieving an excellent synchronization performance, this method also eliminates the redundancy caused by the pilot sequence. Furthermore, it is compared with the optimal pilot-based and other code-aided frame synchronization algorithms. According to analytical and simulation results, the proposed technique outperforms other advanced code-aided frame synchronization solutions in synchronization, which makes it applicable to achieve comparable performance to the pilot-based methods in specific coding gains. Due to the introduction of a novel stopping criterion, the average number of joint detection & decoding is reduced by up to 90%. Analog probability processing technology integrates sub-threshold region circuits with probability domain-based iterative message-passing algorithms inspired by high energy efficiency and low complexity. Hence, hardware implementation is presented based on the analog LDPC decoder chip as fabricated in a 0.35- \\boldsymbol \\mu {m} CMOS technology for our proposed algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the realization loss is within 0.2 dB compared with the theoretical circuit simulation results.}

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to reveal the importance of hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) and power adaptation (PA) for improving transmission robustness of uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Particularly, a cognitive radio inspired uplink NOMA communication scenario is considered, where one primary user is allocated one dedicated resource block, while M secondary users compete with each other to be opportunistically served by using the same resource block of the primary user. Two novel schemes are proposed for the considered scenario, namely hybrid SIC with PA (HSIC-PA) scheme and fixed SIC with PA (FSIC-PA) scheme. Both schemes can ensure that the secondary users are served without degrading the transmission reliability of the primary user compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. The novelty of the proposed schemes compared to those existing schemes is the introduction of power adaptation. This paper presents rigorous analytical results to show that both schemes can avoid outage probability error floors without any constraints on users’ target rates in the high SNR regime, which cannot be achieved by the existing schemes. Furthermore, it is shown that the diversity gain achieved by the HSIC-PA scheme is M , while that of the FISC-PA scheme is only 1. Numerical results are provided to verify the developed analytical results and also demonstrate the superior performance achieved by the proposed schemes by comparing with the existing HSIC without PA (HSIC-NPA) scheme. The presented simulation results also show that HSIC-PA scheme performs the best among the three schemes, which indicates the importance of the combination of HSIC and PA for improving transmission robustness.}

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand of massive machine-type communication (mMTC) to provide scalable access for a large number of devices, which has prompted extensive investigation on grant-free massive random access (RA) in 5G and beyond wireless networks. Although many efficient signal processing algorithms have been developed, the limited radio resource for pilot transmission in grant-free massive RA systems makes accurate user activity detection and channel estimation challenging, which thereby compromises the communication reliability. In this paper, we adopt retransmission as a means to improve the quality of service (QoS) for grant-free massive RA. Specifically, by jointly leveraging the user activity correlation between adjacent transmission blocks and the historical channel estimation results, we first develop an activity-correlation-aware receiver for grant-free massive RA systems with retransmission based on the correlated approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. Then, we analyze the performance of the proposed receiver, including the user activity detection, channel estimation, and data error, by resorting to the state evolution of the correlated AMP algorithm and the random matrix theory (RMT). Our analysis admits a tight closed-form approximation for frame error rate (FER) evaluation. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receiver for grant-free massive RA with retransmission, compared with a conventional design that disregards the critical user activity correlation.}

	abstract = {Future wireless access networks aim to simultaneously support a large number of devices with heterogeneous service requirements, including data rates, error rates, and latencies. While achievable rate and capacity results exist for Gaussian broadcast channels in the asymptotic blocklength regime, the characterization of second-order achievable rate regions for heterogeneous blocklength constraints is not available. Therefore, we investigate a two-user Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) with heterogeneous blocklength constraints, specified according to users’ channel output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We assume that the user with higher output SNR has a shorter blocklength constraint. We show that with sufficiently large output SNR, the stronger user can perform the early decoding (ED) technique to decode and subtract the interference via successive interference cancellation (SIC). To achieve this goal, we derive an explicit lower bound on the necessary number of received symbols for a successful ED, using an independent and identically distributed Gaussian input. The second-order rate region is also derived. Numerical results show that ED can outperform the hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access scheme when the stronger channel is sufficiently better than the weaker one. Under the considered setting, about 7-dB SNR gain can be achieved compared to treating interference as noise. These results show that ED with SIC is a promising technique for future wireless networks.}

	abstract = {We consider a service cost minimization problem for resource-constrained small-cell networks with caching, where the challenge mainly stems from (i) the insufficient backhaul capacity and limited network bandwidth and (ii) the limited storing capacity of small-cell base stations (SBSs). Besides, the optimization problem is NP-hard since both the users’ mobility patterns and content preferences are unknown. In this paper, we develop a novel mobility-aware joint routing and caching strategy to address the challenges. The designed framework divides the entire geographical area into small sections containing one SBS and several mobile users (MUs). Based on the concept of one-stop-shop (OSS), we propose a federated routing and popularity learning (FRPL) approach in which the SBSs cooperatively learn the routing and preference of their respective MUs and make a caching decision. The FRPL method completes multiple tasks in one shot, thus reducing the average processing time per global aggregation of learning. By exploiting the outcomes of FRPL together with the estimated service edge of SBSs, the proposed cache placement solution greedily approximates the minimizer of the challenging service cost optimization problem. Theoretical and numerical analyses show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.}

	abstract = {This work deals with a heterogeneous semantics-native communication (SNC) problem. When agents do not share the same communication context, the effectiveness of contextual reasoning (CR) is compromised calling for agents to infer other agents’ context before communication. This article proposes a novel framework for solving the inverse problem of CR in SNC using two Bayesian inference methods, namely: Bayesian inverse CR (iCR) and Bayesian inverse linearized CR (iLCR). The first proposed Bayesian iCR method utilizes Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to infer the agent’s context while being computationally expensive. To address this issue, a Bayesian iLCR method is leveraged which obtains a linearized CR (LCR) model by training a linear neural network. Experimental results show that the Bayesian iLCR method requires less computation and achieves higher inference accuracy compared to Bayesian iCR. Additionally, heterogeneous SNC based on the context obtained through the Bayesian iLCR method shows better communication effectiveness than that of Bayesian iCR. Overall, this work provides valuable insights and methods to improve the effectiveness of SNC in situations where agents have different contexts.}

	abstract = {In federated learning (FL), the communication constraint between the remote clients and the Parameter Server (PS) is a crucial bottleneck. For this reason, model updates must be compressed so as to minimize the loss in accuracy resulting from the communication constraint. This paper proposes “M-magnitude weighted L2 distortion + 2 degrees of freedom” (M22) algorithm, a rate-distortion inspired approach to gradient compression for federated training of deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we propose a family of distortion measures between the original gradient and the reconstruction we referred to as “ M -magnitude weighted L_{2} ” distortion, and we assume that gradient updates follow an i.i.d. distribution – generalized normal or Weibull, which have two degrees of freedom. In both the distortion measure and the gradient distribution, there is one free parameter for each that can be fitted as a function of the iteration number. Given a choice of gradient distribution and distortion measure, we design the quantizer to minimize the expected distortion in gradient reconstruction. To measure the gradient compression performance under a communication constraint, we define the per-bit accuracy as the optimal improvement in accuracy that one bit of communication brings to the centralized model over the training period. Using this performance measure, we systematically benchmark the choice of gradient distribution and distortion measure. We provide substantial insights on the role of these choices and argue that significant performance improvements can be attained using such a rate-distortion inspired compressor.}

The proposed structure jointly optimizes the two encoder/decoder pairs and generates interference-aware constellations that dynamically adapt their shape based on interference intensity to minimize the bit error rate (BER). An in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) power allocation layer is introduced in the DAE to guarantee an average power constraint and enable the architecture to generate constellations with nonuniform shapes. This brings further gain compared to standard uniform constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation. The proposed structure is then extended to work with imperfect channel state information (CSI). The CSI imperfection due to both the estimation and quantization errors are examined. The performance of the DAE-ZIC is compared with two baseline methods, i.e., standard and rotated constellations. The proposed structure significantly enhances the performance of the ZIC both for the perfect and imperfect CSI. Simulation results show that the improvement is achieved in all interference regimes (weak, moderate, and strong) and consistently increases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For instance, more than an order of magnitude BER reduction is obtained with respect to the most competitive conventional method at weak interference when \\rm SNR > 15 dB\nand two bits per symbol are transmitted. The improvements reach about two orders of magnitude when quantization error exists, indicating that the DAE-ZIC is more robust to the interference compared to the conventional methods.}

In this work, we go beyond existing learning-based channel estimation methods tailored for specific scenarios, to develop an adaptive learning-based channel state information (CSI) estimation approach. We offer the adaptivity in the learning approach through extracting the scenario embeddings of CSI and adjusting the channel estimation method with the extracted information automatically in each scenario. Specifically, Learning-Based Scenario-Adaptive Channel Estimation Algorithm (LACE) is designed. LACE is based on a Scenario-Aware Hyper-Network (SAH-Net) that incorporates the embedding loss to make the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based encoder learn to extract the effective scenario embeddings from the time-space two dimensional features of the CSI. The extracted embeddings are utilized by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based tuning module to tune the parameters of the channel estimation method. Our learning design is complemented with analysis to verify that the theoretical performance of LACE is strictly superior to that of the mix-training method, which involves conventionally training the deep network-based channel estimation method using samples from all scenarios. Our results show that the performance of LACE trained in finite scenarios is comparable to that of the deep network-based channel estimation method trained in each scenario, while having lower complexity. Further more, the performance of LACE trained in infinite scenarios is demonstrated to be superior to that of the mix-training method in all test scenarios.}

The XL-MIMO consists of multiple antenna subarrays that are widely spaced over the service area to ensure line-of-sight (LoS) transmissions. First, we establish the XL-MIMO-based massive access model considering the near-field spatial non-stationary (SNS) property. Then, by exploiting the block sparsity of subarrays and the SNS property, we propose a structured block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for efficient active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE). Furthermore, different sensing matrices are applied in different pilot subcarriers for exploiting the diversity gains. Additionally, a multi-subarray collaborative localization algorithm is designed for localization. In particular, the angle of arrival (AoA) and time difference of arrival (TDoA) of the LoS links between active users and related subarrays are extracted from the estimated XL-MIMO channels, and then the coordinates of active users are acquired by jointly utilizing the AoAs and TDoAs. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms in terms of AUD and CE performance and can achieve centimeter-level localization accuracy.}

This setup is suitably modified to introduce heterogeneous traffic. Specifically, to model the massive IoT service, we assume that a standard message originates independently from each IoT device as in the standard UMA setup. To model the critical IoT service, we assume the generation of alarm messages that are common for all devices. This setup requires a significant redefinition of the error events, i.e., misdetections and false positives. We further assume that the number of active users in each transmission attempt is random and unknown. We derive a random-coding achievability bound on the misdetection and false positive probabilities of both standard and alarm messages on the Gaussian multiple access channel. Using our bound, we demonstrate that orthogonal network slicing enables massive and critical IoT to coexist under the requirement of high energy efficiency. On the contrary, we show that nonorthogonal network slicing is energy inefficient due to the residual interference from the alarm signal when decoding the standard messages.}

This paper investigates the age of information (AoI) of the three HARQ schemes specified in 5G R16, targeting to provide guidelines for future grant-free access design in 5G-Advanced and beyond. Specifically, we analyze two packet management policies: First-come-first-serve (FCFS) and preemption policy where new packets always preempt the buffer. We also study the AoI in a latency-sensitive scenario where expired packets are discarded. We derive exact expressions of AoI and peak AoI for all schemes and their lower bounds, revealing that the number of the maximum consecutive transmissions is critical for information freshness. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and show that Proactive HARQ scheme outperforms K-repetition HARQ scheme unconditionally and Reactive HARQ scheme with moderate system load or above. And discarding expired packets enhances system robustness for overload systems but yields larger AoI.}

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the proposed optical orthogonal time frequency space (O-OTFS) is capable of improving the bandwidth-/power-/energy-efficiencies of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (O-OFDM). The bandwidth-efficiency is improved because only a single cyclic prefix (CP) is needed for an entire O-OTFS frame. The power-efficiency is enhanced thanks to the diversity gain achieved by its symplectic finite Fourier transform (SFFT), which also leads to a reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), hence improving its energy-efficiency. These features are facilitated by the proposed layered asymmetrically clipped O-OTFS (LACO-OTFS), which is capable of removing the direct current (DC) bias while retaining the full optical throughput. Nonetheless, there exists an inherent trade-off, where increasing the O-OTFS frame size leads to a commensurately reduced CP percentage at the cost of an increased PAPR. In order to mitigate this, we propose to perform discrete Fourier transform based spreading (DFT-S) in the delay-Doppler (DD)-domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that regardless of the choice of domain in which the information is modulated (i.e. O-OFDM/O-OTFS with/without DFT-S), the frequency-selectivity of the quasi-static but dispersive optical channel can always be equalized by single-tap frequency-domain equalization (FDE). Moreover, the channel estimation techniques are conceived to operate in the time-/frequency-/DD-domains for both O-OFDM and O-OTFS. Our simulation results demonstrate that for a multi-user optical wireless system associated with M=64 subcarriers and the OTFS frame length of N=64 , LACO-OTFS is capable of achieving a 7 dB power-efficiency gain over LACO-OFDM, where the CP overhead is reduced by a factor of N=64 . DFT-S-LACO-OTFS is also capable of providing a 7 dB power-efficiency gain over DFT-S-LACO-OFDM, where the low PAPR of single-carrier transmission is retained.}

	abstract = {The line-of-sight (LOS) requirement of free-space optical (FSO) systems can be relaxed by employing optical relays or optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In this paper, we show that the power reflected from FSO IRSs and collected at the receiver (Rx) lens may scale quadratically or linearly with the IRS size or may saturate at a constant value. We analyze the power scaling law for optical IRSs and unveil its dependence on the wavelength, transmitter (Tx)-to-IRS and IRS-to-Rx distances, beam waist, and Rx lens size. We also consider the impact of linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shift profiles across the IRS on the power collected at the Rx lens for different IRS sizes. Our results reveal that surprisingly the powers received for the different phase shift profiles are identical, unless the IRS operates in the saturation regime. Moreover, IRSs employing the focusing (linear) phase shift profile require the largest (smallest) size to reach the saturation regime. We also compare optical IRSs in different power scaling regimes with optical relays in terms of the outage probability, diversity and coding gains, and optimal placement. Our results show that, at the expense of a higher hardware complexity, relay-assisted FSO links yield a better outage performance at high signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), but optical IRSs can achieve a higher performance at low SNRs. Moreover, while it is optimal to place relays equidistant from Tx and Rx, the optimal location of optical IRSs depends on the phase shift profile and the power scaling regime they operate in.}

	abstract = {To achieve multi-Gb/s data rates in 6G optical wireless access networks based on narrow infrared (IR) laser beams, a high-speed receiver with two key specifications is needed: a sufficiently large aperture to collect the required optical power and a wide field-of-view (FOV) to avoid strict alignment issues. This paper puts forward the systematic design and optimisation of multi-tier non-imaging angle diversity receivers (ADRs) composed of compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs) coupled with photodiode (PD) arrays for laser-based optical wireless communication (OWC) links. Design tradeoffs include the gain-FOV tradeoff for each receiver element and the area-bandwidth tradeoff for each PD array. The rate maximisation is formulated as a non-convex optimisation problem under the constraints on the minimum required FOV and the overall ADR dimensions to find the optimum configuration of the receiver bandwidth and FOV, and a low-complexity optimal solution is proposed. The ADR performance is studied using computer simulations and insightful design guidelines are provided through various numerical examples. An efficient technique is also proposed to reduce the ADR dimensions based on CPC length truncation. It is shown that a compact ADR with a height of \\leq 0.5 cm and an effective area of \\leq 0.5 cm2 reaches a data rate of 12 Gb/s with a half-angle FOV of 30° over a 3 m link distance.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of cache-aided multi-user private information retrieval (MuPIR). This problem consists of N\nindependent files that are replicated across S \\geq 2\nnon-colluding servers. There are K\ncache-equipped users having caches of size equivalent to M\nfiles. Every user aims to retrieve a file from the servers, but servers should not obtain any information about users’ demands. The user caches are filled with some arbitrary function of the files before the users decide their demands, known as the placement phase. After deciding their demands, users cooperatively send queries to the servers to retrieve their desired files privately. Upon receiving the queries, servers broadcast coded transmissions based on these queries and the files, known as the delivery phase. Conveying queries to the servers incurs an upload cost for the users, and downloading the answers broadcasted by the servers incurs a download cost. Each file has to be split into F\npackets to implement cache-aided MuPIR schemes. In this paper, we propose MuPIR schemes that utilize placement delivery arrays (PDAs) to characterize placement and delivery. Proposed MuPIR schemes significantly reduce subpacketization levels while slightly increasing the download cost. The proposed scheme also substantially reduces the upload cost for the users. We show that our scheme is order optimal in terms of download cost for PDAs based on Ali-Niesen scheme for centralised coded caching. We recover the optimal single-user PIR scheme presented by Tian et al. in [“Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval Codes With Optimal Message Size and Upload Cost,” IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2019] as a special case. Our scheme also achieves optimal rate for single-user cache-aided PIR setup reported in [R. Tandon, “The capacity of cache aided private information retrieval,” Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control and Computing, 2017.]}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a robust secure communication scheme for a two-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) scenario with the assistance of Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), in which one legitimate user and one eavesdropper are considered. In the proposed scheme, the information is transmitted from one UAV named information UAV to the user via the assistance of the IRS, while the jamming information is transmitted by the other UAV named jamming UAV equipped with multi-antenna to interfere with the eavesdropper and safeguard the communication between information UAV and legitimate receiver. For the considered communication system, we assume that the Channel State Information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channels are imperfect. In this imperfect CSI case, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem. By jointly optimizing UAV transmit power, trajectory, and IRS phase shifters, the suboptimal average secrecy rate of the proposed scheme can be obtained. Specifically, Lagrangian dual transform and quaduratic transform are introduced to convert the objective function into more tractable form; S-Procedure is used for handling CSI uncertainty; and a two-stage penalty function algorithm is applied to obtain rank-one phase shifters solution. Numerical simulation results validate some interesting insights: (1) The IRS can bring strong robustness to the two-UAV security communication system; (2) Deploying jamming UAV in the IRS-UAV security communication system can greatly improve security performance, especially employing more antennas at the jamming UAV.}

To this end, we first propose two relay selection schemes, namely random relay selection (RRS) and max-min relay selection (MMRS), as well as their corresponding cooperative jamming (CJ) schemes for ensuring covertness in the system. We then provide theoretical modeling for the covert rate performance under each relay selection scheme and its CJ scheme and further explore the optimal transmit power controls of both the source and relay for covert rate maximization. Finally, extensive simulation/numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical models and also to illustrate the covert rate performance of the relay system under cooperative jamming and relay selection.}

These bits are added to and used from a pool of available key bits. In this work, we analyze the reliability of the system in terms of the probability that the budget of available key bits will be exhausted. In addition, we investigate the latency before a transmission can take place. Since security, reliability, and latency are three important metrics for modern communication systems, it is of great interest to jointly analyze them in relation to the system parameters. In particular, we show under what conditions the system may remain in an active state indefinitely, i.e., never run out of available secret-key bits. The results presented in this work will allow system designers to adjust the system parameters in such a way that the requirements of the application in terms of both reliability and latency are met.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) algorithm via bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) for massive multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems with non-orthogonal pilot sequences. The contribution aims to reduce significantly the communication overhead required for channel acquisition by enabling the use of short non-orthogonal pilots, while maintaining multi-user detection (MUD) capability. Bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiGAMP), which is systematically derived by extending approximate message passing (AMP) to the bilinear inference problem (BIP), provides computationally efficient approximate implementations of large-scale JCDE via sum-product algorithm (SPA); however, as the pilot length decreases, the estimation accuracy is severely degraded. To tackle this issue, the proposed BiGaBP algorithm generalizes BiGAMP by relaxing its dependence on the large-system limit approximation and leveraging the belief propagation (BP) concept. In addition, a novel belief scaling method complying with the data detection accuracy for each iteration step is designed to avoid the divergence behavior of iterative estimation in the early iterations due to the use of non-orthogonal pilots, especially in insufficient large-system conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes and approaches the performance of idealized (genie-aided) scheme in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) performances.}

The goal of this paper is to establish successful communication between the cellular base stations and devices, focusing on the problem of joint user activity detection and channel estimation. Different from traditional compressed sensing (CS) methods that only use the sparsity of user activities, we develop several Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based CS algorithms by exploiting the sparsity of user activities and mmWave channels. First, a group soft-thresholding AMP is presented to utilize only the user activity sparsity. Second, a hard-thresholding AMP is proposed based on the on-grid CS approach. Third, a super-resolution AMP algorithm is proposed based on atomic norm, in which a greedy method is proposed as a super-resolution denoiser. And we smooth the denoiser based on Monte Carlo sampling to have Lipschitz continuity and present state evolution results. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.}

We give the conditions under which the QS-SDP and FA-SDP forms are shown to be sufficiently tight so that their solutions perform to the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) precision. The results from the simulations demonstrate that the QS-SDP and FA-SDP solutions require few transmitters and receivers to uniquely determine the unknown parameters of the moving target.

Specifically, the satellite network employs multicast communication to disseminate information to multiple satellite users, while the terrestrial network incorporates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology to serve terrestrial users. Given that the location information-based channel state information (LoI-CSI) of each user is available, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the outage probability (OP) of the terrestrial network by optimizing the transmit power and beamforming (BF) weight vector at the base station, the IRS phase shift vector, and the power allocation factor, while meeting the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement of the satellite network. To make the optimization problem tractable, we first propose a low-complexity BF algorithm based on the LoI-CSI, which simplifies the optimization problem while guaranteeing the QoS requirement of the satellite network. Then, assuming that terrestrial links experience Rician fading, we derive an approximate yet accurate OP of the terrestrial network, which is explored to calculate the phase shift vector. Furthermore, we propose a novel power allocation method that employs an exponential-type approximation of the first-order Marcum Q-function, to obtain the power allocation coefficient. Finally, simulation results confirm the theoretical formulas’ validity and reveal the proposed algorithms’ superiority in system performance.}

The IoT devices with limited battery size and computing ability cannot meet many applications brought out by the data-driven artificial intelligence technique. The combination of wireless power transfer (WPT) and edge computing is regarded as an effective solution to this dilemma. IoT devices can collect radio frequency energy provided by hybrid access points (HAPs) to process data locally or offload data to the edge servers of HAPs. However, how to efficiently make offloading decisions and allocate resource is challenging, especially for the networks with multiple HAPs. In this paper, we consider the sum computation rate maximization problem for a WPT empowered IoT network with multiple HAPs and IoT devices. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem efficiently, we decompose it into a top-problem of optimizing offloading decisions and a sub-problem of optimizing time allocation under the given offloading decisions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to output the near-optimal offloading decision and design an efficient algorithm based on Lagrangian duality method to obtain the consequent optimal time allocation. Simulations verified that the proposed DRL-based algorithm can achieve more than 95 percent of the maximal computation rate with low complexity. Compared with the common actor-critic algorithm, the proposed algorithm has the substantial advantage in convergence speed, achieved computation rate and running time.}

	abstract = {A multicell-coordinated beamforming solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is presented when employing low-resolution data converters and per-antenna level constraints. For a more realistic deployment, we aim to find the downlink (DL) beamformer that minimizes the maximum power on transmit antenna array of each basestation under received signal quality constraints while minimizing per-antenna transmit power. We show that strong duality holds between the primal DL formulation and its manageable Lagrangian dual problem which can be interpreted as the virtual uplink (UL) problem with adjustable noise covariance matrices. For a fixed set of noise covariance matrices, we claim that the virtual UL solution is effectively used to compute the DL beamformer and noise covariance matrices can be subsequently updated with an associated subgradient. Our primary contributions are then 1) formulating the quantized DL OFDM antenna power minimax problem and deriving its associated dual problem, 2) showing strong duality and interpreting the dual as a virtual quantized UL OFDM problem, and 3) developing an iterative minimax algorithm based on the dual problem. Simulations validate the proposed algorithm in terms of the maximum antenna transmit power and peak-to-average-power ratio.}

Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) Golay complementary array set (GCAS) can be used to design the massive MIMO precoding matrix so as to achieve omnidirectional transmission due to its complementary autocorrelation property. In this paper, novel constructions of new 2D GCASs with arbitrary array lengths are proposed. Our key idea is to carefully truncate the columns of certain larger arrays generated by 2D generalized Boolean functions. Finally, the power radiation patterns and numerical results are provided to verify the omnidirectional property of the GCAS-based precoding. The error performances of the proposed precoding scheme are presented to validate its superiority over the existing alternatives.}

With the goal of improving the energy efficiency of the network, we consider both large-scale and small-scale signal propagation effects in our system model and aim to optimize the node deployment as an effective measure to reduce the wireless communication power consumption of the WSN. We propose a new framework, in which hard deterministic connectivity constraints on communication links are replaced with realistic limitations on outage due to severe stochastic fading. We also consider a radio energy model that reflects the exponential dependence of the transmission power on the rate. We derive the necessary conditions for the optimal deployment that not only minimize the power consumption, but also guarantee all wireless links to have an outage probability below the given threshold. Our theoretical findings are accompanied by simulations that indicate significant performance gains compared to existing node deployment algorithms in the literature.}

As its signal levels are significantly lower than those of communication systems, passive sensing bands need to be protected from radio frequency interference (RFI) of other transmission sources. Here, we investigate the RFI of inter-satellite links (ISLs) of an emerging mega-constellation medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite communication system to nadir-pointing low earth orbit (LEO) SPS. We develop accurate static and dynamic analytical RFI models by introducing static and time-varying virtual satellite distribution functions and the regions of line-of-sight RFI paths. Performance comparison between the proposed analytical approach and the simulation-based approach for various scenarios of MEO satellites and LEO SPS system settings corroborates the accuracy, flexibility, and generality of the proposed analytical models, and reveals insights into the corresponding RFI characteristics. The results also indicate that it is possible for MEO ISLs to utilize the SPS spectrum while keeping the RFI to the SPS at an acceptable level.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently gained significant interest as an emerging technology for future wireless networks thanks to its potential for improving the coverage in challenging propagation environments. This paper studies an RIS-assisted communication system, where a source transmits data to a destination in the presence of a weak direct link. We analyze and compare RIS designs based on long-term and short-term channel statistics in terms of coverage probability and ergodic rate. For the considered optimization designs, we derive closed-form expressions for the coverage probability and ergodic rate, which explicitly unveil the impact of the propagation environment and the RIS on the system performance. Besides the optimization of the RIS phase profile, we formulate an RIS placement optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the coverage probability by relying only on partial channel state information. An efficient algorithm is proposed based on the gradient ascent method. Simulation results are illustrated in order to corroborate the analytical framework and findings. The proposed RIS phase profile is shown to outperform several heuristic benchmark schemes in terms of outage probability and ergodic rate. In addition, the proposed RIS placement strategy provides an extra degree of freedom that remarkably improves the system performance.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication systems introduce a new communication paradigm called near-field communications, which identifies users’ location within the near-field (Fresnel’s region). In the near-field, beams can be steered in the angle and distance dimensions, resulting in an enormous codebook and a prolonged two-dimensional beam alignment (BA) process. To keep a low BA overhead while achieving low BA error, in this paper, we design a novel hierarchical codebook and a BA scheme for near-field XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, we first propose a novel spatial partition where the angle-offset effect is revealed and leveraged to improve the beam gain inside the coverage area. Based on the partition, we design distance-coarse and focusing beams. Distance-coarse beams are leveraged to construct the high level of the codebook for angle dimension alignment. In contrast, focusing beams construct the last level codebook for distance dimension alignment. Corresponding to the proposed codebook structure, our BA scheme is a tree search consisting of two stages: the angle aligning stage and the distance aligning stage. Next, we formulate the desired codebook design problem as difference convex optimization problems, where three beam design guidelines are considered to minimize the BA error rate raised by the near-field angle-offset effect. After that, the proposed optimization problem is solved by the constrained concave-convex procedure. Numerical simulations verify the angle offset effect and our designed near-field beam. Furthermore, we show that our BA scheme only utilizes one percent of overhead but achieves a lower BA error rate than exhaustive searching.}

We compare these methods with the channel charting algorithms principal component analysis (PCA), Sammon’s method (SM), and autoencoder (AE). We show that ISQ, LR, and MM surpass PCA, SM, and AE in performance. We also compare our algorithm MM with an algorithm from the literature that uses the MUSIC algorithm jointly on \\theta and \\rho . We call this algorithm the JM algorithm. JM performs very slightly better than MM but at a substantial increase in complexity. Finally, we introduce the rotate-and-sum (RS) algorithm which has about the same performance as the MM and JM algorithms. Unlike MUSIC, RS does not employ eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis. Thus, it is more suitable for direct register transfer logic (RTL) implementation.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel transparent amplifying intelligent surface (TAIS) architecture for uplink enhancement in indoor-to-outdoor mmWave communications. The TAIS is an amplifier-based transmissive intelligent surface that can refract and amplify the incident signal, instead of only refracting it with adjustable phase shift by most passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). With advanced indium tin oxide film and printing technology, TAIS can be fabricated on the windows without any visual effects. This paper primarily focuses on exploiting the TAIS-based architecture to boost the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) in indoor-to-outdoor mmWave communications. By jointly optimizing the TAIS’s phase shift matrix and transmit power of the user equipment, the uplink SE can be maximized by exploiting the nonlinearity in the TAIS’s amplification process. The key enabler is that we drive the optimal phase shift matrix that maximizes the SE and deduces its closed-form representation. The SE maximization is then proved to be transferred to the transmit power optimization problem. Another important enabler is that we design a low-complexity algorithm to solve the optimization problem using the difference of convex programming. Moreover, the asymptotic spectral efficiency under nonlinear amplification and power scaling law with infinitely large elements under both the sparse and rich scattering channel models are analyzed. Simulation results show that our proposed TAIS can increase the SE by up to 24.7% as compared to its alternative methods.}

By jointing the use of an arbitrary number of active TAs and the construction of one or two signal constellations, a new design, called as joint multiple constellations and variable active antennas selection for signal spaces design (SSD-MCVA), is proposed to exploit the spatial domain and then extend the signal spaces. Specifically, according to the dimensions of the spatial symbols that are constructed by three types of constellations (i.e., conventional QAM, the first secondary QAM (SQAM) and the second SQAM ( \\text{S}' QAM)) and the aid of the sign j , four antenna index (AI) vector subsets are designed to extend the number of signal space vectors for enhancing the SE as well as the reliability of transmission. In addition, permutating signal spatial vectors with MCVA (PSSV-MCVA) is proposed to exploit the permutation index domain and then greatly improve the throughput for the app- lication of the large-scale MIMO systems. Furthermore, the spatial index bits, the detection complexity comparisons and the average bit error probability are provided. Simulation results show that the proposed systems achieve more spatial index bits and a lower bit error rate than existing index modulation systems.}

We split the code design problem into the frozen set design and the frozen bit expression design problems. To solve the first problem, we analyze the connection between the code minimum distance and the frozen set. This analysis leads to a novel frozen set structure that ensures a low frame error rate (FER) under successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. Given a bit-channel reliability sequence, our frozen set structure reduces the problem of frozen set design to that of selecting three integer numbers. We develop a reinforcement learning technique to find the values of these integer numbers minimizing the FER under SCL decoding. We then propose a simple deterministic method producing efficient expressions for dynamic frozen bits. Simulation results show that the proposed compactly-specified polar codes of lengths 512 to 4096 outperform the state-of-the-art polar code constructions under SCL decoding in the high SNR regime.}

	abstract = {In wireless networks with distributed computing, the computational performance is limited by stragglers. To mitigate the stragglers’ effect, coded computation is adopted through computational redundancy. Moreover, in wireless transmission, transmission errors may occur due to noise, channel fading and so on. Existing works design coded computation and error detection separately. However, this leads to frequent encoding and inefficient allocation. In this paper, we propose a joint computation and transmission coding (JCTC) scheme to design coded computation and error detection jointly. The coded computation is based on Luby transform (LT) code and linear error-detecting codes are applied for the re-transmission mechanism. To achieve the low dynamic encoding, two-layer encoding is adopted. Then, the performances of JCTC scheme are analyzed in terms of latency and computation reliability. Finally, in order to achieve efficient task and redundancy allocation, the wireless LT coded computation with error detection (WLTCC-ED) algorithm is given from both iterative and low-complexity perspectives respectively. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, it shows that our proposed JCTC scheme has significant advantages over separate designs.}

	abstract = {Recently proposed splitting receivers, utilizing both coherently and non-coherently processed signals for detection, have demonstrated remarkable performance gain compared to conventional receivers in the single-antenna scenario. In this paper, focusing on a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup, we propose a multi-antenna splitting receiver, where the received signal at each antenna is split into an envelope detection (ED) branch and a coherent detection (CD) branch, and the processed signals from both branches of all antennas are then jointly utilized for recovering the transmitted information. We derive a closed-form approximation of the achievable mutual information (MI), in terms of the key receiver design parameters including the power splitting ratio at each antenna and the signal combining coefficients from all the ED and CD branches. We further optimize these receiver design parameters and demonstrate important design insights for the proposed multi-antenna ED-CD splitting receiver: 1) the optimal splitting ratio is identical at each antenna, and 2) the optimal combining coefficients for the ED and CD branches are the same, and each coefficient is proportional to the corresponding antenna’s channel power gain. Our numerical results also demonstrate the MI performance improvement of the proposed receiver over conventional non-splitting receivers.}

	abstract = {The maximum information rates for bandlimited channels with direct detection are achieved with joint detection and decoding (JDD), but JDD is often too complex to implement. Two receiver structures are studied to reduce complexity: separate detection and decoding (SDD) and successive interference cancellation (SIC). For bipolar modulation, frequency-domain raised-cosine pulse shaping, and fiber-optic channels with chromatic dispersion, SIC achieves rates close to those of JDD, thereby attaining significant energy gains over SDD and intensity modulation. Gibbs sampling further reduces the detector complexity and achieves rates close to those of the forward-backward algorithm at low to intermediate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but stalls at high SNR. Simulations with polar codes, higher-order modulation, and multi-level coding confirm the predicted gains.}

Particularly, to make full use of RSMA technique, the LEO satellite needs to appropriately schedule transmitting power to common and private streams. Therefore, the key issue is to jointly optimize the resource allocation and power control to fully utilize the benefits of resource sharing and RSMA. However, the combination of continuous power control and discrete resource allocation becomes the bottleneck for providing an effective solution with limited system information. To deal with this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework which jointly employs deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm for discrete resource allocation and proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for continuous power control to maximize a joint objective. Simulation experiments evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme compared with several baseline schemes and the results show the advantages of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged to support computation-intensive tasks in 6G systems. Since the battery capacity of a UAV is limited, to serve as many users as possible, a joint design on UAV trajectory and offloading strategy with consideration for service fairness is essential to provide energy-efficient computation offloading to the users in UAV-MEC networks. Unfortunately, such a joint decision-making problem is not straightforward due to various task types required from users and various functionalities of different UAVs enabled by different application programs. Considering the above issues, we take energy efficiency and service fairness as the objective, and propose a Multi-Agent Energy-Efficient joint Trajectory and Computation Offloading (MA-ETCO) scheme. To adapt to dynamic demands of users, we develop an optimization-embedding multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (OMADRL) algorithm. Each UAV autonomously learns the trajectory control decision based on MADRL to adapt to dynamic demands. Then, it will obtain the optimal computation offloading decision by solving a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The computation offloading result, in turn, will be used as an indicator to guide UAVs’ trajectory design. Compared to relying solely on deep reinforcement learning, such an optimization-embedding way reduces action space dimension and improves convergence efficiency.}

	abstract = {Channel capacity estimation plays a crucial role in beyond 5G intelligent communications. Despite its significance, this task is challenging for a majority of channels, especially for the complex channels not modeled as the well-known typical ones. Recently, neural networks have been used in mutual information estimation and optimization. They are particularly considered as efficient tools for learning channel capacity. In this paper, we propose a cooperative framework to simultaneously estimate channel capacity and design the optimal codebook. First, we will leverage MIM-based GAN, a novel form of generative adversarial network (GAN) using message importance measure (MIM) as the information distance, into mutual information estimation, and develop a novel method, named MIM-based mutual information estimator (MMIE). Then, we design a generalized cooperative framework for channel capacity learning, in which a generator is regarded as an encoder producing the channel input, while a discriminator is the mutual information estimator that assesses the performance of the generator. Through the adversarial training, the generator automatically learns the optimal codebook and the discriminator estimates the channel capacity. Numerical experiments will demonstrate that compared with several conventional estimators, the MMIE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and stability.}

	abstract = {Recently, the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth in multi-modal communication systems requires a paradigm shift. Powered by deep learning, semantic communications are applied to multi-modal scenarios to boost communication efficiency and save communication resources. However, the existing end-to-end neural network (NN) based framework without the channel encoder/decoder is incompatible with modern digital communication systems. Moreover, most end-to-end designs are task-specific and require re- design and re- training for new tasks, which limits their applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed multi-modal semantic communication framework incorporating the conventional channel encoder/decoder. We adopt NN-based semantic encoder and decoder to extract correlated semantic information contained in different modalities, including speech, text, and image. Based on the proposed framework, we further establish a general rate-adaptive coding mechanism for various types of multi-modal semantic tasks. In particular, we utilize unequal error protection based on semantic importance, which is derived by evaluating the distortion bound of each modality. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that aims at minimizing inference delay while maintaining inference accuracy for semantic tasks. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanism fares better than both conventional communication and existing semantic communication systems in terms of task performance, inference delay, and deployment complexity.}

	abstract = {This paper works on the detection of physical random access channel (NPRACH) in Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) system. The frequency hopping preamble design and increasing number of IoT terminals lead to inter-cell interference among different cells, resulting in inevitable increase of false alarm rate. Due to the ambiguity between preamble and interference, it is a great challenge for NPRACH detection methods to achieve low false alarm rate when having strong interference. In this paper, we analyze the difference between preamble and interference in the propagation environments of NPRACH signals in the 2-dimensional Fast Fourier Transformation (2-D FFT) domain. Then we propose a deep learning-based NPRACH detection method, dubbed Mask Assisted Anti-Interference Universal Detection Scheme (MIUS), in the 2-D FFT domain for preamble detection with inter-cell interference in different repetition cases. In the proposed MIUS, the Mask-ResNet Block is designed as a building block to extract features distinguishing the preamble and interference based on masking operations. Our proposed MIUS utilizes the Mask-ResNet Block in a separate manner to detect the preambles in sequential repetitions across different repetition cases. Simulation results show that MIUS can simultaneously maintain the low false alarm rate and achieve high detection accuracy in low Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) regime in all repetition cases.}

We formulate the MEC resource allocation optimization as a constrained Markov decision process that balances minimum processing latency and denial-of-service (DoS) probability. We use the MEC aggregated features as the DRL input to significantly reduce the high-dimensionality input of the remaining service processing time for individual MEC requests. Our designed constrained DRL effectively attains the optimal resource allocations that are adapted to the dynamic DoS requirements. We provide extensive simulation results and analysis to validate that our BC-DRL framework achieves higher security, reliability, and resource utilization efficiency than benchmark blockchain consensus protocols and MEC resource allocation algorithms.}

These signals pass through MA doubly-dispersive channel and get combined at the base station (BS). We show that the composite signal received at the BS forms an equivalent single-user orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system. We show that such low-complexity transmission of OFDM symbols in the uplink from low-capability devices yields diversity gain as the OTFS. We extend this MA scheme for orthogonal time sequency multiplexing (OTSM) and block based single carrier (block SC) transmissions, where the composite received signal at the BS forms an equivalent single-user OTSM or block SC received signal depending on the transmission. We also develop successive interference cancellation (SIC) and turbo decoding principles-based receivers for multi-user OTFS, OTSM, and block SC transmissions, and a frequency domain SIC receiver for OFDM. We analyze their complexity with both analytical and simulation methods. Further, we compare the multi-user uncoded and coded performance of OTFS, OTSM, and block SC with multi-user OFDM. We also evaluate their performance under the effects of nonlinear high-power amplifiers in multi-user scenarios.}

At the transmitter, we propose to superimpose and overlap the information-bearing chaotic signals for higher energy efficiency. Since the chaotic modulated signals of each user share identical reference chaotic signals, the transmitted superimposed signal matrices have the low-rank property. Then at the receiver, we apply the SVD-aided detection to recover these low-rank signals, which can suppress the noise to attain better reliability performance. Moreover, we prove that the proposed design can achieve the maximum likelihood detection performances. Furthermore, we derive the theoretical bit rate, energy efficiency and bit error rate expressions over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Simulation results are then provided to validate the theoretical derivations. Subsequently, the simulated performances over AWGN and fading channels are investigated to show that higher energy efficiency and better reliability performances than benchmark schemes can be achieved in industrial IoT scenarios.}

	abstract = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is emerging as a promising technology by achieving full-space coverage and further improving system performance. However, most existing works adopted an independent phase-shift model, which is high-cost and may be difficult to achieve in realistic wideband systems. Consequently, a coupled phase-shift STAR-RIS enhanced downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system is investigated for both unicast and broadcast communications in this paper. We aim to maximize the average sum-rate (ASR) for all subcarriers by jointly optimizing the precoding matrices and the reflecting and transmitting coefficients (RTCs). Specifically, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to iteratively design each block of a multiblock problem reformulated by the original one. The precoding matrices are optimized by the Lagrangian multiplier method for low computational complexity. For the RTCs, an element-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the coupled phase-shift and amplitude coefficients. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing the ASR with that of other benchmarks. Moreover, its performance closely approaches the upper bound under various practical user proportion scenarios on both sides of the STAR-RIS.}

In MC-PD-NOMA, the available channel bandwidth is divided into several sub-carriers in order to serve the multiple users in each sub-carrier. In this work, to reduce the number of successive interference cancellation (SIC) operations, detection delay, SIC complexity and to enhance the SIC stability of the MC-PD-NOMA, a system, namely, MC-quadrature-NOMA (MC-Q-NOMA), is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed MC-Q-NOMA follows the essential upconversion architecture to provide orthogonality in the pass-band. Moreover, a novel analytical framework is introduced to evaluate analytical expressions of average sum-rate (ASR), outage probability (OP), and diversity order for the proposed system under the generalized \\alpha -\\mu\nchannel for perfect and imperfect SICs. In addition, the proposed framework is utilized to determine the analytical expression of ASR, OP, and diversity order for MC-PD-NOMA. Comparative analysis indicates that under imperfect SIC, MC-Q-NOMA outperforms the MC-PD-NOMA due to the lesser number of SICs. However, under perfect SIC, MC-Q-NOMA demonstrates comparable performance with the MC-PD-NOMA. Furthermore, the analytical expression of the average bit-error-rate is evaluated for the MC-Q-NOMA. Numerical results demonstrate that the error performance of MC-Q-NOMA is superior to MC-PD-NOMA for all signal-to-noise ratio values.}

This paper proposes AnalyticalBP, an exact analytical continuous-time Markov chain model for blocking probabilities considering the crosstalk-avoided approach in SS-EONs. AnalyticalBP generates all the feasible states and their transitions while avoiding inter-core and inter-mode crosstalks for both single and multi-class requests. Single-class requests use the same number of slots, whereas multi-class requests adopt different numbers of slots to satisfy clients’ requirements. When AnalyticalBP is not tractable due to scalability, we introduce an iterative approximate model for a single-hop link. We further extend the single-hop model for a multi-hop network. We compare AnalyticalBP, the iterative approximate model, and Monte Carlo simulation studies for a single-hop link. Numerical results indicate that the performances obtained by AnalyticalBP and the simulation studies, in terms of blocking probabilities and resource utilization, are comparable, and the accuracy of the iterative approximate model is also acceptable.}

We design a sophisticated key generation scheme based on multi-domain polarization and the corresponding receivers. An in-depth analysis of the system’s secrecy rate is provided, demonstrating the confidentiality of our approach in the presence of eavesdroppers having strong computational capabilities. More explicitly, our simulation results and theoretical analysis corroborate the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms of its bit error rate (BER), block error rate (BLER), and maximum achievable secrecy rate. Our findings indicate that the innovative PLS framework effectively enhances the security and reliability of wireless communication systems.

No existing paper has studied covert communication for the random access channel. Our protocol assumes binary discrete phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, and it works well under imperfect channel state information (I-CSI) for both the legitimate and adversary receivers, which is a realistic assumption in the low power regime. Also, our method assumes that the legitimate users share secret variables in a similar way as the preceding studies. Although several studies investigated the covert communication for the point-to-point communication, no existing paper considers the covert communication under the above uncertainty assumption even for point-to-point communication. Our protocol under the above uncertainty assumption allows O(n) legitimate senders and O(n/\\log n) active legitimate senders. Furthermore, our protocol can be converted to a protocol for point-to-point communication that works under the above uncertainty assumption.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has the capability to significantly enhance physical layer security by reconfiguring the propagation in wireless communications. However, due to the cascaded channel brought by the RIS and the hostile nature of potential eavesdroppers, acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers is challenging. Worse still, if the eavesdroppers are equipped with multiple antennas and there exists spatial correlation at the RIS due to closely spaced RIS elements, the random channel matrices are complicatedly coupled with the phase shift and other wireless resources in the outage probabilistic constraint, making their optimizations intractable. To date, there has been no systematic and feasible approach to address such a challenge. To fill this gap, this paper for the first time reveals an analytical transformation for handling the intractable outage probabilistic constraint. It is theoretically established that when the maximum tolerable outage probability is smaller than a threshold around 0.4, which generally holds in practice, the proposed transformation is exact and suffers no performance loss. As an illustrative example of the developed constraint transformation, the secure energy efficiency maximization is selected as the objecitve function and the resultant resource optimization is handled by the alternating maximization framework. Numerical results are presented to show the rapid convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm and unveil that the proposed probabilistic constraint transformation has superiority over the Bernstein-Type Inequality approximation. Compared with several baseline schemes (e.g., random phase-shift, fixed phase-shift, RIS ignoring CSI uncertainty, and secure transmission without RIS), the proposed scheme significantly boosts the performance, underscoring the significance of appropriately managing the probabilistic constraint outage and optimizing RIS phase shifts for secure transmission against multi-antenna eavesdroppers.}

Since Eves are not legitimate users, their channels cannot be estimated perfectly. We investigate two scenarios with partial channel state information (CSI) error of only cascaded BS-IRS-Eve channel and full CSI errors of both cascaded BS-IRS-Eve channel and direct BS-Eve channel under the statistical CSI error model. To ensure the security performance under CSI errors, the transmit beamforming, AN spatial distribution at the BS, and phase shifts at IRS are jointly optimized to minimize the transmit power constrained by the minimum data rate requirement of Bob and the outage probability of maximum data rate limitation of Eves. In contrast to existing works, the direct link considered in our work makes the optimization of phase shifts at IRS much more challenging, thus we propose a series of novel and artful mathematical manipulations to tackle this issue. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be applied for both uncorrelated and correlated CSI errors. Simulations confirm the superiority of our proposed algorithm.}

To enhance the computing performance, we consider a partially offloading scheme where the computational task at each user can be executed at itself and offloaded to the UAV edge server and the BS via the UAV-enabled RIS, respectively. To maximize the total number of secure computing tasks among all users, we design a low complexity iterative algorithm by jointly optimizing the RIS phase shift, UAV deployment, power and computing resource allocation subject to certain power constraints.

To tackle the optimization problem, the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is applied to address the nonconvex radar SINR objective function, and the resulting quartic problem is solved by developing an semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based approach. Moreover, we derive the scaling order of the radar SINR with a large number of reflecting elements. Next, the transmit power allocation problem and the deployment strategy of the active RIS are studied with a moderate number of reflecting elements. Finally, we validate the potential of the active RIS in ISAC systems compared to passive RIS. Additionally, we deliberate on several open problems that remain for future research.}

	abstract = {Phase noise can cause significant performance degradation in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, especially for high-order data transmission. To mitigate the effect of phase noise on data transmission, pilot-based and blind-based algorithms are widely adopted in the existing works, which suffer from spectral efficiency degradation or formidable computational cost due to the large-scale and time-dependent properties of phase noise. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-level maximum a posteriori (MMAP)-based blind data detection algorithm to address the phase noise compensation in MIMO-ODFM systems. The proposed algorithm, exploiting the spectral low-dimensional property of phase noise and the approximate message passing (AMP) rule, achieves a near optimal detection performance. The exploitation of low-pass characteristics of phase noise spectrum significantly reduces the computational complexity, and the adoption of AMP principle ensures a linear complexity of the algorithm with respect to the number of antennas and subcarriers. Thus, a good complexity-accuracy trade-off is obtained. Besides, the proposed algorithm is applicable to the scenarios of commonly shared oscillators and independent oscillators. The numerical experiments show that the proposed pilot-free data detection algorithm can achieve superior data transmission performance for channels with strong phase noise at a low complexity.}

Such protocols would greatly benefit from prior deterministic knowledge of the sparsity level, i.e., the instantaneous number of simultaneously active devices K . Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated pilot transmissions (CPTs) for detecting K . Specifically, the proposed CPT mechanism includes a downlink (DL) phase for channel state information acquisition that resolves fading uncertainty in the uplink (UL) transmission phase using shared UL pilot symbols for channel compensation. We propose a signal sparsity level detector and analytically assess its accuracy when network channels are subject to Rayleigh fading. We show that the variance of the estimator increases with K , and its distribution approximates that of the sum of a Student’s t and Gaussian random variable. The numerical results evince the need for carefully configuring the duration of the DL and UL phases. Indeed, we show that relatively short DL phases are preferable in highly sparse networks given the total CPT duration is fixed. Finally, we discuss and exemplify with some early results the potential of the proposed CPT framework for MUD, and highlight relevant research directions.}

In the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, a novel enhanced NOMA scheme called NOMA with informative envelope (NOMA-IE) is proposed to explore extra flexibility from the envelope of NOMA signals. In this scheme, data bits are conveyed by the quantified signal envelope in addition to classic signal constellations. The subcarrier activation patterns of different users are jointly decided by the envelope former at the transmitter of NOMA-IE. At the receiver, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed, and the envelope detection coefficient is introduced to eliminate the error floor. Theoretical expressions of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and detection complexity are provided first. Then, considering the binary phase shift keying modulation, the block error rate and bit error rate are derived based on the two-subcarrier element. The analytical results reveal that the SIC error and the index error are the main factors degrading the error performance. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the NOMA-IE over the OFDM and OFDM-NOMA in terms of the error rate performance when all the schemes have the same spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {With the evolutional development of maritime networks, the explosive growth of maritime data has put forward elevated demands for the computing capabilities of maritime devices (MDs). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively improved compared with benchmarks.}

	abstract = {To liberate indoor industrial cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks from wired fronthaul, this paper proposes a multicarrier-division duplex (MDD)-enabled two-tier terahertz (THz) fronthaul scheme. In our scheme, two layers of fronthaul links rely on the mutually orthogonal subcarrier sets in the same THz band, while access links are implemented over sub-6G band. However, the proposed scheme leads to a complicated mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem incorporating access point (AP) clustering, device selection, the assignment of subcarrier sets and the resource allocation at both the central processing unit (CPU) and APs. Hence, in order to address the formulated problem, we first resort to the low-complexity but efficient heuristic methods thereby relaxing the involved binary variables. Then, the overall end-to-end optimization is implemented by iteratively optimizing the assignment of subcarrier sets and the number of AP clusters. Furthermore, an advanced MDD frame structure consisting of three parallel data streams is tailored for the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic AP clustering approach in dealing with the networks of varying sizes. Moreover, benefiting from the well-designed frame structure, MDD is capable of outperforming TDD in the two-tier fronthaul networks. Additionally, the effect of the THz bandwidth on system performance is analyzed, and it is shown that empowered by sufficient bandwidth, our proposed two-tier fully-wireless fronthaul scheme can achieve a comparable performance to the fiber-optic based systems. Finally, the superiority of the proposed MDD-enabled fronthaul scheme is verified in a practical scenario with realistic ray-tracing simulations.}

These proposed techniques can employ coherent and non-coherent detection and can be adjusted to achieve various spectral efficiencies by altering the number of multiplexed layers. Unlike our proposed LCSS and LDMCSS, other CSS alternatives for LPWANs cannot provide the same level of flexibility and SE. The performance of these techniques is evaluated in terms of bit error rate under different channel conditions, as well as with phase and frequency offsets.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted extensive attention in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems because of the capability of configuring the wireless propagation environment. However, due to the existence of a RIS between the transmitter and receiver, a large number of channel coefficients need to be estimated, resulting in more pilot overhead. In this paper, we propose a joint sparse and low-rank based two-stage channel estimation scheme for RIS-assisted mmWave systems. Specifically, we first establish a low-rank approximation model against the noisy channel, fitting in with the precondition of the compressed sensing theory for perfect signal recovery. To overcome the difficulty of solving the low-rank problem, we propose a trace operator to replace the traditional nuclear norm operator, which can better approximate the rank of a matrix. Furthermore, by utilizing the sparse characteristics of the mmWave channel, sparse recovery is carried out to estimate the RIS-assisted channel in the second stage. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain in terms of estimation accuracy compared to the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Massive devices have become a bottleneck restricting the improvement of computing networks. In this paper, we investigate massive multiple access (MA) schemes in low earth orbit satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) integrated multi-tier computing networks to achieve higher connectivity. A game-theoretic MA approach is proposed for sum data minimization at UAVs. This approach is divided into two parts: data node (DN)-UAV assignment and UAV-satellite matching. In the first part, the DNs’ orthogonal MA process is formulated as a coalition formation game (CFG) with the derived optimal bandwidth allocation. The CFG with the proposed Max-Satisfaction order is proofed as an exact potential game, which can maximize the satisfaction between the collected data and UAVs’ real computing capacities. Besides, the overlapping CFG (OCFG) is utilized for higher satisfaction. In UAV-satellite matching, non-orthogonal MA-based sum rate maximization with imperfect successive interference cancellation is obtained by transmit power optimization firstly. The UAV-satellite matching process is formulated as a many-to-one matching game (MTOMG). A swap-based MTOMG algorithm is proposed for UAVs grouping. Finally, the simulation results show the proposed schemes have better performance than other schemes, and the proposed approach remains the lowest data at UAVs compared to other approaches.}

	abstract = {The era of ubiquitous, affordable wireless connectivity has opened doors to countless practical applications. In this context, ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) stands out, utilizing passive tags to establish connections with readers by harnessing reflected ambient radio frequency (RF) signals. However, conventional data detectors face limitations due to their inadequate knowledge of channel and RF-source parameters. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach using a deep neural network (DNN) for channel state information (CSI) estimation and signal detection within AmBC systems. Unlike traditional methods that separate CSI estimation and data detection, our approach leverages a DNN to implicitly estimate CSI and simultaneously detect data. The DNN model, trained offline using simulated data derived from channel statistics, excels in online data recovery, ensuring robust performance in practical scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations validate the superiority of our proposed DNN method over traditional detectors, particularly in terms of bit error rate (BER). In high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, our method exhibits an impressive approximately 20% improvement in BER performance compared to the maximum likelihood (ML) approach. These results underscore the effectiveness of our developed approach for AmBC channel estimation and signal detection. In summary, our method outperforms traditional detectors, bolstering the reliability and efficiency of AmBC systems, even in challenging channel conditions.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emergency communication network. Multiple STAR-RISs are deployed to provide additional and intelligent transmission links between trapped users and UAV-mounted base station (BS). Each user selects the nearest STAR-RIS for uploading data, and NOMA is employed for users located at the same side of the same STAR-RIS. Considering practical requirements of post-disaster emergency communications, we formulate a throughput maximization problem subject to constraints on minimum average rate and maximum energy consumption, where the UAV trajectory, STAR-RIS passive beamforming, and time and power allocation are jointly optimized. Furthermore, we propose a Lagrange based reward constrained proximal policy optimization (LRCPPO) algorithm, which provides an adaptive method for solving the long-term optimization problem with cumulative constraints. Specifically, using Lagrange relaxation, the original problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem with a two-layer structure. The inner layer is solved by penalized reward based proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. In the outer layer, Lagrange multipliers are updated by gradient descent. Numerical results show the proposed algorithm can effectively improve network performance while satisfying the constraints well. It also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed STAR-RIS assisted UAV NOMA network architecture over the benchmark schemes employing reflecting-only RISs and orthogonal multiple access.}

	abstract = {This paper studies covert MIMO ambient backscatter communication (AmBC). In contrast to the prior covert AmBC works, we equip all devices with multiple antennas, where a backscatter tag works as a beamformer to hide both his transmission behavior and location from a warden. Technically, we derive two key metrics, namely the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) measuring the transmission covertness and the covert rate measuring the transmission efficiency. We reveal that they both increase monotonically w.r.t the number of the tag’s antenna. This tradeoff makes the optimum parameter configuration non-trivial. To this end, we optimize the beamformer of the tag to maximize the covert rate subject to the covertness constraint under perfect knowledge of the warden’s channel state information (WCSI). We use the matrix permutation and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method to make the formulated non-convex problem convex, and obtain the solution with the barrier method. We also study the impact of imperfect WCSI. To address the uncertain estimate error, we use the S-Procedure to reformulate the constraints linearly and the primal-dual interior-point method for a near-optimal solution. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and confirm that our work outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.}

	abstract = {The advent of Satellite as a Service (SaaS) platforms has empowered satellite service providers (SPs) to rent portions of satellite capacity from infrastructure providers (IPs) to cater to the diverse demands of their users across multiple satellite services. To effectively manage costs and maintain a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for numerous concurrent connections, SPs should secure flexible capacity from IPs. However, the irregular and unpredictable nature of traffic demands from various applications complicates the capacity-renting framework. This study presents a dynamic capacity allocation framework that efficiently handles diverse traffic flows with varying arrival rates, aiming to minimize rental costs while meeting blocking probability and QoE requirements. Utilizing the M_{t}/M_{t}/1 queuing model and a continuous-time Markov chain, the technical designs are framed as a statistical optimization problem. In this context, the system waiting-queue lengths are estimated using the transient probabilities of Kolmogorov equations. Subsequently, cumulative distribution functions are employed to re-formulate this stochastic optimization problem into a convex form, which can be tackled through the Lagrangian duality method.Through extensive simulations and numerical assessments, we illustrate our method’s efficacy, with the proposed algorithm outperforming benchmarks by reducing costs by up to 9.85% and 3.1%.}

	abstract = {To effectively meet the diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from proliferating applications, a widely-adopted practical solution in radio access network (RAN) is categorized QoS provisioning, which utilizes virtual networks (i.e., tenants) to support a limited number of service categories. Apparently, one critical issue is RAN resource allocation among coexisting tenants. However, conventional single objective-based approaches cannot ensure fairness among different service categories. Moreover, except for radio resource, computing and storage resources also need to be considered. Besides, appropriate allocation of computing and storage resources could help mitigating backhaul network congestion. Hence, we aim to optimize the key QoS indicators of three main service categories and reduce backhaul bandwidth consumption simultaneously. We formulate the problem of multi-dimensional resource allocation from RAN to tenants as a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is challenging to solve directly due to the competing objectives and the mutual-influenced resources. For guaranteeing fairness, this problem is reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem using weighted sum approach. Moreover, a decoupling-based iterative optimization (DBIO) algorithm is proposed to decompose it into three subproblems to solve iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate that DBIO algorithm can achieve superior performance with much less time consumption, compared with three metaheuristic algorithms.}

Recently, the technology of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-equipped-UAV has been investigated as a feasible approach to assist communication under such conditions. However, the channel characteristics in the post-disaster area rapidly change due to the topographical changes caused by secondary disasters and the high mobility of UAVs. In this paper we develop a new fading-shadowing model to fit the path loss caused by the debris. Following this, we derive the exact distribution of the new channel statistics for a small number of RIS elements and the approximate distribution for a large number of RIS elements, respectively. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions for performance analysis, including average capacity (AC), energy efficiency (EE), and outage probability (OP). Based on the above analytical derivations, we maximize the energy efficiency by optimizing the number of RIS elements and the coverage area by optimizing the altitude of the RIS-equipped UAV, respectively. Finally, simulation results validate the accuracy of derived expressions and show insights related to the optimal number of RIS elements and the optimal UAV altitude for emergency wireless communication (EWC).}

By utilizing DOA information from the RISS instead of conventional channel estimation, the pilot overhead is reduced and the RISS becomes independent of the hybrid access point (HAP), enabling efficient operation. Specifically, the RISS autonomously estimates the DOA of uplink signals from single-antenna users and reflects them using the HAP’s slowly varying DOA information. During downlink transmission, it updates the HAP’s DOA information and designs the reflection phase of energy signals based on the latest user DOA information. The paper includes a comprehensive performance analysis, covering system design, protocol details, receiving performance, and RISS deployment suggestions. We derive a closed-form expression to analyze system performance under DOA errors, and calculate the statistical distribution of user received energy using the moment-matching technique. We provide a recommended transmit power to meet a specified outage probability and energy threshold. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the conventional counterpart by 2.3 dB and 4.7 dB for Rician factors \\kappa _{h}=\\kappa _{G}=1 and \\kappa _{h}=\\kappa _{G}=10 , respectively.}

Bearing in mind the importance of AoI and energy consumption during the data collection process, we present a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the AoI and UAV energy consumption. To explore the tradeoff between AoI and energy consumption, we jointly optimize the collection time, the UAV trajectory, and the duration of time slots. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we divide the main problem into three sub-problems and address them by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) and Lagrangian dual methods. Finally, we design a multi-variable fixed algorithm to iteratively solve the three sub-problems.

To enable a harmonious coexistence between the two different types of services, we propose a resource-efficient mMTC/H2H coexistence scheme by jointly considering the random access (RA) and data transmission, where the entire uplink resources are divided for the proposed RA and data transmission procedures. Based on the proposed scheme, we derive the average achievable throughput of the bursty mMTC service and develop a time-nonhomogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the joint state transition of H2H user equipments (HUEs). To tackle the cumbersome Markov model, we approximately decompose the constructed time-nonhomogeneous Markov model into multiple independent Markov chains, where each decomposed Markov chain characterizes one single HUE’s state transition. Then, the decomposed Markov model is transformed into a semi-Markov process and the corresponding steady-state condition is obtained based on the queueing network analysis for H2H service. By approximating the evolution of number of HUEs in different states as M/M/1 queues, we derive the stationary probabilities for the embedded Markov chain of the semi-Markov process and obtain the data transmission success probability of each HUE. Based on the abovementioned analytical framework, we formulate a constrained nonlinear integer programming (NLIP) problem to maximize the mMTC throughput under the constraints of H2H quality-of-service (QoS) stabilization and resource allocation. By adopting the modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, we solve the formulated problem and obtain the efficient resource allocation strategy for the mMTC/H2H coexistence. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed analytical framework and modified PSO algorithm achieve close to the optimal mMTC/H2H coexisting performance and can be adapted to various network settings.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based adaptive polar coding scheme that adapts to various channel conditions and quality of service requirements. To ensure tight adaptation, we develop a new AI-based performance prediction framework for the precoded polar codes under the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder. This AI-based framework relies on a neural network and recent advancements in the analysis of precoded polar codes, SCL and SC decoders. Then we apply the proposed framework to optimise precoded polar codes for various target frame error rates (FER), signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and decoding list sizes L , where the code length is fixed to a power of two, but the code rate may vary. We predict the throughput and maximise it over the code rates with bit-level granularity. The proposed approach paves the way towards online adaptive polar coding with high error-correction capability. The constructed codes can be compactly specified using the reliability sequence from the 5G New Radio standard and a single parameter whose value is specific to each code. The simulation results show that the proposed codes outperform 5G polar codes with CRC11 under SCL decoding with various L .}

These codes are referred to as mixed-component SCCs (MC-SCCs). We propose a low-complexity ternary message passing decoding algorithm for MC-SCCs, where error-and-erasure decoding plays a core role and soft reliability is reconstructed by hard decisions and channel log-likelihood ratios. We develop the density evolution analysis that is applicable to both binary and non-binary algebraic codes to optimize the decoder. By properly selecting mixed components, we can construct low-error-floor MC-SCCs with a smaller size of decoding window (proportional to component lengths) and a faster speed of convergence compared with the conventional SCCs. Moreover, we verify that for various requirements of overhead and decoding window size, MC-SCCs can outperform the conventional SCCs with both BCH components in terms of both error-rate performance and decoding complexity.}

	abstract = {Recently, neural networks have improved MinSum message-passing decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by multiplying or adding weights to the messages, where the weights are determined by a neural network. The neural network complexity to determine distinct weights for each edge is high, often limiting the application to relatively short LDPC codes. Furthermore, storing separate weights for every edge and every iteration can be a burden for hardware implementations. To reduce neural network complexity and storage requirements, this paper proposes a family of weight-sharing schemes that use the same weight for edges that have the same check node degree and/or variable node degree. Our simulation results show that node-degree-based weight-sharing can deliver the same performance requiring distinct weights for each node. This paper also combines these degree-specific neural weights with a reconstruction-computation-quantization (RCQ) decoder to produce a weighted RCQ (W-RCQ) decoder. The W-RCQ decoder with node-degree-based weight sharing has a reduced hardware requirement compared with the original RCQ decoder. As an additional contribution, this paper identifies and resolves a gradient explosion issue that can arise when training neural LDPC decoders.}

	abstract = {In non-cooperative communication systems, effective parameter identification with small samples intercepted bitstream is a major challenge. Faced with this demand, a solution to blind recognition for BCH and RS codes is presented. Firstly, the intercepted bitstream is analyzed, and the optimal code-set with high reliability is selected by channel soft information. Secondly, the optimal code-set is cycled into a pseudo cyclic matrix according to the algebraic structure of the codewords, which is employed for the code length and synchronization recognition based on the improved rank criterion. Finally, the code spectrum analysis of the optimal code-set is performed to complete primitive and generator polynomial recognition, and a recoding operation is proposed to judge the recognition performance. Simulations validate the proposed algorithms by recognition probability in terms of different parameters, it hardly depends on the number of codewords but on the accuracy of the optimal code-set, which is especially suitable for small sample datasets. Under the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel with Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation, the recognition probability is still comparable to or superior to the existing schemes, even if only one-twentieth of the intercepted codewords are used.}

In this paper, a novel asynchronous spread spectrum technique, called Golden Modulation, is introduced. This modulation provides a vast family of equivalent waveforms with very low cross-correlation even in asynchronous conditions, hence enabling naturally massive multiuser operation without the need for inter-user synchronization or interference cancellation receivers. The basic modulation principles, which rely on spectrum spreading via direct Zadoff-Chu sequences modulation, are presented and the corresponding theoretical bit error rate performance in additive white Gaussian noise and multi-path channels is derived and compared by simulation with realistic receiver performance. The demodulation of the Golden Modulation is described, and its performance in the presence of uncoordinated multiple users is characterized and compared against LoRa in a variety of scenarios. Various higher-layer and backward compatibility issues are also discussed.}

In this paper, the dirty tape channel (AWGN channel with Gaussian state interference causally known by the transmitter) with noiseless/noisy feedback is investigated. First, SK-type feedback schemes are proposed for this model by introducing a lattice-based strategy into the classical SK scheme, and it is shown that this strategy helps to eliminate the impact of the state interference and the feedback channel noise on the performance of the SK scheme. Then, we analyze the security performance of the proposed schemes, in particular, for the dirty tape channel with noisy feedback and eavesdropper, we give a lower bound on the normalized eavesdropper’s equivocation by establishing a novel inequality about the differential entropy of the Gaussian modulo-lattice function. Finally, performances of our proposed schemes are further explained by numerical examples.}

By leveraging the decomposition results of several random variables, i.e., uniform, exponential, and truncated exponential random variables, and adopting a superposition coding (SC) scheme, the inner bound on the capacity region is derived. Then, the outer bound is derived by applying the conditional entropy power inequality (EPI). In the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the inner bound asymptotically matches the outer bound, thus characterizing the high-SNR asymptotic capacity region. The bounds are also extended to the general K\n-user BCs without loss of high-SNR asymptotic optimality.}

In particular, we focus on the problem of total end-to-end (E2E) latency minimization for the considered system under the joint optimization of beamforming design at the RIS, power, bandwidth allocation, processing rates, and task offloading parameters using DT architecture. To tackle the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we first model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). Later, we adopt deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve it effectively. We have compared the DDPG results with proximal policy optimization (PPO), modified PPO (M-PPO), and conventional alternating optimization (AO) algorithms. Simulation results depict that the proposed DT-enabled resource allocation scheme for the RIS-empowered MEC network using DDPG algorithm achieves up to 60% lower transmission delay and 20% lower energy consumption compared to the scheme without an RIS. This confirms the practical advantages of leveraging RIS technology in MEC systems. Results demonstrate that DDPG outperforms M-PPO and PPO in terms of higher reward value and better learning efficiency, while M-PPO and PPO exhibit lower execution time than DDPG and AO due to their advanced policy optimization techniques. Thus, the results validate the effectiveness of the DRL solutions over AO for dynamic resource allocation w.r.t. reduced execution time.}

In DP-OTA-FedAvg, gradients are aligned using an alignment coefficient and then aggregated over the air, utilizing channel noise to ensure participant privacy. This study highlights two critical tradeoffs in aligned over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) systems with limited power and privacy budgets. Firstly, it reveals the tradeoff between the number of scheduled devices and the alignment coefficient. Secondly, it investigates the balance between aggregation distortion and local training error while adhering to the sum power constraint. Specifically, we measure privacy using differential privacy (DP) and perform convergence analyses for both convex and non-convex loss functions. These analyses provide insights into how device scheduling, the alignment coefficient, and the number of global aggregations affect both privacy preservation and the learning process. Building on these analytical results, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the optimality gap of DP-OTA-FedAvg under power and privacy constraints. By specifying the number of aggregation rounds, we derive a closed-form expression describing the relationship between the alignment coefficient and the number of scheduled devices. We then tackle the problem through iterative optimization of scheduling and aggregation rounds. The effectiveness of the proposed policies is verified through simulations, and the performance advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios where devices have poor channel conditions and limited sum-power budgets.}

In particular, our proposed Comm-Trans Net serves as an integrated DL-based receiver for unknown channel conditions. Our results show that the proposed Comm-Trans Net can outperform the bit-error rate (BER) performance compared to minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) receiver, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based receivers. Moreover, our proposed Comm-Trans Net is robust for multiple communication scenarios ranging from the TDL-A channel to the TDL-E channel with different levels of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and line-of-sight (LoS) components. Also, the computational complexity of the proposed Comm-Trans Net is studied, which shows that the attention mechanism for channel positional encoding is a cost-effective solution to improve the quality of service.}

The FD relay employs hybrid architecture with a fewer radio frequency (RF) chains than the antennas. Further, the users observe spatially-correlated Rician channels. For this system, we propose a novel optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) that not only provides a much higher spectral efficiency (SE) than the conventional maximal ratio (MR) combiner, but also has better multi-user-interference (MUI) cancellation capability, which translates to low latency, as the system can schedule a large number of URLLC users. The OBE achieves this gain by exploiting spatial correlation in the system, an aspect we analytically demonstrate. We also derive a SE lower bound for this system, which is used to maximize the global energy efficiency (GEE) metric. The objective of GEE is a fractional function of the optimization variables, and is non-convex. We extend the fractional programming tools – Lagrangian dual and Quadratic transforms – to optimize the GEE. We show that a hybrid DF relay has a higher GEE, and a similar SE as that of a digital amplify-and-forward relay. We also show the higher GEE provided by a combination of OBE design and hybrid architecture, when compared with conventional combiners and digital architecture.}

The CUs are served by the mMIMO base station (BS), while the D2D user-pairs communicate without BS intervention. We design a novel interference-aware maximal ratio (IA-MR) combiner, and show that it has a similar spectral efficiency (SE) as the zero forcing (ZF) combiner, and that too with a much lesser computational complexity. The IA-MR combiner recovers the SE loss due to URLLC and D2D underlaying in multi-cell mMIMO systems. We also derive closed-form SE expression for the IA-MR combiner by assuming spatially-correlated Rician-faded channels, and use them to maximize the global energy efficiency (GEE) metric. The URLLC and D2D operations cause the GEE to become non-convex, as it now contains difference-of-concave and coupled fractional functions of optimization variables. We propose an optimization framework to tackle this non-convexity by using the quadratic and Lagrangian dual transforms. The proposed framework is also clubbed with a stochastic technique to optimize the GEE for ZF and minimum mean squared error equalizers, which do not have closed-form SE expressions.}

	abstract = {Efficient implementation of Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) is crucial in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a large number of antennas at the base station (BS) serving many user equipments (UEs). To address the high computational complexity of THP, in this paper, we first propose novel THP update algorithms that can avoid recomputing the THP filters when a new UE arrives or departs. Specifically, by using the Gram-Schmidt process and a series of Givens matrices, the THP filters are computed without full matrix operations. Then we extend the THP update algorithms to a more general scenario when multiple multi-antenna UEs arrive or depart. In this case, the proposed algorithms use both direct and iterative approaches. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is derived and compared with that of the conventional THP. Finally, to further align with the practical scenario, we analyze and derive the approximate close-form expressions for the sum achievable rate of the proposed algorithms under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The impact of quasi-static fading and slow time-varying scenarios with imperfect CSI on the communication performance of the proposed algorithms is also evaluated.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating time-varying quantum noise. Specifically, we focus on Pauli qubit noise with time-variations and attempt to construct the most accurate instantaneous channel description. To this end, we propose an adaptive framework of simultaneous communication and parameter estimation (SCAPE) that efficiently and accurately estimates the time-varying Pauli channel while communicating reliably over the channel being estimated. This adaptive framework gives the informed control of communication rate–parameter estimation tradeoff to communicating parties. Interestingly, this adaptive SCAPE requires post-processing entirely on the receiver’s end and minimal feedback to the sender to increase, decrease, or continue with the same code rate of employed error correcting code. This procedure can be particularly useful in time-varying quantum channels with natural periodic deviations in channel conditions, e.g., in satellite communication channels.}

	abstract = {Multipartite entanglement plays a crucial role for the design of the Quantum Internet, due to its peculiarities with no classical counterpart. Yet, for entanglement-based quantum networks, a key open issue is constituted by the lack of an effective entanglement access control (EAC) strategy for properly handling and coordinating the quantum nodes in accessing the entangled resource. In this paper, we design a quantum-genuine entanglement access control (EAC) to solve the contention problem arising in accessing a multipartite entangled resource. The proposed quantum-genuine EAC is able to: i) fairly select a subset of nodes granted with the access to the contended resource; ii) preserve the privacy and anonymity of the identities of the selected nodes; iii) avoid to delegate the signaling arising with entanglement access control to the classical network. We also conduct a theoretical analysis of noise effects on the proposed EAC. This theoretical analysis is able to catch the complex noise effects on the EAC through meaningful parameters.}

As the key feature of this work, we calculate the discrete-input-continuous-output for memory-less channel (DCMC) capacity of the authentic and eavesdropping channel in the presence of the atmospheric turbulence characterised by \\alpha -\\mu\nprobability density function (PDF), zero and non-zero boresight pointing error, and partial band or broadband jamming noise. For this purpose, novel PDFs for all-encompassing conditions of FSO channel and the received signals at different nodes of the considered system are formulated. Thereafter, we devise schemes to wane the effect of a vicious Eve by formulating novel closed-form expressions of average secrecy capacity for both strategies. Our derived analytical expressions can be used as tools to examine the DCMC capacity and secrecy capacity for different turbulence regimes of FSO link, severity of boresight errors, and activity of a friendly jammer. The mathematical results are affirmed by Monte-Carlo simulation. We exhibit that deploying a friendly jammer to assist enhancing the security of an FSO system is very conducive as it makes the Eve to hike its signal-to-jamming-noise ratio by almost 10 dB when the jammer’s activity increases from 10% to 100% of the time frame of data transmission.}

In this paper, we investigate finite blocklength covert communication assisted by a multi-antenna relay station and a multi-antenna destination to fight against hostile detection from a warden also equipped with multiple antennas and interference from an uninformed jammer. In order to achieve optimal covert communication performance, we formulate the optimization problems in the single-user and the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) multi-user scenarios separately. In the single-user scenario, we design a cooperative beamforming strategy for the relay and the destination to maximize their received signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR). Then in the multi-user scenario, we utilize the above beamforming strategy and propose a majorization-minimization-based relay’s power allocation algorithm to maximize the total covert throughput rate. The numerical results are provided to depict the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and we address how the jamming power and the numbers of antennas affect covert communication based on these numerical results and theoretical analysis.}

	abstract = {Steganographic coding is an essential part of adaptive steganography. There are only two practical near-optimal codes in the context of adaptive steganography so far: Syndrome-Trellis Codes (STCs) based on linear convolutional codes and Steganographic Polar Codes (SPCs) based on polar codes. It can be noticed that both STCs and SPCs are based on channel codes. Like the need for the variety of cryptographic algorithms, to make steganography practical and secure, it is important to devise more adaptive steganographic codes to create more choices for users. Moreover, we want to solve the long-lasting problem of whether lossy source codes-based near-optimal adaptive steganographic coding exists. In this paper, we consider using Low-Density Generator-Matrix (LDGM) codes in adaptive steganography where a new algorithm is proposed. First, we describe the framework of our LDGM codes-based steganographic coding algorithm and establish rigorous upper bounds on average embedding efficiency for individual LDGM steganographic codes with a given information bit degree distribution under the constant distortion profile. Then, we give a provably optimal method of distortion incorporation for adaptive steganography and provide the corresponding log-domain Belief Propagation Guided Decimation (log-BPGD) algorithm to minimize the additive distortion. The syndrome coding technique is applied to realize definitive encoding and decoding of the secret message. We report experiments for various distortion profiles, payload rates, and code lengths. The results verify the near-optimal performance of the proposed method, by which the possibility of designing near-optimal adaptive steganographic coding methods based on lossy source coding is confirmed.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been recognized as a promising technology for enhancing the computation capability for next generation wireless networks. This paper studies physical layer security for an MEC network, where multiple users desire to securely offload part of their computation tasks to a base station (BS) simultaneously using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) subject to the potential overhearing of a malicious eavesdropper. The secrecy outage probability (SOP) is adopted as a secrecy performance metric of the computation offloading against eavesdropping attacks. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of the MEC system subject to an individual SOP constraint for each user. To this end, we jointly design each user’s local computing bits, the transmit power, the secrecy code rates, as well as the successive interference cancellation decoding order at the BS side. As the formulated problem is highly non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition (PDD) and sequential convex approximation methods to obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. To reduce the computational complexity, we further propose a reverse recursion (RR) algorithm and derive semi-closed-form solutions to the design problem. Numerical results are presented to validate the convergence and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. We show that the minimal total energy consumption obtained via either the PDD or RR method approaches the optimal performance of exhaustive search as the task duration increases. It is also demonstrated that the RR algorithm can achieve a comparable performance to that of the PDD algorithm while enjoying a much lower computational complexity.}

Using the unified near-field and far-field model obtained by expressing the source position in the modified polar representation (MPR), two different methods, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method that achieves noise resilience and the two-step closed-from solution method that accomplishes low complexity, are proposed to jointly estimate the MPR coordinates and the propagation speed. For the SDR method, we express the propagation speed as the sum of a pre-selected constant and the residual to form a non-convex constrained weighted least squares problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite program by applying SDR. The two-step method obtains a coarse estimate in Step 1 by solving the quadratic programming problem without considering the relations among the variables, and then refines the coarse estimate in Step 2 by estimating the correction to compensate the error resulting from ignoring the relations. Theoretical mean square error analysis confirms that the proposed methods can reach the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound performance, which is also validated by using both simulated and real data.}

	abstract = {Online Bayesian learning-assisted channel state information (CSI) estimation schemes are conceived for single input single output (SISO) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulated systems. To begin with, an end-to-end system model is derived in the delay-Doppler (DD)-domain, followed by an online CSI estimation (CE) framework for SISO-OTFS systems. Next, the sequential minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is derived for this model which utilizes expectation maximization (EM) based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) for initialization of the online estimation procedure. Additionally, a low-complexity detection technique is developed for the system under consideration, which is accomplished via an analogous time-frequency (TF)-domain system model that leads to a block-diagonal TF-domain channel matrix. The paradigm designed for online CE is subsequently extended to MIMO-OTFS systems. The corresponding DD-domain CSI is shown to be simultaneously row and group sparse. Hence a novel EM-based row and group sparse Bayesian learning scheme is developed for determining the initialization parameters for the above online algorithm. As a further continuation, a low-complexity detector is also proposed for MIMO-OTFS systems based on an iterative block matrix inversion technique. Furthermore, time-recursive Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bounds (BCRLBs) are derived to benchmark the MSE performance of the proposed schemes for both the systems. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed online estimation techniques.}

In this paper, we consider the problem of energy harvesting for RISs in the absence of coordination with the ambient RF source. We propose a series of sequential phase-alignment algorithms that maximize the received power based on only power measurements. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal value for the noiseless scenario. However, for the noisy scenario, we propose a linear least squares estimator. We prove that within the class of linear estimators, the optimal set of measurement phases are equally-spaced phases. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we introduce a random phase update algorithm as a benchmark. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the random phase update method in terms of achieved power after convergence while requiring fewer measurements per phase update. Using simulations, we show that in a noiseless scenario with a discrete set of possible phase shifts for the RIS elements, the proposed method is sub-optimal, achieving a higher value than the random algorithm but not exactly the maximum feasible value that we obtained by exhaustive search.}

In particular, the IRS is used to improve the efficiency of wireless energy transfer, and alleviate the harmful interference between the communication and AirComp signals. To balance the performance of such an integrated system, we present two joint beamforming and reflection optimization problems via minimizing the computation distortion and maximizing the sum rate, respectively. To solve the non-convex problems, we develop the alternating optimization framework with proved convergence, in which the penalty function-based method and variable substitution technique are exploited to acquire the optimal solutions of beamformers and reflection parameters.

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is an emerging technique for the next generation of communication systems. However, due to multiple performance metrics used for communication and sensing, the limited number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) in optimizing ISAC systems poses a challenge. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can introduce new DoF for beamforming in ISAC systems, thereby enhancing the performance of communication and sensing simultaneously. In this paper, we propose two optimization techniques for beamforming in RIS-assisted ISAC systems. The first technique is an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and a one-dimension iterative (ODI) algorithm, which can maximize the radar mutual information (MI) while imposing constraints on the communication rates. The second technique is an AO algorithm based on the Riemannian gradient (RG) method, which can maximize the weighted ISAC performance metrics. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. The AO-SDR-ODI method is shown to achieve better communication and sensing performance, than the AO-RG method, at a higher complexity. It is also shown that the mean-squared-error (MSE) of the estimates of the sensing parameters decreases as the radar MI increases.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is a promising technique for future 6G communications. The sharp increase in the number of antennas results in a transition of electromagnetic propagation from the far-field to the near-field. Due to the near-field effect, the exhaustive near-field beam training at all angles and distances requires very high overhead. The improved fast near-field beam training scheme based on time-delay structure can reduce the overhead, but it suffers from very high hardware costs and energy consumption caused by time-delay circuits. In this paper, we propose a near-field two dimension (2D) hierarchical beam training scheme to reduce the overhead without the need for extra hardware circuits. Specifically, we first formulate the multi-resolution near-field codewords design problem covering different angle and distance coverages. Next, inspired by phase retrieval problems in digital holography imaging technology, we propose a Gerchberg-Saxton (GS)-based algorithm to acquire the theoretical codeword by considering the fully digital architecture. Based on the theoretical codeword, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to acquire the practical codeword considering the hybrid digital-analog architecture. Finally, with the designed multi-resolution codebooks, we propose a near-field 2D hierarchical beam training scheme to significantly reduce the training overhead, which is verified by extensive simulation results.}

	abstract = {The power amplifier (PA) is an indispensable component in wireless communication systems, while the nonlinearity induced by PA can lead to significant performance degradation. The conventional nonlinearity equalization (NLE) method can effectively mitigate the nonlinear effects and provide superior BER performance but requires intensive computational complexity. To this end, we propose a novel NLE method in the time domain, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity without sacrificing the BER performance. Specifically, we first propose a novel PA representation of the sum of products (SPs), which is a unified time-domain representation for several typical memory and memoryless PA models. On this basis, the SPs-iterative least square equalizer (SPs-ILSE) method is proposed to mitigate the impact of both the memory and memoryless PA’s nonlinear distortions at the receiver side. The computational complexity of complex multiplication (CCCM) in the proposed method is O(N\\text {log}N) for the memoryless PA models and O(KN^{2}) for the memory PA models. Moreover, considering the commonly utilized PA models, we also derive the closed-form expression for the achievable SINR of the SPs-ILSE method in the ideal conditions. Numerical results show that (i) the closed-form SINR expression is valid for both the memory and memoryless scenarios (ii) the proposed method exhibits the superior bit error rate (BER) performance in comparison to several relevant nonlinear signal processing methods such as digital pre-distortion (DPD), and power amplifier nonlinearity cancellation (PANC) (iii) the proposed NLE method achieves the same BER performance as the previous NLE method, i.e., reconstruction of distorted signals (RODS), while the CCCM of the proposed method is much lower.}

	abstract = {Precise parameter estimation is essential for developing effective channel models. However, jointly estimating the various channel parameters is a challenging problem as these parameters can only be extracted from comprehensive data collected during massive measurement activities. Traditional algorithms suffer from limited estimation accuracy due to high mobility and signal correlation. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity full-dimension parameter extraction algorithm. The method extends the forward-backward spatial smoothing technique to estimate two-dimensional (2-D) angle information in the uniform planar array (UPA), enhancing aperture size and providing higher resolution for coherent signals. Then, we provide a Doppler compensation technique to prevent the deterioration in complex amplitude estimation quality caused by large Doppler frequency in high-speed mobile environments. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is also applied to the fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) system. To remedy power leakage in the channel impulse response (CIR), we propose an eigenvalue-assisted sampling point selection scheme. This scheme preserves sampling positions abundant in channel information to reduce computational complexity and eliminate most noise. Simulation and field tests show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance with lower computational complexity compared to the existing algorithm.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications and ultra-high frequency bands are both potential enablers for satisfying extreme performance requirements of future wireless systems. Thanks to low hardware cost and power consumption, holographic metasurface antennas (HMAs) operating at high frequencies have recently emerged as an effective realization of large-scale antenna arrays, leading to greatly enlarged near-field region. In this paper, we investigate a power-efficient HMA-based near-field downlink multiuser system, where three different HMA-based arrays are considered. Specifically, we aim to minimize the total transmit power for each HMA-based array while maintaining the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraint of each user by jointly optimizing the digital transmit precoder and the analog HMA weighting matrix. In the special single-user scenario, we validate that the original optimization problem can be decomposed into several independent subproblems each corresponding to a single HMA microstrip, whose optimal solution can be obtained by the successive convex approximation (SCA) based method. It is also revealed that the HMA-based array is capable of achieving near-field beam focusing. In the general multiuser scenario, we develop an efficient SCA-alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to tackle the intractable optimization problem, where the digital precoders and the HMA weighting matrix are iteratively optimized in an alternating manner. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms over existing benchmark schemes. It is also shown that the HMA-based array attains lower hardware overhead and power consumption as compared to the conventional hybrid array.}

We adopt a blockage-aware channel model to characterize the practical blockage effects for air-to-ground (A2G) links caused by buildings. Aiming to minimize the mission completion time while satisfying the data collection requirements of UEs, we formulate a problem by jointly optimizing the UAV three-dimensional (3-D) trajectory and resource allocation, including the UE scheduling and subcarrier assignment. To solve the formulated non-convex combinatorial programming problem, we propose a suboptimal algorithm that solves two subproblems iteratively. Specifically, in each iteration, the trajectory design subproblem jointly optimizes the UAVs’ waypoints and time slot length to decrease the mission completion time, which is solved by employing block successive convex approximation (BSCA). For the resource allocation subproblem, we develop a heuristic algorithm for UE scheduling and subcarrier assignment to increase the collected data volume for a given time duration. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of mission completion time compared to benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Placing selected content at the edge of the network close to the users, known as caching, is an important technique to improve the efficiency of content delivery in wireless networks. In this paper, we consider caching in a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which the primary fronthaul link operates in the mmWave range and may switch to microwave frequencies in the case of blockage. We aim to minimize the average long-term network cost by optimizing dynamic fetching and caching decisions. Importantly, we consider the realistic case of user request distributions and blockage rates being a priori unknown and not necessarily stationary. We introduce change point detection (CPD) to detect significant changes in the environment; we couple this step with reinforcement learning (RL): our key contribution, the proposed change point detection assisted reinforcement learning (CPRL) algorithm learns the environment and (re-)optimizes the caching policy to solve the associated Markov decision process (MDP) problem. Essentially, CPD allows our learning algorithm to adapt its caching strategy to the new environment which shows faster convergence. The numerical results show that our proposed approach improves the efficiency of caching in wireless networks, making it more adaptable to changing request patterns over time.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) usually consists of a large number of passive elements, for which the element-grouping strategies can be adopted to group adjacent elements into a sub-surface for lower computational complexity. For the grouped elements of a sub-surface, the linear gradient phase shift configuration can achieve directional IRS reflect beam towards the intended receiver. In this paper, we propose a practical scalable optimization framework for element-grouping IRS by adopting the amplitude-dependent phase-gradient directional beamforming, which induces a new amplitude-phase coupling to the reflected signal. Specifically, by deriving the phase-gradient condition from Fermat’s principle, we propose a practical phase-gradient IRS reflection model. Under this practical model, the amplitude-phase coupling becomes complicated, which brings technical challenges to the IRS beamforming optimization. We study a joint transmit and reflect beamforming optimization problem to minimize the transmit power. By designing a trigonometric transformation to deal with the complicated amplitude-phase coupling, we propose a penalty-based phase control strategy under given element grouping. Subsequently, to solve the element-grouping combinatorial problem with performance guarantee, we propose a low-complexity IRS reflect beamforming algorithm based on Markov approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves substantial performance gains compared to conventional schemes.}

We propose a joint Time Switching (TS) scheme in which transmitters, receivers, and the relay/IRS are either in their energy or information transmission/reception modes. The transmitted multi-carrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms are used for Energy Harvesting (EH) and Information Decoding (ID) modes, respectively. In order to design an optimal fair system, we maximize the minimum rate of all pairs for both relay and IRS systems through a unified framework. This framework allows us to simultaneously design energy waveforms, find optimal relay/IRS amplification/reflection matrices, allocate powers for information waveforms, and allocate time durations for various phases. This problem turns out to be non-convex. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm by using the Minorization-Maximization (MM) technique, which efficiently converges to the optimized solution, i.e., stationary point of the problem (under mild conditions). Numerical examples show that the proposed method improves the performance of the multi-pair WIPT relay/IRS system under various setups.}

	abstract = {Blockage effects can dramatically deteriorate high frequency cellular network performance. One practical solution is to apply macro-diversity technique, where the user associates with more than one Base Station (BS), to improve the chance of Light-Of-Sight (LOS) link availability. However, how the correlations are brought by both blockages and cooperative BSs is still unclear due to the analytical complexity. In addition, these two kinds of correlations are highly coupled and further impact macro-diversity gain. On basis of the cascade blockage model, this paper proposes a new functional framework to evaluate macro-diversity gains from the perspective of a typical user subjected to three metrics: joint LOS probability, conditional LOS probability and coverage probability. We first derive a set of tractable functional equations to describe three performance metrics. Then corresponding iterative algorithms that can be solved efficiently are designed respectively for three metrics. This analytical framework gains insight into contradictory requirements for macro-diversity, which not only guide the usage of Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) in realistic environments, but also determine the beamforming usage in mmWave band. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of this functional framework by a simplified joint transmission example.}

	abstract = {Media-based modulation (MBM) is a novel technique for embedding information in the channel states via intentional perturbations of the transmission media. This article provides an overview of MBM and its benefits while highlighting relevant challenges and future research directions. We explain how MBM differs from source-based modulation and how it addresses issues in legacy multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, such as deep fades and MIMO diversity-multiplexing trade-off. We demonstrate how MBM works in harmony with other index modulations and improves upon them by providing similar advantages with a more compact transmitter. Numerical results (simulation and analytical) support these claims and include outage comparison with legacy MIMO systems, comparisons with other state-of-the-art modulation schemes, and a performance example showcasing transmitting 32 bits of information in a single channel use with an excellent symbol error rate of $\\mathsf {SER} \\simeq 10^{-5}$ at “energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio” of $\\mathsf {E_{b}/N_{0}} \\simeq -3.5$ dB. The article continues with methods to address the issues of receiver training and decoding for large constellation sets. A number of other research questions, such as pulse shaping to limit bandwidth expansion due to the time-varying nature of MBM and the effect of forward error correcting codes on MBM diversity order are discussed. We present an RF transceiver structure that generates independent propagation paths for embedding information. Fabrication and testing of the transceiver structure show close agreement between simulation and measurement. There are inherent connections between MBM and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS). These connections, including the application of MBM in beamforming, are discussed. We present a solution that involves the integration of a filtering radiating patch within the MBM walls to restrict bandwidth expansion. Lastly, we delve into several specific application domains for MBM.}

	abstract = {The statistical gap between existing correlation-based stochastic channel models (CBSMs) and practical propagation is a longstanding issue, especially for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission. To address this problem, a pervasively correlated channel model (PCCM) applicable to MIMO channels with arbitrary antenna configurations and scenarios is proposed. Unlike the conventional jointly correlated channel model (JCCM) based on an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random matrix, a new random matrix whose elements are independent and nonidentically distributed (i.n.d.) generalized Gamma complex Gaussian mixture (GGCGM) variables with correlated envelopes is used to approximate the real channel statistics better. Moreover, the PCCM can be simplified via the Rayleigh fading assumption for rapid evaluation of channel performance and supports backward compatibility with existing CBSMs under specific assumptions. Demonstrative numerical experiments for MIMO channels are conducted based on the 3GPP TR 38.901 model considering various scenarios, frequencies, and antenna configurations. The channel capacity distributions are obtained based on random samples generated using the geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM), the JCCM, and the proposed PCCM. The numerical results show that the PCCM is more flexible than the JCCM with respect to high-order statistics, enabling more accurate estimation of massive MIMO transmission channel performance.}

	abstract = {Non-Terrestrial Networks represent a valuable solution for providing connectivity to Internet of Things (IoT) devices in remote areas, where classical infrastructure is unavailable. Due to the low-power nature of IoT devices, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can prevent the energy depletion of these Ground Nodes (GNs) by employing Wireless Power Transfer through an array antenna. Starting from the mathematical modeling of such a scenario, two Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming problems are formulated to fairly maximize (i) the energy distribution and (ii) the total amount of data transmitted to a Low Earth Orbit CubeSat. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the drone kinematics, the transmission scheduling plan, and the beamforming vectors of the array antenna. To cope with their non-convexity, both problems are mathematically manipulated to reach a tractable form, for which two optimization algorithms are proposed and their complexity analyzed. To prove the effectiveness of the overall solution, a comprehensive simulation campaign is conducted under several parameter settings, such as number of GNs and UAV antenna elements with different transmission power levels. Finally, the proposal is compared with a baseline, which confirms the superiority of the proposal up to 7 times in terms of total transmitted data.}

	abstract = {An integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system assisted by distributed passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) is proposed in this paper, which enables simultaneous signal demodulation and location sensing, without channel state information (CSI). A detailed workflow of the proposed IRS-based ISAC system is designed, including transmission protocol, joint location sensing and demodulation, as well as beamforming optimization. Specifically, each coherent block consists of two stages, and each stage is divided into two time blocks, where the signal demodulation, channel estimation, and location sensing are conducted by the proposed integrated localization and demodulation (I-LAD) algorithm, simultaneously. Simulation results show that the signal demodulation performance of the proposed I-LAD algorithm is close to that of the benchmark scheme assuming perfect CSI. At the same time, the channel estimation performance is comparable to that of the parallel factor decomposition (PAPRFAC) method or the compressive sensing-based channel estimation (CS-EST) method. In addition, the proposed location sensing scheme almost achieves the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for distributed IRS-assisted localization-only systems, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed I-LAD algorithm.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-out (CF-mMIMO) systems provide limited coverage because of expensive wired fronthaul between access points (APs) and central processing unit (CPU). To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), acting as an aerial AP, works coherently with the ground APs to expand the coverage of conventional CF-mMIMO system. To fully utilize the spectrum resource, the wireless fronthaul between the CPU and UAV shares the total bandwidth with the radio access networks. Considering limited power supply of the UAV and for the goal of green communications, we formulate a weighted sum power minimization problem to jointly optimize downlink beamforming and fronthaul compression, as well as UAV placement. The formulated problem is a mixed timescale problem, thus we propose a two-timescale optimization framework in which the UAV placement is optimized in each long timescale based on statistical channel state information (CSI), then the downlink beamforming and fronthaul compression are optimized in each short timescale based on instantaneous CSI. Specifically, uplink-downlink duality and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based alternating optimization techniques are introduced to find solutions to the short timescale issue, while successive convex approximation and SDR methods are invoked to find solutions to the long timescale issue. Finally, simulation results corroborate the performance of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Locally recoverable codes (LRCs) play a vital role in distributed storage systems where the failure or unavailability of storage devices is a common occurrence. The purpose of LRCs is to facilitate the repair processes required to recover lost or damaged data in such systems. A code C will be said \\left ({r,\\delta }\\right) -LRC if for each i , the i th component of codewords have locality (r, \\delta) , that is, there exists a punctured subcode of C with support containing i , whose length is at most r + \\delta - 1 , and whose minimum distance is at least \\delta . An (r, \\delta) -LRC with locality (r, \\delta) allows for the local recovery of any \\delta -1 nodes by accessing information from r other nodes. In this paper, we present new constructions of \\left ({r,\\delta }\\right) -LRCs, with 2\\leq \\delta \\leq \\frac {p-1}{t} over \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}} , where t divides p-1 and t\\neq p-1 . Initially, we provide generator matrices for \\left ({r,2}\\right) -LRCs, among which one instance is considered as Singleton-Type Bound (STB)-optimal, a notion introduced in this paper. Also, we present a method for recovering an erased symbol in a codeword of our \\left ({r,2}\\right) -LRC. For this aim, we use the polynomial interpolation over \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}} proposed by Gopalan. Next, we present the parity-check matrices for another family of \\left ({r,\\delta }\\right) -LRCs over \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}} , and construct two instances of STB-optimal \\left ({r,\\delta }\\right) -LRCs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first study on ring-based LRCs. The proposed LRCs over \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}} exhibit certain design restrictions compared to LRCs over \\mathbb {F}_{p^{s}} . However, we provide two advantages for LRCs over \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}} . First, we analyze Boolean circuits for arithmetic operations and demonstrate that the complexity of implementing multiplication in \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s}} , the operation with the highest cost in our algorithms, is considerably lower than in \\mathbb {F}_{p^{s}} . This highlights the superior performance of our LRCs in terms of implementation speed and cost-efficiency compared to their counterparts. Next, we offer an example illustrating that the Gray image of particular \\mathbb {Z}_{p^{s+1}} -LRCs of length n results in LRCs of length np^{s} over \\mathbb {F}_{p} , which may not necessarily be linear. This introduces a novel class of LRCs, prompting further exploration of the connections between existing nonlinear LRCs in finite fields and linear ring-based LRCs.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a large unitarily invariant system (LUIS) involving a unitarily invariant sensing matrix, an arbitrarily fixed signal distribution, and forward error control (FEC) coding. A universal Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is considered for constructing orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP), enabling its applicability to a wide range of prototypes without the constraint of differentiability. We develop two single-input-single-output variational transfer functions for OAMP with Lipschitz continuous local estimators, facilitating an analysis of achievable rates. Furthermore, when the state evolution of OAMP has a unique fixed point, we reveal that OAMP can achieve the constrained capacity predicted by the replica method of LUIS based on matched FEC coding, regardless of the signal distribution. The replica method is rigorously validated for LUIS with Gaussian signaling and certain sub-classes of LUIS with arbitrary signal distributions. Several area properties are established based on the variational transfer functions of OAMP. Meanwhile, we present a replica constrained capacity-achieving coding principle for LUIS. This principle serves as the basis for optimizing irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes specifically tailored for binary signaling in our simulation results. The performance of OAMP with these optimized codes exhibits a remarkable improvement over the unoptimized codes and even surpasses the well-known Turbo-LMMSE algorithm. For quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, we observe bit error rates (BER) performance near the replica constrained capacity across diverse channel conditions.}

In this paper, we focus on improving the block error performance of SPARC in short block length regime over the AWGN channel. Towards that, we introduce suitable candidates for dictionary matrices in real and complex fields using Gold sequences and mutually unbiased bases (MUB). We propose two generalizations of SPARC (GSPARC), develop a greedy decoder called Match and Decode (MAD) algorithm, and provide its analytical noiseless recovery guarantees. We propose a parallel greedy search technique called parallel MAD (PMAD) to improve performance. We describe the applicability of GSPARC with PMAD decoder for multi-user channels, providing a non-orthogonal multiple access scheme. We present numerical results comparing the block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed algorithms for GSPARC in AWGN channels in the short block length regime. The PMAD decoder gives better BLER than the approximate message-passing decoder for SPARC. GSPARC with PMAD gives comparable and competitive BLER performance compared to other existing codes. In multi-user channels, GSPARC with PMAD decoder outperforms the sphere packing lower bounds of an orthogonal multiple access scheme with the same spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {It is shown that efficient reversible variable length codes (RVLCs) with numerous codewords can be obtained if suboptimal RVLCs for the average distributions of monotone sources with relatively small alphabet sizes are multiplied by some fixed-length codes. Employing these RVLCs, the best known upper bounds on the average redundancy of optimal RVLC are almost halved. In particular, it is proved that the average redundancy of optimal RVLC for sources with n\nsymbols is less than \\frac {11}{n}+0.11345\nbits for n > 32\n. Some other upper bounds are also derived which are either suboptimal in some sense for small n\nor easily computable for large n\nor descriptive of asymptotic behavior. Moreover, we prove that the penalty of using optimal RVLC instead of Huffman code is less than 0.0848 bits for almost all sources with sufficiently large alphabet size. These results provide stronger evidence that, overall, the cost of benefiting from the desired properties of RVLC is not significant in terms of the redundancy.}

	abstract = {With the development of wireless computing devices, extending distributed computing to wireless networks deserves a closer look. This paper considers distributed computing over unreliable and insecure device-to-device (D2D) networks, in which each device is not always available to perform computation. The process of distributed devices exchanging calculated results with each other is vulnerable to eavesdropping in wireless environments. To handle the unreliable devices, we adopt repetition codes to build a novel system that supports general computations, called \\rho -replication system, where each device has \\rho -1 replicas with duplicate data. A coded computation scheme for the \\rho -replication system is proposed, which not only achieves the minimum communication load of the system but also ensures weak security of wireless transmissions during data exchange. Furthermore, the replication nature of the system can be exploited for beamforming transmissions, naturally leading to the idea of energy optimization. Simulation results show that increasing \\rho does not necessarily improve energy efficiency, as the benefit of increased beamforming gain may be outweighed by the drawback of heavier communication load.}

The results are also simplified for the mixed architecture that employs full resolution (FR) ADCs and one-bit DACs, and the conventional architecture that employs FR ADCs and DACs. The SQINR is shown to decrease by a factor of 2/\\pi and 4/\\pi ^{2} in the one-bit setting compared to that achieved in the mixed setting and conventional setting respectively under MRT precoding without PC. Interestingly, the decrease in SQINR is less when we consider PC, which is shown to adversely impact the conventional system more than the one-bit system. Similar insights are obtained under ZF precoding with the decrease in the SQINR with the use of one-bit ADCs and DACs being more pronounced. We utilize the derived expressions to yield performance insights related to power efficiency, the numbers of antennas needed by the three architectures to achieve the same sum-rate, and energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {Blind signal processing techniques of channel and noise power estimation, modulation and channel coding scheme (MCS) recognition, and data detection have played crucial roles in wireless transmission scenarios, where the receiver cannot obtain a priori information of the incoming signals. Each of these blind signal processing tasks has been extensively studied in the literature. Few works studied the combination of partial tasks jointly. However, to the best of our knowledge, an overall problem that involves all the aforementioned tasks has not been investigated previously. Simply cascading the solution of each individual task is apparently not a suitable approach for the overall problem. To address the above issues, we design a joint blind receiver that jointly improves the performance of parameter estimation, MCS recognition, and data detection. Thus, we refer to it as the blind estimation, recognition, and detection (BERD) receiver. The multipath fading channel, noise power, and MCS of the transmitter are all unknown to the receiver side; the required side information is only the pool of MCS candidates and perfect synchronization. In this BERD receiver, we first propose an expectation-maximization-based channel and noise power estimator block, which solves the non-convex maximum likelihood estimation problem in a tractable way. Then, a soft-information detector and regenerator block is designed to detect the transmitted information bits and regenerate more reliable symbols. The BERD receiver iterates between these two blocks, and consequently, the accuracy of channel estimation is improved and in turn helps the data detection. Finally, a multistage likelihood-based fusion and decision block is proposed to make the final decision on the adopted MCS, the information bits, and the unknown channel information. Numerical results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed BERD receiver compared to the existing schemes, in terms of data detection, MCS recognition, and channel estimation.}

In this paper, we consider a joint state sensing and communication system, where a multi-antenna ISAC transceiver simultaneously senses a sensing target and conveys a message to a multi-antenna communication receiver in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) real Gaussian channels. Our goal is to optimize the signal input probability distribution to obtain the approximate capacity-distortion region. The formulated optimization problem is difficult because of high optimization dimension and high storage complexity. To reduce the optimization dimension, it is theoretically proved that over each transmitting antenna, the optimal signal inputs over different symbol durations should follow an independent and identical distribution. To reduce the storage complexity, it is also theoretically proved that the signal input probability distribution optimization over MIMO channels is equivalent to that over multiple-input-single-output channels. We propose an alternating optimization based Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed joint state sensing and communication system achieves the larger capacity-distortion region than both the basic time-sharing (TS) and improved TS schemes.}

	abstract = {Information aging has gained prominence in characterizing communication protocols for timely remote estimation and control applications. This work proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type communication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput in each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined to minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame. At the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point (AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node. Depending on the observedstatus of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes, and maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The maximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at each frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may render T-DFSA unstable. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-DFSA compared to the existing optimal frame slotted ALOHA, threshold-ALOHA, and age-based thinning protocols in a considerable range of update generation rates.}

	abstract = {In-network aggregation is a fundamental operation for massive packets in the Internet of Things (IoT). By aggregating ultra-small packets, the energy consumption for data transmission is not related to the packet number, while the average delay performance depends on the delay of all packets even if they are aggregated. In this paper, we propose a low-delay ultra-small packet transmission scheme with in-network aggregation in energy-harvesting multi-hop networks, where each device periodically transmits packets in a collect-wait-forward relaying manner. Considering the resulting extra waiting time during relaying, we first drive the tractable form of the average end-to-end delay by problem transformation. By characterizing the two-dimensional evolution property from the perspective of both hops and time, the delay minimization problem is reformulated as an infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision process with a two-dimensional optimality equation. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we decompose the global Bellman equation into several per-device local relay selection problems. Based on the problem decomposition, we propose a distributed ultra-Small Packet Aggregation Relay SElection (SPARSE) algorithm via stochastic learning. The convergence is further proved theoretically and verified by simulation. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain over the baselines for ultra-small packets.}

To devise an efficient radio resource management strategy encompassing user association, channel allocation, and power allocation, we formulate an optimization problem that considers time, energy, and achievable rate in the utility function. The formulated problem is a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) and has been proven to be NP-hard. To address this complexity, we propose a unified nature-inspired optimization framework, which can be deployed for subproblems in various settings and can be integrated with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Through our rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis, the proposed algorithms show that they can converge to a near-optimal solution while keeping negligible optimality gaps.

	abstract = {Due to the large path loss in millimeter wave (mmWave) band, the transmission path between transmitter (Tx) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as a Rayleigh fading channel, and a physics-based channel model is proposed for IRS-assisted mmWave communication system in urban scenario. Also, the horizontal and vertical rotation angles of IRS and the relationship between the scattering gain of IRS reflecting unit and its effective aperture in the incident direction and the desired reflection direction are considered in the proposed model. For the considered communication scenario, the existing reflection phases, which are designed to align the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) components among Tx, IRS, and receiver (Rx) with the LoS components between Tx and Rx, are not the appropriate reflection phases. Based on the proposed model, we first obtain the statistical phases of the virtual scattering components within a cluster by minimizing phase differences between different IRS reflection units, and then obtain the reflection phases by minimizing the phase differences of the derived statistical phases for all clusters. By comparing with the existing reflection phases, the designed reflection phases can significantly enhance the system performance gains of mmWave communications. Using the designed reflection phases, the expressions of received signal power and upper bound of ergodic sum capacity are derived in this paper, which are validated by using Monte-Carlo simulation results. Numerical results show that the proposed mmWave channel model could accurately simulate the propagation characteristics of IRS. Also, numerical results show that the performance gains of IRS-assisted systems are equivalent to that of large-scale communication systems without using IRS.}

	abstract = {In this work, we study the real-time tracking and reconstruction of an information source with the purpose of actuation. A device monitors the state of the information source and transmits status updates to a receiver over a wireless erasure channel. We consider two models for the source, namely an\nN\n-state Markov chain and an\nN\n-state Birth-Death Markov process. We investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a semantics-aware one, and we study their performance for a set of metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors. In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary policy with uniform, change-aware, and semantics-aware sampling policies. Our results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the optimal randomized stationary policy outperforms all other sampling policies when the source is rapidly evolving. Otherwise, the semantics-aware policy performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error with a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Based on this, we propose a wait-then-generate sampling policy which is simple to implement.}

	abstract = {An (H,r,M,N) combination network is a symmetric relay network that involves a central server equipped with N files that communicates with K users through H cache-less intermediate relays, where each user maintains a local cache of size M files and is connected to a distinct subset of r relays. In this setting, the well-known uniform scheme is proposed by Zewail and Yener via Minimum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For practical reasons, this paper studies a more general combination network where each distinct subset of r relays is connected to \\Lambda users, referred to as (H,r,\\Lambda,M,N) dense-user combination network. Although the Zewail-Yener scheme is also feasible for the considered system, it causes high computational complexity since the use of (H,r)_{q} MDS code involves expensive multiplication operations in large finite field. In this paper, we aim to design coded caching schemes not only to minimize the worst-case link-load, but also to be implemented over the minimum operation field, i.e., binary field \\mathbb {F}_{2} . First, we propose a construction which can transform any coded caching scheme for the shared-link model to the considered dense-user combination network. By applying the transformation approach based on the seminal work proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we present the MAN-based scheme that operates in binary field. To further reduce the link-load under small memory regions, we propose a hybrid scheme that can extend any caching scheme for the original (H,r,M,N) combination network to the considered (H,r,\\Lambda,M,N) dense-user combination network by an ingenious outer-inner construction. From the theoretical analysis of computation complexity, the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the number of bit operations. From numerical comparisons, the link-loads of proposed schemes are close to or even better than that of Zewail-Yener scheme, while significantly reducing the operation field.}

To derive an outer bound on the rate region, we introduce a novel way of applying a Sato-type outer bound in the finite blocklength regime, since Sato’s classical outer bound is not directly applicable. To derive the achievable rate region, we present a way to use shell codes, which are second-order optimal for the single-user case, in the HB-GBC. We apply our technique to a hybrid TDMA/NOMA approach as well as early decoding, which is a technique that performs successive interference cancellation with an incompletely received interference codeword. Our numerical results show that the range of power allocations where early decoding is feasible is significantly enlarged compared to the state-of-the-art, leading to considerably improved rates in the regime where rate fairness between users is the goal. This makes early decoding a promising technique to increase the rates and fairness when strict latency constraints have to be met.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a Gaussian multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with a legitimate transmitter, a legitimate receiver (Bob), an eavesdropper (Eve), and a cooperative jammer. All nodes may be equipped with multiple antennas. Traditionally, the jammer transmits Gaussian noise (GN) to enhance the security. However, using this approach, the jamming signal interferes not only with Eve but also with Bob. In this paper, besides the GN strategy, we assume that the jammer can also choose to use the encoded jammer (EJ) strategy, i.e., instead of GN, it transmits a codeword from an appropriate codebook. In certain conditions, the EJ scheme enables Bob to decode the jamming codeword and thus cancel the interference, while Eve remains unable to do so even if it knows all the codebooks. We first derive an inner bound on the system’s secrecy rate under the strong secrecy metric, and then consider the maximization this bound through precoder design in a computationally efficient manner. In the single-input multi-output (SIMO) case, we prove that although non-convex, the power control problems can be optimally solved for both GN and EJ schemes. In the MIMO case, we propose to solve the problems using the matrix simultaneous diagonalization (SD) technique, which requires quite a low computational complexity. Simulation results show that by introducing a cooperative jammer with coding capability, and allowing it to switch between the GN and EJ schemes, a dramatic increase in the secrecy rate can be achieved. In addition, the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the current state of the art benchmarks in terms of both secrecy rate and computation time.}

	abstract = {Laser inter-satellite links (LISLs) have greatly extended communication distance between satellites, allowing for establishment of dynamic links to reduce communication delay. However, a closed-loop control is required for LISL, which causes high energy consumption. Proper scheduling of dynamic LISLs can effectively reduce energy consumption and communication delay. In this study, a satellite link mode with three fixed LISLs and one dynamic LISL is designed, and its feasibility is analyzed. The optimization problem is formulated and transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) by modeling it as a sequential decision problem. By decomposing states, actions, and reward functions, the MDP is divided into the proposed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Moreover, compressed sensing is utilized to cut down state information to reduce communication, storage, and computation overhead. Furthermore, network parameters and experience sharing, and prioritized experience replay have been adopted to improve stability and convergence speed of network training with a large number of agents. Experimental results show that under different routing strategies, the proposed MADRL can reduce energy consumption by over 15% and delay by approximately two hops compared to fixed LISLs scenario within several iterations.}

The end-to-end learning-based autoencoder (AE) for communication networks represents the network by an encoder and decoder, where in between, the learned latent representation goes through a physical communication channel. We introduce a joint learning scheme based on projected gradient descent iteration to optimize the spectral mask behavior and MIMO detection under the influence of a non-linear high power amplifier (HPA) and a multipath fading channel. The offered efficient implementation novel waveform design technique utilizes only a single PAPR reduction block for all antennas. It is throughput-lossless, as no side information is required at the decoder. Performance is analyzed by examining the bit error rate (BER), the PAPR, and the spectral response and compared with classical PAPR reduction MIMO detector methods on 5G simulated data. The suggested system exhibits competitive performance when considering all optimization criteria simultaneously. We apply gradual loss learning for multi-objective optimization and show empirically that a single trained model covers the tasks of PAPR reduction, spectrum design, and MIMO detection together over a wide range of SNR levels.}

In this paper, we consider the mmWave communications systems where mobile users are served by the roadside unit (RSU). We propose a multi-camera view based proactive RSU selection and beam searching scheme that can predict the optimal RSU for the user in the next frame and search the corresponding beam pair. The proposed scheme utilizes vision sensing and reduces training resources.

There exists an absence of consideration for the neural architecture selection of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spectrum sensing. Here, we develop a method using reinforcement learning and Q-learning to systematically search and evaluate various architectures for generated datasets including different signals and channels in the spectrum sensing problem. We show by extensive simulations that CNN-based detectors proposed by our developed method outperform several detectors in the literature. For the most complex dataset, the proposed approach provides 9% enhancement in accuracy at the cost of higher computational complexity. Furthermore, a novel method using multi-armed bandit model for selection of the sensing time is proposed to achieve higher throughput and accuracy while minimizing the consumed energy. The method dynamically adjusts the sensing time under the time-varying condition of the channel without prior information. We demonstrate through a simulated scenario that the proposed method improves the achieved reward by about 20% compared to the conventional policies. Consequently, this study effectively manages the selection of important hyperparameters for CNN-based detectors offering superior performance of cognitive radio network.}

	abstract = {Consider a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink system in which the base station (BS) sends multiple data streams to multi-antenna users via symbol-level precoding (SLP), where the optimization of receive combining matrix becomes crucial, unlike in the single-antenna user scenario. We begin by introducing a joint optimization problem on the symbol-level transmit precoder and receive combiner. The problem is solved using the alternating optimization (AO) method, and the optimal solution structures for transmit precoding and receive combining matrices are derived by using Lagrangian and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, based on which, the original problem is transformed into an equivalent quadratic programming problem, enabling more efficient solutions. To address the challenge that the above joint design is difficult to implement, we propose a more practical scheme where the receive combining optimization is replaced by the interference rejection combiner (IRC), which is however difficult to directly use because of the rank-one transmit precoding matrix. Therefore, we introduce a new regularized IRC (RIRC) receiver to circumvent the above issue. Numerical results demonstrate that the practical SLP-RIRC method enjoys only a slight communication performance loss compared to the joint transmit precoding and receive combining design, both offering substantial performance gains over the conventional BD-based approaches.}

	abstract = {This paper designs a helper-assisted offloading strategy in non-orthogonal multiple access enabled mobile edge computing systems, in order to guarantee the quality of service of the energy/delay-sensitive user equipments (UEs). To achieve a tradeoff between the energy consumption and the delay, we introduce a performance metric called energy-delay tradeoff. Aiming at the maximal energy-delay tradeoff minimization, the joint optimization of user association, resource block (RB) assignment, power allocation, task assignment, and computation resource allocation is formulated as a non-convex problem with coupled continuous and 0-1 variables. To tackle this challenging problem, we decompose it as a two-level problem. For the inner-level problem, an iterative parametric convex approximation (IPCA) algorithm is proposed. Then, based on the solution obtained from the inner-level problem, we model the outer-level problem as a four-sided matching problem, and then propose a low-complexity four-sided UE-RB-helper-server matching (FS-URHSM) algorithm. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the IPCA algorithm can converge to a stationary Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point and the FS-URHSM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stable matching with polynomial complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of proposed algorithms in terms of the energy consumption and the delay.}

	abstract = {As an amalgamation of digital twin and edge computing, the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) have drawn much attention from industry and academia to bridge the divide between physical edge networks and digital systems. Meanwhile, the physical hardware and open-access wireless communication environments in edge networks raise significant challenges in timely information aggregation and real-time status updates for digital twins, especially in the presence of inherent failure and hostile jamming. In this paper, we investigate the fault-tolerant Age-of-Information (AoI) optimization problem for digital twin edge networks against the severe fault phenomena in wireless communications. In contrast to previous works that focus on single fault or individual jamming behavior, we propose a comprehensive communication failure model over the f non-overlapping wireless sub-channels, where f_{1} out of the f sub-channels are inherently failed and f_{2} out of the f sub-channels are jammed by adversaries. Then, based on the multi-channel communication failure model, we present a distributed fault-tolerant communication algorithm to minimize the expected average peak AoI in DITENs. Using an adaptive transmission strategy, we prove that the AoI optimization issue for n end devices can be resolved within \\Theta (n) time steps when f_{1}+f_{2} < f . Both theoretical analyses and empirical simulations are conducted to verify the fault-tolerance and efficiency of our proposed algorithm despite the communication failures.}

	abstract = {We propose spatial superimposition (SS) structures to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for unipolar asymmetrically clipped optical-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UACO-OFDM) light fidelity (LiFi) systems with multiple light emitting diodes (LEDs) at the transmitter. The traditional \\mu -law companding method only increases the small amplitudes of signals, while maintaining the maximum value of the signal, which provides the limited PAPR reduction. Hence, we propose an improved nonlinear \\mu -law companding approach for PAPR reduction by enhancing small-amplitude signals and compressing large-amplitude signals. Linear compression is further used in the transmitted signals to reduce the impact of LED nonlinearity. Multiple LEDs are utilized to compensate for signal distortion caused by joint linear and nonlinear compressions, requiring no decompanding as in the traditional method. However, there are a few negative compensation signals that can be made to be positive by adding a small value of direct current (DC) bias theoretically derived in a closed form. Also, we propose an enhanced SS (eSS) structure, where the turn-on and maximum voltages of LED are jointly considered in the PAPR reduction, requiring no additional DC bias. This is the first work to investigate channel diversity in the proposed structures, while the multiple channels are assumed to be highly correlated with each other due to small LED separation in the previous works. We propose a frequency-domain channel filling (FCF) approach and a time-domain CF (TCF) approach, to mitigate the channel differences, which enables effective equalization of received signals. This is also the first work to investigate the analytical bit error rate (BER) of UACO-OFDM systems with clipping noise. We derive the analytical BERs of the proposed SS and eSS structures, respectively. Simulation results verify the proposed approaches.}

	abstract = {The rapid deployment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, driven by technological advancements and cost reductions, has led to the emergence of mega-constellations for satellite-based Internet services. Among them, the networking problem has become a significant area of research. Specifically, breaking away from the traditional Grid-Mesh + topology schemes has been a focal point. Although some related studies have been conducted, there are still three major challenges in optimizing the topology of laser inter-satellite links: the lack of theoretical derivation for satellite visibility, the need for comprehensive modeling goals, and the absence of network simulation verification. To address these challenges, we introduce the theory of visibility analysis of laser terminals in real scenarios and propose a theoretical model of topologically feasible solutions for integer linear programming. Furthermore, a mathematical model is developed that considers time delay, hop count, and link load as optimization objectives. The Many-objective Non-Grid-Mesh Topology Optimization (M-NGTO) algorithm, based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 3 (NSGA-III), is then designed to effectively optimize the topology. The optimized Non-Grid-Mesh topology is validated through packet-level simulations on the Hypatia platform. Additionally, consistency analysis is performed to establish agreement between theory and simulation results. The results of simulations conducted on two megaLEO satellite Internet constellations, GW and Starlink, demonstrate that the performance of the Non-Grid-Mesh topology in the above three optimization objectives is approximately 39.11% better than the average of the Grid-Mesh + topology, confirming the effectiveness of the M-NGTO algorithm. The findings have significant implications for enhancing the communication performance and load balancing of satellite Internet systems.}

	abstract = {Despite its potential for reducing the detection probability at the warden, the effectiveness of covert communication in practical situations is often hindered by harsh wireless signal propagation environments. Fortunately, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can establish programmable wireless channels to tackle this issue. In this paper, we propose two IRS-assisted finite-blocklength covert communication schemes to maximize the effective covert throughput (ECT) with equal and unequal transmit prior probabilities, respectively. First, we analyze the warden’s detection performance with its optimal detection threshold derived, which is the worst situation for the covert transmission. We jointly optimize the transmit power, transmission blocklength, prior transmission probability and IRS’s phase shifts to maximize ECT in the common scenario and packet-generation scenario, respectively, which covers a wide range of practical applications. The designed optimal phase shifts not only maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver, but also introduce uncertainty to the warden for covertness provisioning. The closed-form expressions of solutions indicate that there exists a non-trivial trade-off between ECT and covertness, and adopting unequal transmit prior probabilities is proved to perform better than its counterpart of equal probabilities. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superior performance achieved by the proposed covert communication schemes.}

	abstract = {Proactive eavesdropping improves the wireless information surveillance performance by cognitively sending jamming signals to degrade the suspicious link condition. Current studies all considered that the suspicious users do not apply jamming to defend against the proactive eavesdropping. Contrary to that, this paper considers that a jammer sends jamming signals to degrade the eavesdropping link condition to protect the suspicious communications. A Stackelberg game framework is formulated to track the interactions between the jammer and the monitor and make strategy designs, where the monitor is the leader aiming at maximizing the successful eavesdropping probability and the jammer is the follower aiming at minimizing the successful eavesdropping probability. For the follower’s problem, the optimal jammer’s jamming power allocation policy with respect to the fixed monitor’s jamming power is derived based on the sum-of-ratios optimization. Then for the leader’s problem, the optimal monitor’s jamming power allocation policy is obtained via the bisection search method and the sum-of-ratios optimization. Some design insights are discussed from the obtained policies. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results. It is shown that the jamming from the jammer deteriorates the eavesdropping performance and the proposed scheme outperforms various benchmark schemes in existing literature.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the over-the-air computation (AirComp) in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with imperfect channel state information (CSI), in which multiple single-antenna wireless devices (WDs) simultaneously send uncoded signals to a multi-antenna access point (AP) for distributed functional computation over multiple subcarriers. In particular, we consider two scenarios with best-effort and error-constrained computation tasks, with the objectives of minimizing the average computation mean squared error (MSE) and the computation outage probability over the multiple subcarriers, respectively. Towards this end, we jointly optimize the transmit coefficients at the WDs and the receive beamforming vectors at the AP over subcarriers, subject to the maximum transmit power constraints at individual WDs. First, for the special case with a single receive antenna at the AP, we propose the semi-closed-form globally optimal solutions to the two problems using the Lagrange-duality method. It is shown that at each subcarrier, the WDs’ optimized power control policy for average MSE minimization follows a regularized channel inversion structure, while that for computation outage probability minimization follows an on-off regularized channel inversion, with the regularization dependent on the transmit power budget and channel estimation error. Next, for the general case with multiple receive antennas at the AP, we present efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and convex optimization to find converged solutions to both problems. It is shown that with finite receive antennas at the AP, a non-zero computation MSE for AirComp is inevitable due to the channel estimation errors even when the transmit powers at WDs tend to infinity, while with massive receive antennas, the average MSE and outage probability vanish when the channel vectors are independent and identically distributed. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.}

	abstract = {Compared with traditional half-duplex wireless systems, the application of emerging full-duplex (FD) technology can potentially double the system capacity theoretically. However, conventional techniques for suppressing self-interference (SI) adopted in FD systems require exceedingly high power consumption and expensive hardware. In this paper, we consider employing an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the proximity of an FD base station (BS) to mitigate SI for simultaneously receiving data from uplink users and transmitting information to downlink users. The objective considered is to maximize the system weighted sum-rate by jointly optimizing the IRS phase shifts, the BS transmit beamformers, and the transmit power of the uplink users. To visualize the role of the IRS in SI cancellation, we first study a simple scenario with one downlink user and one uplink user. To address the formulated non-convex problem, a low-complexity algorithm based on successive convex approximation is proposed. For the more general case considering multiple downlink and uplink users, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm based on element-wise optimization is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the FD system with the proposed schemes can achieve a larger gain over the half-duplex system, and the IRS is able to achieve a balance between suppressing SI and providing beamforming gain.}

	abstract = {The evolvement of wireless communication services concurs with significant growth in data traffic, thereby inflicting stringent requirements on terrestrial networks. This work invigorates a connectivity solution that integrates aerial and terrestrial communications with a cloud-enabled high-altitude platform station (C-HAPS) to promote an equitable connectivity landscape. The C-HAPS system is connected to terrestrial base-stations and hot-air balloons via a data-sharing fronthauling strategy. The base-stations and hot-air balloons are then grouped into disjoint clusters and coordinately serve both aerial and terrestrial users. The paper focuses on determining the user-to-transmitter scheduling policy and the associated users’ beamforming vectors in the downlink direction of the considered network by maximizing two different objectives: the sum-rate and sum-of-log of the long-term average rate, both subject to limited transmit power and finite fronthaul capacity. The paper uses well-chosen convexification and approximation steps, such as fractional programming and sparse beamforming via re-weighted \\ell _{0} -norm approximation, to solve the two non-convex discrete and continuous optimization problems using numerical iterative optimization algorithms. The results outline the gain illustrated through equitable access service in crowded and unserved areas and showcase the numerical benefits stemming from the proposed C-HAPS coordination of hot-air balloons and terrestrial base-stations for empowering the digital inclusion framework.}

	abstract = {Autonomous driving and intelligent transportation applications have dramatically increased the demand for high-accuracy and low-latency localization services. While cellular networks are potentially capable of target detection and localization, achieving accurate and reliable positioning faces critical challenges. Particularly, the relatively small radar cross sections (RCS) of moving targets and the high complexity for measurement association give rise to weak echo signals and discrepancies in the measurements. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for multi-target localization by leveraging the controllable signal reflection capabilities of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). Specifically, IRSs are strategically mounted on the targets (e.g., vehicles and robots), enabling effective association of multiple measurements and facilitating the localization process. We aim to minimize the maximum Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of targets by jointly optimizing the target association, the IRS phase shifts, and the dwell time. However, solving this CRLB optimization problem is non-trivial due to the non-convex objective function and closely coupled variables. For single-target localization, a simplified closed-form expression is presented for the case where base stations (BSs) can be deployed flexibly, and the optimal BS location is derived to provide a lower performance bound of the original problem. Then, we prove that the transformed problem is a monotonic optimization, which can be optimally solved by the Polyblock-based algorithm. Moreover, based on derived insights for the single-target case, we propose a heuristic algorithm to optimize the target association and time allocation for the multi-target case. Furthermore, we provide useful guidance for the practical implementation of the proposed localization scheme by theoretically analyzing the relationship between time slots, BSs, and targets. Simulation results verify that deploying IRS on vehicles and effective phase shift design can effectively improve the resolution ability of multi-vehicle positioning and reduce the requirements of the number of BSs.}

Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance wireless network performance by smartly reconfiguring the radio propagation environment. While significant research has been conducted on RIS-assisted wireless systems, this paper focuses specifically on the deployment of RIS in a wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system to achieve maximum sum-rate. First, we derive the average user rate as well as the lower bound rate when the covariance of the channel follows the Wishart distribution. Based on the lower bound of users’ rate, we propose a heuristic method that transforms the problem of optimizing the RIS’s orientation into maximizing the number of users served by the RIS. Simulation results show that the proposed RIS deployment strategy can effectively improve the sum-rate. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed RIS deployment algorithm is only approximately 7.6% lower on average than that of the exhaustive search algorithm.}

	abstract = {To harness the benefits of both reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA), we consider the hybrid RIS and DMA assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access channel (MAC) over spatially correlated Rician fading, in which multiple multi-antenna users send the transmitted signals to the DMA-based base station (BS) with the assistance of a RIS. The objective is to maximize the achievable ergodic sum-rate by jointly designing the transmit covariance matrix of users, the phase shift matrix of RIS, and the DMA weight matrix at BS only with statistical channel state information. By capitalizing on large random matrix theory, a closed-form asymptotic ergodic sum-rate is first obtained. Then, we propose a modified water-filling algorithm to design the optimal transmit covariance matrix under the power consumption and specific absorption rate constraints. Next, we design the phase shift matrix of RIS via the projected gradient ascent algorithm, subject to the non-convex unit-modular constraint. To find the constrained DMA weight matrix, we further resort to the optimal solution of the unconstrained DMA problem and adopt the alternating optimization method. The proposed algorithm is numerically shown to improve the sum-rate compared to the baseline schemes, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Recently, the design of omnidirectional precoding has been widely studied for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. For the base station (BS) equipped with a uniform rectangular array (URA), the current state-of-the-art scheme uses two-dimensional (2-D) Golay complementary array pairs (GCAPs)/Golay complementary array sets (GCASs) as precoding matrices to achieve omnidirectional transmission. However, the existing constructions of 2-D GCAP/GCAS-based precoding can just be implemented using the analog phase shifter network with fully-connected structure (FCS), and the existing parameters of 2-D GCAPs constructed from function-based methods are limited. More specifically, the array sizes are in the form of a power-of-two. In this paper, utilizing the truncation technique, we presented three constructions of new 2-D GCAPs with non-power-of-two array sizes from 2-D generalized Boolean functions (GBFs), which have never been reported in the literature. The proposed constructions include 2-D GCAPs with power-of-two array sizes as a special case, with flexible parameters. Moreover, we further provide a theoretical connection between 2-D GBFs and precoding matrices, such that the omnidirectional precoding scheme based on the proposed 2-D GCAPs is applicable to both FCS and partially-connected structure (PCS). Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the precoding scheme is useful in massive MIMO omnidirectional transmission systems.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-cluster wireless powered communication network (WPCN) in the presence of hardware impairments (HIs). With the aid of an RIS, passive devices (PDs) grouped into multiple clusters first jointly collect the energy radiated by an energy source (ES), and then transmit useful information to an access point through a hybrid time- and frequency- division multiple access (HTF) scheme. Specifically, the PDs from different clusters occupy different transmission time to avoid inter-cluster interference, while the PDs within the same cluster occupy different bandwidth to avoid intra-cluster interference. Due to non-ideal hardware, the impact of the phase shift (PS) error at the RIS and the HIs at the transceivers are revealed. Then, the closed-form expression for average system sum rate (ASSR) is derived. Assuming that the ES and the PDs are deployed by different service providers, a Stackelberg game (SG) is utilized to model energy trading based on price incentive. In the established SG, the PDs act as a leader to maximize the difference between the ASSR benefit and energy payment by optimizing energy price, RIS PSs in the information tansfer stage, as well as time and bandwidth allocation. Meanwhile, the ES acts as a follower to maximize the difference between energy payment and energy cost by optimizing transmit power, energy beamforming, and RIS PSs in the energy transfer stage. The follower and leader level problems are solved through algorithms such as majorization-minimization, alternating optimization, Lagrange dual approach, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition, block coordinate descent, and one-dimensional search. Simulation results verify that compared to the benchmark schemes, the proposed HTF scheme achieves higher PDs’ utility value and lower ES’s energy consumption, and strikes a balance between utility and overhead.}

	abstract = {The benefits of mobile edge computing (MEC) systems cannot be fully exploited when the communication link is blocked or the communication signal is weak. Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technology is introduced to build an IRS-assisted MEC system and to solve this issue. In this paper, devices offload part of their computing tasks to MEC through the multi-antenna access point with the help of the IRS, thereby reducing the completion time of computing tasks. We consider the weighted sum-latency minimization for single-device and multi-device scenarios in the uplink, which are constrained by computing offload allocation, edge node computational capability, IRS practical phase shift, beamforming, and device transmitting power. Firstly, block coordinate descent technology is used to decouple latency minimization problem into two subproblems of computation and communication. Secondly, in single-device scenario, the original problem is simplified and solved by the continuous refinement scheme. In multi-device scenario, an algorithm that combines alternating optimization and the Jaya algorithm is proposed for the first time to solve the weighted sum-latency minimization problem. In addition, compared with the conventional MEC systems without IRS, the effectiveness and high-performance gain of the proposed algorithm are proved through simulations.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications with hybrid precoding architectures have been regarded as energy-efficient solutions to fulfill the vision of high-speed transmissions for 6G communications. Benefiting from the advantages of providing a wide scan-range and flat array gain, the uniform circular array (UCA) has attracted much attention. However, the growing bandwidth of mmWave and THz communications require frequency-dependent phase shifts, which can not be perfectly realized through frequency-independent phase shifters (PSs) in classical hybrid precoding architectures. This mismatch causes the beam defocus effect in UCA wideband communications, where high-gain beams could not form at non-central frequencies in any direction. In this paper, we first investigate the characteristics of the beam defocus effect distinguishing itself from the beam split effect in uniform linear array (ULA) systems. The beamforming gain in both frequency domain and angular domain is analyzed, characterizing the beamforming loss caused by the beam defocus effect. Then, the delay-phase precoding (DPP) architecture leveraging true-time-delays (TTDs) to generate frequency-dependent phase shifts is employed to mitigate the beam defocus effect. Finally, performance analysis and extensive simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of DPP architecture in UCA systems.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been identified as a promising disruptive innovation to realize a faster, safer and more efficient communication system. In this paper, we study the broad beamwidth design of RIS. A problem is formulated to achieve broadbeam with maximum and equal power gain within a pre-defined angular region given constraints of the unit modulus weights of RIS. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, where the optimal solution cannot be analytically obtained, we propose the difference-of-convex-based semi-definite programming (DC-SDP) algorithm. In addition, as important guidance of signal coverage for arbitrary angular regions, we mathematically derive the relationship between the angular range of the spatial sector and the maximum average received power. The upper bounds of the average received power with different RIS configurations are also obtained, where uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform linear array (ULA) are considered. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our derivations and verify that our proposed DC-SDP algorithm is applicable in practical applications and outperforms other baseline methods. Overall, this work can be viewed as a foundation for the practical implementation of RIS on coverage enhancement and can also be seen as an initial step towards achieving channel estimation.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the transmission design for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system, where the base station (BS), information decoding receiver (IDR), and energy harvesting receiver (EHR) are equipped with multiple antennas. The IRS can facilitate the transmission of information and the acquisition of energy by regulating its reflection phase shifts. By jointly optimizing the transmit precoder at the BS and the phase shifts of the IRS, our goal is to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the BS and the IDR subject to the constraints of the transmit power at the BS and the harvested energy at the EHR. Unlike existing works, where ideal Gaussian signals are assumed to be the inputs, this paper considers the actual scenario of finite-alphabet signals, such as phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), as the input signals. To facilitate the solution of this optimization problem, we use the channel cutoff rate (CR) as a surrogate for MI. By doing this, the original problem of MI maximization is transformed into an approximate equivalent problem of CR maximization. Two cases, where perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the BS, are both considered. The formulated problems in the two cases are intractable due to the non-convexity and variable coupling. However, by analyzing the structure of the problems, for each CSI case, we develop a corresponding solution algorithm based on alternating optimization. For the perfect CSI case, the algorithm combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with penalty-based manifold optimization, while, for the imperfect CSI case, the algorithm is involved with SCA, S-Procedure, and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Both the solution algorithms can be utilized to effectively optimize the precoder and the phase shifts, whose superiority is well verified by simulation results.}

	abstract = {Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are commonly deployed in distributed storage systems as they provide the maximum failure tolerance for some given redundancy. The repair problem of MDS codes has drawn much attention and various constructions of MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth have been proposed in the last decade. However, few of the existing codes are constructed over the binary field. In this paper, we propose new constructions of binary MDS array codes with optimal repair (or access) bandwidth for single-node failure. Specifically, by stacking multiple Blaum-Roth code instances of which the parity-check matrices are judiciously designed, we obtain three families of binary MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth; using the permutation matrices as building blocks, we also construct two families of binary MDS array codes with optimal access bandwidth. Moreover, error-resilient capability while achieving the lower bound on repair (or access) bandwidth is obtained when the number of helper nodes d < n-1 . All the codes in this paper are constructed over a particular ring of binary polynomials. Consequently, computation operations involved in the encoding, decoding and node repair procedures for these codes are only XORs and cyclic shifts, avoiding complex multiplications and divisions over large finite fields.}

Unlike bit-flip decoders, no outer code is needed to terminate decoding; therefore, SCOS also applies to \\boldsymbol {G}_{N} -coset codes modified with dynamic frozen bits. The average complexity is close to that of successive cancellation (SC) decoding at practical frame error rates (FERs) for codes with wide ranges of rate and lengths up to 512 bits, which perform within 0.25 dB or less from the random coding union bound and outperform Reed–Muller codes under ML decoding by up to 0.5 dB. Simulations illustrate simultaneous gains for SCOS over SC-Fano, SC stack (SCS) and SC list (SCL) decoding in FER and the average complexity at various SNR regimes. SCOS is further extended by forcing it to look for candidates satisfying a threshold, thereby outperforming basic SCOS under complexity constraints. The modified SCOS enables strong error-detection capability without the need for an outer code. In particular, the (128, 64) polarization-adjusted convolutional code under modified SCOS provides gains in overall and undetected FER compared to CRC-aided polar codes under SCL/dynamic SC flip decoding at high SNR.}

Spectral precoding is an effective approach toward this goal, at the expense of throughput loss due to precoder redundancy; thus, it is of interest to explore alternative precoder designs with improved performance at lower redundancies. We present a novel precoder which minimizes radiated power within a user-selectable frequency region. The structure of the precoding matrix is chosen to allow efficient mitigation of in-band distortion at the receiver by means of iterative and successive interference cancellation, while completely avoiding distortion to protected and pilot subcarriers. By exploiting the low-rank properties of constituent blocks, computational complexity can be significantly reduced with little impact on sidelobe reduction. Simulation results show the benefits of the proposed design, which is particularly effective in redundancy-limited settings targeting high spectral efficiency.}

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity iterative successive interference cancellation based minimum mean squared error (SIC-MMSE) detection algorithm for zero-padded OTFS (ZP-OTFS) modulation. In the proposed algorithm, signals are detected based on layers processed by multiple SIC-MMSE linear filters for each sub-channel, with interference on the targeted signal layer being successively canceled either by hard or soft information. To reduce the complexity of computing individual layer filter coefficients, we also propose a novel filter coefficients recycling approach in place of generating the exact form of MMSE filter weights. Moreover, we design a joint detection and decoding algorithm for ZP-OTFS to enhance error performance. Compared to the conventional SIC-MMSE detection, our proposed algorithms outperform other linear detectors, e.g., maximal ratio combining (MRC), for ZP-OTFS with up to 3 dB gain while maintaining comparable computation complexity.}

In this scenario, the current widely adopted likelihood ratio test (LRT)-based detector is not optimal anymore. To address this, we formulate a detection framework based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which replaces the unknown parameter with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and is proven optimal in the scenario. Based on the GLRT-based framework, two different detection models are proposed, where one only utilizes observations of the current time and the other can exploit observations of past time slots. We analyze the estimation and fisher information of the transmit power, and even the detection and covert performance under two different detection models, respectively. Based on the analytical results, we further derive the maximum number of tolerable slots under which the transmitter can remain the same transmit power while the detection error probability of the warden is still larger than the regulated threshold. Moreover, the transmit power and the number of tolerable slots are jointly optimized to maximize the transmission throughput subjecting to covertness constraint. The numerical results demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis. We show how the covert rate is influenced by the number of transmitting slots and the transmit power, which can guide the design of the covert transmission strategy.}

	abstract = {A three-dimensional constellation-based \\boldsymbol {M} -ary differential chaos shift keying modulation system, referred to as 3D- \\boldsymbol {M} -DCSK system, is proposed in this paper. In particular, we exploit the excellent cross-correlation properties of chaotic signals to intelligently combine the 3D constellation mapping and the DCSK scheme, thus increasing the minimum Euclidean distance (MED) between the adjacent mapped symbols. In this way, the date rate and transmission reliability of conventional two-dimensional constellation mapping can be effectively improved. The theoretical expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed 3D- \\boldsymbol {M} -DCSK system are derived under the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel as well as the multipath Rayleigh fading channel. Additionally, the peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) performance of the proposed 3D- \\boldsymbol {M} -DCSK system is carefully analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed 3D- \\boldsymbol {M} -DCSK system achieves outstanding improvement in terms of transmission reliability and PAPR performance compared to the state-of-the-art \\boldsymbol {M} -DCSK system in both AWGN and multipath Rayleigh fading channels.}

First, MCC UEs are grouped according to their timeliness requirements, and a multi-dimensional codebook is introduced to resolve the UE collisions in massive access. Then, the IS-UTMA exclusively allocates time slots and pilots to different MCC UE groups to perform massive access, while the ECO- and ICO-UTMA allow timeliness critical group to share resources with timeliness tolerant group to improve the system timeliness. To capture the timeliness evaluation of each MCC UE group, we utilize age of information (AoI) to model the information freshness and derive closed-form expressions of average AoI (AAoI) by tracing the access failure probability (AFP) and instantaneous AoI. Furthermore, we establish the parameter optimization problems to minimize AAoI under desired AFP requirements. Extensive simulations validate the accurate of theoretical derivations, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UTMA scheme with joint optimized parameters, which can achieve minimum AAoI under desired AFP than the state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Amplitude, phase, frequency, and polarization states of electromagnetic (EM) waves can be dynamically manipulated by means of artificially engineered planar materials, composed of sub-wavelength meta-atoms, which are typically referred to as metasurfaces. In wireless communications, metasurfaces can be configured to judiciously modify the EM propagation environment in such a way to achieve different network objectives in a digitally programmable way. In such a context, metasurfaces are typically referred to as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Until now, researchers in wireless communications have mainly focused their attention on slowly time-varying designs of RISs, where the spatial-phase gradient across the RIS is varied at the rate equal to the inverse of the channel coherence time. Additional degrees of freedom for controlling EM waves can be gained by applying a time modulation to the reflection response of RISs during the channel coherence time interval, thereby attaining rapidly time-varying RISs. In this paper, we develop a general framework where a downlink multiuser transmission over single-input single-output slow fading channels is assisted by a digitally controlled rapidly time-varying RIS. We show that reconfiguring the RIS at a rate greater than the inverse of the channel coherence time might be beneficial from a communication perspective depending on the considered network utility function and the available channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The conclusions of our analysis in terms of system design guidelines are as follows: (i) if the network utility function is the sum-rate time-averaged network capacity, without any constraint on fair resource allocation, and full CSIT is available, it is unnecessary to change the electronic properties of the RIS within the channel coherence time interval; (ii) if partial CSIT is assumed only, a rapidly time-varying randomized RIS allows to achieve a suitable balance between sum-rate time-averaged capacity and user fairness, especially for a sufficiently large number of users; (iii) regardless of the available amount of CSIT, the design of rapid temporal variations across the RIS is instrumental for developing scheduling algorithms aimed at maximizing the network capacity subject to fairness constraints.}

An alternative modulation scheme is the discrete modulated CVQKD (DM-CVQKD) protocol. In this paper, we perform a feasibility study for practical satellite-to-ground CVQKD with a focus on comparing existing GM-CVQKD and DM-CVQKD protocols with the application of the performance of recent reconciliation methods. We use a satellite-to-ground link model which takes into account geometric, scintillation, and scattering losses from the link distance, atmospheric turbulence, and atmospheric aerosols, respectively. In addition, recent multidimensional (MD) and multilevel coding and multistage decoding (MLC-MSD) reconciliation method models in combination with multiedge-type low-density parity-check (MET-LDPC) code models have been used to determine the reconciliation efficiency. Realistic parameters have been used for the calculation of the secret key rate (SKR) along with a comparison between MD and MLC-MSD reconciliation during satellite-to-ground GM-CVQKD, for the first time. The results show that GM-CVQKD outperforms DM-CVQKD. In addition, GM-CVQKD with MD reconciliation outperforms GM-CVQKD with MLC-MSD reconciliation in the finite size limit by producing positive SKRs at larger link distances and lower elevation angles.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the unsourced random access (URA) problem with a massive multiple-input multiple-output receiver that serves wireless devices in the near-field of radiation. We employ an uncoupled transmission protocol without appending redundancies to the slot-wise encoded messages. To exploit the channel sparsity for block length reduction while facing the collapsed sparse structure in the angular domain of near-field channels, we propose a sparse channel sampling method that divides the angle-distance (polar) domain based on the maximum permissible coherence. Decoding starts with retrieving active codewords and channels from each slot. We address the issue by leveraging the structured channel sparsity in the spatial and polar domains and propose a novel turbo-based recovery algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate an off-grid compressed sensing method to refine discretely estimated channel parameters over the continuum that improves the detection performance. Afterward, without the assistance of redundancies, we recouple the separated messages according to the similarity of the users’ channel information and propose a modified K -medoids method to handle the constraints and collisions involved in channel clustering. Simulations reveal that via exploiting the channel sparsity, the proposed URA scheme achieves high spectral efficiency and surpasses existing multi-slot-based schemes. Moreover, with more measurements provided by the overcomplete channel sampling, the near-field-suited scheme outperforms its counterpart of the far-field.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we design a resource block (RB) oriented power pool (PP) for semi-grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (SGF-NOMA) in the presence of residual errors resulting from imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). In the proposed method, the BS allocates one orthogonal RB to each grant-based (GB) user, and determines the acceptable received power from grant-free (GF) users and calculates a threshold against this RB for broadcasting. Each GF user as an agent, tries to find the optimal transmit power and RB without affecting the quality-of-service (QoS) and ongoing transmission of the GB user. To this end, we formulate the transmit power and RB allocation problem as a stochastic Markov game to design the desired PPs and maximize the long-term system throughput. The problem is then solved using multi-agent (MA) deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as double deep Q networks (DDQN) and Dueling DDQN due to their enhanced capabilities in value estimation and policy learning, with the latter performing optimally in environments characterized by extensive states and action spaces. The agents (GF users) undertake actions, specifically adjusting power levels and selecting RBs, in pursuit of maximizing cumulative rewards (throughput). Simulation results indicate computational scalability and minimal signaling overhead of the proposed algorithm with notable gains in system throughput compared to existing SGF-NOMA systems. We examine the effect of SIC error levels on sum rate and user transmit power, revealing a decrease in sum rate and an increase in user transmit power as QoS requirements and error variance escalate. We demonstrate that PPs can benefit new (untrained) users joining the network and outperform conventional SGF-NOMA without PPs in spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {The problem of goal-oriented semantic filtering and timely source coding in multiuser communication systems is considered here. We study a distributed monitoring system in which multiple information sources, each observing a physical process, provide status update packets to multiple monitors having heterogeneous goals. Two semantic filtering schemes are first proposed as a means to admit or drop arrival packets based on their goal-dependent importance, which is a function of the intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of information and the probability of occurrence of each realization. Admitted packets at each sensor are then encoded and transmitted over block-fading wireless channels so that served monitors can timely fulfill their goals. A truncated error control scheme is derived, which allows transmitters to drop or retransmit undelivered packets based on their significance. Then, we formulate the timely source encoding optimization problem and analytically derive the optimal codeword lengths assigned to the admitted packets which maximize a weighted sum of semantic utility functions for all pairs of communicating sensors and monitors. Our analytical and numerical results provide the optimal design parameters for different arrival rates and highlight the improvement in timely status update delivery using the proposed semantic filtering, source coding, and error control schemes.}

Furthermore, the dual STAR-RISs (D-STAR) concept is conceived as a promising architecture for 360-degree full-plane service coverage, including UL/DL users located between the base station (BS) and the D-STAR as well as beyond. The corresponding regions are termed as primary (P) and secondary (S) regions. Both BS/users exist in the P-region, but only users are located in the S-region. The primary STAR-RIS (STAR-P) plays an important role in terms of tackling the P-region inter-user interference, the self-interference (SI) from the BS and from the reflective as well as refractive UL users imposed on the DL receiver. By contrast, the secondary STAR-RIS (STAR-S) aims for mitigating the S-region interferences. The non-linear and non-convex rate-maximization problem formulated is solved by alternating optimization amongst the decomposed convex sub-problems of the BS beamformer, and the D-STAR amplitude as well as phase shift configurations. We also propose a D-STAR based active beamforming and passive STAR-RIS amplitude/phase (DBAP) optimization scheme to solve the respective sub-problems by Lagrange dual with Dinkelbach’s transformation, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP). Our simulation results reveal that the proposed D-STAR architecture outperforms the conventional single RIS, single STAR-RIS, and half-duplex networks. The proposed DBAP of D-STAR outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions found in the open literature for different numbers of quantization levels, geographic deployment, transmit power and for diverse numbers of transmit antennas, patch partitions as well as D-STAR elements.}

By utilizing a channel capacity upper bound expression, we obtain the secrecy outage probability (SOP), average secrecy outage rate (ASOR), and average secrecy outage duration (ASOD) expressions when the number of molecules arriving at Eve from Alice and Interferer follows Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, the effect of various channel parameters, such as Lévy noise parameter, molecular degradation, and molecular correlation on various secrecy metrics, is studied for both scenarios. In the noise-limited system, increasing molecular degradation leads to secrecy compromisation, with an increase in SOP and ASOD and a simultaneous decrease in ASOR. We also observe a significant improvement in the system’s secrecy, especially in terms of ASOR, on increasing the Lévy noise parameter. Concurrently, we analyze the channel parameter’s effect on the secrecy of the interference-limited scenario. From the ASOR and ASOD perspectives, we find that with increasing molecular degradation and correlation, the information-theoretic security of the system increases. However, increasing the Lévy noise parameter negatively impacts the system’s secrecy. Finally, extending our analysis to a three-dimensional environment reveals that additional dimensions lead to secrecy deterioration for the noise-limited and interference-limited cases.}

To maximize the potential of RS, we propose a general RS-enabled hybrid beamforming framework that can be applied to both fully-connected and sub-array hybrid beamforming structures, allowing for the assignment of a flexible number of streams for each user. Our proposed RS method divides each stream into an arbitrary number of common and private sub-streams, where private sub-streams are only recoverable by a dedicated user, whereas common streams can be recovered by all users. We propose a low-complexity analog and digital beamforming design suitable for the proposed RS and optimize the number of allocated common and private sub-streams for all users through a low-complexity genetic algorithm to maximize the achievable sum rate or minimum rate over multiple users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal sum rate close to that of dirty paper coding with low computational complexity and outperforms the benchmark approaches without considering RS.}

We establish the signal and channel models, and reveal that the signals received by each user terminal (UT) are typically asynchronous in time and frequency. We propose a spatial linear receive processing for signal extraction and perform time and frequency compensations at each UT to achieve synchronized signal. We prove that the single data stream transmission from each satellite to each UT is optimal to maximize the ergodic sum rate. Therefore, without loss of optimality, we can reduce the joint design of the transmit covariance matrices and receive vectors for spatial linear processing to that of the precoding vectors and receive vectors, which we refer to as joint precoder and receiver design (JPRD). We devise a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) based JPRD algorithm by using the statistical channel state information. Further, we approximate the optimal design with an ergodic sum rate upper bound, for which the optimality of single data stream transmission still holds. We derive a condition under which the inter-satellite interference can be eliminated, and develop a low-complexity WMMSE based JPRD algorithm with the upper bound.

	abstract = {Most existing works on dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems mainly focus on active sensing, but ignore passive sensing. To leverage multi-static sensing capability, we explore integrated active and passive sensing (IAPS) in DFRC systems to remedy sensing performance. The multi-antenna base station (BS) is responsible for communication and active sensing by transmitting signals to user equipments while detecting a target according to echo signals. In contrast, passive sensing is performed at the receive access points (RAPs). We consider both the cases where the capacity of the backhaul links between the RAPs and BS is unlimited or limited and adopt different fusion strategies. Specifically, when the backhaul capacity is unlimited, the BS and RAPs transfer sensing signals they have received to the central controller (CC) for signal fusion. The CC processes the signals and leverages the generalized likelihood ratio test detector to determine the present of a target. However, when the backhaul capacity is limited, each RAP, as well as the BS, makes decisions independently and sends its binary inference results to the CC for result fusion via voting aggregation. Then, aiming at maximize the target detection probability under communication quality of service constraints, two power optimization algorithms are proposed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that the sensing performance in case of unlimited backhaul capacity is much better than that in case of limited backhaul capacity. Moreover, it implied that the proposed IAPS scheme outperforms only-passive and only-active sensing schemes, especially in unlimited capacity case.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of joint user scheduling and computing resource allocation in asynchronous mobile edge computing (MEC) networks is studied. In such networks, edge devices will offload their computational tasks to an MEC server, using the energy they harvest from this server. To get their tasks processed on time using the harvested energy, edge devices will strategically schedule their task offloading, and compete for the computational resource at the MEC server. Then, the MEC server will execute these tasks asynchronously based on the arrival of the tasks. This joint user scheduling, time and computation resource allocation problem is posed as an optimization framework whose goal is to find the optimal scheduling and allocation strategy that minimizes the energy consumption of these mobile computing tasks. To solve this mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, the general benders decomposition method is adopted which decomposes the original problem into a primal problem and a master problem. Specifically, the primal problem is related to computation resource and time slot allocation, of which the optimal closed-form solution is obtained. The master problem regarding discrete user scheduling variables is constructed by adding optimality cuts or feasibility cuts according to whether the primal problem is feasible, which is a standard mixed-integer linear programming problem and can be efficiently solved. By iteratively solving the primal problem and master problem, the optimal scheduling and resource allocation scheme is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous computing framework reduces 87.17% energy consumption compared with conventional synchronous computing counterpart.}

	abstract = {The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has become the foundational structure for various emerging communication paradigms, leveraging the flexible deployment of distributed access points (APs) and centralized task processing. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization framework based on a practical finite-length coding communication system in C-RAN, aiming at maximizing bandwidth efficiency while providing statistical quality of service (QoS) for individual services. Based on the theoretical results from effective capacity and finite-length coding, we formulate a joint optimization problem involving modulation and coding schemes (MCS), retransmission count, initial bandwidth allocation and AP selection, which reflects the coordinated decision of parameters across the physical layer, data link layer and transport layer. To tackle such a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we firstly decompose it into a transmission parameter decision (TPD) sub-problem and a user association (UA) sub-problem, which can be solved by a binary search-based algorithm and an auction-based algorithm respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the impact of QoS requirements and channel quality on the optimal transmission parameters. Furthermore, compared with fixed transmission parameter setting, the proposed algorithms achieve the bandwidth efficiency gain up to 27.87% under various traffic and channel scenarios.}

	abstract = {The emergence of mega-constellations of interconnected satellites has a major impact on the integration of cellular wireless and non-terrestrial networks, while simultaneously offering previously inconceivable data gathering capabilities. This paper studies the problem of running a federated learning (FL) algorithm within low Earth orbit satellite constellations connected with intra-orbit inter-satellite links (ISL), aiming to efficiently process collected data in situ. Satellites apply on-board machine learning and transmit local parameters to the parameter server (PS). The main contribution is a novel approach to enhance FL in satellite constellations using intra-orbit ISLs. The key idea is to rely on predictability of satellite visits to create a system design in which ISLs mitigate the impact of intermittent connectivity and transmit aggregated parameters to the PS. We first devise a synchronous FL, which is extended towards an asynchronous FL for the case of sparse satellite visits to the PS. An efficient use of the satellite resources is attained by sparsification-based compression the aggregated parameters within each orbit. Performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and required data transmission size. We observe a sevenfold increase in convergence speed over the state-of-the-art using ISLs, and 10\\times reduction in communication load through the proposed in-network aggregation strategy.}

	abstract = {The NAND flash memory channel is corrupted by different types of noises, such as the data retention noise and the wear-out noise, which lead to unknown channel offset and make the flash memory channel non-stationary. In the literature, machine learning-based methods have been proposed for data detection for flash memory channels. However, these methods require a large number of training samples and labels to achieve a satisfactory performance, which is costly. Furthermore, with a large unknown channel offset, it may be impossible to obtain enough correct labels. In this paper, we reformulate the data detection for the flash memory channel as a transfer learning (TL) problem. We then propose a model-based deep TL (DTL) algorithm for flash memory channel detection. It can effectively reduce the training data size from 106 samples to less than 104 samples. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)-based DTL algorithm using moment alignment, which can detect data without any labels. Hence, it is suitable for scenarios where the decoding of error-correcting code fails and no labels can be obtained. Finally, a UDA-based threshold detector is proposed to eliminate the need for a neural network. Both the channel raw error rate analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DTL-based detection schemes can achieve near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance with much less training data and/or without using any labels.}

	abstract = {Smart factory is a new digital and intelligent platform requiring high throughput and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Industrial communications at sub-6 GHz faces spectrum congestion and bandwidth limitations, which seriously jeopardize the high data rate requirement of smart factory. Recently, millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz technologies have become enablers for high speed communications and intelligent manufacturing in Industry 4.0 and beyond. However, the sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage and the overhead of large-scale antenna beam sweeping pose serious challenges to the reliability and the latency of wireless networks in these frequency ranges. In this paper, we propose a vision-aided URLLC framework for smart factory that does not incur any overhead from channel training and beam sweeping. In particular, we design a feature extraction method to obtain communications-related features in environmental images for blockage prediction, reference signal receiving power (RSRP) prediction, and beam selection. Then, we construct a joint image-channel dataset covering images, annotations, blockage, and wireless channels based on Blender and Wireless Insite software. Simulations show that the accuracy of blockage prediction 400 ms ahead reaches 99.9%, the root mean square error (RMSE) of RSRP prediction 400 ms ahead reaches 2.78 dB, and the Top-5 accuracy of beam selection reaches 91.8%. Blockage and RSRP prediction can assist base station (BS) handover to avoid communications interruption, while beam selection can eliminate the overhead of channel training and beam sweeping. Hence, the proposed study provides a promising direction for enabling URLLC under mmWave and even Terahertz bands in smart factory of Industry 4.0.}

	abstract = {Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for navigation enables agents to cooperate to achieve their navigation goals. Using emergent communication, agents learn a communication protocol to coordinate and share information that is needed to achieve their navigation tasks. In emergent communication, symbols with no pre-specified usage rules are exchanged, in which the meaning and syntax emerge through training. Learning a navigation policy along with a communication protocol in a MARL environment is highly complex due to the huge state space to be explored. To cope with this complexity, this work proposes a novel neural network architecture, for jointly learning an adaptive state space abstraction and a communication protocol among agents participating in navigation tasks. The goal is to come up with an adaptive abstractor that significantly reduces the size of the state space to be explored, without degradation in the policy performance. Simulation results show that the proposed method reaches a better policy, in terms of achievable rewards, resulting in fewer training iterations compared to the case where raw states or fixed state abstraction are used. Moreover, it is shown that a communication protocol emerges during training which enables the agents to learn better policies within fewer training iterations.}

	abstract = {Short frame structure and its optimization plays an important role in ultra reliable and low latency communication (URLLC). We investigate and compare the latency and throughput performances of the independent encoding (IE) and joint encoding (JE) frame structures for heterogeneous multi-device URLLC in the finite block length regime. There is a counter-intuitive finding that, despite a longer frame, IE enables a much lower average latency and higher reliability than JE, thanks to lower queuing latency, while JE achieves higher throughput with lower traffic heterogeneity, thanks to less channel dispersion. It is also shown that traffic heterogeneity has less adverse effects on the performance of the IE frame structure, and can even help reduce its average latency with the shortest block length first (SBF) scheduling rule proposed. We also provide an intensive analysis of the trade-off between pilot power and pilot overhead, with near-optimal pilot power and block length derived in closed form. Low-complexity joint pilot power, pilot length and block length optimization algorithms are proposed for IE and JE frame structures. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and also show that pilot power optimization plays a significant role in enhancing throughput at low to medium SNR.}

In this work, we focus on Ma tching {G} ame-based resource allocation strategy with {I} ncomplete information in the space {C} ommunication network, called MAGIC. Specifically, we formulate the multi-dimensional resource allocation with incomplete information as the revenue maximization problem of access satellite, which is the sum priorities of the successfully accessed users. The revenue maximization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and a three-sided matching game is employed to solve it. Meanwhile, we apply a model-free reinforcement learning framework to pre-train the historical network data to compensate for the shortcomings caused by incomplete information. Furthermore, user-optimal and access satellite-optimal resource allocation algorithms are designed to achieve optimal resource scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and convergence of proposed algorithms from the single time slot and multiple time slot perspectives of different network parameters.}

	abstract = {Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in visible light communication (VLC) systems, but their bandwidth is generally incomparable to the laser diodes (LDs). Though LDs are exploited in free space optical systems to provide high data rate, such systems generally fail for mobile users due to the challenges in acquisition, tracking and pointing. Recently, various centimeter-level visible light positioning (VLP) systems have been realized, making it possible to realize VLP-assisted communication systems. In this work, we design a novel VLP-assisted indoor laser communication system, where an LED provides the positioning signal for the mobile user and a narrow-beam laser carries high-speed data stream. The estimated position is updated regularly to continuously orient the laser boresight to the user. The error of the VLP system and the outage probability of the VLP-assisted laser communication system are both derived in closed forms. According to the analytical and simulation results, the outage probability is related to the changes of the system parameters, such as the transmission power of the laser and the user position. Moreover, the outage probability can be minimized by optimizing the laser’s beam divergence angle. An experimental platform is built to verify the feasibility of our proposed system.}

To assess the system performance, expressions for the outage probability (OP) and average bit-error rate (BER) are further obtained in closed-form. Furthermore, driven by a desire for more explicit insights, the high SNR analyses of the OP and average BER, and upper and lower bounds on the average capacity are presented. Finally, through Monte Carlo simulations, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified.}

We first define both link resource availability (LRA) and node resource availability (NRA) for the VN mapping optimization, by which an integer linear program (ILP) model and two VN mapping approaches are proposed to achieve the high network profit. Simulation results verify that our proposed LRA VN mapping approach achieves greatly close network performance to that by solving solutions of the integer linear program model and significantly outperforms its counterpart approaches. The improved network profits out of the VN mapping is as a result of well suppressed average crosstalk, rejection ratio of VNs, and spectrum fragmentation ratio in SDM-ODCNs.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the channel aging problem of mobile light-fidelity (LiFi) systems. In the LiFi physical layer, the majority of the optimization problems for mobile users are non-convex and require the use of dual decomposition or heuristics techniques. Such techniques are based on iterative algorithms, and often cause a high processing delay at the physical layer. Hence, the obtained solutions are rendered sub-optimal since the LiFi channels are evolving. In this paper, a proactive-optimization (PO) approach that can alleviate the LiFi channel aging problem is proposed. The core idea is to design a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network that is capable of predicting posterior positions and orientations of mobile users, which can be then used to predict their channel coefficients. Consequently, the obtained channel coefficients can be exploited to derive near-optimal transmission-schemes prior to the intended service-time, which enables real-time service. Through various simulations, the performance of the designed LSTM model is evaluated in terms of prediction error and inference complexity, as well as its application in a practical LiFi optimization problem.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a covert ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) system aided by the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), where an IRS is used as a beamformer to help Tag for covert AmBC. Technically, we derive the expression of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to measure the detection performance of the warden. To fight against the warden’s detection, we propose a joint IRS’s beamforming and Tag’s reflection coefficient optimization scheme to maximize the covert AmBC rate subject to a key constraint metric of the KL divergence. To solve the non-convex problem, we formulate it as Fractional Programming (FP) for the linear iterations, and use the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain the optimal parameters of IRS and Tag. Moreover, we investigate the covert performance with the imperfect channel state information of the warden’s link (WCSI) with Tag and IRS. Numerical results show the covert performance of the system, and illustrate the superiority of the IRS’s assistance to the covert backscatter efficiency. The simulations also show that the channel estimated error of Tag-Willie link has a negative impact on the covert backscatter efficiency, while the channel estimated errors of IRS-Willie link have the positive influence on the contrary.}

	abstract = {In frequency division duplexing (FDD) cell-free massive MIMO, the acquisition of the channel state information (CSI) is very challenging because of the large overhead required for the training and feedback of the downlink channels of multiple cooperating base stations (BSs). In this paper, for systems with partial uplink-downlink channel reciprocity, and a general spatial domain channel model with variations in the average port power and correlation among port coefficients, we propose a joint-port-selection-based CSI acquisition and feedback scheme for the downlink transmission with zero-forcing precoding. The scheme uses an eigenvalue-decomposition-based transformation to reduce the feedback overhead by exploring the port correlation. We derive the sum-rate of the system for any port selection. Based on the sum-rate result, we propose a low-complexity greedy-search-based joint port selection (GS-JPS) algorithm. Moreover, to adapt to fast time-varying scenarios, a supervised deep learning-enhanced joint port selection (DL-JPS) algorithm is proposed. Simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and their advantage over existing port-selection channel acquisition schemes.}

	abstract = {Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted much attention due to their flexibility and low cost. However, there are limitations for multiple UAVs such as limited energy and collaborative coverage. To achieve a better coverage performance, each UAV needs to find the optimal position to cover many ground users while saving energy. However, there are trade-offs between coverage utility and energy consumption. In this paper, we study a multi-UAV communication scenario where multi-UAV array is deployed to provide wireless coverage for mobile ground users. Considering the number, 3D positions, and speeds of UAVs, we formulate a Coverage Utility and Energy Multi-objective Optimization Problem (CUEMOP) to simultaneously maximize the total coverage utility and minimize the total energy consumption of UAVs. Due to the complexity and NP-hardness of the formulated CUEMOP, we propose Improved Multi-objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (ImMOGWO) algorithm. In this algorithm, we design the Role Determination (RD) algorithm to cluster the ground users and prepare for initialization of UAV number and position. Hybrid solution initialization (HSI) algorithm is to initialize multi-dimensional variables and overcome algorithm inefficiency caused by random initialization. The Levy flight and Sin Cosine method based on the MOGWO algorithm (LSCMGA) is proposed to increase the diversity of solutions and ensure the convergence effect of the algorithm. Simulation results verify that proposed ImMOGWO algorithm has better performance than some other benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communications have been regarded as an effective solution to provide instant services. This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-UAV system, where ground users are formed as multicast groups and served by multiple UAVs with coordinated multi-point technique. The goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum rates for all groups by jointly optimizing the trajectories, the cooperative beamforming of the clustered UAVs, and the passive beamforming of the RIS. A hybrid learning scheme is proposed, integrating a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, RES-QMIX, and a majorization-minimization (MM)-based alternating optimization. First, the RES-QMIX algorithm is proposed to optimize the trajectories of all UAVs. Then, the alternating optimization is invoked to decouple the joint beamforming into two sub-problems, and each is transformed into a convex quadratic cone programming problem with the MM algorithm. Moreover, the alternating optimization is employed to estimate the reward of the action in RES-QMIX algorithm, thus reducing the action space and achieving the joint optimization. Numerical results show that: 1) The proposed hybrid learning framework achieves fast convergence and outperforms heuristic algorithms; 2) The proposed system obtains a more significant communication rate than CoMP and RIS-only systems.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is highly susceptible to obstacles and requires significant directivity of beams. To address these challenges, a promising solution is to deploy antenna arrays at base stations (BSs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Antenna arrays enable 3D beamforming and provide highly directional beams, while RISs create favorable transmission environments. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework to quantify the coverage performance of the RIS-assisted mmWave cellular network with 3D beamforming. Modeling obstacles and RISs with a line Boolean model and BSs with a Poisson point process (PPP), we provide the distance distribution between a UE and its associated RIS by evaluating the impact of the RIS orientation. Moreover, we adopt a 3D sectorized flat-top antenna model to characterize the interference introduced by dynamic directional beams (i.e., mainlobe/sidelobe). Furthermore, we derive the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage probability, where an equivalent PPP is proposed to enhance the computation efficiency. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our analysis and show that the proposed network achieves significant coverage improvement. We also investigate the impacts of the key parameters on the coverage probability, providing useful insights for deploying RISs and antenna arrays in mmWave cellular networks.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (RISeUAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN) consisting of a ground hybrid access point (GHAP), a RISeUAV, and a ground wireless device (GWD). Specifically, the passive GWD first harvests energy through the downlink (DL) wireless power transfer (WPT) assisted by the RISeUAV, and then wireless information transfer (WIT) takes place in the RISeUAV-aided uplink (UL) communications. Due to the partial reciprocity of wireless channels, the unavailable DL channel state information (CSI) can be estimated by an outdated version of the UL CSI. Considering the negative effect of this outdated CSI and a non-linear energy-harvester (NLEH), we formulate a two-timescale active and passive beamforming (TTAPB) framework for maximizing the ergodic throughput (ET) and derive a closed-form expression of the ET, based on which the joint optimization of time allocation for WPT/WIT and UAV placement with two-timescale active and passive beamforming (JOTAUP-TTAPB) scheme is proposed. As for the solution of the JOTAUP-TTAPB scheme, although the objective function is non-convex with respect to the hovering altitude of the RISeUAV, it can be transformed into an equivalent exponential function of fractional forms that facilitates the utilization of a golden-section-search-aided Dinkelbach (GSS-D) algorithm to obtain a jointly optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TTAPB framework by validating our ET analysis. Furthermore, the JOTAUP-TTAPB scheme outperforms several benchmark schemes in spite of performance degradations of all schemes due to imperfect channel reciprocity, exhibiting remarkable robustness against outdated DL CSI. Moreover, the proposed JOTAUP-TTAPB scheme improves the performance bounds limited by NLEHs. Additionally, not only the GSS-D algorithm for the JOTAUP-TTAPB scheme shows a faster convergence than the golden-section-search-aided alternating optimization, but also the low-complexity joint optimization avoids optimality loss by exploiting semi-closed-form solutions.}

More specifically, by considering the power splitting-based relaying (PSR) protocol for the energy harvesting (EH) process, we quantify the effect of positive and negative dependency between the source-to-relay ( SR ) and relay-to-destination ( RD ) links on key performance metrics such as ergodic capacity and outage probability. To this end, we first represent general formulations for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the product of two arbitrary random variables, exploiting copula theory. This is used to derive the closed-form expressions of the ergodic capacity and outage probability in a SWIPT relay network under correlated Nakagami- m fading channels. Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided to validate the correctness of the developed analytical results, showing that the system performance significantly improves under positive dependence in the SR - RD links, compared to the case of negative dependence and independent links. Results further demonstrate that the efficiency of the ergodic capacity and outage probability ameliorates as the fading severity reduces for the PSR protocol.}

	abstract = {Emerging use cases within the realm of industrial automation have underscored the importance of predictable wireless networked control when wireless networks bridge both real-time (RT) and time-sensitive (TS) services concurrently. However, the interplay between the varying fading channels, stochastic arrival tasks, and queuing states makes it challenging to guarantee completely the jitter-bounded deterministic latency of TS services and the throughput of RT services. To address this issue, we develop a predictable radio resource scheduling scheme based on Lyapunov-guided proximal policy optimization (LyPPO) for maximizing the transmission rate of RT services while adhering to the jitter-bounded deterministic delay constraint of TS services. The stochastic network calculus (SNC) is innovatively used to deduce the delay violation probability (DVP) and delay-constrained arrival rate bounds for RT services, which guides LyPPO by transforming the invisible jitter-bounded deterministic delay constraints of TS services into visible adaptive bandwidth limits. The simulation results verify that compared to alternative scheduling strategies, the proposed scheme adeptly mitigates the challenges posed by system dynamics and inherent uncertainties and provides predictable performance, encompassing both the foreseeability of TS services latency and the tolerability of RT services latency. Furthermore, the scheme exhibits superior performance in terms of packet loss probability and resource utilization efficiency.}

Specifically, the achievable user rates are derived for three operating protocols of the STAR-RIS, namely the energy-splitting (ES), mode-switching (MS), and time-switching (TS) with both unicast and multicast transmissions. This analysis is useful in evaluating the system performance under imperfectly estimated channel state information (CSI), spatially correlated fading, pilot contamination, and statistical CSI based phase-shift optimization, transmit power control, and user signal decoding. For the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, the asymptotic achievable rates are also derived, and they serve as benchmarks or upper bounds for the rate performance comparisons for systems operating under the above transmission impediments. The composite uplink channels are estimated through linear minimum mean square error estimation technique, and the phase-shift matrices at the STAR-RIS are optimized to maximize the effective average channel gains to minimize the channel estimation overhead. The base-station optimizes the transmit power based on the max-min criterion to attain a system-wide common user rate by negating the near-far effects of the downlink composite channels. Our numerical and simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and convergence of phase-shift and transmit power optimization algorithms.

The radio resources are allocated via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the time into T slots and frequency dimensions, with a measure of non-orthogonality \\eta . Retransmissions are stored in a receiver buffer with a finite size C_{\\sf buf} and combined via Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ), using Chase Combining (CC) and Incremental Redundancy (IR). We determine the best scaling for the SE (bits/rdof) and for the user density J/n , for a given number of users J and a blocklength n , versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, \\rho ) per bit, i.e., the ratio E_{b}/N_{0} , for the sum-rate optimal regime and when the interference is treated as noise (TIN), using a finite blocklength analysis. Contrasting the classical scheme (no retransmissions) with CC-NOMA, CC-OMA, and IR-OMA strategies in TIN and sum-rate optimal cases, the numerical results on the SE demonstrate that CC-NOMA outperforms, almost in all regimes, the other approaches. For high C_{\\sf buf} and small \\eta , IR-OMA could surpass CC-NOMA. At low E_{b}/N_{0} , the SE of CC-OMA with TIN, as it exploits CC and offers lower interference, can approach the trend of CC-NOMA and outperform the other TIN-based methods. In the sum-rate optimal regime, the scalings of J/n versus E_{b}/N_{0} deteriorate with T , yet from the most degraded to the least, the ordering of the schemes is as 1) classical, 2) CC-OMA, 3) IR-OMA, and 4) CC-NOMA, demonstrating the robustness of CC-NOMA. Contrasting TIN models at low \\rho , the scalings of J/n for CC-based models improve the best, whereas, at high \\rho , the scaling of CC-NOMA is poor due to higher interference, and CC-OMA becomes prominent due to combining retransmissions and its reduced interference. The scaling results are applicable over a range of \\eta , T , C_{\\sf buf} , and J , at low received SNR. The proposed analytical framework provides insights into resource allocation in grant-based access and specific 5G use cases for massive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) uplink access.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology holds great promise for the advancement of future sixth-generation networks. However, existing research on RIS-assisted communication systems often relies on ideal hardware and static channel conditions, which are impractical in real-world scenarios. In this study, we assess the performance of a RIS-assisted communication system, considering the combined effects of hardware impairments caused by imperfect transceivers and channel aging resulting from user mobility. To achieve this, we analyze the direct and cascade channels between the base station and the user, assuming correlated Rician distributions. We employ the linear minimum mean square estimation method to estimate the overall channel and derive a closed-form expression for the uplink spectral efficiency (SE). By formulating an optimization problem for RIS phase shift, we maximize SE using the projected gradient ascent algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations reveal the impact of channel aging and hardware impairments on system performance. While practical RIS implementations may introduce phase estimation error in the reflected signal, these errors can be mitigated through phase shift optimization. Overall, our results highlight the significant potential of RIS technology in addressing challenges posed by imperfect hardware and users’ mobility.}

	abstract = {The deployment of UAVs as aerial base stations (BSs) has been considered as a promising supplement to the ground networks, which can quickly build an emergency communication network in a disaster area or significantly relief the communication burden imposed by hot-spots. However, the application of UAVs as aerial BSs is constrained by the limited onboard energy and communication coverage of UAVs. In particular, for a large target area, multiple UAVs should be deployed to meet the communication requirements. Therefore, designing the optimal trajectories of multiple UAVs is crucial to boost the UAV network performance. Inspired by the promising future of UAV BSs, this paper aims at proposing a distributed 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory design algorithm for multiple UAVs to optimize the system performance. We formulate the trajectory design problem as a multi-objective optimization problem to improve the user equipment (UE) access rate, ensure fair access opportunities, increase transmitted data volume and reduce energy consumption. Further inspired by the decision-making ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in complex environments, we propose a DRL based trajectory design algorithm for multiple UAVs, namely DMTD, in which UAVs can explore both the optimal flight altitude and the potential UE distribution area in the iterative interactions with the environment, and then select the optimal flight trajectories to boost the network performance from multiple aspects. Extensive experimental results under different UE distributions have demonstrated that the proposed DMTD algorithm can find the optimal altitude to provide maximum coverage. Moreover, DMTD beats existing algorithms by providing high UE access rate, ensuring fair network service and increasing total transmitted data volume at the cost of a relatively low energy consumption. Especially in the scenes with dense and randomly distributed UEs, DMTD provides a UE access rate close to 0.9 and transmits 6 times of data volume than existing algorithms.}

We first employ a sparse beam based a posteriori channel model and demonstrate that robust precoding can be efficiently solved in the Slepian transform domain with a large number of base station (BS) antennas. Next, we introduce two Slepian transform based robust precoding methods, including a joint approach that leverages inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) for reduced complexity with a large number of user terminals (UTs). We then establish a local optimum for the Slepian transform domain robust precoder (STRP) design using the majorization minimization (MM) algorithm, taking advantages of HF skywave massive MIMO channel sparsity and Slepian sequence properties. Further, two distinct designs are presented: separate STRP (SSTRP) and joint STRP (JSTRP). Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed robust precoders, showcasing their excellent ergodic sum-rate performance and low complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the design of energy-efficient beamforming for an ISAC system, where the transmitted waveform is optimized for joint multi-user communication and target estimation simultaneously. We aim to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE), taking into account the constraints of a maximum transmit power budget, a minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for communication, and a maximum tolerable Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for target estimation. We first consider communication-centric EE maximization. To handle the non-convex fractional objective function, we propose an iterative quadratic-transform-Dinkelbach method, where Schur complement and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) techniques are leveraged to solve the subproblem in each iteration. For the scenarios where sensing is critical, we propose a novel performance metric for characterizing the sensing-centric EE and optimize the metric adopted in the scenario of sensing a point-like target and an extended target. To handle the nonconvexity, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to develop an efficient algorithm for approximating the nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex ones. Furthermore, we adopt a Pareto optimization mechanism to articulate the tradeoff between the communication-centric EE and sensing-centric EE. We formulate the search of the Pareto boundary as a constrained optimization problem and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to handle it. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms compared with the baseline schemes and the obtained approximate Pareto boundary shows that there is a non-trivial tradeoff between communication-centric EE and sensing-centric EE, where the number of communication users and EE requirements have serious effects on the achievable tradeoff.}

	abstract = {True-time delayers (TTDs) are popular components for hybrid beamforming architectures to combat the spatial-wideband effect in wideband near-field communications. In this paper, a serial and a hybrid serial-parallel TTD configuration are investigated for hybrid beamforming architectures. Compared to the conventional parallel configuration, the serial configuration exhibits a cumulative time delay caused by multiple TTDs, which potentially alleviates the maximum delay requirements on the individual TTDs. However, independent control of individual TTDs becomes impossible in the serial configuration. Therefore, a hybrid TTD configuration is proposed as a compromise solution. Furthermore, a power equalization approach is proposed to address the cumulative insertion loss of the serial and hybrid TTD configurations. Moreover, the wideband near-field beamforming design for different configurations is studied to maximize the spectral efficiency in both single-user and multiple-user systems. 1) For single-user systems, a closed-form solution for the beamforming design is derived. The preferred user locations and the required maximum time delay of each TTD configuration are characterized. 2) For multi-user systems, a penalty-based iterative algorithm is developed to obtain a stationary point of the spectral efficiency maximization problem for the considered TTD configurations. In addition, a hybrid-forward-and-backward (HFB) implementation is proposed to enhance the performance of the serial configuration. Our numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed designs and unveil that i) compared to the conventional parallel configuration, both the serial and hybrid configurations can significantly reduce the maximum time delays required for the individual TTDs and ii) the hybrid configuration excels in single-user systems, while the HFB serial configuration is preferred in multi-user systems.}

We first present a deep polar encoder that harnesses a series of multi-layered polar transformations with varying sizes. Our approach to encoding enables a low-complexity implementation while significantly enhancing the weight distribution of the code. Moreover, our encoding method offers flexibility in rate-profiling, embracing a wide range of code rates and blocklengths. Next, we put forth a low-complexity decoding algorithm called successive cancellation list with backpropagation parity checks (SCL-BPC). This decoding algorithm leverages the parity check equations in the reverse process of the multi-layered pre-transformed encoding for SCL decoding. Additionally, we present a low-latency decoding algorithm that employs parallel SCL decoding by treating partially pre-transformed bit patterns as additional frozen bits. Through simulations, we demonstrate that deep polar codes outperform existing pre-transformed polar codes in terms of block error rates across various code rates under short block lengths, while maintaining low encoding and decoding complexity. Furthermore, we show that concatenating deep polar codes with cyclic-redundancy-check codes can achieve the meta-converse bound of the finite block length capacity within 0.4 dB in some instances.}

Although both DTDD and FD CF systems support concurrent downlink (DL) transmission and uplink (UL) reception capability, the sum spectral efficiency (SE) is limited by various cross-link interferences. We first present a novel pilot allocation scheme that minimizes the pilot length required to ensure no pilot contamination among the user equipments (UEs) served by at least one common AP. Then, we derive the sum SE in closed form, considering zero-forcing combining and precoding along with the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio optimal weighting at the central processing unit. We also present a provably convergent algorithm for joint UL-DL power allocation and UL/DL mode scheduling of the APs (for DTDD) to maximize the sum SE. Further, the proposed algorithms are precoder and combiner agnostic and come with closed-form update equations for the UL and DL power control coefficients. Our numerical results illustrate the superiority of the proposed pilot allocation and power control algorithms over several benchmark schemes and show that the sum SE with DTDD can outperform an FD CF system with similar antenna density. Thus, DTDD combined with CF is a promising alternative to FD that attains the same performance using HD APs, while obviating the burden of intra-AP interference cancellation.}

We then propose practical methods to generate time domain Zak-OTFS signals, for actual transmission, using the windowing functions. For Type-1, the signals are generated using an interpolation filter. For Type-2, they are generated using a form of precoded OFDM. We show that this allows a wide variety of pulse shapes to be implemented in practice for Zak-OTFS modulation. This was not previously possible. We also show that the Type-2 signals are more spectrally efficient than their Type-1 counterparts. Finally, we compare the channel predictability of the two implementations.}

In this work, we propose to enhance PLS in a full-duplex symbiotic radio (FDSR) system with a proactive eavesdropper, which may overhear the information and interfere legitimate communications simultaneously by emitting attack signals. To deal with the eavesdroppers, we propose a security strategy based on pseudo-decoding and artificial noise (AN) injection to ensure the performance of legitimate communications through forward noise suppression. A novel AN signal generation scheme is proposed using a pseudo-decoding method, where AN signal is superimposed on data signal to safeguard the legitimate channel. The phase control in the forward noise suppression scheme and the power allocation between AN and data signals are optimized to maximize security throughput. The formulated problem can be solved via problem decomposition and alternate optimization algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of security throughput and attack mitigation performance.}

Such networks are densely and massively popupated and must meet stringent latency and reliability requirements. Due to these characteristics, grant-free random access is envisioned to alleviate the control overhead generated by the classical random access procedure. However, active user detection and channel estimation algorithms are required. Existing algorithms assume that the activity of each device is homogeneous and independent, which is not the case in many applications (e.g., due to sensors observing a common phenomenon). In order to address this problem, we introduce a new flexible model taking into account a group-heterogeneous activity, using the framework of copula theory. It is then leveraged by a hybrid generalized approximate message passing algorithm to solve the active user detection and channel estimation problem. Our numerical results show that the user detection and channel estimation are both improved with this new algorithm w.r.t. stateof- the-art Bayesian algorithms, with gains up to 10 times fewer detection errors and 10 dB less channel estimation error.}

	abstract = {The recently popularized ISAC paradigm attempts carry out both communication and sensing functionalities uses the same time-frequency resources to combat the scarcity of these resources. However, high-resolution range and velocity radars require wideband long-duration transmission, which implies complex, costly receivers to sample at a high-frequency rate. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS)-based ISAC system which enables achieving highly accurate range-velocity profiles without the need for large bandwidth transmissions or long-duration frames. This approach relaxes the constraints on bandwidth and time while still providing precise sensing information. The proposed scheme exploits a single OTFS carrier with rectangular pulse shaping as a pilot to estimate both simultaneous accruing delay and Doppler, thereby determining range and velocity, respectively. By leveraging the sidelobes of the physical pulse shape of the pilot signal, we propose an algorithm that allows the detection of the range and the velocity of radar targets beyond the resolution limitation set by the time duration and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. The conducted simulation results along with the real experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve accurate low-complexity radar parameter estimation.}

SINs often employ a large number of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites which are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Thus, game theoretic physical layer authentication (PLA) based on Doppler frequency spread (DS) and received power (RP) attributes is proposed to provide effective authentication for these satellites. Hypothesis testing with a threshold is used to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate (spoofer) satellites. Then, a zero-sum PLA game in which the ground station (GS) chooses the optimal detection threshold ( \\tau ^{*} ) to maximize its utility and a spoofing satellite ( s ) chooses the optimal attack probability ( k^{*} ) to maximize its utility. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {We explore a satellite internet of things (SIoT) system, wherein multiple IoT users are allowed to access the SIoT in a grant-free manner. Such a manner may incur the severe co-frequency interference (CFI), and decease the user capacity in terms of the number IoT users successfully accessing the SIoT. To this end, we first design two beam preprocessing oriented user grouping methods, called user distribution based user grouping (UDUG) and user position based user grouping (UPUG), respectively. With respect to the UDUG, we propose the regional statistical channel state information based multi-beam processing (RsCSI-MBP). For the UPUG, we conceive the user statistical channel state information with position error based MBP (UsCSIPe-MBP). Both the RsCSI-MBP and the UsCSIPe-MBP schemes can mitigate inter-beam CFI relying on MBP, wherein the optimized beamforming vectors are obtained by using generalized Rayleigh quotient. Furthermore, the user capacity, preamble collision probability and packet loss probability are analyzed for the RsCSI-MBP and UsCSIPe-MBP schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the UsCSIPe-MBP scheme outperforms the RsCSI-MBP and the conventional seven-color frequency-reuse multibeam schemes in terms of a higher user capacity and a lower packet loss probability, even considering the satellite mobility, phase and amplitude inconsistence of the antenna array used.}

Communication takes place through energy-efficient technologies such as capacitive coupling (CC) and galvanic coupling (GC); however, their modeling is still incomplete. This paper tackles characterization of the human body channel using impulse response, including a first-ever comparison of CC and GC in both wearable and implantable configurations. Experimental data are leveraged to evaluate the measured impulse response in ex-vivo chicken tissue and in-vivo human tissue in a frequency range up to 100 kHz. Pseudorandom noise (PN) sequences are transmitted in baseband and a correlative channel sounding system is implemented. Experimental results demonstrate that the channel is relatively flat in the frequency range of interest, thus offering the opportunity to simplify the design of an IBC transceiver. The relationship between the channel responses and the transmitter-to-receiver distance is also examined using linear correlation, and two regression models are developed. The results show that CC channels are not affected by distance within the range of investigation, while a negative relationship is found for GC channels. Finally, experiments reveal that implantable CC with isolated ground -not deeply investigated yet- is a very promising solution for IBC.}

Spreading information symbols across the entire delay-Doppler plane enables OTFS to exploit full diversity. Nevertheless, there is a need for enhanced reliability in OTFS systems to satisfy the rigorous requirements of forthcoming communication systems. To tackle this concern, we propose a scheme called joint delay-Doppler index modulation OTFS (JDDIM-OTFS). This scheme activates delay or Doppler resource elements in a subframe, and in order to obtain higher spectral efficiency, we use different constellations for each active resource block. Furthermore, we utilize a low-complex detector with the help of a greedy approach. Moreover, a theoretical upper bound is derived for the bit error rate (BER). Simulation results validate that JDDIM-OTFS outmatches classical OTFS and other benchmark schemes in terms of BER under perfect and imperfect channel conditions.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a security-aware computation offloading framework tailored for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) networks operating in environments with aerial eavesdroppers (AEs) and ground eavesdroppers (GEs). It is envisaged that multiple ground nodes (GNs) should perform computation tasks partly locally and partly remotely by offloading a portion of these tasks to MEC servers. To facilitate this paradigm, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is deployed, serving as both an aerial MEC server and a relay for forwarding part of the tasks to a ground access point (AP) for computing. The computation offloading is further reinforced by incorporating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) unit in close proximity to the AP. Within this context, this paper provides an analysis of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and formulates an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the minimum secure computation efficiency (SCE) by jointly optimizing transmit power allocation, time slot scheduling, task allocation, and RIS’s phase shifts. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, an iterative algorithm is introduced to address the fractional objective function and coupled optimization variables by employing Dinkelbach- and block coordinate descent (BCD)-based methods, respectively. The obtained results confirm the efficacy of the optimized scheme.}

We address two critical challenges: the characterization of FAP density and the establishment of capacity bounds for channels with vertically-drifted FAP. Our method relate macroscopic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models to microscopic Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) models, resulting in a precise expression that links FAP density with elliptic-type Green’s function. This formula is distinguished by its wide applicability across any spatial dimensions, any drift directions, and various receiver geometries. We demonstrate the practicality of our model through case studies: 2D and 3D planar receivers. The accuracy of our formula is also validated by particle-based simulations. Advancing further, the explicit FAP density forms enable us to establish closed-form upper and lower bounds for the capacity of vertically-drifted FAP channels under a second-moment constraint, significantly advancing the understanding of FAP channels in MC systems.}

	abstract = {A two-time-scale approximate Markov decision process (MDP) is proposed to optimize the uplink queuing performance of a millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system. Exploiting the wireless sensing techniques, the locations of signal reflectors, blockers, and mobile agents, as well as the mobility pattern of agents, become available knowledge to facilitate predictive scheduling. Notice that the state variation of the wireless channel fading and transmission queue is much faster than that of mobile agents’ locations. The joint optimization of uplink power adaptation, time allocation, and analog beamforming of all the frames is formulated as a two-time-scale MDP with the average uplink energy, queuing length, and buffer overflow rate in the minimization objective. The scheduling in the larger time scale with an infinite horizon, i.e., the analog transceiver beamforming, adapts with the random motion of mobile agents; whereas the scheduling in the smaller time scale with a finite horizon, i.e., uplink power and time allocation, adapts with both the small-scale channel fading, queue dynamics and large-scale random motion. The optimal solution of two-time-scale MDP requests iterative optimization between Bellman’s equations of both time scales, whose computation complexity is prohibitive. A novel low-complexity solution framework is then proposed to obtain the optimal larger-time-scale and sub-optimal smaller-time-scale policies, where the performance of the proposed scheme is bounded analytically. Benefiting from the motion sensing and blockage prediction, the proposed scheduling scheme outperforms existing benchmarks in the numerical simulations.}

The problem is formulated as a constrained partial observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP) in general. We first derive the achievable age of information (AoI) by the random and determined transmission policies, which works in the absence of feedback. Then, we propose a greedy policy that traces the expected receiver AoI based on the delayed feedback, and selects the action that minimizes the expected immediate Lagrange cost defined in the formulated CPOMDP. The proposed policy outperforms the existing policies for a wide range of feedback delay, even in the absence of feedback, yet the implementation complexity is still low since the decision threshold is derived in the closed-form, as a function of the network parameters.}

	abstract = {Extended reality (XR) is an emerging 6G application with unique traffic characteristics and requirements, calling for innovative Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) technologies. This paper investigates multi-user scheduling to meet XR services’ hard-latency constraints. Specifically, we focus on a periodical traffic model, where the latency constraint for transmitting each XR frame is less than the inter-arrival time. We describe the system as a periodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the performance metric being the probability of successful transmission within the latency constraint. We then obtain the maximum success probability and the optimal scheduling based on the optimal value function. In the case of homogeneous arrivals, we construct a lower bound of the optimal value function. Based on this, we propose an online multi-user scheduling policy that determines scheduling decisions by solving a series of nonlinear Knapsack Problems (KPs) in polynomial time. Our analysis demonstrates that the scheduling scheme is asymptotically optimal with increasing users. Furthermore, we extend the online scheduling scheme to heterogeneous arrivals and present extensions for practical scenarios with multiple resource blocks, quasi-periodical arrivals, random frame sizes, and time-correlated channel fading. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheduler achieves near-optimal performance and outperforms other benchmark schedulers.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) can generate huge communication overhead for the central server, which may cause operational challenges. Furthermore, the central server’s failure or compromise may result in a breakdown of the entire system. To mitigate this issue, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has been proposed as a more resilient framework that does not rely on a central server, as demonstrated in previous works. DFL involves the exchange of parameters between each device through a wireless network. To optimize the communication efficiency of the DFL system, various transmission schemes have been proposed and investigated. However, the limited communication resources present a significant challenge for these schemes. Therefore, to explore the impact of constrained resources, such as computation and communication costs on the DFL, this study analyzes the model performance of resource-constrained DFL using different communication schemes (digital and analog) over wireless networks. Specifically, we provide convergence bounds for both digital and analog transmission approaches, enabling analysis of the model performance trained on DFL. Furthermore, for digital transmission, we investigate and analyze resource allocation between computation and communication and convergence rates, obtaining its communication complexity and the minimum probability of correction communication required for convergence guarantee. For analog transmission, we discuss the impact of channel fading and noise on the model performance and the maximum errors accumulation with convergence guarantee over fading channels. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to evaluate the performance and convergence rate of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) trained in the DFL framework on fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our simulation results validate our analysis and discussion, revealing how to improve performance by optimizing system parameters under different communication conditions.}

	abstract = {Task-oriented semantic communications have achieved significant performance gains. However, the employed deep neural networks in semantic communications have to be updated when the task is changed or multiple models need to be stored for performing different tasks. To address this issue, we develop a unified deep learning-enabled semantic communication system (U-DeepSC), where a unified end-to-end framework can serve many different tasks with multiple modalities of data. As the number of required features varies from task to task, we propose a vector-wise dynamic scheme that can adjust the number of transmitted symbols for different tasks. Moreover, our dynamic scheme can also adaptively adjust the number of transmitted features under different channel conditions to optimize the transmission efficiency. Particularly, we devise a lightweight feature selection module (FSM) to evaluate the importance of feature vectors, which can hierarchically drop redundant feature vectors and significantly accelerate the inference. To reduce the transmission overhead, we then design a unified codebook for feature representation to serve multiple tasks, where only the indices of these task-specific features in the codebook are transmitted. According to the simulation results, the proposed U-DeepSC achieves comparable performance to the task-oriented semantic communication system designed for a specific task but with significant reduction in both transmission overhead and model size.}

A critical challenge is to protect the privacy of individual user updates, as the latter can reveal extensive information about sensitive local datasets. To do so, a recent promising approach is information-theoretic secure aggregation, where parties learn the aggregate (sum) of user updates, but no further information is revealed about the individual updates. In this work, we present the first single-server secure aggregation framework in the context of clustered federated learning, to learn the aggregate of user updates for any clustering of users, but without learning any information about the local updates or cluster identities. Our framework can achieve linear communication complexity under formal information-theoretic privacy guarantees, while providing key trade-offs between communication and computation complexity, adversary tolerance, and resilience to user dropouts.}

However, current deep learning-based methods face limitations due to their reliance on joint source-channel coding and end-to-end training, hindering adaptability to new channels and user demands. In this study, we introduce the Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Semantic Communication (RIS-SC) framework as a solution. This framework dynamically allocates semantic content, leveraging varying degrees of RIS assistance to cater to the evolving needs of users. It takes into account factors such as user mobility and obstacles in the line of sight, enabling the RIS resource to preserve essential semantics even in challenging channel conditions. While this ensures the preservation of core semantics in difficult channel conditions, it may also lead to the loss of some non-essential semantic details under extreme conditions. To counteract this, we have incorporated a reconstruction method that deduces the missing semantic elements, thereby enhancing visual understanding. The RIS-SC framework stands out for its adaptability, ensuring optimal resource distribution for users under favorable conditions and maintaining visual clarity in challenging scenarios. Simulations validate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach in diverse channel conditions and user demands.}

	abstract = {Scalability is a major concern in implementing deep learning (DL) based methods in wireless communication systems. Given various channel reconstruction tasks, applying one DL model for one specific task is costly in both model training and model storage. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep plug-and-play prior method for three channel reconstruction tasks in the downlink of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, including channel estimation, antenna extrapolation and channel state information (CSI) feedback. The proposed method corresponding to these three channel reconstruction tasks employs a common DL model, which greatly reduces the overhead of model training and storage. Unlike general multi-task learning, the DL model of the proposed method does not require further fine-tuning for specific channel reconstruction tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DeepMIMO dataset to demonstrate the convergence, performance, and storage overhead of the proposed method for the three channel reconstruction tasks.}

	abstract = {Integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial relay networks (ISATRNs) have been considered as a promising architecture for next-generation networks, where high altitude platform (HAP) is pivotal in these integrated networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for HAP-based ISATRNs with mixed FSO/RF transmission mode, which incorporates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to dynamically reconfigure the propagation environment and fulfill the massive access requirements of ground users. Our aim is to maximize the system ergodic rate by joint optimizing the UAV trajectory, RIS phase shift, and active transmit beamforming matrix under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To solve this intractable problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based energy efficient optimization scheme by utilizing an improved long short-term memory (LSTM)-double deep Q-network (DDQN) framework is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over the traditional DDQN algorithm, on single-step exploration average reward values and other evaluation metrics.}

	abstract = {For the future 6G-enabled massive Internet of Things (mIoT), how to effectively manage spectrum resources to support huge data traffic under the large-scale overlapping caused by the dense deployment of massive devices is the imperative challenge. In this paper, a novel hypergraph interference model is designed, and two reinforcement learning (RL)-based resource management algorithms in the 6G-enabled mIoT are proposed to enhance the network throughput and avoid overlapping interference. Then, based on the hypergraph interference model, the resource management problem of execution network throughput maximization is theoretically formulated under large-scale overlapping interference scenarios. To handle this problem, we convert it into a Markov decision process (MDP) model and then deal with this MDP model through the advantage actor-critic (A2C)-based resource management algorithm and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C)-based resource management algorithm, which aim to maximize network throughput of the spectrum resource allocation among massive devices. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms can not only avoid large-scale overlapping interference but also improve the network throughput.}

	abstract = {We consider gossip networks consisting of a source that maintains the current version of a file, n nodes that use asynchronous gossip mechanisms to disseminate fresh information in the network, and an oblivious adversary who infects the packets at a target node through data timestamp manipulation, with the intent to replace circulation of fresh packets with outdated packets in the network. We demonstrate how network topology capacitates an adversary to influence age scaling in a network. We show that in a fully connected network, a single infected node increases the expected age from $O(\\log n)$ to $O(n)$ . Further, we show that the optimal behavior for an adversary is to reset the timestamps of all outgoing packets to the current time and of all incoming packets to an outdated time for the infected node; thereby preventing any fresh information to go into the infected node, and facilitating acceptance of stale information out of the infected node into other network nodes. Additionally, if the adversary allows the infected node to accept a small fraction of incoming packets from the network, then a large network can manage to curb the spread of stale files coming from the infected node and pull the network age back to $O(\\log n)$ . Lastly for fully connected network, we show that if an infected node contacts only a single node instead of all nodes of the network, the system age can still be degraded to $O(n)$ . These show that fully connected nature of a network can be both a benefit and a detriment for information freshness; full connectivity, while enabling fast dissemination of information, also enables fast dissipation of adversarial inputs. We then analyze the unidirectional ring network, the other end of the network connectivity spectrum, where we show that the adversarial effect on age scaling of a node is limited by its distance from the adversary, and the age scaling for a large fraction of the network continues to be $O(\\sqrt {n})$ , unchanged from the case with no adversary. We finally support our findings with simulations.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the routing problem in ambient backscatter wireless sensor networks (AB-WSNs) using reinforcement learning approaches. Ambient RF signals serve as the only power source for battery-less sensor nodes and are also leveraged to enable backscatter communication among these nodes. This results in intermittent connection and dynamic topology within AB-WSNs, thereby making it difficult to route data to the sink, e.g., data may not reach the sink in a timely manner. We first introduce a multi-agent network model with two mechanisms to address this issue. We then model the routing problem with the Markov decision process, allowing each node to make informed route decisions based on the current state of its neighbors. With the aim of enabling each node to learn the optimal routing policy and do adaptive stateless routing, we propose two learning algorithms. The first, a value-based learning algorithm, is designed for sparse AB-WSNs. And the second, a policy-based learning algorithm, is intended to tackle the curse of dimensionality in dense AB-WSNs. We analyze the convergence of both learning algorithms and evaluate their performance through extensive experiments. The experiment results validate the convergence and efficiency of the proposed learning algorithms under various conditions.}

We also introduce a novel internal-stopping (IS) principle into the conventional joint detection and decoding (JDD) architecture, the resultant IS-aided JDD (IS-JDD) algorithm significantly reduces the computational overhead. Inspired by the proposed IS-JDD architecture, we further conceive a low-complexity IS-aided extrinsic-information-transfer (IS-EXIT) algorithm to analyze the convergence performance of P-LDPC-coded MIMO-VLC systems. Both theoretical and simulation results verify that our proposed designs can remarkably outperform the existing benchmark schemes in terms of capacity, convergence and complexity.}

	abstract = {User-centric (UC) philosophy is a promising network formation method in light emitting diode enabled visible light communication (VLC) systems. Nevertheless, the nonlinear channel impairments restrict the overall system performance and have not been fully considered in the association structure designing. In this paper, an adaptive user association approach within the UC-cells formation of dense VLC networks is investigated under the consideration of practical nonlinear impairments and adjacent interference. It is mathematically formulated to be an achievable data rate maximization problem by coordinately determining the optimal candidates of access point, clipping ratio and information-carrying power. We divide this mixed combinatorial and non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems and delicately transform them to be binary nonlinear programming and constrained linear programming problems, respectively. In addition, we develop an efficient approach to obtain the local optimal solution with low-computational complexity in an alternating iterative way. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has relatively fast convergence and shows robustness to the variation of complex interference patterns and nonlinear impairments. Moreover, it can achieve significant throughput gain as compared with the conventional schemes, demonstrating the prospect and validity of this methodology for dense VLC networks with actual nonlinear devices.}

This paper combines these two technologies by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique called DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) equipped with PLS as applied to indoor VLC systems. First, a novel PLS algorithm is designed to protect the DCO-OFDM transmission of the legitimate user from an eavesdropper. A closed-form expression for the achievable secrecy rate is derived and compared with the conventional DCO-OFDM without security. To analyze the security performance of the PLS algorithm under the effects of the residual clipping noise and the channel estimation errors, a closed-form expression is derived for a Bayesian estimator of the clipping noise induced naturally at the DCO-OFDM systems after estimating the optical channel impulse response (CIR), by a pilot-aided sparse channel estimation algorithm with the compressed sensing approach, in the form of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and the least-squares (LS). Finally, from the numerical and the computer simulations, it is shown that the proposed PLS algorithm with secret key exchange guarantees the eavesdropper’s BER to stay close to 0.5 and that the proposed encryption-based PLS algorithm does not affect the BER performance of the legitimate user in the system.}

In a dedicated-cache-aided MuPIR problem each user is equipped with a cache that can store M files. In this paper, we consider a generalized version, called multi-access cache-aided MuPIR problem, where there are K users and C \\leq K caches each capable of storing M files and each user can access several cache nodes and every cache node can be accessed by several users. The cache nodes are filled with the content of the files before users decide their demands. Then each user chooses a file index, and users cooperatively send queries to the servers to retrieve their desired files privately. The aim is to reduce the size of broadcast done by the servers as a response to these queries. We propose a scheme that utilizes multi-access caches in generalised combinatorial topology, introduced by (Brunero and Elia, 2023) and show that our scheme is order-optimal within a multiplicative factor of 2, assuming uncoded cache placement. Also, we compare the per-user rate of our setup with dedicated cache setup of (Zhang et al., 2021) in various settings.}

We adopt the two-timescale scheme to design the systems, namely, applying the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to design the base station (BS) beamforming and leveraging the statistical CSI to design the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS. Specifically, we estimate the overall channels based on the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimator and derive the closed-form expression of the average achievable rate. Based on the derived rate, we analyze the power scaling laws in which the transmit power is respectively reduced inversely proportional to the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements. Besides, we draw insights from the comparison between STAR-RIS and conventional RIS under the same condition and the power scaling laws of STAR-RIS and optimize the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS to maximize the sum rate using an accelerated gradient ascent-based algorithm. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical insights. In particular, we also compare the two-timescale scheme with the instantaneous CSI scheme in the simulation. We show that STAR-RIS outperforms conventional RIS, and the two-timescale-based scheme outperforms the instantaneous CSI-based scheme. Furthermore, we draw insight into this phenomenon.}

Multi-UAV MEC systems can meet the quality of service requirements for computation intensive applications of ground terminals (GTs) in complex field environments, emergency disaster relief and other special scenarios. In this paper, a multi-UAV cooperative computation framework is proposed while taking the GT movement and random arrival of computation tasks into consideration. A long-term optimization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and resource allocation, subject to minimizing the total GT computation task completion time and the total system energy consumption. To solve this problem, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm is proposed. In particular, the optimization problem is decomposed into a long time-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning subproblem and a short time-scale resource allocation subproblem. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is invoked to solve the long time-scale subproblem. The greedy algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method are employed to solve the short time-scale subproblem. Finally, a joint multiple time-scale optimization algorithm with a two-layer loop structure is proposed. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed multi-UAV cooperative computation MEC system outperforms the conventional MEC system without collaboration among UAVs; and 2) the proposed algorithm can quickly adapt to different degrees of environmental dynamics and outperforms the benchmark algorithm for different network sizes, task requirements, and available resources.}

	abstract = {Cell free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology in realizing beyond fifth generation (B5G) networks. Massive deployment of access points (APs) in a CF-mMIMO system increases the spectral efficiency, however it also increases the energy consumption and fronthaul requirements. Since recently reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is shown to be a cost-effective solution to improve performance of wireless networks, RIS can be a promising technology to enhance the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. In this work, we study the downlink (DL) performance of CF-mMIMO system aided by multiple RISs, while considering correlated Rician fading channels, discrete RIS phase-shifts and low-complexity channel estimation (CE) protocol. Given the obtained imperfect channel state information (CSI), we derive lower bounds on the rates achieved using conjugate beamforming (CB) and zero-forcing (ZF) precoders. The obtained bounds depend on channel statistics, RIS phase-shifts and number of RIS elements. To optimize the performance with respect to RIS phase-shifts, we formulate a maximization problem and propose a sub-optimal genetic algorithm (GA)-based solution. Through simulations, we demonstrate that distributed RIS deployment outperforms centralized RIS deployment in terms of DL throughput. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the DL throughput improves as number of RISs increases until an optimal number of distributed RISs over which the DL performance of the system starts to drop. We discuss this effect under varying the number of APs and RISs. We extend the analysis by considering different precoders, CE and RIS optimization schemes, and verify the accuracy of our derived analytical results by Monte-Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the evolution of wireless communication networks from utilizing the sub-6 GHz spectrum and the millimeter wave frequency band to incorporating extremely high frequencies like optical and terahertz for 6G and beyond. While these higher frequencies offer broader bandwidths and extreme data rate capabilities, the transition from single-band and heterogeneous networks to multi-band networks (MBNs), where various frequency bands coexist introduces novel challenges in channel modeling, transceiver and antenna design, programmable simulation platforms, standardization, and resource allocation. This paper provides a tutorial overview from the communication design perspective of the various frequency bands, elaborating on the above issues. Then, we introduce and examine typical MBN architectures for future networks and provide a detailed overview of state-of-the-art resource allocation problems for existing MBNs that typically operate on two frequency bands. The considered resource allocation optimization problems and solution techniques are discussed comprehensively. We then identify key performance metrics and constraint sets that should be considered for resource allocation optimization in future MBNs and provide numerical results to depict how various system parameters and user behaviors can influence their performance. Finally, we present several potential research issues as future work for the design and performance optimization of MBNs.}

	abstract = {Bayesian learning aided massive antenna array based THz MIMO systems are designed for spatial-wideband and frequency-wideband scenarios, collectively termed as the dual-wideband channels. Essentially, numerous antenna modules of the THz system result in a significant delay in the transmission/ reception of signals in the time-domain across the antennas, which leads to spatial-selectivity. As a further phenomenon, the wide bandwidth of THz communication results in substantial variation of the effective angle of arrival/ departure (AoA/ AoD) with respect to the subcarrier frequency. This is termed as the beam squint effect, which renders the channel state information (CSI) estimation challenging in such systems. To address this problem, initially, a pilot-aided (PA) Bayesian learning (PA-BL) framework is derived for the estimation of the Terahertz (THz) MIMO channel that relies exclusively on the pilot beams transmitted. Since the framework designed can successfully operate in an ill-posed model, it can verifiably lead to reduced pilot transmissions in comparison to conventional methodologies. The above paradigm is subsequently extended to additionally incorporate data symbols to derive a Data-Aided (DA) BL approach that performs joint data detection and CSI estimation. We will demonstrate that it is capable of improving the dual-wideband channel’s estimate, despite further reducing the training overhead. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds (BCRLBs) are also obtained for explicitly characterizing the lower bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) of the PA-BL and DA-BL frameworks. Our simulation results show the improved normalized MSE (NMSE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance of the proposed estimation schemes and confirm that they approach their respective BCRLB benchmarks.}

	abstract = {User-centric clustering is a valid solution to enhance the coverage and throughput for future mobile communication networks. However, the size of clusters, the location of nodes, and the number of cooperating nodes within the cluster can all have an impact on the data rate of the typical user. In this paper, the user-centric clustering with limited cooperation (LC) in downlink cell-free (CF) architecture is considered, and the effect of composite channels and intra-cluster cooperation on the data rate of the typical user is analyzed from a theoretical derivation level. Specifically, the user classification, the distributions of distances between the serving nodes, and the average data rates of each type of user are given, respectively. The approximate expressions of the Laplace transform (LT) of interfering power for different types of users are obtained with the Gauss-Hermitian integral approximation, and the long-term average data rate of the typical user is derived. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are executed to verify the accuracy of the theory. The results show that shadowing fading should not be ignored for accurately evaluating user performance, and it is particularly important to reasonably select the radius of the cluster and the cooperation threshold that controls whether the access points cooperate or not.}

	abstract = {Next-generation wireless applications are expected to enable extended ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) to support high data rates along with ultra-reliability and low-latency features beyond the capabilities of existing core services. There is a need to transition from conventional architectures to more efficient and robust multiple-access schemes to meet these consolidated requirements in resource-constrained systems. This study explores the utilization of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems to enable spectrally efficient URLLC, even under the imperfect channel state information. In particular, we focus on maximizing spectral efficiency by jointly designing robust beamforming at the base station and STAR-RIS subject to given URLLC requirements. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we propose an alternating optimization framework that obtains sub-optimal solutions to the problems of beamforming design at the BS and STAR-RIS, respectively by exploiting \\mathcal {S}-\nprocedure and successive convex approximation. Simulation results confirm that the STAR-RIS-NOMA system can significantly boost the spectral efficiency by 10-15% compared to conventional reflecting-only RIS while guaranteeing the strict URLLC requirements. Specifically, among all the possible modes of STAR-RIS, the time-splitting mode provides better spectral efficiency than other modes owing to its better interference management.}

The transceivers of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) are non-ideal with hardware impairments. The closed-form expressions of the total uplink (UL) EE and the average harvested energy (HE) are derived by employing a non-linear energy harvesting model and coherent transmission schemes. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total uplink EE, in which power control coefficients for APs and UEs, and the large-scale fading decoding vectors are considered. An alternating algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed to tackle the complexity issue of the non-convex optimization problem. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the total uplink EE comparing with the equal power allocation strategies. Moreover, it is revealed that the hardware impairments on the UEs can be the primary limitation to the total uplink EE in comparison with those on the APs, however, the impact can be effectively mitigated by the proposed algorithm.}

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with caching and multicasting is attractive for such scenarios with high traffic demands, since the multicasting allows concurrently serving users, and the caching can alleviate the burden on backhaul links. Hence, in this work, we investigate a cellular network assisted by caching-and-multicasting-empowered UAVs, where UAVs multicast the files from their caching storage or base stations via wireless backhaul links. Particularly, a popularity-aware (PA) file selection and multicast scheme is proposed, where the files to be multicasted are determined by the instantaneous requested popularity, the maximum number of allowable fetched files and the performance on wireless backhaul links. By leveraging stochastic geometry, we obtain the approximated yet accurate result for the average number of successfully multicasted users. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the PA scheme, i.e., achieving a larger average number of successfully multicasted users compared to the random scheme for most cases. Moreover, the results suggest that a relatively smaller number of multicast channels or reducing the maximum number of allowable fetched files can benefit network performance in the case of the high signal-to-interference ratio threshold on the backhaul links.}

	abstract = {Wireless communication is vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks due to the inherent broadcasting nature of wireless channels. This paper investigates an anti-jamming communication system that employs a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance desired signals and suppress jamming signals. To optimize the system performance while guaranteeing fairness, we maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the legitimate user equipments by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the reflecting coefficients at the RIS, subject to the BS’s maximum transmit power constraint and the RIS’s reflecting coefficient constraints. To solve the non-convex max-min-fairness optimization problem, we propose an alternating-optimization (AO)-based approach that alternates between optimizing variables using a second-order-cone program and semi-definite relaxation techniques. Considering the piratical limitation of imperfect jammer-related channel state information (CSI), we also adopt the stochastic successive convex approximation technique for tackling imperfect CSI in the AO-based approach. Furthermore, we propose a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based solving approach that does not require the jammer-related CSI. Numerical results show that both approaches improve the minimum SINR performance significantly. Although the AO-based approach with real-time CSI slightly outperforms the DRL-based approach with historical CSI, the DRL-based approach uses the trained deep neural network to obtain the beamforming decision directly without solving optimization problems.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless relaying technology has aroused great interest recently as a promising new solution to enhance the system performance. However, most existing works only consider the decode-and-forward (DF) relay and ignore the base station (BS) to user direct link. In this paper, we focus on an IRS-aided full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system and study the deployment design and beamforming optimization problem. Specifically, we first analyze the asymptotic rates achieved by three IRS deployment strategies (i.e., deploying the IRS near the BS, relay and user) when the number of reflecting elements becomes sufficiently large to obtain useful insights. Then, for the practical case with finite number of reflecting elements, we aim to maximize the transmission rate under different IRS deployment strategies by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and transmit powers at the BS and relay. For the case of deploying the IRS near the user, a block coordinate decent (BCD)-based algorithm is proposed. For the cases of deploying the IRS near the relay and BS, we propose a virtual stochastic successive convex approximation (VSSCA) algorithm to solve our considered deterministic optimization problems efficiently. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the asymptotic performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared to various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {When using ultra-wideband signaling on massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, the electromagnetic wave incurs an extra delay (across the array elements) comparable to or larger than the symbol duration, which translates into a shift in beam direction known as the beam squint effect. The beam squinting problem degrades the array gain and reduces the system capacity. This paper proposes a novel transceiver design based on lens antenna subarray and analog subband filters to compensate for the beam squinting effect. Specifically, the proposed design chunks the wideband signal from the phase shifters into groups of narrowband signals and controls their squints through an exhaustive search-based switching/precoding mechanism under the lenses. Furthermore, a simplified, thresholded search-based precoding algorithm is proposed, which demonstrates good performance while significantly minimizing complexity. The proposed system is analyzed in terms of beam gain, complexity, power consumption, and capacity. The numerical results demonstrate significant performance enhancement for the proposed system design as compared to the conventional mMIMO system with an uncompensated beam squinting problem.}

	abstract = {In distributed computing systems, to mitigate the adverse effect of stragglers on the computation time, computation redundancy is used. The redundancy can be added proactively at the beginning, or reactively after some time based on the delay pattern of the workers. While most of the existing work with reactive mitigation strategy only considered task replication, we propose a coded reactive straggler mitigation with an uncoded and a coded phase for distributed matrix-matrix multiplications. Specifically, in the uncoded phase of the proposed strategy, the master distributes the computational job without redundancy among the workers. After a predetermined waiting time, the master cancels the remaining tasks. It then encodes the remaining tasks and distributes them among the workers. In the uncoded phase, in addition to the conventional erasure model, where workers can communicate only once, we consider multi-message communication (MMC) model to exploit the partial works done by workers. The optimum waiting time for the uncoded phase and the optimum code rate for the coded phase are also obtained. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed coded reactive mitigation significantly decreases the execution time in comparison with both the proactive mitigation strategy or the existing reactive mitigation strategy.}

First, the definition of GUCI is proposed. The coding structure of GUCI is introduced. Next, we propose a class of GUCIs\nC\nto reach the expansion factor\nK\nC\n=2\n, and we show that the smallest minimum expansion factor is in the range\n1≤\nK\n∗\n≤2\n.

	abstract = {We present two strategies to reduce the complexity of the alternating direction method of multipliers when applied to linear programming (ADMM-LP) decoding of low-density parity-check codes. First, to address the high complexity of computing a projection onto the parity polytope, the complexity bottleneck of ADMM-LP decoding, we propose the sparse affine projection algorithm (SAPA). SAPA projects onto the affine hull of \\chi \\leq d nearby local codewords where the check degree is d and where \\chi can be significantly smaller than d. Unlike exact projection, SAPA does not require a water-filling process, and thus can be implemented with lower per-iteration complexity. Second, to reduce the number of effective iterations needed for ADMM-LP decoding, we propose a randomized layered scheduling framework. Rather than updating checks in round-robin fashion in each iteration, more “problematic” checks have a higher probability of being updated. The probability mass function that governs the selection of which checks to update is based upon the location of replica vectors inside (or on) the parity polytope. The resultant decoder converges significantly faster under this randomized scheduling than under round-robin scheduling. This makes it well suited for use in applications that limit the number of iterations.}

	abstract = {Molecular Communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication paradigm utilizing molecules for information transfer. Research on MC has largely transitioned from theoretical investigations to practical testbed implementations, harnessing microfluidics and sensor technologies. Accurate models for input-output relationships on these platforms are crucial for optimizing MC methods and understanding the impact of physical parameters on performance. Our study focuses on a practical microfluidic MC system with a graphene field effect transistor biosensor (bioFET)-based receiver, developing an end-to-end frequency-domain model. The model provides insights into the dispersion, distortion, and attenuation of received signals, thus potentially informing the design of new frequency-domain MC techniques, such as modulation and detection methods. The accuracy of the developed model is verified through particle-based spatial stochastic simulations of pulse transmission and ligand-receptor reactions on the receiver surface.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) is a new multi-carrier scheme based on chirp spread spectrum (CSS) recently introduced and shown to be more robust to interference. In this paper, we propose a novel OCDM system based on index modulation (IM). In this scheme, information is conveyed not only by {M}\n-ary signal constellation in classic OCDM, but also by subchirp indices activated in accordance with the input bitstream. We design a receiver structure based on single-tap frequency domain equalization (FDE) and maximum likelihood (ML) detection. To address the exponential complexity growth caused by ML detection, we also propose a novel reduced-complexity maximum likelihood (RC-ML) detector. The new detector offers a comparable BER performance to the ML one with a substantially reduced complexity. A theoretical peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance analysis of the new scheme is given to illustrate the advantages of combining OCDM with IM. We provide an extensive performance analysis of the new scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER), diversity gain, and minimum Euclidean distance (MED). Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the PAPR and BER performances of the proposed scheme are significantly better than those of the OCDM scheme due to the information bits carried by the OCDM subchirp indices. Moreover, our numerical results verify the robustness of the system in the presence of carrier frequency offsets (CFO).}

	abstract = {Drawing inspiration from the advantages of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) in wireless networks, this paper presents a novel design for intelligent omni surface (IOS) enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). By harnessing the power of multi-antennas and a multitude of elements, the dual-function base station (BS) and IOS collaborate to realize joint active and passive beamforming, enabling seamless 360-degree ISAC coverage. The objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of multi-target sensing while ensuring the multi-user multi-stream communications. To achieve this, a comprehensive optimization approach is employed, encompassing the design of radar receive vector, transmit beamforming matrix, and IOS transmissive and reflective coefficients. Due to the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, an auxiliary variable is introduced to transform it into a more tractable form. Consequently, the problem is decomposed into three sub-problems based on the block coordinate descent algorithm. Semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation methods are leveraged to convert the sub-problem into a convex problem, while the iterative rank minimization algorithm and penalty function method ensure the equivalence. Furthermore, the scenario is extended to mode switching and time switching protocols. Simulation results validate the convergence and superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems can suffer from malicious jamming attacks due to the open nature of wireless channels. Deploying aerial intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS) can flexibly configure the propagation environment of ISAC to address this threat. In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming scheme for ISAC via AIRS. Our goal is to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitting beamforming at the dual-function base station, as well as the phase shift matrix and deployment of AIRS, while satisfying the echo signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirement of target sensing. To handle this non-convex problem with multiple coupled variables, we decompose it into three sub-problems and solve them via the alternate optimization. We first introduce auxiliary variables to convert the transmit beamforming sub-problem into a convex counterpart and solve it via semi-definite relaxation. Then, the IRS phase-shift design is transformed into an equivalent rank-constrained problem, and the penalty-based method and the first-order Taylor expansion are leveraged to calculate the passive beamforming. Finally, with the optimized active and passive beamformings, we resort to successive convex approximation to optimize the AIRS deployment. Simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Large-scale satellite constellations lead to a scarcity of spatial spectrum resources, especially for the overlapped spectrum between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Orbit (GEO)satellites in hybrid constellations. Hence, based on game theory, a distributed spectrum-sharing method is proposed for downlink spectrum sharing in large-scale hybrid satellite constellations. Specifically, the system cycle is divided into equal-spaced topological periods, and the beams of LEO satellites are assigned to LEO ground stations (LGS) during every topological period. A system model based on game theory is also developed to describe the mutual interference of links established between LEO satellites and LGS. Subsequently, the formulated game is proven to be an exact potential game, with at least one pure strategic Nash equilibrium (NE). Along the line, to obtain the NE solution, a dynamic channel allocation algorithm is proposed based on stochastic learning theory, and the convergence is proven. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the proposed DCASLA’s effectiveness, which can balance the convergence speed and overall network satisfaction.}

	abstract = {Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) directly transmits confidential information over a quantum channel. In this context, it is important to take into account the multi-photon effect when using weak coherent laser pulses as the quantum source. Here we propose a multi-intensity QSDC (MI-QSDC) protocol where laser pulses having different intensities are used for secure communication in a fashion reminiscent of decoy states, where only signal intensity pulses are used for key exchange. Pulses of all intensities are used both for information transmission and eavesdropping detection in the MI-QSDC. The statistical fluctuations associated with practical finite block-length in QSDC are also considered and a tight secrecy capacity bound is given. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol is capable of communicating over a distance on the order of 100 km by relying on a finite block-length of sending 1014 pulses.}

In coping with the increased dynamics in UAV networks, the transmission of control information is indispensable, requiring not only ultra reliability and low latency, but also high security. In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of the control information in a NOMA ground-air short-packet wireless network with an untrusted internal UAV or an external flying eavesdropper, respectively. Both the large-scale path loss and the Nakagami-m small-scale fading are considered. First, the closed-form expressions of the average secure block error rate (BLER) and the average achievable secrecy throughput in each scenario are derived. Then, the asymptotic performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is analyzed to get more insights from both scenarios. Specifically, analytical results show that error floors occur with the increase of SNR. Moreover, a one-dimensional search is applied to maximize the average achievable secrecy throughput by optimizing the blocklength. Simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of analysis and the effectiveness of optimization.}

In a scenario featuring multi-antenna user equipments (UEs), we consider the practical additive hardware impairments (AHIs) at transceivers and conduct a comprehensive analysis of their impact on the system performance. Leveraging the pronounced beam directivity inherent in mmWave MIMO, we design phase shifts of RISs and analog beamformers of transceivers to achieve beam alignment. In light of this, we explore a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) equivalent channel estimation method. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form expressions for downlink achievable spectral efficiency (SE) in the presence of AHIs, utilizing statistical channel state information (CSI) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). Based on the derived closed-form expressions, we propose an efficient power allocation strategy relying on an intelligent algorithm known as primal-dual optimization based deep deterministic policy gradient (PDO-DDPG), which can ensure safe exploration of the agent. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions, unveil the impact of AHIs on the achievable SE, and verify the effectiveness of the PDO-DDPG based power allocation.}

However, the original formulations of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of this model are not applicable to all possible values of its defining parameters, and are given in terms of multifold generalized hypergeometric functions, which prevents their widespread use for the derivation of performance metric expressions. A new formulation of the IFTR model is here presented as a countable mixture of Gamma distributions which greatly facilitates the performance evaluation for this model in terms of the metrics already known for the much simpler and widely used Nakagami-m fading, and is shown to provide a better fit to empirical measurements than the original formulation. Additionally, a closed-form expression is presented for the generalized moment generating function (GMGF), which permits to readily obtain all the moments of the distribution of the model, as well as several relevant performance metrics. Based on these new derivations, performance results are presented for the IFTR model considering different metrics, which are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {Wireless communication with the enormous demands of sensing ability have given rise to the integrated passive sensing and communication (IPSAC) technology. The main challenge of IPSAC is how to achieve high sensing and communication performance by integrating the passive sensing and communication demodulation. In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal processing optimization scheme by jointly processing the pilot and data signals. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an ISAC signal processing algorithm based on iterative optimization, which alternates the passive sensing and channel reconstruction to realize target sensing. However, the hyper-parameter configuration of the iterative optimization algorithm influences the performance of target detection and communication demodulation. Recognizing this fact, we propose a model-driven ISAC network (ISAC-NET) that adopts the block-by-block signal processing method to improve the communication and sensing performance. The proposed ISAC-NET obtains suitable hyper-parameters by deep learning to guarantee the performance and convergence of communication and sensing signal processing. From the simulation results, ISAC-NET obtains better communication performance than the traditional signal demodulation algorithm, which is close to OAMP-Net2. Compared to the 2D-DFT algorithm, ISAC-NET demonstrates significantly enhanced sensing performance. In summary, ISAC-NET is a promising tool for the IPSAC systems.}

We introduce a three-dimensional (3D) multi-user ISAC framework with distributed IRSs, which offers simultaneous signal demodulation, channel estimation, and localization. The transmission is divided into a user access stage and a downlink transmission stage. In the first stage, we propose an algorithm for simultaneous uplink signal demodulation and angles of arrival (AoA) estimation at the semi-passive IRS. Moreover, a joint active and passive beamforming scheme inspired by radar-communication, is proposed to enhance both communication and localization performance in the downlink stage, while eliminating the need for distinct localization reference signals. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ISAC framework achieves centimeter-level localization accuracy while maintaining comparable communication performance to communication-only systems, thus validating its effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication paradigm using molecules as information carriers, necessitating novel transceivers and modulation/detection techniques. In realizing practical MC receivers (MC-Rxs), biosensor field-effect transistor (bioFET)-based architectures are promising, having surface receptors that undergo reversible reactions with ligands. These interactions are converted into electrical signals via field effect, enabling the decoding of transmitted information. A significant challenge in these receivers is the limited specificity of receptors to target ligands, which leads to molecular cross-talk from similar interfering ligands co-existing in the MC channel. Decoding transmitted symbols under such interference is challenging in the time domain, especially when MC-Rx lacks prior knowledge of interferer statistics or operates near saturation. To address this, we introduce a frequency-domain detection (FDD) technique for bioFET-based MC-Rxs, which exploits the distinct binding reaction rates of different ligand types, reflected in the power spectrum of binding noise. Compared to conventional time-domain detection (TDD) technique, this method offers improved detection performance under stochastic molecular interference. We analyze the bit error probability (BEP) of FDD, confirming its superior performance in various interference scenarios. Moreover, the theoretical performance limits of FDD are validated through a particle-based spatial stochastic simulator, simulating binding reactions on MC-Rx within microfluidic channels.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the physical layer security for a distributed antenna system, where a base station (BS) equipped with multiple distributed antennas transmits signals to a legitimate user (U) through an opportunistic antenna. Meanwhile, multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Es) attempt to tap the information transmission between the BS and U. To enhance the physical layer security, a friendly jammer (J) is employed to create a potential interference to Es by emitting artificial noise. However, since U is not aware of the information sent by J, it can be affected by the interference. In this context, this paper proposes adaptive jamming (AJ) scheme and interference cancellation (IC) scheme to mitigate the interference’s impact on U and consequently improve secrecy performance. Specifically, the AJ scheme avoids interference from having a negative effect on the system security by setting an interference threshold, activating the jammer only when the interference to U is below the threshold value. By contrast, the IC scheme designs an advanced special signal to eliminate the interference from J to U. For comparison, we present conventional non-jammer (NJ) scheme as a benchmark. Exact and asymptotic secrecy outage probability expressions for NJ, AJ, and IC schemes are derived over Nakagami- m fading channels. Numerical results show that the proposed AJ and IC schemes perform better than NJ scheme in terms of secrecy outage probability. Additionally, the physical layer security of all schemes can be improved by increasing the number of distributed antennas.}

	abstract = {The design of Wireless Networked Control System (WNCS) requires addressing critical interactions between control and communication systems with minimal complexity and communication overhead while providing ultra-high reliability. This paper introduces a novel optimization theory based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for the joint design of controller and communication systems. The objective of minimum power consumption is targeted while satisfying the schedulability and rate constraints of the communication system in the finite blocklength regime and stability constraint of the control system. Decision variables include the sampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet error probability in the communication system. The proposed framework contains two stages: optimization theory and DRL. In the optimization theory stage, following the formulation of the joint optimization problem, optimality conditions are derived to find the mathematical relations between the optimal values of the decision variables. These relations allow the decomposition of the problem into multiple building blocks. In the DRL stage, the blocks that are simplified but not tractable are replaced by DRL. Via extensive simulations, the proposed optimization theory based DRL approach is demonstrated to outperform the optimization theory and pure DRL based approaches, with close to optimal performance and much lower complexity.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a promising technology for future communication system. In this paper, we consider a millimeter wave system over high mobility scenario, and propose a novel simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided ISAC scheme. To improve the communication service of the in-vehicle user equipment (UE) and simultaneously track and sense the vehicle with the help of nearby roadside units (RSUs), a STAR-RIS is equipped on the outside surface of the vehicle. Firstly, an efficient transmission structure for the ISAC scheme is developed, where a number of training sequences with orthogonal precoders and combiners are respectively utilized at BS and RSUs for channel parameter extraction. Then, the near-field static channel model between the STAR-RIS and in-vehicle UE as well as the far-field time-frequency selective BS-RIS-RSUs channel model are characterized. By utilizing the multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) algorithm, the cascaded channel parameters (i.e., the delays, the Doppler frequency shifts, the angles of arrivals, and the angles of departure of the scattering paths) of the BS-RIS-RSUs links can be obtained at the RSUs. Thus, the vehicle localization and its velocity measurement can be acquired by jointly utilizing these extracted cascaded channel parameters of all RSUs. Note that the MOMP algorithm can be further utilized to extract the channel parameters of the BS-RIS-UE link for communication service. With the help of sensing results, the reflection and refraction phase shifts of the STAR-RIS are delicately designed, which can significantly improve the received signal strength for both the RSUs and the in-vehicle UE, and can finally enhance the sensing and communication performance. Moreover, the trade-off design for sensing and communication is proposed by optimizing the energy splitting factors of the STAR-RIS. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed STAR-RIS aided ISAC scheme.}

	abstract = {Due to the open accessibility of wireless networks with severe privacy risks, covert communication has gained increasing attention, where the effective range is limited by the low transmit power. Fortunately, employing intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) as a relay has become an appealing solution to extend the range of covert communication. To this end, we investigate the covert communication in which the ground transmitter secretly delivers information to the full-duplex receiver through a two-way IRS, avoiding detection by the warden. Then, the error detection probability is determined with an optimal threshold at a warden, which is the worst case for covert transmission. Moreover, we analyze the closed-form expression of outage probability. To improve the covertness, artificial noise is generated by the receiver to interfere with the adversarial monitoring. Thus, considering the optimal prior probability, we maximize the expected error detection probability of warden subject to the covertness constraint. Specifically, we alternately optimize the prior probability and the transmit power of artificial noise while satisfying the outage probability and covertness requirement. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for covert communications via the two-way IRS.}

Previous works on identification for space-time block codes (STBC) of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are limited to additive white Gaussian noise. In this paper, we develop a novel automatic identification algorithm to exploit the generalized cross-correntropy function of the received signals to classify STBC-OFDM signals in the presence of Gaussian noise and impulsive interference. This algorithm first introduces the generalized cross-correntropy function to fully utilize the space-time redundancy of STBC-OFDM signals. The strongly-distinguishable discriminating matrix is then constructed by using the generalized cross-correntropy for multiple receive antennas. Finally, a decision tree identification algorithm is employed to identify the STBC-OFDM signals which is extended by the binary hypothesis test. The proposed algorithm avoids the traditionally required pre-processing tasks, such as channel coefficient estimation, noise and interference statistics prediction and modulation type recognition. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed scheme provides good identification performance by exploiting the generalized cross-correntropy function of STBC-OFDM signals under impulsive interference circumstances.}

	abstract = {Future wireless networks are expected to support diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications under dynamic network conditions through effective resource allocation. However, the growing complexity of underlying optimization problems for resource allocation has brought many challenges to traditional centralized network operations due to inherent computational constraints. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed-Optimization with Centralized-Refining (DO-CR) mechanism to achieve more efficient resource allocation by engaging both access point and all devices. Specifically, the new DO-CR mechanism first utilizes the distributed processing capacity of all devices, allowing them to optimize their own resource allocation schemes through a new resource reservation and reporting technique. Then a centralized optimizer generates a graph of resource trading topology based on individual optimization results and achieves the Pareto optimal solution by the graph-based algorithm. This Pareto optimal solution simplifies the overall optimization problem and enables the central optimizer to solve it with smaller feasible regions. The analysis presents that the DO-CR mechanism’s performance is bounded by Pareto optimality as lower limit and global optimality as upper limit. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DO-CR mechanism significantly reduces processing time on the centralized optimizer while maintaining near-optimal utility performance compared to conventional optimization methods.}

The study reveals that when the noise p.s.d. is a strictly positive computable continuous function, computing the capacity of the band-limited ACGN channel becomes a \\#\\mathrm {P}_{1} -complete problem within the set of polynomial time computable noise p.s.d.s, meaning that it is even more complex than problems that are NP1-complete. Additionally, it is shown that computing the capacity-achieving distribution is also \\#\\mathrm {P}_{1} -complete. Furthermore, under the widely accepted assumption that \\mathrm {FP}_{1} \\neq \\#\\mathrm {P}_{1} , this has two significant implications for the ACGN channel. The first implication is the existence of a polynomial time computable noise p.s.d. for which the computation of the corresponding ACGN capacity cannot be performed in polynomial time, i.e., the number of computational steps on a Turing machine grows faster than all polynomials. The second is the existence of a polynomial time computable noise p.s.d. for which determining the corresponding ACGN’s capacity-achieving p.s.d. cannot be done within polynomial time. This implies that either the sequence of achievable rates with guaranteed distance to capacity is not polynomial time computable, or the corresponding blocklength sequence is not polynomial time computable.}

The setting consists of a server connected to a set of users, assisted by a smaller number of helper nodes that are equipped with their own storage. In addition to the helper caches, each user possesses a dedicated cache which is also used to prefetch file contents. Each helper cache can serve an arbitrary number of users, but each user gets served by only one helper cache. We consider two scenarios: (a) the server has no prior information about the user-to-helper cache association, and (b) the server knows the user-to-helper cache association at the placement phase itself. We design centralized coded caching schemes under uncoded placement for the above two settings. For case (b), we propose four schemes, and establish the optimality of certain schemes in specific memory regimes by deriving matching lower bounds. The fourth scheme, called as the composite scheme, appropriately partitions the file library and the cache memories between two other schemes in case (b) to minimize the rate by leveraging the advantages of both.}

Conducting channel measurements for 6G communications is highly expensive and cannot cover all scenarios and frequency bands. Moreover, existing conventional channel models fail to accurately predict channel characteristics in unknown frequency band. As a result, predictive channel modeling has emerged as a promising solution for addressing these challenges in 6G channel modeling. In this study, we propose a frequency domain predictive channel model that combines an autoencoder with a coupling Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (Conv-GRU) cells. The proposed model aims to predict channel characteristics in unknown frequency bands. The proposed predictive channel model is validated by using data collected from multiple frequency bands channel measurements. To evaluate its performance, several commonly used prediction networks, i.e., a general LSTM network, a GRU-based predictive network, and a Conv-LSTM-based predictive network, are conducted as benchmarks for comparison. Based on evaluation results, our proposed predictive channel model achieves the highest level of accuracy in predicting channels. Additionally, we provide a performance bound for extrapolation predictability using a Ray Tracing simulator.}

However, these methods require the workers to transmit real-valued vectors during the process of learning, which induces very high communication burden. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel DL method based on 1-bit gradient coding (1-bit GC-DL), where 1-bit data encoded from the locally computed gradients are transmitted by the workers to reduce the communication overhead. We theoretically provide the convergence guarantees of the proposed method for both the convex loss functions and non-convex loss functions. It is shown empirically that 1-bit GC-DL outperforms the baseline methods, which attains better learning performance under the same communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has shown promise in enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, many studies indicate that better feedback performance often accompanies higher computational complexity. Pursuing better performance-complexity tradeoffs is crucial to facilitate practical deployment, especially on computation-limited devices, which may have to use lightweight autoencoder with unfavorable performance. To achieve this goal, this paper introduces knowledge distillation (KD) to achieve better tradeoffs, where knowledge from a complicated teacher autoencoder is transferred to a lightweight student autoencoder for performance improvement. Specifically, two methods are proposed for implementation. Firstly, an autoencoder KD-based method is introduced by training a student autoencoder to mimic the reconstructed CSI of a pretrained teacher autoencoder. Secondly, an encoder KD-based method is proposed to reduce training overhead by performing KD only on the student encoder. Additionally, a variant of encoder KD is introduced to protect user equipment and base station vendor intellectual property. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly improve the student autoencoder’s performance, while reducing the number of floating point operations and inference time to 3.05%–5.28% and 13.80%–14.76% of the teacher network, respectively. Furthermore, the variant encoder KD method effectively enhances the student autoencoder’s generalization capability across different scenarios, environments, and bandwidths.}

	abstract = {Distributed multi-task learning (MTL) is a learning paradigm where distributed users simultaneously learn multiple tasks by leveraging the correlations among tasks. However, distributed MTL suffers from a more severe communication bottleneck than single-task learning as more than one models need to be transmitted in the communication phase. To address this issue, we investigate the hierarchical MTL system where distributed users wish to jointly learn different learning models orchestrated by a central server with the help of multiple relays. We propose a coded distributed computing scheme for hierarchical MTL systems that jointly exploits the network topology and relays’ computing capability to create coded multicast opportunities to improve communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the communication loads both in the uplink and downlink transmissions between relays and the server. To further illustrate the optimality of the proposed scheme, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the minimum uplink and downlink communication loads and prove that the gaps between achievable upper bounds and lower bounds are within the minimum number of connected users among all relays. In particular, when the network topology can be delicately designed, the proposed scheme can achieve the information-theoretic optimal communication loads. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed scheme can greatly reduce the overall training time compared to the conventional hierarchical MTL scheme.}

	abstract = {The problem of coordinated data collection is studied for a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) system. A mobile crowdsensing platform (MCSP) sequentially publishes sensing tasks to the available mobile units (MUs) that signal their willingness to participate in a task by sending sensing offers back to the MCSP. From the received offers, the MCSP decides the task assignment. A stable task assignment must address two challenges: the MCSP’s and MUs’ conflicting goals, and the uncertainty about the MUs’ required efforts and preferences. To overcome these challenges a novel decentralized approach combining matching theory and online learning, called collision-avoidance multi-armed bandit with strategic free sensing (CA-MAB-SFS), is proposed. The task assignment problem is modeled as a matching game considering the MCSP’s and MUs’ individual goals while the MUs learn their efforts online. Our innovative “free-sensing” mechanism significantly improves the MU’s learning process while reducing collisions during task allocation. The stable regret of CA-MAB-SFS, i.e., the loss of learning, is analytically shown to be bounded by a sublinear function, ensuring the convergence to a stable optimal solution. Simulation results show that CA-MAB-SFS increases the MUs’ and the MCSP’s satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the average task completion time by at least 16%.}

	abstract = {A precise incident wave angle estimation in aerial communication is a key enabler in sixth-generation wireless communication network. With this goal, a generic 3-dimensional (3D) channel model is analyzed for air-to-air (A2A) networks under antenna misalignment, radio frequency impairments and polarization loss. The unique aspects of each aerial node are highlighted and the few-shot learning as a model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) classifier is proposed for learning-to-learn (L2L) incident wave angle estimation by utilizing the received signal strength (RSS). Additionally, a more computationally efficient technique, first order model agnostic meta-learning (FOMAML) is implemented. It has been observed that the proposed approach reaches up to 85% training accuracy and 75.4% evaluation accuracy with MAML. Regarding this, a convergence rate and accuracy trade-off have been established for several cases of MAML and FOMAML. For different L2L models trained with limited data, heuristic accuracy performance is determined by an upper bound of the probability of confidence.}

	abstract = {Visible light positioning (VLP) is an accurate and low-cost positioning technique. However, existing VLP algorithms require multiple luminaires or multiple sensors to achieve the desired positioning accuracy, which may not be satisfied in practice. To circumvent this challenge, a novel visual odometry (VO) assisted VLP algorithm (VO-VLP) is proposed, which can achieve accurate positioning using only a single luminaire at the transmitter and a single camera at the receiver. In the considered model, the luminaires are equipped on the ceiling and consistently broadcast coordinate information of the luminaires by visible light communication (VLC). A user equipped with a camera captures photos of the ceiling so as to locate its position via VO-VLP. In particular, VO-VLP first uses the single luminaire’s circle feature and VLC information to obtain the pose and location of the user. However, there are dual solutions due to the limited received information in the single-luminaire scenario and the symmetry of the circular luminaire. Then, we propose a duality elimination method to eliminate the wrong one by introducing VO to exploit the visual features on the ceiling in two consecutive images, which are captured when the user moves. To verify the feasibility of our designed VO-VLP, a prototype is implemented. A cooperative multi-information image processing method is proposed for the prototype to ensure that the VLC information and the visual information of the luminaire and the ceiling can be simultaneously received for real-time positioning. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove that VO-VLP can achieve accurate positioning with only a single luminaire and a camera without any extra sensors, such as an inertial measurement unit. In particular, simulation results show that the proposed indoor positioning algorithm can achieve a 97% positioning accuracy of around 10 cm, and experimental results show that the average positioning accuracy is less than 10 cm.}

The parity bits produced by the AT are transmitted with the pilot tone by remapping. In addition, a soft decision for this 4D-PS signal is proposed. An experiment of self-homodyne coherent ultra-high order 4D signal transmission based on two cores of a 7-core fiber is demonstrated with a spectral efficiency of 16.37 bit/s/Hz.

To address this issue, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided uplink communication scenario, generating multiple measurements through RIS phase adjustment. This study successfully realizes 3D single-frequency imaging by exploiting the near-field multi-view image correlations deduced from user mobility. We first highlight the significance of considering anisotropy in multi-view image formation by investigating radar cross-section properties and diffraction resolution limits. We then propose a novel model for joint multi-view 3D imaging that incorporates occlusion effects and anisotropic scattering. These factors lead to slow image support variation and smooth coefficient evolution, which are mathematically modeled as Markov processes. Based on this model, we employ the Expectation Maximization-Turbo-Generalized Approximate Message Passing algorithm for joint multi-view single-frequency 3D imaging with limited measurements. Simulation results reveal the superiority of joint multi-view imaging in terms of enhanced imaging ranges, accuracies, and anisotropy characterization compared to single-view imaging. Combining adjacent observations for joint multi-view imaging enables a reduction in the measurement overhead by 80%.}

	abstract = {Coded caching is an effective technique to reduce the data transmission load by exploiting the cache contents across the network. However, most coded caching schemes are designed for static networks that consist of only a placement phase and a delivery phase. In practice, a network maybe dynamic with multiple rounds of placement and delivery phases, and the number of users within the network may vary. In these dynamic networks, a conventional coded caching scheme may lead to the undesired updates at the existing users’ cache contents. This paper proposes a centralized coded caching scheme for dynamic networks that can support multiple rounds with newly joining users. It prevents cache contents of the existing users from being updated, extending the service duration of cache devices. Further recognizing the need of information security in coded caching, the considered dynamic networks are featured by two constraints: 1) the library files must be kept secure from a wiretapper who has access to the shared link; 2) any subset of users cannot obtain information from the demands of other users. This consideration leads to another dynamic coded caching scheme that ensures information security. It is shown that the proposed schemes can yield a small subpacketization level and achieve a good rate-memory tradeoff.}

	abstract = {Coded computing has received significant attention thanks to its advantage in alleviating the straggler effect in distributed computation framework, which would be one of the key fundamental techniques to enable the distributed and decentralized network architectures towards 5G-advanced and 6G era. Specifically, considering the scenario that multiple tasks randomly arrive at the network, the additional task queuing makes the delay analysis of coded computing more challenging. In this paper, we consider the impacts of task queuing and characterize the end-to-end delay for coded computing systems under the multi-task scenario. To this end, we first model the end-to-end coded computing system. Then, based on the redundant task processing strategies, we consider both purging and non-purging coded computing schemes. Although the expected end-to-end delay for both schemes are intractable, we obtain closed-form expressions for their respective lower and upper bounds, which generalizes the delay results of the single-task scenario. Moreover, we show that the multi-task coded computing has a coding gain of \\Theta (\\log n) where n denotes the number of worker nodes, even with task queues considered. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the derived delay bounds and show the effectiveness of coded computing in the multi-task scenario.}

However, the OAM beam is not suitable for the long distance transmission due to its inverted cone shape. Moreover, the commonly used uniform circular array (UCA) communication system with fixed radius can only obtain limited channel capacity. In order to obtain higher channel capacity, this paper proposes an optimized transmission system combining UCA and non-twisted parabolic antenna (PA). The optimization of UCA deployment radius enables the combined system to obtain the maximum channel capacity for the transmission at a specific distance. Compared with the traditional OAM system and the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, the channel capacity can be increased nearly up to two and four times respectively without increasing the bit error rate (BER) and complexity significantly.}

	abstract = {To alleviate the time overhead of the handover and beam reselection caused by user mobility, a velocity-based association policy has been adopted in heterogeneous networks. However, it might introduce severe interference from cross-tier interfering base stations which are closer to the users than the serving one. To deal with this problem, we propose two cross-tier interference coordination (CTIC) schemes for mobile users in heterogeneous networks: one jointly considers the transmit power and path loss (TPL-CTIC), and the other further incorporates the directional antenna gain (TPG-CTIC). Considering the beam misalignment and the time overhead caused by user mobility, we derive the overall coverage probability and the average effective Shannon rate (ESR) of mobile users to characterize the user-perceived performance. Taking the cost of the proposed CTIC schemes into account, we further derive the average normalized throughput to evaluate the overall network performance. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the case without CTIC, the proposed schemes significantly improve the overall coverage probability in the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio regime and the average ESR. To capture the expense of proposed schemes, we define the average normalized throughput. Although TPL-CTIC performs better in terms of the overall coverage probability and the average ESR, TPG-CTIC outperforms in terms of the average normalized throughput.}

In this paper, we investigate the ergodic spectral efficiency of IOS-aided systems for transmission over random channel links, while considering both realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI) and transceiver hardware impairments (HWIs). Firstly, we formulate the linear minimum mean square error estimator of the equivalent channel spanning from the user equipments (UEs) to the access point (AP), where the transceiver HWIs are also considered. Then, we apply a two-timescale protocol for designing the beamformer of the IOS-aided system. Specifically, for the active AP beamformer, the minimum mean square error combining method is employed, which relies on the estimated equivalent channels, on the statistical information of the channel estimation error, on the inter-user interference as well as on the HWIs at the AP and UEs. By contrast, the passive IOS beamformer is designed based on the statistical CSI for maximizing the upper bound of the ergodic spectral efficiency. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the transceiver HWIs have a significant effect on the ergodic spectral efficiency, especially in the high transmit power region. Furthermore, we show that the HWIs at the AP can be effectively compensated by deploying more AP antennas.}

Due to high molecular absorption, THz signals experience severe path loss over long distance. To alleviate distance limitation, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the coverage range. Adaptive sub-band bandwidth (ASB) allocation can mitigate absorption attenuation by allocating THz sub-bands with variable bandwidth to the users. However, in ASB allocation, since the bandwidth of sub-bands may not be known a priori, accurate channel estimation is challenging. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a metapath-based heterogeneous graph-transformer network (MHGphormer) to bypass the channel estimation phase. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints in a RIS-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) THz system to optimize the precoding, phase shifts, and ASB allocation. The proposed MHGphormer parameterizes the mapping from input (e.g., location information, users’ minimum data rate) to the optimized system parameters via unsupervised learning. The proposed MHGphormer has the permutation invariance/equivariance property. It can be applied to systems with different number of users. Simulation results show that our proposed MHGphormer achieves a higher system sum-rate when compared with the homogeneous graph neural network, unsupervised deep neural network, and alternating optimization baseline algorithms.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), composed of nearly passive elements, is regarded as one of the potential paradigms to support multi-gigabit data in real-time. However, in traditional CSI (channel state information) driven frame, the training overhead of channel estimation greatly increases as the number of RIS elements increases to intelligently manipulate the reflected signals. To conveniently use the reflected signal without complex CSI feedback, in this paper we propose a position-aided phase configuration scheme based on the property of Fresnel zone. In particular, we design the impedance based discrete RIS elements with joint absorption mode and reflection mode considering the fabrication complexities, which integrated the property of the Fresnel zone to resist the impact of position error. Then, with joint absorption and 1-bit reflection mode elements, we develop the two-step position-aided ON/OFF states judgement (TPOSJ) scheme and the frame structure to control the ON/OFF state of RIS, followed by analyzing the impacts of mobility and position error on our proposed scheme. Also, we derive the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem based power flow. Simulations show that the proposed scheme can manipulate the ON/OFF state intelligently without complex CSI, thus verifying the practical application of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper considers networked device-free sensing in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular system with multipath environment, where the passive targets reflect the downlink signals to the base stations (BSs) via non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths and/or line-of-sight (LOS) paths, and the BSs share the sensing information extracted from their received echoes to jointly localize the targets. A two-phase localization protocol is considered. In Phase I, we design an efficient method that is able to accurately estimate the range of any path from a transmitting BS to a receiving BS via a target, even if the transmitting and receiving BSs are separated and not perfectly synchronized. In Phase II, we propose an effective method that is able to jointly identify the ranges of the LOS paths between the targets and the BSs as well as associate the ranges of LOS paths with the right targets, such that the number and the locations of the targets both can be accurately estimated. Numerical results verify that our proposed two-phase protocol can achieve high performance of networked sensing in the multipath environment.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided green multiple-user downlink communication system. In contrast to the existing works that deploy the IRS in a fixed location, the location of the IRS is taken as an optimization variable to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the location of the IRS, transmit beamformers at the base station (BS), and IRS phase shifts. We point out a critical conclusion that before and after IRS deployment, the channel state information (CSI) of all the communication terminals is different, so an offline-online hybrid-CSI optimization framework is proposed to solve the problem. In the offline stage, we optimize the IRS location with only the statistical CSI (S-CSI) so the ergodic quality of service (QoS) constraints have to be considered, and universal lower bounds associated only with the location variable are derived to decouple all variables. In the online stage, all the instantaneous-CSI (I-CSI) are available. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating optimization framework is developed. We propose a Riemannian Manifold (RM) algorithm to optimize the IRS phase shifts. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm is convergent and effective, and show that the location deployment of IRS is crucial for green communication.}

	abstract = {Matrix-variate optimization plays a central role in advanced wireless system designs. In this paper, we aim to explore optimal solutions of matrix variables under two special structure constraints using complex matrix derivatives, including diagonal structure constraints and constant modulus constraints, both of which are closely related to the state-of-the-art wireless applications. Specifically, for diagonal structure constraints mostly considered in the uplink multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system and the amplitude-adjustable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, the capacity maximization problem, the mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem and their variants are rigorously investigated. By leveraging complex matrix derivatives, the optimal solutions of these problems are directly obtained in closed forms. Nevertheless, for constant modulus constraints with the intrinsic nature of element-wise decomposability, which are often seen in the hybrid analog-digital MIMO system and the fully-passive IRS-aided MIMO system, we firstly explore inherent structures of the element-wise phase derivatives associated with different optimization problems. Then, we propose a novel alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with the aid of several arbitrary feasible solutions, which avoids the complicated matrix inversion and matrix factorization involved in conventional element-wise iterative algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the computational complexity without loss of system performance.}

This paper studies the joint design of protograph low-density parity-check (PLDPC) codes and shaping index modulation (IM) in OAM systems. To begin with, we analyze the distribution of extrinsic log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) for coded bits output from channel detector, and then propose a customized Box-Cox transformation (CBCT) to make the distribution achieve symmetry and Gaussian features. We also devise a CBCT-based protograph extrinsic information transfer (CBCT-PEXIT) algorithm to predict the convergence performance of PLDPC-coded OAM systems. Furthermore, with the aid of such an algorithm, we construct two new types of improved PLDPC codes tailored for OAM systems, including unpunctured codes and rate-compatible punctured codes. In addition, we present a two-step design method, which seamlessly combines the shaping technique and index rule into a novel modulation scheme, called shaping index. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLDPC-coded OAM systems with shaping index significantly outperform state-of-the-art counterparts.}

The design of the UAV flight path plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness of UAV communication systems. However, the air-to-ground links with a high probability of LoS introduce a heightened risk of eavesdropping, posing a significant security challenge. In this work, we investigate the problem of ensuring secure data acquisition for quadrotor UAV-based communication systems in the presence of multiple location-uncertain terrestrial eavesdroppers. The bandwidth allocation and the three-dimensional trajectory of the UAV are jointly designed to maximize the system’s overall fair secrecy rate. This design also considers the UAV’s energy consumption during flight and aims to ensure fairness among users. Solving this problem poses a challenge since it is a non-convex and involves multiple variables, making it difficult to address using conventional optimization methods. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the security of aerial Internet of Things systems.}

This paper proposes rate maximization techniques for both single-user and multiuser MIMO systems, based on the well-known weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) criterion. Using a suitable weight matrix, the WMMSE algorithm tackles an equivalent weighted mean square error (WMSE) minimization problem to achieve the sum-rate maximization. By considering a more practical RIS system model that employs a tensor-based representation enforced by the electromagnetic behavior exhibited by the RIS panel, we detail both the sum-rate maximizing and WMSE minimizing strategies for RIS phase shift optimization by deriving the closed-form gradient of the sum-rate and the WMSE with respect to the RIS phase shift vector. Our simulations reveal that the proposed rate maximization technique, rooted in the WMMSE algorithm, exhibits superior performance when compared to other benchmarks.}

In such a system, an uplink (UL) power optimization must be performed to increase the system’s spectral and power efficiencies (SE and PE). In this work, we develop a set of multi-objective UL power optimization models and algorithms based on the differential evolution (DE) meta-heuristic (MH) considering the optimal sequential linear processing (OSLP) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection schemes. The bi-objective approaches aim at deriving nondominated solutions in models to: 1) maximize the max-min fairness (MMF) and max-sum rate (MSR) metrics; 2) maximize the MMF and minimize transmission power (MTP); 3) maximize the MSR and minimize the MTP. A tri-objective approach is also developed to maximize the MMF and MSR and minimize the MTP. Solutions displaying interesting trade-offs are obtained with the proposed models and algorithmic approaches, compared with the case where the UEs employ full power in the UL. Results show that improved SE and PE can be attained with the proposed bi-objective and tri-objective optimization approaches.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) constitute a promising technique of supporting energy-efficient communications. In this paper, we formulate the energy efficiency maximization problem of the switch-controlled RHS-aided beamforming architecture by alternately optimizing the holographic beamformer at the RHS, the digital beamformer, the total transmit power and the power sharing ratio of each user. Specifically, to deal with this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we decouple it into three sub-problems. Firstly, the coefficients of RHS elements responsible for the holographic beamformer are optimized to maximize the sum of the eigen-channel gains of all users by our proposed low-complexity eigen-decomposition (ED) method. Then, the digital beamformer is designed by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to support multi-user information transfer. Finally, the total transmit power and the power sharing ratio are alternately optimized, while considering the effect of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI). We theoretically derive the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency performance upper bound for the RHS-based beamforming architectures in the presence of HWIs. Our simulation results show that the switch-controlled RHS-aided beamforming architecture achieves higher energy efficiency than the conventional fully digital beamformer and the hybrid beamformer based on phase shift arrays (PSA). Moreover, considering the effect of HWI in the beamforming design can bring about further energy efficiency enhancements.}

	abstract = {Product codes (PCs) are typically decoded using iterative bounded distance decoding (iBDD) to ensure a low decoding complexity. To obtain further performance gain, a soft-aided decoding algorithm, termed the iBDD with scaled reliability (iBDD-SR), was proposed for PCs. In this paper, we propose an enhanced iBDD-SR by introducing threshold and memory when passing messages between the component decoders. The resulting algorithm is referred to as the threshold-based binary message passing (TB-BMP) with memory. In the proposed decoding algorithm, the soft reliability of the BDD output at the current half-iteration is a weighted sum of the BDD output, the channel reliability, and the content of the memory unit, where the content of the memory unit at the current half-iteration is related to the selected threshold and the BDD output at last half-iteration. Due to the existence of memory, the Bayesian network is used to model the decoding process of the TB-BMP. Based on the Bayesian network, we derive the density evolution (DE) equations for the TB-BMP under the constraint of extrinsic message passing (EMP). The analytical results of the DE analysis can be used to guide the selection of the parameters of the TB-BMP decoder. Extensive simulation results show that the TB-BMP decoder outperforms the iBDD-SR over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (Bi-AWGN) channels. In particular, for a PC based on a two-error-correcting extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code of length 256, the TB-BMP decoder performs about 0.28 dB better than the iBDD-SR at a bit error rate (BER) of 10−7.}

	abstract = {Binary array codes are widely used in storage systems to prevent data loss, such as the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). Most designs for such codes, such as Blaum-Roth (BR) codes and Independent-Parity (IP) codes, are carried out on the polynomial ring \\mathbb {F}_{2}[x]/\\langle \\sum _{i=0}^{p-1}x^{i} \\rangle , where \\mathbb {F}_{2} is a binary field, and p is a prime number. In this paper, we consider the polynomial ring \\mathbb {F}_{2}[x]/\\langle \\sum _{i=0}^{p-1}x^{i\\tau }\\rangle , where p > 1 is an odd number and \\tau \\geq 1 is any power of two, and explore variant codes from codes over this polynomial ring. Particularly, the variant codes are derived by mapping parity-check matrices over the polynomial ring to binary parity-check matrices. Specifically, we first propose two classes of variant codes, termed V-ETBR and V-ESIP codes. To make these variant codes binary maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes that achieve optimal storage efficiency, this paper then derives the connections between them and their counterparts over polynomial rings. These connections are general, making it easy to construct variant MDS array codes from various forms of matrices over polynomial rings. Subsequently, some instances are explicitly constructed based on Cauchy and Vandermonde matrices. In the proposed constructions, both V-ETBR and V-ESIP MDS array codes can have any number of parity columns and have the total number of data columns of exponential order with respect to p . In contrast, previous binary MDS array codes only have a total number of data columns of linear order with respect to p . This makes the codes proposed in this paper more suitable for application to large-scale storage systems. In terms of computation, two fast syndrome computations are proposed for the Vandermonde-based V-ETBR and V-ESIP MDS array codes, both meeting the lowest known asymptotic complexity among MDS codes. Due to the fact that all variant codes are constructed from parity-check matrices over simple binary fields instead of polynomial rings, they are attractive in practice.}

In this paper, we study the polarization characteristics of RS polar codes and propose two types of partial orders (POs) for the synthesized channels, which are supported by validity proofs. By combining these partial orders, a Partial Distance-based Polarization Weight (PDPW) construction method is presented. The proposed method achieves comparable performance to Monte-Carlo simulations while requiring lower complexity. Additionally, a Minimum Polarization Weight Puncturing (MPWP) scheme for rate-matching is proposed to enhance its practical applicability in communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the RS polar codes based on the proposed PDPW construction outperform the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) NR polar codes in terms of standard code performance and rate-matching performance.}

An (n,k,m) piggybacking code contains k data nodes and r=n-k parity nodes, each node stores m symbols. In this paper, we propose a new piggybacking design by jointly designing piggyback functions for both data node repair and parity node repair to reduce the repair bandwidth. Our piggybacking codes can support flexible sub-packetization m with 2\\leq m\\leq r . When m=r , we derive a new lower bound of repair bandwidth based on our piggybacking structure and show that this lower bound is lower than the corresponding lower bounds derived from the existing piggybacking codes for 5 < r\\ll k . When m < r , we show that our piggybacking codes have lower repair bandwidth than the existing piggybacking codes for all the evaluated high-code-rate parameters with 10\\leq r\\leq 20 , k=100 and m\\leq 5 . Moreover, we derive the lower bound of repair complexity defined as the number of multiplication operations required in repairing single-node erasure under general piggybacking framework and show that our codes can achieve the repair complexity lower bound, i.e., our codes have optimal repair complexity.}

However, these 5G LDPC codes are not optimized for the scenarios of Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) in which small transport block sizes are usually used. In this paper, a new method is proposed to construct PBRL LDPC codes for URLLC and mMTC. This method incorporates degree-distribution optimization, base matrix derived from parity-check matrix of quadratic residue codes, masking technique and modified progressive-edge-growth (PEG) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed PBRL LDPC codes outperform 5G LDPC short codes in terms of error-correcting performance.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has attracted significant attention as a viable paradigm for energy efficient communication in the next generation of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Channel estimation, a vital task in AmBC receiver design, becomes more challenging when accounting for more practical scenarios such as frequency selective fading and the presence of hardware impairments such as I/Q imbalance. Full-duplex communication further complicates channel estimation, due to the presence of self-interference. In this work, we consider OFDM-based full-duplex AmBC systems affected by I/Q imbalance, and propose two methods for the joint estimation of the channel and I/Q imbalance. The first algorithm is a pilot-based estimator, while the second is a semi-blind estimator based on the concept of decision-directed (DD) estimation. In addition, we propose a novel design of appropriate pilot sequences to optimize the performance of the proposed methods. As benchmarks on estimation performance, we obtain analytical expressions for the pilot-based and semi-blind Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs). Our simulations demonstrate that both proposed estimators converge to their respective bounds. The proposed methods offer different tradeoffs between accuracy and computational complexity, which are suitable for different use cases.}

	abstract = {Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs by taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the system design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes novel linear precoding algorithms for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (MIMO-BICM) systems that maximize the achievable rate subject to power constraints. To overcome the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the optimization problem, we rewrite the achievable rate in terms of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) and introduce manifold-based gradient ascent (MGA) precoding and low-complexity non-iterative algorithms. Simulation results show significant gains in achievable rate and block error rate compared to existing techniques. Additionally, we extend our investigation to linear precoding with the constraint that the precoding matrix is selected from the codebook type-I adopted in Fifth-Generation New Radio (5G NR) networks. We propose heuristic algorithms that exploit the Kronecker and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) structure of the codebook and consider the singular vector decomposition (SVD) precoder as the optimal reference precoder. The traditional exhaustive search methods require a high complexity, especially for large codebook sizes. However, our proposed algorithms apply a combination of direct estimation and a low-dimensional search for deriving the indices, resulting in a reduced number of codebook precoder candidates. Simulation results show that our proposed low-complexity algorithms perform comparably to exhaustive search baselines.}

	abstract = {The deployment of aerial base stations (ABSs) on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents a promising solution for extending cellular connectivity to areas where terrestrial infrastructure is overloaded, damaged, or absent. A pivotal challenge in this domain is to decide the locations of a set of ABSs to effectively serve ground-based users. Most existing approaches oversimplify this problem by assuming that the channel gain between two points is a function of solely distance and, sometimes, also the elevation angle. In turn, this paper leverages propagation radio maps to account for arbitrary air-to-ground channel gains. This methodology enables the identification of an approximately minimal set of locations where ABSs need to be deployed to ensure that all ground terminals achieve a target service rate, while adhering to backhaul capacity limitations and avoiding designated no-fly zones. Relying on a convex relaxation technique and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), this paper puts forth a solver whose computational complexity scales linearly with the number of ground terminals. Convergence is established analytically and an extensive set of simulations corroborate the merits of the proposed scheme relative to conventional methods.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has attracted attention as an enabling technology for green device-to-device (D2D) communication for the next generation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Most existing works assume that the signals of the source and the backscattering device (BD) are perfectly synchronized at the reader. Perfect synchronization is not feasible in practice, and the timing offset between the two signals can significantly degrade the performance of the reader’s receiver. In this work, we consider an asynchronous AmBC system and solve the problem of joint timing offset and channel estimation at the reader. Assuming generic Nyquist pulse-shaping filters, we develop a pilot-based maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, as well as a semi-blind estimator using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. For the special case of the rectangular pulse, we also derive the corresponding ML and EM estimators, and an approximate low-complexity EM (LCEM) algorithm. As theoretical benchmarks, we obtain the Cramer-Rao-bound (CRB) for pilot-based estimation, while for semi-blind estimation the modified CRB (MCRB) is obtained. The performance of the proposed algorithms is investigated using simulations, showing that both the ML and EM approach their corresponding CRBs, and that the EM-type algorithms provide superior estimation and detection accuracy, at the expense of higher complexity.}

	abstract = {Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is regarded as one of the most crucial technologies for the next-generation communications due to its ability to significantly improve spectral efficiency. However, larger antenna aperture and higher frequency make the Rayleigh distances dramatically increased, resulting in more and more communications taking place in the near-field region. Different from traditional far-field communications, near-field communications are widely considered to be spherical wavefront-based rather than planar wavefront based, thus techniques designed for far-field scenarios might be no longer applicable. In this paper, we study the near-field communication system with an extremely large cylindrical antenna array (CLA). Under such a setup, we study the near-field beamforming, exploiting the geometrical relationship between CLA and user with the spherical-wavefront model. Specifically, we analyze the beamforming gain in the elevation angle, azimuth angle domain and distance domains, respectively. We then study the beam focusing properties in near-field CLA systems, namely the asymptotic orthogonality and the depth of focused beams. Moreover, a three-dimensional (3-D) near-field CLA codebook is proposed to make beam focusing more effective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed near-field codebook can effectively focus the beam to a certain location and thus improve the system achievable rate.}

In the first part and under perfect CSI conditions, we propose a two-step low-complexity data detection algorithm that reduces the maximum likelihood (ML) search space. The key idea is based on constructing a list of constellation points exploiting the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function. We convert the original detection problem under binary observations into the classical integer least-squares optimization enabling direct use of efficient sphere-decoding algorithms. This method is then extended to the multi-bit case along with an assessment of the computational complexity. In the second part, we focus on a real channel model and assume only the availability of statistical CSIR. We formulate the optimal detection metric under a pilot training scheme and present the main challenges in its evaluation, then employ the Laplace method to retrieve an approximation in closed form. We demonstrate through numerical experiments near-optimality of our proposed solutions in terms of vector error rates with respect to oracle lower bounds on their corresponding ML metric. Finally, we also investigate the performance in practical spatially correlated massive MIMO channels.}

	abstract = {Aiming at providing wireless communication systems with environment-perceptive capacity, emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies face multiple difficulties, especially in balancing the performance trade-off between the communication and radar functions. In this paper, we introduce a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist both data transmission and target detection in a dual-functional ISAC system. To formulate a general optimization framework, diverse communication performance metrics have been taken into account including famous capacity maximization and mean-squared error (MSE) minimization. Whereas the target detection process is modeled as a general likelihood ratio test (GLRT) due to the practical limitations, and the monotonicity of the corresponding detection probability is proved. For the single-user and single-target (SUST) scenario, the minimum transmit power for sensing has been revealed. By exploiting the optimal conditions, we validate that the optimal BS satisfies the maximum power allocation criterion and derive the optimal BS precoder in a semi-closed form. Moreover, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based RIS design is proposed to address the non-convex radar constraint. For the sake of enhancing computational efficiency, a low-complexity RIS design is also developed based on the manifold optimization theory. Furthermore, the ISAC transceiver design for the multiple-users and multiple-targets (MUMT) scenario is also investigated, where a zero-forcing (ZF) radar receiver is adopted to cancel the interference signals from different targets. Then optimal BS precoder is derived under the maximum power allocation scheme, and the RIS phase shifts can be optimized by extending the proposed ADMM-based RIS design algorithm. Finally, the ISAC transceiver design with imperfect in-band full-duplex transceivers is also discussed and two radar receive beamformer designs have been proposed to mitigate the performance loss. Numerical simulation results verify the convergence and superior communication/sensing performance of our proposed transceiver designs.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has evolved into a promising approach to significantly improve both spectral and energy efficiencies of wireless communications. Different from the traditional fully-passive and fully-active RISs, a novel hybrid RIS composed of both active and passive reflecting elements has recently emerged, which can leverage their combined advantages to effectively mitigate the RIS-induced multiplicative path loss. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid active-passive RIS assisted wireless system from a rate-maximization perspective. Specifically, we firstly consider the multi-antenna multi-user system and aim to maximize the system weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing the transmit precoding matrices and the active-passive RIS reflection matrix. The optimal semi-closed-form solution to each subproblem is obtained by jointly exploring the activeness of constraints and leveraging the majorization-minimization (MM) technique. To gain more useful insights into the rate maximization, we also study the special single-antenna single-user scenario, in which it is revealed that both the optimal transmit beamsteering direction and the optimal phase shifts at the hybrid RIS are independent of actual reflection amplitudes of the hybrid RIS. Numerical results demonstrate the lower complexity and superior rate performance of our proposed algorithms as compared to the existing schemes adopting the fully-passive RIS. Moreover, it is revealed that the hybrid RIS can strike a flexible balance between the square-order beamforming gain of the fully-passive RIS and the power amplification gain of the fully-active RIS by adjusting the active/passive element allocation.}

Following this, we develop RLS and SGD based algorithms for tracking the scalar effective downlink channel at each UE, and derive their performance guarantees.

We provide closed-form expressions for uplink achievable data rates while accounting for the nonlinear behavior of the PA. We extensively examine power control strategies. Initially, we explore full power transmission and Channel Inversion. Then, we address the non-convex problem of maximizing both the sum rate (MSR) and the minimum rate (MMR) of users using the single condensation method (SCM) and successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. We propose iterative algorithms to optimize the ultimate geometric programming (GP) problem and find the optimal power control coefficients. Results confirm that the proposed nonlinearity-aware power control yields substantial enhancements in net throughput compared to conventional algorithms. This underscores the superiority of integrating the nonlinearity of PAs into the power allocation strategy. The proposed MSR algorithm not only enhances the sum throughput but also increases the minimum net throughput and Jain’s fairness index of net throughput.}

	abstract = {Automatic composite-modulation classification (ACMC) is deemed to be an essential and important cognitive mechanism adopted for the next generation intelligent telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C), cognitive aerospace communications, and space surveillance as it can automatically recognize the unknown composite-modulation (CM) scheme of the received signal. In this work, we introduce a novel ACMC method using the hybrid feature-vectors based on our proposed new cyclic-paw-print images extracted from the CM signals. In our proposed novel approach, according to the polyspectral analysis of the received CM signals, a received CM signal can be converted to a gray-scale image matrix, named cyclic-paw-print (CPP), which can be very robust against noise. Then, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are simultaneously applied to the obtained CPP matrix and the hybrid DCT/DWT feature-vector is further constructed thereby. Finally, the sequential minimal optimized support vector machine (SMO-SVM) is adopted as the classifier using such feature vectors. Our proposed new ACMC technique requires a lower computational complexity and leads to a higher recognition-accuracy than other existing ACMC methods according to Monte Carlo simulations and experiments using real CM signal data.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel blind iterative projections algorithm to address challenges associated with codebook-based beamforming in 5G and beyond systems. In contrast to existing methodologies, our proposed algorithm eliminates quantization noise and search space scanning latency. The blind nature of our approach capitalizes on information-bearing symbols, yielding performance close to theoretical expectations. In contrast to the prevalent iterative least squares (LS) algorithms in the literature, our proposal does not necessitate the constant modulus or finite alphabet constraints on the desired signal. This makes our algorithm more general and allows us to demonstrate its stability analytically and capability to perform singular value decomposition (SVD) of the received signal matrix. Our algorithm achieves SVD optimality with lower computational costs than conventional SVD methods. We present an analysis of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at each iteration, elucidating the impact of batch size and noise variance on the SNR gain at convergence. We apply our proposed algorithm to receive-side hybrid beamforming and show that it offers superior performance compared to various existing approaches documented in the literature.}

	abstract = {The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and marine communication networks has been emerging as a promising paradigm to cater for the growing maritime activities, e.g., marine environment monitoring and ocean resource exploration. The increasing growth of marine applications and services poses challenges for processing marine data, while the resources-limited UAVs cannot satisfy the requirements of computing-intensive and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider a marine edge computing scenario with a group of UAVs and ocean beacon stations (OBSs) and propose a multi-UAV aided multi-access edge computing for marine networks from the perspective of system-welfare and energy-efficient design. Specifically, we propose a multi-task multi-access offloading scheme in marine edge computing networks, in which multiple UAVs can process their workloads locally or offload their partial workloads to multiple OBSs for processing. We consider the total utilities for completing all tasks as the system welfare, and measure the difference between the system welfare and energy consumption as the system revenue. A joint optimization problem is formulated by optimizing the OBS selection, the offloading ratio and the transmission duration, with the objective of increasing the system revenue in marine edge computing networks. We exploit a vertical decomposition architecture to solve the formulated non-convex problem via decomposing it into three sub-problems. Regarding each sub-problem, we propose efficient algorithms to derive the optimal solutions. We finally conduct simulations to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve the best performance for improving the system revenue in comparison with several benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Satellite-ground integrated heterogeneous networks can relieve network congestion, release network resources and provide ubiquitous intelligence services for terrestrial users. Furthermore, digital twin technology can enable nearly-instant data mapping from the physical world to digital systems. The integration between satellite-ground integrated heterogeneous networks and digital twin alleviates the gap between data analyses and physical unities. However, the current challenges, such as the pricing policy, the stochastic task arrivals, the time-varying satellite locations, mutual channel interference, and resource scheduling mechanisms between the users and cloud servers, severely affect the improvement of quality of service. Hence, we establish a blockchain-aided Stackelberg game model for maximizing the pricing profits and network throughput in terms of minimizing privacy overhead, which is able to perform computation offloading, decrease channel interference, and improve privacy protection. Due to the long-term task queue in Stackelberg model, we propose a Lyapunov stability theory-based model-agnostic meta-learning aided multi-agent deep federated reinforcement learning framework to transfer the long-term task queue into the single time slot, and then optimize the central processing unit frequency, channel selection, task-offloading decision, block size, and cloud server price, which facilitate the integration of communication, computation, and block resources. Subsequently, several performance analyses show that the proposed learning framework can strengthen the privacy protection, approach the optimal time average function, and fulfill the long-term average queue size via lower computational complexity. Finally, our simulation results indicate that the proposed learning framework is superior to the existing baseline methods in terms of network throughput, channel interference, cloud server profits, and privacy overhead.}

However, the finite blocklength analysis for Rayleigh-product channels is not available in the literature. In this paper, we will characterize the mutual information density (MID) and perform the FBL analysis to reveal the impact of rank-deficiency in Rayleigh-product channels. To this end, we first set up a central limit theorem for the MID over Rayleigh-product MIMO channels in the asymptotic regime where the number of scatterers, number of antennas, and blocklength go to infinity at the same pace. Then, we utilize the CLT to obtain the upper and lower bounds for the packet error probability, whose approximations in the high and low signal to noise ratio regimes are then derived to illustrate the impact of rank-deficiency. One interesting observation is that rank-deficiency degrades the performance of MIMO systems with FBL and the fundamental limits of Rayleigh-product channels degenerate to those of the Rayleigh case when the number of scatterers approaches infinity.}

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for achieving the promised advantages of enhancing spectral and energy efficiencies in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proven effective in reducing the required signaling overhead for CSI feedback. In practical dual-polarized MIMO scenarios, channels in the vertical and horizontal polarization directions tend to exhibit high polarization correlation. To fully exploit the inherent propagation similarity within dual-polarized channels, we propose a disentangled representation neural network (NN) for CSI feedback, referred to as DiReNet. The proposed DiReNet disentangles dual-polarized CSI into three components: polarization-shared information, vertical polarization-specific information, and horizontal polarization-specific information. This disentanglement of dual-polarized CSI enables the minimization of information redundancy caused by the polarization correlation and improves the performance of CSI compression and recovery. Additionally, flexible quantization and network extension schemes are designed. Consequently, our method provides a pragmatic solution for CSI feedback to harness the physical MIMO polarization as a priori information. Our experimental results show that the performance of our proposed DiReNet surpasses that of existing DL-based networks, while also effectively reducing the number of network parameters by nearly one third.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the quality-of-service (QoS) constrained multi-group multicast beamforming design problem, where each multicast group is composed of a number of users requiring the same content. Due to the nonconvex QoS constraints, this problem is nonconvex and NP-hard. While existing optimization-based iterative algorithms can obtain a suboptimal solution, their iterative nature results in large computational complexity and delay. To facilitate real-time implementations, this paper proposes a deep learning-based approach, which consists of a beamforming structure assisted problem transformation and a customized neural network architecture named hierarchical permutation equivariance (HPE) transformer. The proposed HPE transformer is proved to be permutation equivariant with respect to the users within each multicast group, and also permutation equivariant with respect to different multicast groups. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HPE transformer outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based and deep learning-based approaches for multi-group multicast beamforming design in terms of the total transmit power, the constraint violation, and the computational time. In addition, the proposed HPE transformer achieves pretty good generalization performance on different numbers of users, different numbers of multicast groups, and different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio targets.}

	abstract = {The remote wireless control of industrial systems is one of the major use cases for 5G and beyond systems: in these cases, the massive amounts of sensory information that need to be shared over the wireless medium may overload even high-capacity connections. Consequently, solving the effective communication problem by optimizing the transmission strategy to discard irrelevant information can provide a significant advantage, but is often a very complex task. In this work, we consider a prototypal system in which an observer must communicate its sensory data to a robot controlling a task (e.g., a mobile robot in a factory). We then model it as a remote Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), considering the effect of adopting semantic and effective communication-oriented solutions on the overall system performance. We split the communication problem by considering an ensemble Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) encoding, and train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to dynamically adapt the quantization level, considering both the current state of the environment and the memory of past messages. We tested the proposed approach on the well-known CartPole reference control problem, obtaining a significant performance increase over traditional approaches.}

Furthermore, we suggest a method to fuse dissimilarity metrics such that both the time at which channels were measured as well as similarities in channel state information can be taken into consideration while learning a channel chart. By applying both classical and deep learning-based manifold learning to a dataset containing sub-6 GHz distributed massive MIMO channel measurements, we show that our metrics outperform previously proposed dissimilarity measures. The results indicate that the new metrics improve channel charting performance, even under non-line-of-sight conditions.}

	abstract = {Semantic communications have emerged as a new paradigm for improving communication efficiency by transmitting the semantic information of a source message that is most relevant to a desired task at the receiver. Most existing approaches typically utilize neural networks (NNs) to design end-to-end semantic communication systems, where NN-based semantic encoders output continuously distributed signals to be sent directly to the channel in an analog fashion. In this work, we propose a joint coding-modulation (JCM) framework for digital semantic communications by using variational autoencoder (VAE). Our approach learns the transition probability from source data to discrete constellation symbols, thereby avoiding the non-differentiability problem of digital modulation. Meanwhile, by jointly designing the coding and modulation process together, we can match the obtained modulation strategy with the operating channel condition. We also derive a matching loss function with information-theoretic meaning for end-to-end training. Experiments on image semantic communication validate the superiority of our proposed JCM framework over the state-of-the-art quantization-based digital semantic coding-modulation methods across a wide range of channel conditions, transmission rates, and modulation orders. Furthermore, its performance gap to analog semantic communication reduces as the modulation order increases while enjoying the hardware implementation convenience.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) based collaborative edge AI inference architecture is proposed. Specifically, geographically distributed devices capture real-time noise-corrupted sensory data samples and extract the noisy local feature vectors, which are then aggregated at each remote radio head (RRH) to suppress sensing noise. To realize efficient uplink feature aggregation, we allow each RRH receives local feature vectors from all devices over the same resource blocks simultaneously by leveraging an over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique. Thereafter, these aggregated feature vectors are quantized and transmitted to a central processor (CP) for further aggregation and downstream inference tasks. Our aim in this work is to maximize the inference accuracy via a surrogate accuracy metric called discriminant gain, which measures the discernibility of different classes in the feature space. The key challenges lie on simultaneously suppressing the coupled sensing noise, AirComp distortion caused by hostile wireless channels, and the quantization error resulting from the limited capacity of fronthaul links. To address these challenges, this work proposes a joint transmit precoding, receive beamforming, and quantization error control scheme to enhance the inference accuracy. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed optimization algorithm compared to various baselines.}

In this paper, we strive to understand the learning performance by taking baseband precoding as an example, for which the optimal precoding matrices of several problems such as sum rate maximization have mathematical structure. Toward this goal, we design a graph neural network (GNN) with edge-update mechanism, whose inductive bias matches to the precoding policy, and analyze its connection to the commonly used convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Noticing that the learning performance can be decomposed into approximation and estimation errors, which depend on the smoothness of a policy and the inductive bias of a DNN, we analyze in which system settings the precoding policy is harder to be approximated by a DNN and how the inductive biases introduced by parameter sharing affect estimation errors. We proceed to derive the estimation error bounds of the DNNs. Simulations validate our analyses and verify the gain of GNN over CNNs in terms of reducing sample complexity.}

As IoT devices (users) are close to each other, their available channel sets, though they might be different, are similar. Using the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique in data mining, we propose channel hopping algorithms that exploit the similarity between the two available channel sets to increase the rendezvous probability. For the synchronous setting, our algorithms have the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) inversely proportional to a well-known similarity measure called the Jaccard index. For the asynchronous setting, we use dimensionality reduction to speed up the rendezvous process. Furthermore, we combine our LSH approach with the Asynchronous Channel Hopping sequence with Maximum rendezvous diversity (MACH) to ensure an upper bound of maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR). Our numerical results show that our algorithms can outperform the random algorithm in terms of ETTR.}

In this work, we consider that residential users over a geographical area are to be provided with network services, constrained by the available network resources. We explore the implementation of hybrid FiWi access network that integrates a fiber-based passive optical network (PON) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless access network to provide efficient network services. This paper proposes a methodology for topology optimization of FiWi access networks, considering the usage of three-dimensional (3D) beamforming and 3D resource grid for downlink transmission from the gNB to the users in 5G scenario. We derive the beam codebook and generate multiple beams to simultaneously serve the spatially separated users. We derive the closed-form expression for millimeter-wave channel model incorporating large-scale and small-scale parameters to compute the effective SINR of users. Further, we propose an optimization framework for optimal resource allocation (i.e., beam and resource block) by utilizing the 3D resource grid for downlink transmission. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for various 3GPP 5G outdoor propagation scenarios, viz., RMa, UMa, and UMi-street canyon.}

	abstract = {We propose a non-redundant pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-coupled unipolar orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (PU-OFDM) optical wireless communication (OWC) system, robust against light-emitting diode (LED) nonlinearity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the inherent null signals in U-OFDM blocks to reduce signal distortion caused by LED nonlinearity. A large-amplitude signal is mapped into a PAM-dependent signal that consists of a PAM signal, an exceeding margin and a polarity margin. The PAM signal that represents a large part of the original large-amplitude signal replaces the null signal in the adjacent block. At the receiver, the PAM signal and the PAM-dependent signal are combined to recover the amplitude of the original signal, and the polarity margin is used to recognize the polarity of the original signal. The proposed PU-OFDM system is spectrally efficient, requiring no side information for signal detection. In order to map the large-amplitude signals into small-amplitude signals, we design three PU-OFDM signal schemes: 1) PAM mapping (PM) for low complexity; 2) enhanced PAM mapping (ePM), enhancing BER performance via time diversity for relative large LED linear range; 3) accumulated PAM mapping (aPM), with strong signal compression ability for severe LED nonlinearity. Simulation results verify the proposed system and schemes.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has received a lot of interest because of its capacity to reconfigure the wireless communication environment in a cost- and energy-efficient way. However, the realistic power consumption modeling and measurement validation of RIS has received far too little attention. Therefore, in this work, we model the power consumption of RIS and conduct measurement validations using various RISs to fill this vacancy. Firstly, we propose a practical power consumption model of RIS. The RIS hardware is divided into three basic parts: the FPGA control board, the drive circuits, and the RIS unit cells. The power consumption of the first two parts is modeled as P_{\\text {static}} and that of the last part is modeled as P_{\\text {units}} . Expressions of P_{\\text {static}} and P_{\\text {units}} vary amongst different types of RISs. Secondly, we conduct measurements on various RISs to validate the proposed model. Five different RISs including the PIN diode, varactor diode, and RF switch types are measured, and measurement results validate the generality and applicability of the proposed power consumption model of RIS. Finally, we summarize the measurement results and discuss the approaches to achieve the low-power-consumption design of RIS-assisted wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique to improve the performance of future wireless communication systems at low energy consumption. To reap the potential benefits of RIS-aided beamforming, it is vital to enhance the accuracy of channel estimation. In this paper, we consider an RIS-aided multiuser system with non-ideal reflecting elements, each of which has a phase-dependent reflecting amplitude, and we aim to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of the channel estimation by jointly optimizing the training signals at the user equipments (UEs) and the reflection pattern at the RIS. As examples the least squares (LS) and linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimators are considered. The considered problems do not admit simple solution mainly due to the complicated constraints pertaining to the non-ideal RIS reflecting elements. As far as the LS criterion is concerned, we tackle this difficulty by first proving the optimality of orthogonal training symbols and then propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based iterative method to design the reflection pattern, where a semi-closed form solution is obtained in each iteration. As for the LMMSE criterion, we address the joint training and reflection pattern optimization problem with an MM-based alternating algorithm, where a closed-form solution to the training symbols and a semi-closed form solution to the RIS reflecting coefficients are derived, respectively. Furthermore, an acceleration scheme is proposed to improve the convergence rate of the proposed MM algorithms. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposed joint training and reflection pattern designs.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In this WPCN, UAVs broadcast radio frequency (RF) signals to facilitate a wireless power transfer (WPT) during the downlink phase, and ground nodes (GNs) harvest energy from these RF signals and transmit data to their respective UAVs in the uplink phase. To maximize the minimum uplink throughput of GNs, we jointly optimize the scheduling, transmit power of GNs, and trajectory of UAVs, while satisfying the energy neutrality of GNs and the mobility constraints of UAVs. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we apply a successive convex approximation to divide the original problem into subproblems and make each of them convex for each optimization variable. Subsequently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a block coordinate descent technique and efficiently find the optimal solution for each convex subproblem. The simulation result reveals that resource allocation and the trajectory of UAVs are strongly influenced by the interference level within the network. Furthermore, the result verifies that the proposed optimization approach significantly outperforms existing baseline schemes by properly coordinating co-channel and cross-link interferences between distinct UAV networks.}

To fill the research gap in this area, we aim to propose an energy-efficient transmission scheme for the multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system based on LR digital-to-analog converters (DAC)-aided PC-HBF architecture. For this purpose, we formulate the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for jointly optimizing beamforming, power allocation, and DAC resolution selection. Confronted with a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the original problem is decoupled into several subproblems with respect to each optimization variable, and we design targeted solutions respectively. More specifically, the beamforming design is primarily focused on mitigating spectral efficiency (SE) bottlenecks due to quantization distortion noise and MU interference, which distinguishes our work from the existing scheme. Besides, we propose a quadratic transformation (QT)-based power allocation scheme and a coordinate ascent search (CAS) for DAC resolution selection to maximize EE. Finally, we propose an innovative two-layer nested (TLN) scheme integrating the above design for a stable solution to the original problem. Simulation results show that the proposed TLN scheme has a fast convergence rate and significantly outperforms existing schemes in terms of EE and SE. In addition, a proposed low-complexity (LC) scheme exhibits performance close to that of the TLN scheme and demonstrates good robustness.}

	abstract = {Besides steering the incoming signals toward a receiver, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can simultaneously serve as a backscatter node to communicate additional data by modulating the same signal. Quadrature reflection modulation (QRM) is a promising contender among index modulation (IM)-based techniques for implementing RIS-based backscatter communications (RIS-BackCom). In this paper, we demonstrate that the error performance of RIS-QRM heavily relies on the employed indexing scheme, which configures each RIS element into one of the two orthogonally-reflecting modes of QRM to encode the transmitted data onto the reflection pattern of RIS elements. In this context, we present an efficient guideline for designing indexing schemes that ensure the resulting channel-dependent QRM symbols are evenly spaced with maximum separation. Following this guideline, we propose two specific indexing techniques: the incremental and uniform indexing schemes, both of which substantially enhance the error performance of RIS-QRM without increasing detection complexity. We derive a closed-form expression for the bit error probability (BEP) of RIS-QRM with the incremental indexing scheme. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity detector for RIS-BackCom systems employing RIS-QRM. Extensive computer simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes in improving the error performance of RIS-QRM-based BackCom systems.}

We conceive the joint design of the transmit precoders and of the aRIS’s power-amplified reconfigurable elements (APRES) to enhance the log-det rate objective functions for all users, which poses large-scale mixed discrete continuous problems. We develop a max-min log-det solver, which iterates quadratic-solvers of cubic complexity to maximize the nonsmooth function representing the minimum of the users’ log-det rate functions. To mitigate the computational burden associated with cubically escalating complexity in large-scale scenarios, we introduce a pair of alternative problems aimed at maximizing the smooth functions representing the sum of the users’ log-det rate function (sum log-det) and the soft minimum of the users’ log-det rate function (soft min log-det). We develop sum log-det and soft max-min solvers, leveraging closed-form expressions of scalable (linear) complexity for efficient computation. This approach ensures practicality in addressing large-scale scenarios. Furthermore, the soft min log-det enables us to enhance the log-det rates for all users and their sum, ultimately improving the quality of delivering multi-user multi-stream information.}

Achieving strict requirements of URLLC for each terminal with a fixed infrastructure is challenging, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as promising enablers to handle this issue due to its flexible deployment, low cost and large coverage. In this paper, we investigate a multi-UAV aided CF-RAN with NAFD that use UAVs as aerial access points (APs). We firstly propose a multi-UAV deployment algorithm based on user distribution and quality of service (QoS) requirement. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions for uplink achievable rate with long block length regime and the lower bound of downlink achievable rate with finite block length communication (FBLC) regime. Based on those expressions, we formulate a weighted sum spectral efficiency maximization problem and solve it by Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and illustrate the impact of system parameters on spectral efficiency. The effectiveness of proposed UAV deployment algorithm and the performance advantages of the weighted sum spectral efficiency optimization algorithm are demonstrated.}

Although many deep learning-based WSR models have been developed, they still rely on a large amount of labeled training data. Thus, they cannot tackle the few-sample problem in the practically and dynamically changing wireless communication environment. To overcome this challenge, a novel SSwsrNet framework is proposed by using the deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) and semi-supervised learning. The DRSN can learn discriminative features from noisy signals. Moreover, a modular semi-supervised learning method that combines labeled and unlabeled data using MixMatch is exploited to further improve the classification performance under few-sample conditions. Extensive simulation results on automatic modulation classification (AMC) and wireless technology classification (WTC) demonstrate that our proposed WSR scheme can achieve better performance than the benchmark schemes in terms of classification accuracy. This novel method enables more robust and adaptive signal recognition for next-generation wireless networks.}

We first develop novel statistical models for the squared l_{2}\n-norm (SLN) of the true and the quantized channel estimates (QCE) based on Gamma distribution and find the corresponding shape and scale parameters. We then derive new expressions for mean SU transmit power and correlation between SLN of true and QCE. We also develop new expressions for IOP and UL spectral efficiency (SE) of SUs and primary users (PUs) as a function of the Bussgang gain and quantization noise variance which in turn depends on the number of quantization levels. We show that to keep IOP fixed, larger back-off in SU transmit power is required when fewer bits are employed for quantization. Furthermore, the likelihood of PUs or SUs achieving a higher SE increases as number of quantization bits increases and 4 bits are sufficient to obtain same performance as an infinite capacity fronthaul. Impact of spatial correlation on SE is also elucidated.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a multi-intelligent-reflecting-surface-(IRS)-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, in which multiple IRSs are installed to help the base station (BS) provide ISAC services at separate line-of-sight (LoS) blocked areas. We focus on the scenario with semi-passive uniform linear array (ULA) IRSs for sensing, in which each IRS is integrated with dedicated sensors for processing echo signals, and each IRS simultaneously serves one sensing target and multiple communication users (CUs) in its coverage area. We consider two cases with point and extended targets, in which each IRS aims to estimate the target direction-of-arrival (DoA) and the complete target response matrix, respectively. Under this setup, we first derive the closed-form Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) for parameter estimation under the two target models. Then, we assume that the BS sends combined information and dedicated sensing signals for ISAC, and accordingly consider two different types of CU receivers that can and cannot cancel the interference from dedicated sensing signals. Under this setup, we minimize the maximum CRB at all IRSs, via jointly optimizing the transmit beamformers at the BS and the reflective beamformers at the multiple IRSs, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at individual CUs, the maximum transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraints at the multiple IRSs. To tackle the highly non-convex SINR-constrained max-CRB minimization problems, we propose efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation, to obtain converged solutions. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the benefits of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes based on separate or heuristic beamforming designs.}

The joint channel estimation and data detection (JCED) problem is formulated as a multi-task sparse Bayesian learning framework in single carrier (SC) communications. The framework treats the equalized symbols as unknown variables for improving the performance of iterative equalization and leverages temporal correlation in UWA channels by partitioning received symbols into subblocks. Furthermore, a JCED algorithm is derived with variational Bayesian inference. The proposed algorithm was evaluated based on the underwater field data collected during a lake experiment conducted in Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang province, China, in May 2016. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been validated with simulation and experiment results.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a new kind of pilot contamination appearing in multi-operator reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) assisted networks, where multiple operators provide services to their respective served users. The operators use dedicated frequency bands, but each RIS inadvertently reflects the transmitted uplink signals of the user equipment devices in multiple bands. Consequently, the concurrent reflection of pilot signals during the channel estimation phase introduces a new inter-operator pilot contamination effect. We investigate the implications of this effect in systems with either deterministic or correlated Rayleigh fading channels, specifically focusing on its impact on channel estimation quality, signal equalization, and channel capacity. The numerical results demonstrate the substantial degradation in system performance caused by this phenomenon and highlight the pressing need to address inter-operator pilot contamination in multi-operator RIS deployments. To combat the negative effect of this new type of pilot contamination, we propose to use orthogonal RIS configurations during uplink pilot transmission, which can mitigate or eliminate the negative effect of inter-operator pilot contamination at the expense of some inter-operator information exchange and orchestration.}

	abstract = {To glean the benefits offered by massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, channel state information must be accurately acquired. Despite the high accuracy, the computational complexity of classical linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator becomes prohibitively high in the context of massive MIMO, while the other low-complexity methods degrade the estimation accuracy seriously. In this paper, we develop a novel rank-1 subspace channel estimator to approximate the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, which outperforms the linear MMSE estimator, but incurs a surprisingly low computational complexity. Our method first acquires the highly accurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) information via a constructed space-embedding matrix and the rank-1 subspace method. Then, it adopts the post-reception beamforming to acquire the unbiased estimate of channel gains. Furthermore, a fast method is designed to implement our new estimator. Theoretical analysis shows that the extra gain achieved by our method over the linear MMSE estimator grows according to the rule of \\textsf {O}(\\log _{10} M)\n, while its computational complexity is linearly scalable to the number of antennas M. Numerical simulations also validate the theoretical results. Our new method substantially extends the accuracy-complexity region and constitutes a promising channel estimation solution to the emerging massive MIMO communications.}

In practice however, such models are oversimplified. This paper introduces a realistic reflection coefficient model for RIS based on measurements. The reflection coefficients are modeled as discrete complex values that have non-uniform amplitudes and suffer from insufficient phase shift capability. We then propose a group-based query algorithm that takes the imperfect coefficients into consideration while calculating the reflection coefficients. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, and derive the closed-form expressions to characterize the received power of an RIS-aided wireless communication system. The performance gains of the proposed algorithm are confirmed in simulations. Furthermore, we validate the proposed theoretical results by experiments with our fabricated RIS prototype systems.

The full coverage appears to be one of the most crucial problems to be considered during the network and access-point/router deployment (placement). We formulate the light-of-sight (LoS) coverage problem using the visibility-graph framework. In this work, for arbitrary multiply-connected or simply-connected polygonal/prismatic fields-of-interest subject to an arbitrary link-range restriction, we investigate how the full LoS coverage can be achieved by a minimum number of access-points/routers. Based on the new mathematical lemmas we derive, we design a novel graph-theoretical approach accordingly. Our proposed new scheme can be deemed the first-ever systematic approach to the best of our knowledge. Our proposed new approach is also evaluated in terms of the coverage efficiency, the number of access-points/routers, and the peak link-distance ratio for full LoS coverage in comparison with the existing solution to the art gallery problem.}

	abstract = {Marker code is an effective coding scheme to protect data from insertions and deletions. It has potential applications in future storage systems, such as DNA storage and racetrack memory. When decoding marker codes, perfect channel state information (CSI), i.e., insertion and deletion probabilities, are required to detect insertion and deletion errors. Sometimes, the perfect CSI is not easy to obtain or the accurate channel model is unknown. Therefore, it is deserved to develop detecting algorithms for marker code without the knowledge of perfect CSI. In this paper, we propose two CSI-agnostic detecting algorithms for marker code based on deep learning. The first one is a model-driven deep learning method, which deep unfolds the original iterative detecting algorithm of marker code. In this method, CSI become weights in neural networks and these weights can be learned from training data. The second one is a data-driven method which is an end-to-end system based on the deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit network. Simulation results show that error performances of the proposed methods are significantly better than that of the original detection algorithm with CSI uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method exhibits better error performances than other methods for unknown channel models.}

In the case of polar codes, the minimum weight \\mathop {\\mathrm {w}}\\nolimits _{\\min } (equal to the minimum distance d) is the only weight for which an explicit enumerator formula is currently available. Having closed-form weight enumerators for polar codewords with weights greater than the minimum weight not only simplifies the enumeration process but also provides valuable insights towards constructing better polar-like codes. In this paper, we contribute towards understanding the algebraic structure underlying higher weights by analyzing Minkowski sums of orbits. Our approach builds upon the lower triangular affine (LTA) group of decreasing monomial codes. Specifically, we propose a closed-form expression for the enumeration of codewords with weight 1.5\\mathop {\\mathrm {w}}\\nolimits _{\\min } . The key insight for code design is that the enumeration of codewords with weight \\mathop {\\mathrm {w}}\\nolimits _{\\min } and 1.5\\mathop {\\mathrm {w}}\\nolimits _{\\min } relies on the set of maximum degree monomials. This set corresponds to the indices of minimum weight rows of the polar transform \\boldsymbol {G}_{N} belonging to the information set \\mathcal {I} . Consequently, reducing the cardinality of this set can lead to a reduction of the number of codewords in both weight categories.}

In the proposed scheme, m_{c} mapped bits are carried by 2^{m_{c}} chaotic sequences by exploiting the quasi-orthogonality of different chaotic signals, while the modulated bit is carried by DCSK. To diminish the multiuser interference, the references allocated to different users are sent in individual time slots, while the information-bearing sequences for the mapped bits of users are sent simultaneously. We then derive the bit error rate (BER) expression of multi-user IVI-DCSK over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. The theoretical and consistent simulation results show that the proposed IVI-DCSK achieves significant gains over the conventional chaotic-based index modulations, i.e., permutation index DCSK (PI-DCSK) and code index modulation DCSK (CIM-DCSK). This gain can be more than 4 dB in fading channels with high multipath delay. In addition, it achieves higher energy and spectral efficiencies over the latter ones. The superiority of the proposed scheme is further verified in practical ultra-wideband (UWB) communications. Thus, this proposed scheme is efficient and promising for chaotic-based low-complexity communications, such as in wireless local area network (WLAN) and indoor applications.}

To be specific, we optimize the power allocation of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. We aim to maximize the radar mutual information (RMI) with considering the communication data rate (CDR) and AoI performance. Specifically, we design a cognitive operating framework for the JRC system, with a particular emphasis on the closed-loop signal processing for online prediction of the radar target scattering coefficient (TSC). Then, considering the obtained TSC prediction result and corresponding communication performance requirement, we optimize the power allocation of the transmit waveform and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold of the communication users. Accordingly, we propose a constraints-splitting coordinate descent (CS-CD) method to solve the formulated non-convex problem by strategically splitting the sum-constraints and assign a quota to each channel, where the allocation criteria is automatically decided during iteration. Simulation results demonstrate that, the cooperative radar-centric communication-constrained (RC-CC) waveform outperforms the separately optimized radar-optimal plus communication-optimal (RO-CO) waveform. Additionally, the A-OnP scheme can increase RMI while meeting the communication CDR and AoI requirements.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications have been considered as the key techniques to support extremely high data rates in the 6G system. One main limitation of the mmWave/THz communications is the severe path loss and low penetration power. For these reasons, it is expected that mmWave/THz communication will be mainly employed in the ultra-dense network (UDN) environment. In order to get the most out of the mmWave/THz UDN, a mobile should be associated to the base stations (BSs) providing a high quality-of-service (QoS). This task is challenging since the reliable path can be disappeared even with a small movement of a mobile. An aim of this paper is to propose a novel mobility management technique based on sensing and computer vision (CV). Our key idea is to predict the cell association from the visual sensing information and CV-based inference and decision. By extracting the geometric information of a mobile from the image and then using it for the downlink rate prediction, we preemptively switch the cell association in UDN. From the numerical evaluations on the realistic mmWave/THz UDN environments, we show that the proposed scheme achieves more than 30% throughput gain over the conventional mobility management techniques.}

	abstract = {Multi-modal services, integrating various modalities such as audio, visual, and haptic, have emerged as leading multimedia applications in the 5G era and beyond. To fulfill the demands for low latency, high reliability, and large capacity, cross-modal transmission schemes have been proposed. Typically, these schemes emphasize on either audio-visual or haptic modality, and prioritize flawless transmission of one modality to assist the other modality streaming. However, these prerequisite and assumption do not hold for generic multi-modal services and communication environments, where determining the priority of modality and guaranteeing flawless transmission becomes challenging. To address this fundamental problem, in this paper, we introduce a strategy toward generic cross-modal transmission, enabling visual and haptic modalities to assist each other as needed. The strategy includes a visual-haptic mutual stream delivery mechanism at the sender and a visual-haptic mutual signal reconstruction approach at the receiver. The former aims to eliminate redundancy in visual and haptic streams through mutual assistance, while the latter adaptively handles impaired, missing, or delayed visual or haptic signals by leveraging modality-aware knowledge transfer and semantic-aware signal generation techniques. The proposed strategy demonstrates excellent performance through experiments conducted on a standard multi-modal dataset and a practical visual-haptic communication platform.}

	abstract = {Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is recognized as the most challenging use case for the next generation of wireless networks. Existing research on URLLC is based on the regular pilot (RP) scheme, which is tough to ensure a high transmission rate with stringent latency and reliability requirements due to the impact of finite blocklength, especially in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose to use generalized superimposed pilot (GSP) scheme for URLLC transmission in massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) systems. Distinguishing from the conventional superimposed pilot (SP) scheme, the GSP scheme eliminates mutual interference between the pilot and data, where the data length is optimized, and the data symbols are precoded to spread over the whole transmission block. With the GSP scheme, we first formulate a weighted sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the data length, pilot power, and data power and then derive closed-form results, including suboptimal data length and achievable rate lower bounds with maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detectors, respectively. Based on the closed-form results, we provide the corresponding iterative algorithms for the MRC and ZF cases where the problems are transformed into geometry program format by using log-function and successive convex approximation methods. Finally, the performance of the RP, SP, and GSP schemes are compared through simulation results, which reflect the superiority and robustness of the GSP scheme in URLLC scenarios.}

Unlike existing SnS CE methods that rely on the statistical characteristics of channels in the spatial or delay domain, we propose an approach that simultaneously exploits the antenna-domain spatial correlation and the wavenumber-domain sparsity of SnS channels. To this end, we introduce a two-stage VR detection and CE scheme. In the first stage, the belief regarding the visibility of antennas is obtained through a VR detection-oriented message passing (VRDO-MP) scheme, which fully exploits the spatial correlation among adjacent antenna elements. In the second stage, leveraging the VR information and wavenumber-domain sparsity, we accurately estimate the SnS channel employing the belief-based orthogonal matching pursuit (BB-OMP) method. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms lead to a significant enhancement in VR detection and CE accuracy as compared to existing methods, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper studies noisy index coding problems over broadcast channels. The codewords from a chosen binary index code of length N are mapped to a 2^{N} -PSK constellation before being transmitted over an AWGN channel. The receivers follow the two-step decoding process of first estimating the PSK symbol using a maximum-likelihood decoder and then performing index code decoding. After estimating the PSK symbol, there is, in general, more than one decoding strategy at a receiver, i.e., more than one linear combination of index-coded bits along with a subset of side information bits, that can be used to estimate the requested message. Thomas et al. in [“Single Uniprior Index Coding With Min-Max Probability of Error Over Fading Channels,” IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, pp. 6050-6059, July 2017] showed that for binary-modulated index code transmissions, minimizing the number of transmissions used to decode a requested message is equivalent to reducing the probability of error. This paper shows that this is no longer true while employing multi-level modulations. Further, we consider the side information available to each receiver also to be noisy and derive an expression for the probability that a requested message bit is estimated erroneously at a receiver. We also show that the criterion for choosing a decoding strategy that gives the best probability of error performance at a receiver changes with the signal-to-noise ratio at which the side information is broadcast. Hence, for a given index coding problem and a chosen index code, we give an algorithm to select the best decoding strategy for the receivers. The above results are shown to be valid over fading channels also.}

	abstract = {Due to the finite bandwidth of practical wireless systems, one multipath component can manifest itself as a discrete pulse consisting of multiple taps in the digital delay domain. This effect is called channel leakage, which complicates the multipath parameter estimation. In this study, we propose a new algorithm to estimate multipath parameters, including delay, angle of arrival (AOA), and angle of departure (AOD) of leaked channels. This is accomplished by leveraging the knowledge of pulse shaping functions, a technique that can be applied to enhance the precision of WiFi sensing. More specifically, we formulate the channel impulse response (CIR) between a transmit and a receive antenna as a linear combination of a set of overcomplete basis vectors, each corresponding to a different delay. Considering the limited number of paths in physical environments, we formulate the multipath parameter estimation as a group sparse recovery problem. We develop a two-stage approach based on variational expectation maximization (VEM) to solve the formulated problem. In the first stage, we estimate the sparse vectors and determine the number of physical paths and their associated delay parameters from the positions of the nonzero entries. In the second stage, we use Newton’s method to estimate the AOA and AOD of each path. The Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath parameter estimation is derived for performance evaluation. Simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve superior estimation accuracy in multipath parameters compared to two benchmarking schemes and approach the CRLB.}

	abstract = {Future wireless networks, in particular, 5G and beyond, are anticipated to deploy dense Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to provide global coverage and broadband connectivity. However, the limited frequency band and the coexistence of multiple constellations bring new challenges for interference management. In this paper, we propose a robust multilayer interference management scheme for spectrum sharing in heterogeneous satellite networks with statistical Channel State Information (CSI) at the Transmitter (CSIT) and Receivers (CSIR). In the proposed scheme, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), as a general and powerful framework for interference management and multiple access strategies, is implemented distributedly at Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and LEO satellites, coined Distributed-RSMA (D-RSMA). By doing so, D-RSMA aims to mitigate the interference and boost the user fairness of the overall multilayer satellite system. Specifically, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the GEO/LEO precoders and message splits to maximize the minimum rate among User Terminals (UTs) subject to a transmit power constraint at all satellites. A robust algorithm is proposed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness towards network load and CSI uncertainty of our proposed D-RSMA scheme. Benefiting from the interference management capability, D-RSMA provides significant max-min fairness performance gains compared to several benchmark schemes.}

Achieving Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) with ISAC has been relatively under-investigated in the existing literature. In this paper, we investigate joint beamforming and scheduling for an ISAC-enabled system to fulfill URLLC requirements. We focus on a typical URLLC scenario where periodic and aperiodic traffic flows coexist. Specifically, the aperiodic traffic is triggered by sensing the stochastic environment. We propose a joint beamforming and scheduling scheme to sense the environment and transmit traffic simultaneously, where efficient scheduling is obtained by exploiting sensing results. To analyze the latency and reliability performance of the proposed scheme, we first describe the system as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Then, we analytically express the latency and reliability performance as the probability of successful transmission within the latency constraint. Based on this, we formulate an optimal performance tradeoff for the periodic and aperiodic traffic and obtain an optimal tradeoff by a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based algorithm. Furthermore, we reveal some insightful properties of the optimal tradeoff and the optimal policy. Simulation results show that the optimal tradeoff outperforms other tradeoffs of benchmark algorithms.}

Two precoders are presented: diagonal, having positive diagonal elements in geometric progression (GP); rank-one, having positive row elements in GP.

UURA is a typical framework of unsourced random access that addresses the problems of codeword detection and message stitching, without the use of check bits. Firstly, we establish a framework for UURA, allowing for immediate decoding of sub-messages upon arrival. Thus, the processing delay is effectively reduced due to the decreasing waiting time. Next, we propose an integrated decoding algorithm for sub-messages by leveraging matrix information geometry (MIG) theory. Specifically, MIG is applied to measure the feature similarities of codewords belonging to the same user equipment, and thus sub-message can be stitched once it is received. This enables the timely recovery of a portion of the original message by simultaneously detecting and stitching codewords within the current sub-slot. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the proposed integrated decoding-based UURA scheme in terms of computational complexity and convergence rate. Finally, we present extensive simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in 6G wireless networks.}

We present a maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for the detection of RIS signals and analyze the error probability theoretically. We derive closed-form expressions of the error probability for the detection of RIS signals for the special case of flat-fading channels. Then we analyze the error probability of the detection of user’s signals. Analysis indicates that faulty detection of RIS signal results in channel estimation errors, consequently compromising the precision of OFDM signal detection. High correlation between code words limits the error propagation to the user but decreases accuracy for RIS signal’s detection. Addressing this, an index modulation with beamforming (IM-BF) code is proposed to enhance the transmission for the user, and a quadrature reflection modulation with beamforming (QRM-BF) code is proposed for a performance trade-off between the user and the RIS. Simulation results demonstrate the theoretical results, and show that the QRM-BF code has better performance for the RIS transmission, and both schemes outperform benchmark schemes from the literature for the user’s transmission. Simulation results also show that the IM-BF scheme significantly improves the user transmission performance compared to the state of the art.}

	abstract = {Network slicing-based communication systems can dynamically and efficiently allocate resources for diversified services. However, due to the limitation of the network interface on channel access and the complexity of the resource allocation, it is challenging to achieve an acceptable solution in the practical system without precise prior knowledge of the dynamics probability model of the service requests. Existing work attempts to solve this problem using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, such methods usually require a lot of interaction with the real environment to achieve good results. In this paper, a framework consisting of a digital twin and reinforcement learning agents is present to handle the issue. Specifically, we propose to use the historical data and the neural networks to build a digital twin model to simulate the state variation law of the real environment. Then, we use the data generated by the network slicing environment to calibrate the digital twin so that it is in sync with the real environment. Finally, DRL for slice optimization optimizes its performance in this virtual pre-verification environment. We conducted an exhaustive verification of the proposed digital twin framework to confirm its scalability. Specifically, we propose to use loss landscapes to visualize the generalization of DRL solutions. We explore a distillation-based optimization scheme for lightweight slicing strategies. In addition, we also extend the framework to offline reinforcement learning, where solutions can be used to obtain intelligent decisions based solely on historical data. Numerical simulation experiments show that the proposed digital twin can significantly improve the performance of the slice optimization strategy.}

	abstract = {Multi-link operation is regarded as a crucial feature in the upcoming WiFi 7 networks, which allows a single multi-link device (MLD) to make concurrent data transmissions over multiple links. To facilitate synchronous multi-link channel access, IEEE 802.11 Task Group BE has proposed various channel access schemes, such as Longest Backoff (LB) access and Shortest Backoff (SB) access. However, the coexisting performance of WiFi 7 networks with multiple channel access schemes remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to evaluate the data rate and mean access delay performance of a multi-link WiFi 7 network with two types of devices adopting LB and SB, respectively, each employing different initial backoff window sizes. The ratio of device data rates between LB-MLDs and SB-MLDs is inversely correlated with the number of links, and the ratio of their initial backoff window sizes, indicating potential unfairness if the backoff parameters are not appropriately chosen. The optimal initial backoff window sizes to maximize the network sum rate and minimize the mean access delay under a given data rate ratio are further derived and verified by simulation results. The maximum network sum rate scales with the number of links, and is independent of the target fairness requirement or number of devices. Conversely, the minimum mean access delay for each type of devices, is strongly influenced by the target fairness requirement, and shows a linear increase with the network size.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the generalized linear system (GLS), widely employed to evaluate the impact of nonlinear preprocessing on wireless transceivers. Two state-of-the-art signal recovery algorithms, namely generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) and generalized orthogonal/vector AMP (GOAMP/GVAMP), are comparatively studied. They have demonstrated Bayesian optimality for independently and identically distributed (IID) Gaussian matrices and unitary matrices, respectively. However, Bayesian optimality does not inherently guarantee error-free signal recovery. For coded GLS, the information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit of GAMP remains unknown, and there are still no analytical comparisons between GAMP and GOAMP/GVAMP in terms of the mean-square error and information-theoretic limit. To address these issues, we present the achievable rate analysis and optimal coding principle for GAMP with IID Gaussian matrices, as well as provide comprehensive comparisons with GOAMP/GVAMP with unitary matrices. Specifically, based on the celebrated I-MMSE lemma and the preconditions for state evolution (SE) to hold, the simplified variational SEs of GAMP and GOAMP/GVAMP are derived, leveraging the IID and unitary matrix properties to analyze the achievable rate and optimal coding principle, respectively. On this basis, it is proven that GOAMP/GVAMP outperforms GAMP in terms of asymptotic MSE and maximum achievable rate while requiring less complexity. Furthermore, two common nonlinear functions, clipping and quantization, are used as examples to demonstrate the theoretical comparisons and practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code design for GAMP and GOAMP/GVAMP. Numerical results show that GAMP and GOAMP/GVAMP with optimized LDPC codes can approach the theoretical limits within 0.3 dB and overcome the decoding deterioration and even divergence of the existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly under low-resolution quantization.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the mmWave beam tracking for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to find the optimal beam via sub-6 GHz channel state information (CSI). We consider two scenarios: 1) sub-6 GHz and mmWave transceivers are co-located on the same base station (BS), and 2) sub-6 GHz and mmWave BSs are separated in different places constituting heterogeneous networks (HetNets) where one sub-6 GHz BS controls multiple mmWave BSs. Considering the mobility of the vehicle and time-varying channels, we propose a predictive beam tracking method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to construct the maps from historical sequential sub-6 GHz CSI to the future optimal mmWave beam. A single LSTM model can handle the beam tracking in the co-located scenario, since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sub-6 GHz and mmWave transceivers, and the propagation of sub-6 GHz and mmWave signals is similar. However, in the HetNet scenario, it is difficult to select the best one among the beams of multiple mmWave BSs only via the CSI of one sub-6 GHz BS. To address this challenge, we design an LSTM fusion model, which exploits not only the historical sequential sub-6 GHz CSI but also a number of mmWave wide beam measurements, to obtain the optimal mmWave BS and beam in the HetNet. In this case, the collected sub-6 GHz CSI and mmWave wide beam measurements are analyzed by the LSTM and fully connected network (FCN) modules, respectively, providing two beam prediction results. Then the results are fused by an attention-based FCN module to accomplish the final prediction. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our LSTM-based beam tracking models compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning beam tracking models that also leverage sub-6 GHz channels. Besides, the robustness and generalization of our proposed LSTM models are illustrated through simulations.}

	abstract = {The data heterogeneity across clients and the limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, are two of the main bottlenecks for wireless federated learning (FL). To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework with partial model aggregation (PMA). This approach aggregates the lower layers of neural networks, responsible for feature extraction, at the parameter server while keeping the upper layers, responsible for complex pattern recognition, at clients for personalization. The proposed PMA-FL is able to address the data heterogeneity and reduce the transmitted information in wireless channels. Then, we derive a convergence bound of the framework under a non-convex loss function setting to reveal the role of unbalanced data size in the learning performance. On this basis, we maximize the scheduled data size to minimize the global loss function through jointly optimize the client selection, bandwidth allocation, computation and communication time division policies with the assistance of Lyapunov optimization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal time division is achieved when the communication and computation parts of PMA-FL have the same power. We also develop a bisection method to solve the optimal bandwidth allocation policy and use the set expansion algorithm to address the client scheduling policy. Compared with the benchmark schemes, the proposed PMA-FL improves 3.13% and 11.8% absolute accuracy on two typical datasets with heterogeneous data distribution settings, i.e., MINIST and CIFAR-10, respectively. In addition, the proposed joint dynamic client selection and resource management approach achieve slightly higher accuracy than the considered benchmarks, but they provide a satisfactory energy and time reduction: 29% energy or 20% time reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time reduction on the CIFAR-10.}

	abstract = {Due to the scarcity of spectrum resources in Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems and insufficient satellite-ground integration in satellite Internet of Things (IoT), this paper investigates its issue in spectrum resource management. We propose a resource allocation method based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) for NOMA enabled satellite IoT. We formulate the spectrum allocation problem of the satellite-ground integrated network as a distributed optimization problem. Then we decouple the problem into two sub-problems. Firstly, a user grouping method based on matching coefficients is defined, and a Linear Programming (LP) method is utilized for obtaining solution. Secondly, the power allocation problem is transformed into a multi-agent problem, where MADDPG is employed to allocate the power. Through this approach, the system is capable of real-time user association and spectrum resource allocation optimization, achieving optimal user grouping while maximizing system transmission rate. Based on the simulation results, the MADDPG-based method demonstrates fast convergence within 100 training iterations. The proposed MADDPG-based resource management method also achieves increased system transmission rate with more effective matching outcomes over Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), and random allocation baselines.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) has received considerable attention for its ability to reduce data transmission size while maintaining task performance. However, existing works mainly focus on analog SemCom with simple channel models, which may limit its practical application. To reduce this gap, we propose an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based SemCom system that is compatible with existing digital communication infrastructures. In the considered system, the extracted semantics is quantized by scalar quantizers, transformed into OFDM signal, and then transmitted over the frequency-selective channel. Moreover, we propose a semantic importance measurement method to build the relationship between target task and semantic features. Based on semantic importance, we formulate a sub-carrier and bit allocation problem to maximize communication performance. However, the optimization objective function cannot be accurately characterized using a mathematical expression due to the neural network-based semantic codec. Given the complex nature of the problem, we first propose a low-complexity sub-carrier allocation method that assigns sub-carriers with better channel conditions to more critical semantics. Then, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based bit allocation algorithm with dynamic action space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves 9.7% and 28.7% performance gains compared to analog SemCom and conventional bit-based communication systems, respectively.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem in integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs). VNE consists of mapping virtual network functions (VNFs) in a service function chain (SFC) to physical nodes and mapping virtual links connecting the VNFs to physical links. Compared to terrestrial networks, VNE in STNs is challenging due to the movement of the non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites and limited onboard processing resources. A static VNE strategy fails to efficiently address the diverse requirements of heterogeneous service requests in such a highly dynamic topology. In addition, existing solutions do not consider the capacity limitation and connectivity duration of inter-satellite links (ISLs) and ground-to-satellite links, which are essential parameters for deploying a VNE strategy in STNs. This work proposes a heuristic solution and reinforcement learning (RL)-based improved solution for the VNE scheme that can dynamically modify the existing VNF deployment strategy to maximize the average service acceptance rate and revenue. The RL agent selects a suitable VNE strategy for each service request considering the time-varying network topology and service’s requirements. The proposed scheme increases the service acceptance ratio by 19.95% compared to the benchmark TS-MAPSCH.}

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in learning-based semantic communication because it can prioritize the preservation of meaningful semantic information over the accuracy of the transmitted symbols, resulting in improved communication efficiency. However, existing learning-based approaches still face limitations in defining semantic level loss and often struggle to find a good trade-off between preserving semantic information and preserving intricate details. In addition, the existing semantic communication approaches cannot effectively train semantic encoders and decoders without the support of downstream models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a contrastive learning (CL)-based semantic communication system. First, inspired by practical observations, we introduce the concept of semantic contrastive loss and propose a semantic contrastive coding (SemCC) approach that treats data corruption during transmission as a form of data augmentation within the CL framework. Moreover, we propose a semantic re-encoding (SemRE) operation, which uses a duplicate of the semantic encoder deployed at the receiver to guide the entire training process when the downstream model is inaccessible. Further, we design the training procedure for SemCC and SemRE approaches, respectively, to balance the semantic information and intricate details. Finally, simulations are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches over competing approaches. In particular, our approaches achieve a significant accuracy improvement of up to 53% on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a bandwidth compression ratio of 1/24, and also obtain comparable image reconstruction quality as the bandwidth compression ratio is improved.}

	abstract = {A joint cascaded channel estimation scheme is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) systems with hardware imperfections. In particular, the practical hybrid near- and far-field electromagnetic radiation with spatial non-stationarity is investigated. By exploiting the cascaded channel correlations between different users and between different STAR-RIS elements, a multi-task learning (MTL)-based channel estimation framework is proposed. This framework is capable of estimating the cascaded channels for transmission and reflection simultaneously based on noisy observations of the mixture channel. Following the design guideline of the proposed MTL framework, an efficient multi-task network (MTN) is developed to reconstruct the high-dimensional channels with limited pilot overhead. In the proposed MTN architecture, a mixed convolution and multilayer perception module is exploited to capture the effective hybrid-field channel features. This module integrates the locality bias modeling of the channel-wise convolution and the long-range dependency modeling of MLP, which finely learns both local spatial correlations and specific spatial non-stationarity of the hybrid-field cascaded channels. Numerical results show that the proposed MTN achieves superior channel estimation accuracy with less training overhead compared with the existing state-of-the-art benchmarks, in terms of required pilots, computations, and network parameters.

Furthermore, the codewords from the clients must satisfy the average power constraint P, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of KP/\\sigma _{z}^{2} . In this paper, we study the fundamental limits imposed by MAC on the convergence rate of any distributed optimization algorithm and design optimal communication schemes to achieve these limits. Our first result is a lower bound for the convergence rate, showing that communicating over a MAC imposes a slowdown of \\sqrt {d/\\frac {1}{2}\\log (1+\\mathtt {SNR})} on any protocol compared to the centralized setting. Next, we design a computationally tractable digital communication scheme that matches the lower bound to a logarithmic factor in K when combined with a projected stochastic gradient descent algorithm. At the heart of our communication scheme is carefully combining several compression and modulation ideas such as quantizing along random bases, Wyner-Ziv compression, modulo-lattice decoding, and amplitude shift keying. We also show that analog schemes, which are popular due to their ease of implementation, can give close to optimal convergence rates at low SNR but experience a slowdown of roughly \\sqrt {d} at high SNR.}

The challenge is how to exploit the large-scale channel information predicted from the predetermined trajectories of the aerial nodes to optimize for the communication strategy in a distributive way. The objective is to minimize both the communication energy and the communication time to control the interference leakage to the ground. Most existing approaches for aerial network communications require intensive centralized coordination, but the trajectory information may not be globally available. To tackle these issues, this paper develops a large timescale two-layer optimization strategy using a game theoretical approach. In the inner layer, a mixed timescale optimization on the power allocation and transmission timing is formulated, which is converted into a one-parameter optimization with an optimality guarantee for a deterministic proxy of the original problem. In the outer layer, a handover time game is formulated, and a neighbor coordinate response strategy based on local information exchange is developed, demonstrating rapid convergence and near-global optimality in simulations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, under large timescale optimization, an order of magnitude of cost saving can be achieved.}

Two types of problems that have been studied in the literature but remain unsolved are revisited under this approach, wherein multiple agents transmit over an error-prone multiaccess channel, and long-term transmission frequency constraints are considered with either a resource constraint or a minimum throughput requirement. Previous works have derived the Whittle’s Index (WI) policy, max-weight policy and average AoI lower bound, however without optimality guarantee or closed-form performance analysis. This work advances the field by deriving closed-form optimal AoI and achieving scheduling policies for both problems, by utilizing the fluid limit tool and transforming the original high-dimensional Markov decision process into solving a set of partial derivative equations. As a result, threshold-based scheduling policies with closed-form threshold expressions are obtained which can be proven to be asymptotically optimal when the number of agents is large. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance optimality of the proposed schemes and analytical results.}

	abstract = {The development of integrated satellite-terrestrial networks has gained significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years, owing to their potential for delivering low latency, high dependability, strong resilience, ubiquitous connectivity and global broadband coverage services. However, due to the ever-changing nature of satellite topology and the complexity of diverse integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, routing requests is challenging. In this paper, the vehicle movement is uncertain introducing the intermittent connectivity related to vehicles. Therefore, we propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model to minimize, under uncertain latency probability distributions, the expected worst-case overall task routing delay from source to target user equipment through satellite constellation. The model addresses undetermined uploading and downloading latency between automobiles, satellites, and user equipment by employing the Wasserstein ambiguity set, allowing for unpredictable vehicle mobility and intermittent connections. By reformulating the problem into a tractable form, we determine the optimal routing path for task uploading, satellite constellation, and task downloading. Ultimately, the performance of the proposed DRO model demonstrates the model’s ability to address the challenges of integrated satellite-terrestrial network routing.}

	abstract = {The use of quantum key distribution (QKD) to improve security may impact the quality of service (Qos) of high rate classical data links. The key generation process with an empty buffer can be modeled as a queuing system, and data throughput limits can be determined using queueing theory to assess the impact on the QoS. The proposed key generation model is based on an on-demand paradigm. Based on the results of this study, a discrete variable (DV)-QKD-secured link could be designed using the data rate bounds to guarantee a given QoS. Furthermore, we validate the derived bounds by comparing the theoretical derivations with simulations. We show that in a one-time-pad system, the achievable throughput approaches 0.59 times the secret key rate as the key length increases. In the case of a key scheme with key reuse, the throughput is asymptotically linear with the number of key reuses, and the slope of the curve corresponds to the secret key rate multiplied by a function of the protocol and channel characteristics. The analysis is carried out on optical fiber and free-space links.}

	abstract = {We design a receiver assembling several photomultipliers (PMTs) as an array to increase the field of view (FOV) of the receiver and adapt to multiuser situation over non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) channels. Channel estimation and signal detection have been investigated according to the space division characteristics of the structure. Firstly, we adopt balanced structure on the pilot matrix, analyze the channel estimation mean square error (MSE), and optimize the structure parameters. Then, with the estimated parameters, an analytical threshold detection rule is proposed as a preliminary work of multiuser detection. The detection rule can be optimized by analyzing the separability of two channel states based on Gaussian approximation of Poisson weighted sum. To assess the effect of imperfect estimation, the sensitivity analysis of channel estimation error on threshold detection performance is carried out. Based on the threshold detection rule, we propose a successive elimination method for on-off keying (OOK) modulated multiuser symbol detection. A tractable closed-form upper bound on the detection error rate is calculated, which turns out to be a good approximation of that of multiuser maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. The proposed successive elimination method has a much faster execution speed than the ML multiuser detection with negligible detection error rate degradation.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology holds the potential to revolutionize head-mounted displays (HMDs) by enabling high-speed wireless communication with nearby processing nodes, where complex video rendering can take place. However, the sparse angular profile of mmWave channels, coupled with the narrow field of view (FoV) of patch-antenna arrays and frequent HMD rotation, can lead to poor performance. We introduce six channel performance metrics to evaluate the performance of an HMD equipped with mmWave arrays. We analyze the metrics using analytical models, discuss their impact for the application, and apply them to 28 GHz channel sounding data, collected in a conference room using eight HMD patch-antenna arrays, offset by 45° from each other in azimuth. Our findings confirm that a single array performs poorly due to the narrow FoV, and featuring multiple arrays along the HMD’s azimuth is required. Namely, the broader FoV stabilizes channel gain during HMD rotation, lessens the attenuation caused by line of sight (LoS) obstruction, and increases the channel’s spatial multiplexing capability. In light of our findings, we conclude that it is imperative to either equip the HMD with multiple arrays or, as an alternative approach, incorporate macroscopic diversity by leveraging distributed access point (AP) infrastructure.}

	abstract = {Radio simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is challenging due to multipath propagation. While line-of-sight (LoS) and first-order non-LoS (NLoS) paths, referred to as NLoS-1 paths, play a critical role in SLAM, no existing techniques can effectively separate them from high-order NLoS paths, i.e., NLoS-n paths ( n\\geq 2 ). This paper presents a new framework to accurately identify the LoS/NLoS-1 paths and conduct SLAM. The key idea is to define the virtual user equipment (UE) of a NLoS-n path as the n-th order reflection of the UE. We discover that the centers of the circles encompassing the UE, a virtual UE associated with a LoS/NLoS-1 path, and each of some other virtual UEs are aligned in a line, if and only if those virtual UEs are all associated with NLoS-1 paths. Accordingly, we propose to identify the LoS/NLoS-1 paths using Hough transform-based line detection, and estimate the UE’s location and the environments with the identified LoS/NLoS-1 paths using maximum likelihood estimation and mean-shift clustering. We analytically confirm that the localization error asymptotically approaches the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound. Simulations show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in localization accuracy by up to 91.93%, even when the latter assumed all NLoS-1 paths are perfectly identified a-priori.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the fair transmission design for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). IRS is used to establish a good signal propagation environment and enhance the RSMA transmission performance. The fair rate adaption problem is constructed as a max-min optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem, we adopt an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the power allocation, beamforming, and decoding order, respectively. A generalized power iteration (GPI) method is proposed to optimize the receive beamforming, which can improve the minimum rate of devices and reduce the optimization complexity. At the base station (BS), a successive group decoding (SGD) algorithm is proposed to tackle the uplink signal estimation, which trades off the fairness and complexity of decoding. At the same time, we also consider robust communication with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which studies robust optimization by using lower bound expressions on the expected data rates. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm can significantly improve the performance of fairness. It also provides reliable results for uplink communication with imperfect CSIT.}

The traffic-aware quality of service additionally complicates the beam selection problem. To address this issue, we propose a traffic-aware hierarchical beam selection scheme performed in a dual timescale. In the long-timescale, the central processing unit collects wide beam responses from base stations (BSs) to predict the power profile in the narrow beam space with a convolutional neural network, based on which the cascaded multiple-BS beam space is carefully pruned. In the short-timescale, we introduce a centralized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to maximize the satisfaction rate of delay w.r.t. beam selection within multiple consecutive time slots. Moreover, we put forward three scalable distributed algorithms including hierarchical distributed Lyapunov optimization, fully distributed RL, and centralized training with decentralized execution of RL to achieve better scalability and better tradeoff between the performance and the execution signal overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly reduce both model training cost and beam training overhead and are easier to meet the user-specific delay requirement, compared to existing methods.}

	abstract = {To reap the benefits of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), channel state information (CSI) is generally required. However, CSI acquisition in RIS systems is challenging and often results in very large pilot overhead, especially in unstructured channel environments. Consequently, the RIS channel estimation problem has attracted a lot of interest and also been a subject of intense study in recent years. In this paper, we propose a decision-directed RIS channel estimation framework for general unstructured channel models. The employed RIS contains some hybrid elements that can simultaneously reflect and sense the incoming signal. We show that with the help of the hybrid RIS elements, it is possible to accurately recover the CSI with a pilot overhead proportional to the number of users. Therefore, the proposed framework substantially improves the system spectral efficiency compared to systems with passive RIS arrays since the pilot overhead in passive RIS systems is proportional to the number of RIS elements times the number of users. We also perform a detailed spectral efficiency analysis for both the pilot-directed and decision-directed frameworks. Our analysis takes into account both the channel estimation and data detection errors at both the RIS and the BS. Finally, we present numerous simulation results to verify the accuracy of the analysis as well as to show the benefits of the proposed decision-directed framework.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are promising techniques for future cellular networks. MEC enables latency-critical tasks offloading at the network edge, while mmWave provides an abundant spectrum for gigabit-per-second data transmission. Dense deployment of remote radio units (RRUs) is necessary due to high mmWave signal path loss, and hence limiting the deployment cost becomes a prime network design factor. Our work considers that RRUs are deployed to provide mmWave access and to offload computation requests to edge servers (ESs) via fronthaul links. We propose an edge network (EN) deployment problem by jointly optimizing the mmWave access and fronthaul networks. Converged fiber and in-band mmWave techniques are utilized for flexible fronthaul links deployment and cost reduction. The deployed EN is expected to fulfill coverage, reliability and latency requirements of ultra-reliable low-latency (uRLLC) services. We formulate the optimization problem as an integer linear program (ILP) and propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal solutions compared with the ILP formulation. We also comparatively evaluate the deployment costs under different EN settings and show that our algorithm provides up to 20.3% cost savings compared to non-converged solutions.}

	abstract = {For wideband transceivers operating at millimeter wave and terahertz frequencies, the implementation of conventional digital predistortion for nonlinearity mitigation faces significant challenges due to the limited availability and/or complexity of high-speed digital signal processing. In this paper, a simple received signal model is proposed for wideband system with nonlinearity and other practical impairments, such as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) I/Q imbalances (IQIs), carrier frequency offset (CFO), and phase noise, to enable low-complexity impairment mitigation. An expanded memory polynomial (EMP) model is firstly proposed to capture Tx IQI and the nonlinearity over the entire transceiver chain. Exploiting the CFO and a novel transmission protocol, a blind Rx IQI estimation is also proposed. The noise enhancement after Rx IQI and CFO compensation is then evaluated as a noise factor related to the mean-square-error of the Rx IQI estimation. As a result, the received signal of the wideband system is finally modelled as an EMP plus additive noises followed by a band-limited noisy receiver filter. Simulation results using a millimeter wave system with 2.5 GHz bandwidth and 73.5 GHz carrier frequency are presented to verify the accuracy of the EMP modelling and validate the theoretical analyses.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation problem in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted broadband millimeter wave multi-input multi-output communication systems. Considering the channel sparsity in both the angle and delay domains, we decouple the channel estimation problem into several sub-problems, namely, sequential estimations of the angles at the user, the base station, and the IRS, alongside the propagation path delays. By exploiting the Vandermonde structure of both the array manifold and the phase difference among multiple subcarriers caused by delays, we propose a multi-stage atomic norm minimization-based (MS-ANM) channel estimation algorithm. In particular, we take full advantage of the sharing of angle information among all subcarriers in the broadband channel to enhance the estimation accuracy. To reduce the computational complexity, we further propose a multi-stage orthogonal matching pursuit-based (MS-OMP) algorithm. Simulation results show that the MS-ANM algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms, and the MS-OMP algorithm strikes a good balance between performance and computational complexity. By fully exploring the channel’s sparsity in the angle and delay domains along with the Vandermonde structure, both proposed algorithms remarkably reduce the training overhead and thus greatly improve the spectral efficiency over the benchmark algorithms.}

Nevertheless, in literature, there are few prototypes serving multiple users. In this paper, we propose a whole flow of channel estimation and beamforming design for RIS, and set up an RIS-aided multi-user system for experimental validations. Specifically, we combine a channel sparsification step with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm, and propose to generate the measurement matrix as Rademacher distribution to obtain the channel state information (CSI). To generate the reflection coefficients with the aim of maximizing the spectral efficiency, we propose a quadratic transform-based low-rank multi-user beamforming (QTLM) algorithm. Our proposed algorithms exploit the sparsity and low-rank properties of the channel, which has the advantages of light calculation and fast convergence. Based on the universal software radio peripheral devices, we built a complete testbed working at 5.8GHz and implemented all the proposed algorithms to verify the possibility of RIS assisting multi-user systems. Experimental results show that the system has obtained an average spectral efficiency increase of 13.48 bps/Hz, with respective received power gains of 26.6dB and 17.5dB for two users, compared with the case when RIS is powered-off.}

	abstract = {Distributed Antenna Systems (DASs) employ multiple antenna arrays in remote radio units to achieve highly directional transmission and provide great coverage performance for future-generation networks. However, the utilization of fully digital or hybrid active antenna arrays results in a significant increase in hardware costs and power consumption for DAS. To address these issues, integrating DAS with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) offers a viable approach to ensure coverage and transmission performance while maintaining low hardware costs and power consumption. To incorporate the merits of RIS into the DAS from practical consideration, a novel architecture of “Reconfigurable Distributed Antennas and Reflecting Surfaces (RDARS)” is proposed in this paper. Specifically, based on the design of the additional direct-through state together with the existing high-quality fronthaul link, any element of the RDARS can be dynamically programmed to connect with the base station (BS) via fibers and perform the connected mode as remote distributed antennas of the BS to receive or transmit signals. Additionally, RDARS also inherits the low-cost and low-energy-consumption benefits of fully passive RISs by default configuring the elements as passive to perform the reflection mode. As a result, RDARS encompasses both DAS and RIS as special cases, offering flexible control over the trade-off between distribution gain and reflection gain to enhance performance. To unveil the potential of such architecture, the ergodic achievable rate under the RDARS architecture is analyzed and closed-form expression with meaningful insights is derived. The theoretical analysis proves that the RDARS can achieve a higher achievable rate than both DAS and fully passive RIS with the passive beamforming gain provided by elements acting reflection mode while combating the “multiplicative fading” suffered by RISs through the connected mode performed at the RDARS. Simulation results also demonstrate the superiority of the RDARS architecture over DAS and passive RIS-aided systems and its flexible trade-off between performance and cost. To further validate the feasibility and effectiveness, an RDARS prototype with 256 elements is built for real experiments. Experimental results show that the RDARS-aided system with only one element operating in connected mode can achieve an additional 21% and 170% throughput improvement over DAS and RIS-aided systems, respectively.}

	abstract = {It has been proved that a long-range (LoRa) system can achieve long-distance and low-power transmission. However, the performance of LoRa systems can be severely degraded by fading. In addition, LoRa technology typically adopts an ALOHA-based access mechanism, which inevitably produces interfering signals for the target user. To overcome the effects of fading and interference, we introduce a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to LoRa systems. In this context, both non-coherent and coherent detections are considered and their bit error rate (BER) performance analyses are conducted. Moreover, we derive the closed-form BER expressions for the proposed system over Nakagami-m fading channels. Simulation results are used to verify the accuracy of our proposed analytical results. It is shown that in the presence of the interference, the proposed system outperforms RIS-free LoRa systems, and RIS-aided LoRa systems adopting blind transmission. In addition, we also compare the proposed system to single-user RIS-aided LoRa systems adopting blind transmission, and the results show that the proposed system maintains its superior performance even in the presence of the interference. Furthermore, the impacts of the spreading factor (SF), the number of reflecting elements, and the Nakagami-m fading parameters are investigated. It is shown that increasing the number of reflecting elements can remarkably enhance the BER performance, which is an affective measure for the proposed system to balance the trade-off between data rate and coverage range. We further observe that the BER performance of the proposed system is more sensitive to the fading parameter m at high signal-to-noise ratios.}

To that purpose, we first present a pilot-based channel estimation scheme for estimating the direct, cascaded, and forward channels. Next, we utilize the channel estimates to design the optimal beamforming weights at the APs, reflection coefficients at the tags, and reception filters at the reader to maximize the tag sum rate while meeting the tags’ minimum energy requirements. Because the proposed maximization problem is non-convex, we propose a solution based on alternative optimization, fractional programming, and Rayleigh quotient techniques. We also quantify the computational complexity of the developed algorithms. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to validate the proposed channel estimation scheme and optimization framework, as well as the performance of the integration of these two technologies. Our algorithm yields impressive gains compared to the random beamforming/combining benchmark. For example, it achieves ~64.8% and ~253.5% gains in harvested power and tag sum rate, respectively, for 10dBm with 36 APs and 3 tags.}

	abstract = {In wideband sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, the beam squint effect manifests as a substantial degradation in array gain. To mitigate the aforementioned beam squint effect, a hybrid precoding approach leveraging both true-time delay (TTD) and phase shifters (PS) has been proposed. However, existing methods operate under the assumption that the TTD device can generate any desired time delay value. These methods subsequently design the TTD precoder while fixing the PS precoder. This work presents a novel optimization framework for the joint TTD and PS precoder design, incorporating realistic time delay constraints for each TTD device. Unlike previous methods, our framework does not rely on the unbounded time delay assumption and optimizes the TTD and PS values jointly to cope with the practical limitations. Furthermore, within the context of our proposed framework, we mathematically determine the minimum number of TTD devices necessitated to achieve a predetermined target array gain. Simulations confirm the proposed approach exhibits performance improvement, guarantees array gain, and achieves computational efficiency.}

As applications of our repair framework, firstly we present the repair scheme of multiple-node failures for some existing constructions, which only have non-trivial solutions for repairing a single-node failure before.

This work describes and analyzes a sequential decoder for convolutional codes over channels prone to insertion, deletion, and substitution errors. Our decoder expands the code trellis by a new channel-state variable, called drift state, as proposed by Davey and MacKay. A suitable decoding metric on that trellis for sequential decoding is derived, generalizing the original Fano metric. The decoder is also extended to facilitate the simultaneous decoding of multiple received sequences that arise from a single transmitted sequence. Under low-noise environments, our decoding approach reduces the decoding complexity by multiple orders of magnitude compared to Viterbi’s algorithm, albeit at slightly higher bit error rates. An analytical method to determine the computational cutoff rate is also suggested. This analysis is supported by numerical evaluations of bit error rates and computational complexity, compared to optimal Viterbi decoding.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a class of rateless Reed-Solomon (RLRS) codes with near-linear encoding/decoding complexities. Like fountain codes, the RLRS codes can generate a reasonably large number of encoded packets in packet-level transmissions. Furthermore, the RLRS codes are maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that always maintain zero reception overhead. In the proposed RLRS codes, the preservative field extensions are realized through Cantor’s field tower, which avoids searching some quadratic irreducible polynomials as in the prior RLRS codes based on Cauchy generator matrices. Additionally, the proposed RLRS codes are based on Vandermonde generator matrices, whereby the LCH transforms, a variant of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) over binary extension fields, can be employed to reduce the encoding/decoding complexity. To further improve computational efficiency, this paper also proposes a scheduling scheme for the LCH transforms to generate encoded packets on demand, instead of generating packets whose number must be a power of two. Analysis shows that compared to the prior approach, the used field tower leads to a lower speed of computational complexity growth caused by field extensions. In addition, with the total number of source packets to be transmitted being k, analysis shows that the proposed RLRS codes have the encoding/decoding complexity \\mathcal {O}(\\log _{2} k)\nper source packet, superior to \\mathcal {O}(k)\nin the prior approach.}

	abstract = {We consider the uplink of a cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with superimposed pilot (SP) transmission, wherein user equipments (UEs) superimpose low-powered pilots onto data signals. This is unlike regular pilot (RP) transmission, where data and pilots use orthogonal spectral resources. Our CF mMIMO system has hardware impairments which occur due to i) low-quality radio frequency (RF) chains at the access points (APs) and UEs; and ii) dynamic analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture at the APs, which enables each RF chain to be connected to different resolution ADC. We derive a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression for this CF system, wherein UEs observe practical spatially-correlated Rician-faded channels. The derived lower-bound is generic, and reduces to the ones in the existing CF mMIMO SP works, which have only considered ideal hardware. Using this lower-bound, we optimally balance pilot and data transmit powers to maximize the SE. We analytically show that the optimal power balance is insensitive to AP impairments, but sensitive to that of UEs. We numerically show that SP can provide a higher SE than RP for low-to-severe hardware impairment levels, when supported by dynamic ADC architecture at the APs. With low resolution ADCs, RP always outperforms SP. The RP is also shown to be suitable for low UE speeds.}

To reinforce the system communication capability, we propose the frequency offsets permutation index modulation (FOPIM) scheme, which conveys extra information bits by selecting and permutating frequency offsets from a frequency offsets pool. For the system communication function, considering the fact that the traditional maximum likelihood detection method suffers from high complexity and bit error rate (BER), the maximum likelihood-based two-stage detection (MLTSD) approach is presented to overcome this issue. For the system sensing function, we employ the two-step maximum likelihood estimator (TSMLE) to stepwise estimate the angle and range of the interested target. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form expressions for the tight upper bound on the communication BER, along with the sensing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed system exhibits lower BER and superior range resolution than independent MIMO communication and sensing modules.}

However, a major challenge in these systems is the significant overhead incurred by the acquisition of channel state information. This paper proposes a pre-designed beam-based transmission protocol that aims to reduce the burden of pilot overhead by designing a RIS reflective pattern codebook as an alternative to channel estimation (CE). We adopt an electromagnetic-compliant RIS model and develop a theoretical approximate expression for the channel gain, incorporating the impact of location mismatch. This approximation facilitates the construction of a location-based reflective pattern codebook, wherein the chosen locations linked with the codewords represent optimal location sampling points derived from theoretical results. By utilizing the constructed codebook, our proposed transmission protocol enables the system to search reflective patterns instead of real-time optimization. To validate our approach, extensive numerical simulations are conducted. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the approximate channel gain expression and highlight the superior coverage achieved by the proposed location-based reflective pattern codebook as well as the achievable spectral efficiency of our transmission protocol.}

	abstract = {Cooperative hybrid transmit precoder (TP) and receive combiner (RC) design algorithms are conceived for cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, operating in the face of asynchronous interference (ASI). To begin with, a Wiener filtering-based optimal hybrid TP/RC (WHB-U) design is proposed for unicast scenarios that minimizes the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) between the received signal and the desired signal subject to user-specific power constraints. Next, a signal-to-leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) maximization-based hybrid TP/RC design (SHB-U) is conceived, which reduces the interference engendered by the signal transmission targeted towards a specific user, rather than focuses on the interference at a particular user. Next, a multicast transmission scenario is considered, wherein the users belonging to a particular multicast group request identical information. Toward this, the WHB-M and SHB-M hybrid TP/RC schemes are designed for mitigating both the inter-user and inter-group interference. Subsequently, we also develop a Bayesian learning (BL)-based framework for jointly designing the RF and baseband (BB) TPs/RCs for both unicast and multicast scenarios, which does not require the full knowledge of mmWave MIMO channel components. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed TP/RC schemes is extensively evaluated by simulations both in terms of their ability to mitigate the ASI, and the spectral efficiency attained.}

This work investigates RSMA’s application within the context of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for the forthcoming Internet-of-Everything networks. Specifically, we integrate RSMA with a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture to support URLLC demands. Considering the imperfect CSI, attributable to pilot contamination and thermal noise, we derive rigorous lower-bound expressions for the downlink achievable rates. These expressions are applicable to short-packet communication scenarios and RSMA strategy over spatially correlated Rician fading channels. Utilizing these analytical expressions, we perform an exhaustive rate performance evaluation, varying system parameters such as the numbers of pilots, access points (APs), devices, and antennas per AP, alongside different multiple access techniques. Furthermore, we address the power control coefficient design for both common and private streams, framing it as an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted sum-rate and enhancing URLLC service quality. To tackle this non-convex challenge, we introduce a geometric programming-based path-following algorithm, which iteratively converges to the solution. The theoretical underpinnings and the efficacy of the proposed power optimization algorithm are corroborated through extensive simulation results.}

	abstract = {Accurate channel state information is paramount for fully harnessing the benefits of massive antennas in communication systems. However, two primary challenges impede its acquisition. Firstly, conventional far-field assumption-based channel estimation schemes become impractical in near-field dominant future communication systems. In contrast to the far-field assumption, which relies solely on angle-dependent channels, the near-field introduces location-dependency. The second challenge involves limited research on hybrid beamformer design during the channel estimation period, unlike the extensive focus on the data transmission period. To overcome these hurdles, this paper presents a neural network-aided joint optimization of the beamformer and localization function for near-field channel estimation, customized to the specific environment. Inspired by the similarity between operations in a neural network and a signal model, the initial network weights emulate the beamforming matrix during training. Subsequently, these weights are extracted for beamformer design, while the remainder of the network serves as the localization function. Following localization, the location parameters undergo refinement, paving the way for precise channel reconstruction. Unlike prevailing near-field channel estimation methods that solely exploit range information from array response, our approach additionally leverages range-dependent frequency selectivity characteristics. Simulation results prove the adaptability of the proposed beamformer to given environments and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in channel estimation.}

First, optimization problems are formulated to achieve MI Pareto boundary and MMSE Pareto boundary, respectively.

Subsequently, based on unified MI and MMSE performance, we propose Data-dependent alternate algorithm (DDA) to obtain the MI Pareto boundary with colored Gaussian noise. In order to reduce complexity, we propose Data-independent alternate algorithm (DIA) when noise degenerates into white Gaussian noise. Finally, simulation results show DDA almost achieves the MI Pareto boundary with colored Gaussian noise and DIA achieves almost the same performance as DDA with white Gaussian noise at a lower cost to implement.}

	abstract = {Although intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can reconfigure the propagation environment to enhance the performance of both non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), the security remains a key challenge. We design a secure beamforming scheme for IRS-assisted NOMA SWIPT networks in this paper, where the artificial jamming is inserted into NOMA signals by the base station to ensure the network security with the aid of IRS. Specifically, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and jamming vectors, the IRS reflecting matrix and the power splitting ratio to maximize the sum rate, satisfying the rate requirement and energy harvesting threshold for each user. The optimization problem is difficult to be solved directly due to its non-convexity with coupled variables. Thus, we first apply auxiliary variables to reformulate it into a more tractable form, and then decompose it into three subproblems that can be converted into convex ones via successive convex approximation. Finally, we solve them iteratively using an alternating optimization algorithm. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can yield significant improvement in both secrecy performance and energy harvesting efficiency in comparison with benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Wireless ad-hoc networks play a significant role in environments without fixed infrastructure, especially in military and emergency situations. Due to the openness and wide coverage of wireless channel, it is necessary to establish a secure transmission mechanism against potential eavesdroppers. Traditional secure transmission schemes almost rely on single path transmission and physical layer security techniques which may not provide enough secrecy when eavesdroppers are widely distributed. To address this, in this paper, we propose a multipath secure transmission mechanism for the sake of both guaranteeing the transmission security and maximizing the end-to-end throughput. Furthermore, we give the approximated closed-form expressions of multipath secrecy connection probability (SCP) relying on secret sharing, and a novel bilevel optimization problem is formulated with the constraints of the end-to-end delay and the derived SCP. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed mechanism is beneficial concerning secrecy performance in comparison to traditional mechanisms. Also, a near-optimal throughput is obtained.}

	abstract = {We investigate the coexistence of orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation with current fourth- and fifth-generation (4G/5G) communication systems that primarily use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. We first derive the input-output-relation of OTFS in the considered coexisting system. In this derivation, we consider 1) the inclusion of multiple cyclic prefixes (CPs) with unequal lengths to the OTFS signal and 2) edge carrier unloading (ECU), to account for the impacts of CP length, frame structure, and subcarrier arrangement described in 3GPP standards for 4G/5G systems. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of multiple CPs to the OTFS signal and ECU lead to the channel response exhibiting spreading effects/leakage along the Doppler and delay dimensions, respectively. Consequently, the effective sampled delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel model for OTFS in coexisting systems may exhibit reduced sparsity. We also show that the effective DD domain channel coefficients for OTFS in coexisting systems are influenced by the unequal lengths of CPs. Subsequently, we propose an interference cancellation-based channel estimation (CE) technique for OTFS in coexisting systems. Through numerical results, we validate our analysis, highlight the importance of not ignoring the unequal lengths of CPs during signal detection, and show the significance of the proposed CE technique.}

Among them, millimeter wave (mmWave) and edge caching promise to significantly improve the SAGIN performance due to the advantage in rich bandwidth resource and low latency, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the joint caching and resource allocation for multimedia services in SAGIN, where multimedia content requests can be simultaneously served by multiple access points (APs). Considering the delay-constraint of multimedia services, we then formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem aiming at minimizing the service delay, which involves jointly optimizing coded caching (CC), power allocation (PA) and UEs-to-APs association (UA). We propose to find the optimal solution by employing an alternating iteration optimization framework. The optimal CC and PA problems are firstly addressed by utilizing convex optimization technology. Then, two many-to-many swap matching algorithms are developed to slove the UA subproblem effectively. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can substantially reduce the service delay over other benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Coded caching is an effective method to reduce the traffic load on network bottleneck. While the heterogeneities on the number of requests and cache sizes in coded caching have been studied independently, their joint impact is still unclear. This paper investigates coded caching in scenarios with heterogeneous number of requests and cache sizes. We propose two achievable schemes. The first scheme, based on file grouping and multi-round decentralized coded caching, is demonstrated to be order optimal under the worst setting, i.e., when user with the i-th smallest cache has the i-th largest number of requests. Moreover, we obtain an important insight that the lower bound of the achievable rate is predominantly influenced by users with high \\frac {X_{i}}{M_{i}} ratios, where X_{i} and M_{i} represent the number of requests and cache size of user i, respectively. Since the achievable rate of our first scheme is difficult to analyze in the general setting, we further propose the second scheme to derive a tractable upper bound. Based on the insight, the second scheme rearranges the users according to their \\frac {X_{i}}{M_{i}} ratios and employs a threshold to divide them into the head users who may have a large impact on the lower bound, and the tail users who may have a small impact on the lower bound. The server transmits the demands of the head users directly while applying the first scheme in groups among the tail users. Under the general setting, the gap between the rate of our second scheme and the lower bound is proved to be within a logarithmic factor. Simulations are conducted to verify the superior performance of our proposed schemes.}

In this work, we study secure aggregation under gradient sparsification constraints, for resource-limited wireless networks, where only a small fraction of local parameters are aggregated from each user during training (as opposed to the full gradient). We first identify the vulnerabilities of conventional secure aggregation mechanisms under gradient sparsification. We show that conventional mechanisms can reveal sensitive user data when aggregating sparsified gradients, due to the auxiliary coordinate information shared during sparsification, even when the individual gradients are not disclosed in the clear. We then propose TinySecAgg, a novel coordinate-hiding sparsified secure aggregation mechanism to address this challenge, under formal information-theoretic privacy guarantees. Our framework reduces the communication overhead of conventional secure aggregation baselines by an order of magnitude (up to 22.5\\times ) without compromising model accuracy.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive semantic resource allocation paradigm with semantic-bit quantization (SBQ) compatible with existing wireless communications, where the inaccurate environment perception introduced by the additional mapping relationship between semantic metrics and transmission metrics is solved. Specifically, SBQ is a hybrid uniform-non-uniform quantization method, which aims to facilitate the coding between semantics and bits. In order to investigate the performance of semantic communication networks, the quality of service for semantic communication (SC-QoS), including the semantic quantization efficiency (SQE) and transmission latency, is proposed for the first time. A problem of maximizing the overall effective SC-QoS is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of the base station, the bits for semantic representation, the subchannel assignment, and the bandwidth resource allocation. To address the non-convex formulated problem, an intelligent resource allocation scheme is proposed based on a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, where the intelligent agent can perceive both semantic tasks and dynamic wireless environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our design can effectively combat semantic noise and achieve superior performance in wireless communications compared to several benchmark schemes. Furthermore, compared to mapping-guided paradigm based resource allocation schemes, our proposed adaptive scheme can achieve up to 13% performance improvement in terms of SC-QoS.}

	abstract = {In next-generation communications, sub-6GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) links typically coexist, with the sub-6GHz link always active and the mmWave link active when high-rate transmission is required. Due to the spatial similarities between sub-6GHz and mmWave channels, sub-6GHz channel information can be utilized to support hybrid beamforming in mmWave communications to reduce overhead costs. We consider a multi-cell heterogeneous communication network where both sub-6GHz and mmWave communications co-exist. Multiple mmWave base stations (BSs) in the heterogeneous network simultaneously transmit signals to multiple users in their own mmWave cells while interfering with each other. The challenging problem is to design hybrid beamformers in the mmWave band that can maximize the system spectral efficiency. To address this highly complex programming using sub-6GHz information, a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) architecture is proposed to learn the intrinsic relationship between sub-6GHz and mmWave and design the hybrid beamformers for mmWave BSs. The proposed HGNN consists of two different node types, namely, BS nodes and user equipment (UE) nodes, and two different edge types, namely, desired link edge and interfering link edge. In addition, the attention mechanism and the residual structure are utilized in the HGNN architecture to improve the performance. Simulation results show that the proposed HGNN can successfully achieve better performances with sub-6GHz information than traditional learning methods. The results also demonstrate that the attention mechanism and residual structure improve the performances of the HGNN compared to its unmodified counterparts.}

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligence bandwidth decisions that reduce latency in optical access networks. Even though RL drives model-free self-adaptive bandwidth decisions, the learning time cost and the widely-known exploration-exploitation dilemma of when to apply the best decision learnt are challenging to address in the bandwidth decision context. This paper for the first time explores how to rapidly learn an optimal bandwidth decision with a known confidence level of the decision for minimizing optical access network latency. We investigate critical aspects, including reward acquisition and strategies to explore decisions, in an RL-based bandwidth allocation scheme. Applying renewal theory, we address the timing for the central office (CO) to acquire rewards from optical network units for accurate decision value evaluation. Further, we derive the relationship between the decision practice times and the confidence of the optimal decision in closed-form. A reward variance-oriented (RVO) exploration strategy is proposed, in which the CO selects bandwidth decisions with probabilities proportional to the reward variances. We prove that the RVO is the most time efficient in learning an optimal decision with a confidence guarantee. With numerical and extensive simulations, we validate the theory and compare several common strategies with the RVO.}

	abstract = {Modulation scheme and power control simultaneously impact the performance of integrated data and energy transfer (IDET). Therefore, some efforts have been invested in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to realize adaptive modulation (AM) and adaptive power control (APC), in order to achieve long-term performance improvement. However, the optimal DRL algorithm design for the long-term performance optimization having long-term constraints is still a challenge, while the optimal patterns of IDET-oriented joint AM and APC are not fully understood. This paper aims to maximize the long-term performance of energy harvesting (EH), while satisfying the long-term constraints of spectrum efficiency, bit-error-rate and transmit power, by jointly optimizing the modulation selection and transmit power allocation. Then, a novel DRL algorithm, named constrained parameterized action deep deterministic policy gradient (C-PADDPG), is proposed to find the feasible policy of joint AM and APC for the transformed constraint satisfaction problem. Meanwhile, the optimal policy is searched for via bisection method. Simulation results demonstrate that our solution can achieve significant gain on the long-term EH performance, compared to the traditional genetic algorithm-based solution and other DRL benchmark. Moreover, the communication-efficient and EH-efficient patterns of joint AM and APC generated by the C-PADDPG algorithm are explicitly illustrated and analyzed.}

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of imperfect communication channels on decentralized federated learning (D-FL) and subsequently determines the optimal number of local aggregations per training round, adapting to the network topology and imperfect channels. We start by deriving the bias of locally aggregated D-FL models under imperfect channels from the ideal global models requiring perfect channels and aggregations. The bias reveals that excessive local aggregations can accumulate communication errors and degrade convergence. Another important aspect is that we analyze a convergence upper bound of D-FL based on the bias. By minimizing the bound, the optimal number of local aggregations is identified to balance a trade-off with accumulation of communication errors in the absence of knowledge of the channels. With this knowledge, the impact of communication errors can be alleviated, allowing the convergence upper bound to decrease throughout aggregations. Experiments validate our convergence analysis and also identify the optimal number of local aggregations on two widely considered image classification tasks. It is seen that D-FL, with an optimal number of local aggregations, can outperform its potential alternatives by over 10% in training accuracy.}

	abstract = {Joint source and channel coding (JSCC) has attracted increasing attention in semantic communications. However, JSCC is vulnerable to privacy issues due to the high relevance between the source image and channel input. In this paper, we propose a disentangled information bottleneck guided privacy-protective JSCC (DPJSCC) for image transmission, which aims at protecting private information and achieving superior image transmission performance. In particular, we propose a disentangled information bottleneck objective to compress the private information in public subcodewords and improve the reconstruction quality simultaneously. To optimize JSCC neural networks using the proposed objective, we derive a differentiable estimation based on variational approximation and the density-ratio trick. Additionally, we design a password-based privacy-protective algorithm that encrypts the private subcodewords, achieving joint optimization with JSCC neural networks. The proposed algorithm involves an encryptor for encrypting private information and a decryptor for recovering it at the legitimate receiver. A loss function is derived based on the maximum entropy principle for jointly training the encryptor, decryptor, and JSCC decoder to maximize eavesdropping uncertainty and improve reconstruction quality. Experimental results show that DPJSCC reduces eavesdropping accuracy on private information by up to 18% and decreases inference time by 10%.}

	abstract = {Despite the success of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in radio-resource management within multi-cell wireless networks, applying it to power allocation in ultra-dense 5G and beyond networks poses challenges. While existing multi-agent DRL-based methods often adopt a fully centralized approach, they often overlook communication overhead costs. In this paper, we model a multi-cell network as a collaborative multi-agent DRL system, implementing a centralized training-decentralized execution approach for accurate and real-time decision-making, thereby eliminating communication overhead during execution. We carefully design the DRL agents’ input observations, actions, and rewards to address potential impractical power allocation policies in multi-carrier systems and ensure strict compliance with transmit power constraints. Through extensive simulations, we assess the sensitivity of the proposed DRL-based power allocation to various exploration methods and system parameters. Results indicate superior performance of DRL-based power allocation with continuous action space in complex network environments. Conversely, simpler network settings with fewer subcarriers and users require fewer power allocation actions, ensuring rapid convergence. By leveraging a fast exploration rate, DRL-based power allocation with discrete action space outperforms conventional algorithms, achieving a 36% relative sum rate increase within 60,000 training episodes.}

In this context, we propose a bitwise end-to-end design for polar coded IDEN systems, where the conventional encoding/decoding, modulation/demodulation, and energy harvesting modules are replaced by the neural networks (NNs). In this way, the entire system can be treated as an AutoEncoder (AE) and trained in an end-to-end manner. Hence achieving global optimization. Additionally, we improve the common NN-based belief propagation (BP) decoder by adding an extra hypernetwork, which generates the corresponding NN weights for the main network under different number of iterations, thus the adaptability of the receiver architecture can be further enhanced. Our numerical results demonstrate that our BP-based end-to-end design is superior to conventional BP-based counterparts in terms of both the BER and power transfer, but it is inferior to the successive cancellation list (SCL)-based conventional IDEN system, which may be due to the inherent performance gap between the BP and SCL decoders.}

	abstract = {We consider a fully-connected wireless gossip network which consists of a source and n receiver nodes. The source updates itself with a Poisson process and also sends updates to the nodes as Poisson arrivals. Upon receiving the updates, the nodes update their knowledge about the source. The nodes gossip the data among themselves in the form of Poisson arrivals to disperse their knowledge about the source. The total gossiping rate is bounded by a constraint. The goal of the network is to be as timely as possible with the source. We propose a scheme which we coin age sense updating multiple access in networks (ASUMAN), which is a distributed opportunistic gossiping scheme, where after each time the source updates itself, each node waits for a time proportional to its current age and broadcasts a signal to the other nodes of the network. This allows the nodes in the network which have higher age to remain silent and only the low-age nodes to gossip, thus utilizing a significant portion of the constrained total gossip rate. We calculate the average age for a typical node in such a network with symmetric settings, and show that the theoretical upper bound on the age scales as $O(1)$ . ASUMAN, with an average age of $O(1)$ , offers significant gains compared to a system where the nodes just gossip blindly with a fixed update rate, in which case the age scales as $O(\\log n)$ . Further, we show that this $O(1)$ age performance is sustained if a network has only a fraction of fully-connected edges. However, if the nodes have finite $O(1)$ connectivity, e.g., ring networks, two-dimensional grids, we show that ASUMAN scheme underperforms uniform gossiping, pointing to the need for connectivity with opportunistic gossiping. We improve this performance by introducing a hierarchical structure in the network, which recovers $O(1)$ age scaling under $O(\\sqrt {n})$ connected networks. Further, we show how the age of the nodes scale when the cluster heads are finitely connected among themselves, e.g., $O(c)$ age scaling for disconnected and $O(\\sqrt {c})$ age scaling for ring-connected cluster heads, where c is the number of clusters. Finally, we show that the $O(1)$ age scaling can be extended to asymmetric settings as well. We give an example of power law arrivals, where nodes’ ages scale differently but follow the $O(1)$ bound.}

	abstract = {Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LEO-SNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for future space information networks. However, the time-varying topology, link intermittency, limited onboard resource and relatively long transmission distance imposed unprecedented challenges on guaranteeing the delay Quality of Service (QoS). In contrast with existing routing-based or resource optimization-based solutions, onboard processing provides an alternative way to reduce the transmission delay by dwindling the transmitted data size. The employment of onboard processing makes it critical to select a routing path with sufficient energy and properly allocate resources for transmission and processing. This paper studies the untouched onboard processing aided transmission delay minimization problem of LEO-SNs. A Distributed Network State Learning (DNSL) mechanism is proposed for synchronizing the network states, which induces Potential Field (PF) to model both the attraction of resources and the repulsion of transmission load. By jointly considering the channel conditions, onboard resources and transmission load, a Deep Q-network (DQN) based Intelligent In-orbit Routing (DIIR) algorithm is proposed for selecting a routing path with good channel conditions, sufficient energy and low transmission load to facilitate onboard processing. Moreover, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based Intelligent Resource Allocation (DIRA) algorithm is provided to achieve intelligent and continuous resource allocation for exploiting onboard processing to minimize the transmission delay, while the resource and load states of satellites on the routing path are taken into consideration by including PF as an input. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that employing onboard processing with the proposed DIIR and DIRA algorithms significantly reduces the average transmission delay and packet loss rate.}

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) based flying ad-hoc network (FANET) routing enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to choose the next-hop to increase the packet delivery ratio, but the routing latency and energy consumption have to be further reduced over inaccurate feedback for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose an RL based energy-efficient fast routing for each UAV to choose the forwarding decision and the power. Based on the state consisting of the battery level, channel conditions and forwarding decisions of the one-hop neighbors, the routing policy is chosen to enhance the utility as the weighted sum of the delivery success indicator, the latency and the energy consumption. The number of the latency violations and the learning parameters shared among the one-hop neighbors are exploited in the update of the routing policy distribution following the latency constraint with the reduced energy consumption. The deep neural networks address the state quantization error of the latency and the channel gain for UAVs with high mobility under large-scale networks. The performance bound regarding the end-to-end latency and the energy consumption is derived in terms of network topology and channel gain based on the packet forwarding game. The performance gain over the benchmark is provided via both simulation and experimental results.}

Due to the online nature of task generation and edge capacity bottleneck, a fundamental challenge for the MEC network is how to optimally schedule the tasks and resources in face of uncertain future arrivals. To this end, we propose a competitive algorithm named EdgeOPT for online parallel task scheduling aiming to maximize the cumulative reward of completed tasks subject to their hard deadlines. The algorithm leverages an adaptive threshold structure at each server to schedule tasks with different demand patterns based on the status of the system and all active users, while incorporating a subroutine for efficient resource allocations. We prove a bounded competitive ratio for EdgeOPT when scheduling monolithic tasks, and propose its extended version to schedule chains of dependent functions. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposal compared to all the baselines.}

Using redundant devices to update the status of interest is a promising method to improve the timeliness of information. However, parallel status updating leads to out-of-order arrivals at the monitor, significantly challenging timeliness analysis. This work studies the Age of Information (AoI) of a multi-queue status update system where multiple devices monitor the same physical process. Specifically, two systems are considered: the Basic System, which only has type-1 devices that are ad hoc devices located close to the source, and the Hybrid System, which contains additional type-2 devices that are infrastructure-based devices located in fixed points compared to the Basic System. Using the Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) framework, a mathematical model that combines discrete and continuous dynamics, we derive the expressions of the average AoI of the considered two systems in closed form. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis. It is shown that when the number and parameters of the type-1 devices/type-2 devices are fixed, the logarithm of average AoI will linearly decrease with the logarithm of the total arrival rate of type-2 devices or that of the number of type-1 devices under specific condition. It has also been demonstrated that the proposed systems can significantly outperform the FCFS M/M/N status update system.}

	abstract = {Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) have been proposed to achieve high data rates and energy efficiency, but their performance is limited by the increase of inter-user interference. To overcome this problem, interference alignment (IA) algorithms have been widely researched. However, reported IA techniques neglect the nonlinear distortion (NLD) induced by power amplifiers. Thus, their performance is severely degraded in power-efficient transmissions operating close to the saturation point. Distortion-aware precoding techniques have been studied to reduce NLD in single transmitter scenarios either single-user or multi-user. Nevertheless, its extension to UDNs with multiple transmitters and users is not straightforward. In this work, a novel IA algorithm, named NLD-IA, is proposed to alternatively design the precoding and combining vectors to reduce the interference and NLD by maximizing the sum-rate through the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Precoding vectors are obtained via a non-convex optimization problem that models the NLD correlation. An analytical solution based on the Newton method over the complex field is developed to solve this problem with low computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed NLD-IA significantly reduces interference and NLD outperforming previous IA algorithms. The proposed method is an attractive solution for UDNs commonly found in the context of Internet of Things applications.}

	abstract = {Deep learning based channel state information (CSI) acquisition and feedback in frequency division duplex systems have drawn much attention in the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless systems. In this paper, we focus on exploiting the CSI codebook in B5G wireless standards with deep learning to enhance the performance of CSI acquisition and feedback. Specifically, the angular-delay-domain partial reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels is considered, and part of angular-delay-domain ports are selected for measuring and feeding back the downlink CSI, where the performance of the conventional deep learning methods is limited due to the deficiency of sparse structures. To address this issue, we propose the new paradigm of adopting deep learning to improve the performance of CSI codebook. Firstly, considering the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of uplink channels, deep learning is utilized to refine the selection of the dominant angular-delay-domain ports, where the focal loss is harnessed to solve the class imbalance problem. Secondly, we propose to reconstruct the downlink CSI by way of deep learning based on the feedback of CSI codebook at the base station, where the information of sparse structures can be effectively leveraged. Finally, a weighted shortcut module is designed to facilitate the accurate reconstruction, and a two-stage loss function with the combination of the mean squared error and sum rate is proposed for adapting to actual multi-user scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed angular-delay-domain port selection and CSI reconstruction paradigm can improve the sum rate performance by more than 10% compared with the standard CSI codebook and traditional deep learning benchmarks.}

However, given the high hardware cost and excessive power consumption of massive MIMO systems, as a remedy, intelligent metasurfaces have been designed for efficient holographic MIMO (HMIMO) systems. In this paper, we propose a HMIMO architecture based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) for the uplink of cell-free systems, where the SIM is employed at the access points (APs) for improving the spectral- and energy-efficiency. Specifically, we conceive distributed beamforming for SIM-assisted cell-free networks, where both the SIM coefficients and the local receiver combiner vectors of each AP are optimized based on the local channel state information (CSI) for the local detection of each user equipment (UE) information. Afterward, the central processing unit (CPU) fuses the local detections gleaned from all APs to detect the aggregate multi-user signal. Specifically, to design the SIM coefficients and the combining vectors of the APs, a low-complexity layer-by-layer iterative optimization algorithm is proposed for maximizing the equivalent gain of the channel spanning from the UEs to the APs. At the CPU, the weight vector used for combining the local detections from all APs is designed based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, where the hardware impairments (HWIs) are also taken into consideration based on their statistics. The simulation results show that the SIM-based HMIMO outperforms the conventional single-layer HMIMO in terms of the achievable rate. We demonstrate that both the HWI of the radio frequency (RF) chains at the APs and the UEs limit the achievable rate in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region.}

	abstract = {One of the main challenges that the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will encounter is the necessity to design sophisticated multiple access techniques that besides being capable of supporting massive connectivity, they can also fulfill the heterogeneous requirements of 6G services, namely further-enhanced mobile broadband (feMBB), extremely reliable and low-latency communication, and ultra-massive machine-type communication (umMTC). To this end, this work investigates the coexistence of multiple feMBB and umMTC wireless sources in a network. In order to enhance the achievable connectivity, each orthogonal resource block of the network is assigned to one feMBB and multiple umMTC sources. FeMBB sources are assumed to constantly transmit, while umMTC are considered to access the network in a probabilistic manner. If more than one umMTC sources attempt to access the network in a given resource block, no umMTC transmission is permitted, however, when precisely one umMTC source endeavors to access the medium, rate-splitting multiple access is employed to concurrently serve both feMBB and umMTC transmissions. For such a communication scenario, we derive novel closed-form expressions for sources’ outage probabilities (OPs), ergodic rates (ERs), system throughput, and ergodic sum rate under both the ideal case of perfect channel state information (pCSI) and perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC) and the more realistic scenario of imperfect CSI (ipCSI) and imperfect SIC (ipSIC). Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio analysis is provided revealing deeper insights for sources’ asymptotic behavior under all considered cases. Simulation results corroborate the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions, investigate the impact of different system parameters on sources’ OP and ER performance, and illustrate the detrimental impact of ipCSI and ipSIC on system performance compared to the ideal case of pCSI and pSIC.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an efficient near-field channel estimation algorithm, and a novel cascade channel reconstruction scheme, with significantly reduced pilot overhead and computational complexity, are proposed for hybrid extra large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS)-aided multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. A unique hybrid XL-RIS architecture is devised, in which the elements at the designed central subarray, and many specially selected discrete elements, are active, while others are passive. Meanwhile, a damped Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm combining the planar and spherical wave models (DNOMP-CPSW) is proposed, in which the angle and distance parameters of multipaths are estimated through the received signals of the central subarray and the discrete active elements respectively, and the near-field channel can be reconstructed accurately with low pilot overhead and computational complexity. Moreover, to decrease the cost of cascade channel reconstruction in the considered system, a separate channel estimation scheme based on the decoupling operation (SCEDO) is proposed, which estimates the two separate channels with only 3 pilots and reduced computational complexity, and then reconstruct the cascade channel. Furthermore, the phase shift strategy of the XL-RIS with 2-bits quantization is devised, which can increase the energy of the received signal and maintain the set order to estimate multipaths in different stages of the SCEDO scheme, to improve the accuracy of the estimates, and enhance the reliability of the separate channel estimation. Simulation results verify that the proposed DNOMP-CPSW algorithm and the hybrid XL-RIS phase shift strategy can enhance the performance of the considered system. Compared with other schemes, the SCEDO scheme can reconstruct the cascade channel efficiently, with much reduced pilot overhead and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC), which combines mobile edge computing (MEC) and wireless power transfer (WPT), is a promising paradigm for coping with the computing power and energy constraints of wireless devices. However, how to realize the online optimal offloading decision and resource allocation in the WP-MEC system is very challenging. This paper studies the system computation completion time (SCCT) minimization problems for WP-MEC networks using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication under binary and partial offloading modes. Due to the complexity of the optimization problems and the time-varying nature of the channel state information, we decouple the original problems into a top-problem of optimizing WPT duration and a sub-problem of optimizing resource allocation, and then propose a convolutional deep reinforcement learning online (CDRO) algorithm. For the top-problem, a deep reinforcement learning framework is used to obtain the near-optimal WPT duration, and an incremental exploration policy is designed to balance the exploration accuracy and exploration range to improve the convergence performance of the CDRO algorithm. For the sub-problems, we propose their corresponding low-complexity algorithms based on in-depth analysis and derivation of the optimal offloading decision’s properties. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed CDRO algorithm achieves near-optimal SCCT with low computational complexity, enabling online decision-making in time-varying channel environments.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a prospective receiving hybrid beamforming structure consisting of several radio frequency (RF) chains and abundant antenna elements in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Due to conventional costly full connections, we design an enhanced partially connected beamformer employing a low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based structure. As a benefit of the LDPC-based structure, information can be exchanged among clustered RF/antenna groups, which results in a low computational complexity order. Advanced message passing (MP) capable of inferring and transferring information among different paths is designed to support the LDPC-based hybrid beamformer. We propose a message-passing enhanced antenna and RF chain selection (MARS) scheme for minimizing the operational power of antennas and RF chains of the receiver as well as hybrid beamforming. Furthermore, sequential and parallel MP schemes for MARS are designed, namely, MARS-S and MARS-P, respectively, to address the convergence speed issue. A heuristic genetic algorithm is designed for receiving hybrid beamforming, comprising gene generation initialization, elite selection, crossover, and mutation. Simulations validate the convergence of both the MARS-P and the MARS-S algorithms. Due to the asynchronous information transfer of MARS-P, it requires higher power than MARS-S, which strikes a compelling balance among power consumption, convergence, and computational complexity. It is also demonstrated that the proposed MARS scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks using the heuristic method of fully/partially connected architectures in the open literature by requiring the lowest power and realizing the highest energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {Network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free (CF) network emerges as a promising solution for enabling massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC). In the massive Internet-of-Things (mIoT) scenarios where users’ active statuses change, the existing NAFD resource scheduling schemes require frequent invocation of optimization algorithms, causing significant energy loss and operational delays. So they are not conducive to mURLLC. This paper proposes a dual time-scale resource scheduling scheme, which combines the improved long-term AP duplex mode optimization method with the short-term power allocation optimization method to further enhance the mURLLC ability of NAFD CF networks. In the proposed long-term AP duplex mode optimization method, we first derive the closed-form expressions of active users’ time overflow (TO) probability as the service latency indicator. Operating on a superframe as a large time-scale unit, the improved long-term AP duplex mode optimization method initially employs a long-term active user prediction algorithm to forecast active users in an upcoming superframe and then leverages the long-term AP duplex mode optimization algorithm based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to achieve optimal long-term AP mode selection which minimizes the TO probability. In the proposed short-term power allocation optimization method, we design a heuristic algorithm to ensure active users in each coherence time can receive high-reliable and low-latency service. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Compared with the short-term AP mode and power joint optimization methods, the dual time-scale resource scheduling scheme achieves similar spectral efficiency and a much lower TO probability, while also avoiding the frequent AP mode optimization and switching, making it more suitable for mURLLC.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted index modulation system schemes are considered to be a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, which can enhance various system capabilities such as coverage and reliability. However, obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is challenging due to the lack of a radio frequency chain in RIS. In this paper, we investigate the RIS-assisted full-duplex (FD) two-way space shift keying (SSK) system under imperfect CSI, where the signal emissions are augmented by deploying RISs in the vicinity of two FD users. The maximum likelihood detector is utilized to recover the transmit antenna index. With this in mind, we derive closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) expression based on the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ) method, and provide the upper bound and asymptotic ABEP expressions in the presence of channel estimation errors. To gain more insights, we also derive the outage probability and provide the throughput of the proposed scheme with imperfect CSI. The correctness of the analytical derivation results is confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated that increasing the number of elements of RIS can significantly improve the ABEP performance of the FD system over the half-duplex (HD) system. Furthermore, in the high SNR region, the ABEP performance of the FD system is better than that of the HD system.}

	abstract = {To combine the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, it is required to ensure the successful successive interference cancellation procedure. Because of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT employed at the OFDM transceivers, the central user may have weak subcarriers and the cell-edge user may have strong subcarriers. In this paper, we propose that for the central or cell-edge user, signals over the weak (strong) subcarriers are jointly encoded and decoded. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum average achievable rates at both the central and cell-edge users through power allocation optimization. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a constrained convex-concave procedure (CCCP) based locally optimal solution, a Lagrangian dual transformation based locally optimal solution, and a prime decomposition based near-optimal solution. The prime decomposition based algorithm, which solves the problem based on water-filling, has extremely low computational complexity. It is shown through simulation results that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional OFDM-NOMA scheme. Furthermore, it is found that the results obtained by the CCCP based solution, Lagrangian dual transformation based solution, and prime decomposition based solution match one another.}

To evaluate the overall system transmission reliability, we derive a tight lower bound of the coexistence outage probability (COP), where an imperfect/realistic successive interference cancellation (SIC) is considered. It is shown analytically that the error floor of the COP in both the near field and far field coverages would appear as long as the residual interference due to SIC is non-negligible, resulting in a diversity order of zero. Such an error floor is mainly dominated by the residual interference parameters, the decoding thresholds, and the power allocation ratios. More importantly, unlike the Gamma approximation approach, the adopted Laplace approach can capture the true diversity order with perfect SIC in the near-field/far-field coverage, which is dominated by the bottleneck number of the STAR-RIS elements belonging to the EP and BD zones, regardless of the dual-hop channel statistics. In addition, it is shown that the COP performance improves with either the quantification order or the concentration parameter of the imperfect channel state information.}

To address two aforementioned issues, a non-orthogonal multiple access-assisted ISAC (NOMA-ISAC) scheme is first proposed in this paper, which can simultaneously perform the sensing and communication tasks on shared radio resource, significantly improving spectral efficiency while mitigating mutual interference. Furthermore, in order to provide a unified metric to simplify the performance analysis in ISAC systems, we extend the definition of the outage probability from a mean square error (MSE) perspective. Then based on the built framework, the tractable expressions of the outage probability are derived for both communication and sensing tasks to evaluate the performance of our proposed NOMA-ISAC scheme and the conventional orthogonal radio resource-based ISAC (OR-ISAC) scheme. Next, the asymptotic outage probability comparisons are carried out to show that the NOMA-ISAC scheme can achieve better performance than the OR-ISAC scheme. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the analytical derivations, and also demonstrate the robustness and performance gains of our proposed NOMA-ISAC scheme over OR-ISAC scheme.}

This paper considers the effects of visibility region (VR) at the base station (BS) in a non-stationary multi-user XL-MIMO scenario, where only partial antennas can receive users’ signal. In time division duplexing (TDD) mode, we first estimate the VR at the BS by detecting the energy of the received signal during uplink training phase. The probabilities of two detection errors are derived and the uplink channel on the detected VR is estimated. In downlink data transmission, to avoid cumbersome Monte-Carlo trials, we derive a deterministic approximate expression for ergodic average energy efficiency (EE) with the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. In frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode, the VR is estimated in uplink training and then the channel information of detected VR is acquired from the feedback channel. In downlink data transmission, the approximation of ergodic average EE is also derived with the RZF precoding. Invoking approximate results, we propose an alternate optimization algorithm to design the detection threshold and the pilot length in both TDD and FDD modes. The numerical results reveal the impacts of VR estimation error on ergodic average EE and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.}

This work shows the importance of downlink pilots transmitted by the APs, which are used by the UEs to first estimate the instantaneous downlink channel state information (CSI), and then perform cache-aided MUI cancellation. We derive a closed-form SE expression for this system by considering practical spatially-correlated Rician fading channels with phase shifts, pilot contamination, and hardware impairments, both at the APs and UEs. We also propose a joint cache placement and power control optimization to maximize the global energy efficiency (GEE) metric. The cache placement problem is solved via clustering, while the power is optimized by designing a novel low-complexity parallel block minorization-maximization optimization. We numerically validate the benefits of downlink CSI for cache-aided CF mMIMO systems, and also show that degradation in CSI quality dramatically negates the UEs cache-aided MUI cancellation capability. We also show that the proposed optimization yields the same GEE as existing state-of-the-art optimizations, but with a much lower complexity.}

	abstract = {Underwater covert communication (UCC) technology can prevent legitimate transmission from being intercepted upon by potential eavesdroppers while ensuring a certain rate at the receiver under the condition of underwater acoustic channels. Previous studies have focused on UCC designs that rely on fixed transmitters and receivers, with limited attention given to dynamic moving senders, such as the widely-used autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Therefore, the establishment of a secure link between the mobile AUV and the receiver remains unexplored. In this paper, we construct an AUV-aided UCC architecture. Specifically, leveraging the unique characteristics of the underwater environment i.e., time-variant channel, severe attenuation, and ambient noise, the AUV plans its trajectory from the settled start point to the destination, adjusting its transmission power for covert communications. Accounting for both green energy consumption and communication security, we develop a novel multi-objective deep deterministic policy gradient (MODDPG) framework for jointly optimizing AUV’s diving energy consumption as well as effective throughput under the covertness constraint. Moreover, we propose an active-trust mechanism at the receiving side to pose an extra safe guard. To handle this, an evolutionary game model between the receiver and eavesdropper is built. Simulations and numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve a Pareto-optimal solution for covert communications with rapid convergence speed. The evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) enables the receiver to attain superior benefits and security compared to other strategies.}

	abstract = {We analyze the uplink performance of a distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture in which the remotely located access points (APs) are connected to a central processing unit via a fiber-optical fronthaul carrying a dithered and 1-bit quantized version of the received radio-frequency (RF) signal. The innovative feature of the proposed architecture is that no down-conversion is performed at the APs. This eliminates the need to equip the APs with local oscillators, which may be difficult to synchronize. Under the assumption that a constraint is imposed on the amount of data that can be exchanged across the fiber-optical fronthaul, we investigate the tradeoff between spatial oversampling, defined in terms of the total number of APs, and temporal oversampling, defined in terms of the oversampling factor selected at the central processing unit, to facilitate the recovery of the transmitted signal from 1-bit samples of the RF received signal. Using the so-called error-vector magnitude (EVM) as performance metric, we shed light on the optimal design of the dither signal, and quantify, for a given number of APs, the minimum fronthaul rate required for our proposed distributed massive MIMO architecture to outperform a standard co-located massive MIMO architecture in terms of EVM.}

The design of these codes starts from simplex codes, defined by parity-check matrices having a simple form stemming from the coefficients of a primitive polynomial. For this reason, we call the new codes Primitive Rate-Compatible LDPC (PRC-LDPC) codes. By applying puncturing to these codes, we obtain a bit-level granularity of the code rate. We show that, in order to achieve good LDPC codes, the underlying polynomials, besides being primitive, must meet some more stringent conditions with respect to those of classical punctured simplex codes. We leverage non-modular Golomb rulers to take these new requirements into account. We characterize the minimum distance properties of PRC-LDPC codes, and study and discuss their encoding and decoding complexity. Finally, we assess the error rate performance of high rate PRC-LDPC codes under iterative decoding.}

Such a scenario arises naturally in quantum communications, where information bits become useless after a certain time. Trailing the capacity results obtained recently for certain queue-channels, this paper aims to construct practical channel codes for the erasure queue-channel (EQC)—a channel characterized by highly correlated erasures, governed by the underlying queuing dynamics. Our main contributions in this paper are twofold: (i) We propose a generic ‘wrapper’ based on interleaving across renewal blocks of the queue to convert any capacity-achieving code for a memoryless erasure channel to a capacity-achieving code for the EQC. Next, due to the complexity involved in implementing interleaved systems, (ii) we study the performance of LDPC and Polar codes without any interleaving. Motivated by the empirical performance, we show that standard Arıkan’s Polar transform polarizes the M/M/1 EQC.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided index modulation (IM) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications. However, acquiring channel state information (CSI) for RIS-based IM requires expensive pilot overhead, especially for the IM in multiple domains. In this paper, a novel rectangular differential reflecting spatial modulation (RDRSM) system is proposed for the RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Specifically, the proposed multi-antenna-activated RDRSM (M-RDRSM) scheme utilizes a rectangular dispersion matrix (DM) to jointly map a digital beamforming (DBF) weight vector and a RIS reflection pattern to perform the rectangular differential modulation. A thorough analysis presents that the proposed M-RDRSM scheme can achieve high-spectral efficiency, low complexity of the system, and noncoherent decoding without prior knowledge of CSI in the space-reflection dual-domain IM. Further, the proposed M-RDRSM scheme is simplified to a single-antenna-activated RDRSM (S-RDRSM) scheme, which can reduce the hardware cost and avoid the inter-antenna synchronization problem more effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RDRSM scheme performs better in terms of bit error rate performance and achieve a lower decoding complexity than the existing correlated differential IM schemes with the same achievable spectral efficiency.}

We formulate a max-min security EE optimization problem by jointly designing the distributed active beamforming and artificial noise at base stations as well as the passive beamforming at RISs under practical constraints. To deal with it, we first divide the original optimization problem into two sub-ones, and then propose an iterative optimization algorithm to solve each sub-problem based on the fractional programming, constrained concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and semi-definite programming (SDP) techniques. After that, these two sub-problems are alternatively solved until convergence, and the final solutions are obtained. Next, we extend to the imperfect channel state information of the Eves’ links, and investigate the robust security EE beamforming optimization problem by bringing the outage probability constraints. Based on this, we first transform the uncertain outage probability constraints into the certain ones by the Bernstein-type inequality and sphere boundary techniques, and then propose an alternatively iterative algorithm to obtain the solutions of the original problem based on the S-procedure, successive convex approximation, CCCP, and SDP techniques. Finally, the simulation results are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) were introduced to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems. However, from a service provider’s viewpoint, a concern with the use of an IRS is its effect on out-of-band (OOB) quality of service. Specifically, if two operators, say X and Y, provide services in a given geographical area using non-overlapping frequency bands, and if operator X uses an IRS to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of its users (UEs), does it degrade the performance of UEs served by operator Y? We answer this by analyzing the average and instantaneous performances of the OOB operator considering both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Specifically, we derive the ergodic sum-SE achieved by the operators under round-robin scheduling. We also derive the outage probability and analyze the change in the SNR caused by the IRS at an OOB UE, using stochastic dominance theory. Surprisingly, even though the IRS is randomly configured from operator Y’s point of view, the OOB operator still benefits from the presence of the IRS, witnessing a performance enhancement for free in both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. This is because the IRS introduces additional paths between the transmitter and receiver, increasing the overall signal power arriving at the UE and providing diversity benefits. Finally, we show that the use of opportunistic scheduling schemes can further enhance the benefit of the uncontrolled IRS at OOB UEs. We numerically illustrate our findings and conclude that an IRS is always beneficial to every operator, even when the IRS is deployed & controlled by only one operator.}

The primary objective is to achieve high data-rate and spectral efficiency transmissions. In this system, a joint mapping scheme for time slots is utilized to convey additional information bits. Chaotic signals and their Hilbert transforms are transmitted separately during unselected and selected time slots. The transmitted signals are expanded by employing discrete W vectors, with the indices of these vectors conveying extra information bits, thereby enhancing data rate and bit error rate (BER) performance. Noise reduction techniques are applied to further enhance BER performance. Theoretical BER expressions are formulated for the JTCDWT-DMIM-DCSK system in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Additionally, the paper provides an analysis of the system’s data rate, spectral efficiency, and complexity compared to advanced competitors. Simulation results validate the correctness of the theoretical derivations and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system. Overall, the JTCDWT-DMIM-DCSK system holds promise as a cost-effective solution for wireless communications.}

An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average AoI by optimizing each mobile device’s probability of contending for channel access opportunity and the threshold of offload rate. We derive the exact expression of the average AoI and generate a reformulated optimization problem. Although being non-convex, the reformulated problem is tackled by the following operations. First, we leverage the Dinkelbach method and the block coordinate descent method to convert the reformulated problem into an iterative solving procedure of two non-convex sub-problems, which optimize the contending probability and the threshold of offload rate respectively. Second, for each non-convex sub-problem, we explore the piecewise differential monotonicity for the cost function, and achieve the associated optimal solution by transforming them into standard monotonic optimization problems. Numerical results can verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through the comparison with benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a new electromagnetic response control solution, which can proactively reshape the characteristics of wireless channel environments. In RIS-assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) and the optimization of reflecting coefficients constitute major design challenges. To address these issues, codebook-based solutions have been developed recently, which, however, are mostly environment-agnostic. In this paper, a novel environment-aware codebook protocol is proposed, which can significantly reduce both pilot overhead and computational complexity, while maintaining expected communication performance. Specifically, first of all, a channel training framework is introduced to divide the training phase into several blocks. In each block, we directly estimate the composite end-to-end channel and focus only on the transmit beamforming. Second, we propose an environment-aware codebook generation scheme, which first generates a group of channels based on statistical CSI, and then obtains their corresponding RIS configuration by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) method offline. In each online training block, the RIS is configured based on the corresponding codeword in the environment-aware codebook, and the optimal codeword resulting in the highest sum rate is adopted for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Third, we analyze the theoretical performance of the environment-aware codebook-based protocol taking into account the channel estimation errors. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme. In particular, the simulation results demonstrate that our protocol is more competitive than conventional environment-agnostic codebooks.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted for channel state information (CSI) feedback to harness the performance gains promised by massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Existing DL-based feedback schemes prioritize the accuracy of CSI reconstruction, which results in substantial memory and computational demands, especially when they are unacceptable for user equipment (UE) with limited resources. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric pooling-based network for more efficient CSI compression, named PoolCsiNet, to reduce the associated overhead of exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNN) for CSI compression at the UE. By leveraging the local information of clustered physical channel models, PoolCsiNet incorporates a low-complexity amplitude-pooling algorithm in its encoder at the UE without requiring any trainable parameters. A corresponding decoder structure is also developed to firstly acquire a coarse CSI and then a lightweight feature refiner is constructed to enhance the coarse CSI reconstruction. The parameter-free encoder and CNN-based refiner constitute a novel asymmetric CSI network architecture. Thanks to the parameter-free design of the encoder, memory demand at the UE is minimized, thereby eliminating the need for joint training and parameter updating. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of indoor wireless channels, a PoolCsiNet+, with a dilated-amplitude-pooling (DAP) module, is further proposed to elevate the CSI reconstruction accuracy of the PoolCsiNet. Thanks to a pooling design tailored for clustered channel models, lossy compression of pooling hardly sacrifices CSI features and can be exploited to eliminate information redundancy in CSI. Experiments demonstrate that both asymmetric PoolCsiNet and PoolCsiNet+ significantly improve the quality of CSI reconstruction up to 4 dB compared with existing DL-based methods, while maintaining a memory-free profile and achieving a sevenfold reduction in computational overhead at the UE.}

	abstract = {The Cyclic prefix (CP) in traditional OFDM systems is used to combat inter-symbol Interference (ISI) and inter-carrier Interference (ICI), which simplifies the design of the equalizer by converting the linear convolution (LS) between symbols and the channel into cyclic convolution (CC). However, the overhead of CP reduces the system’s spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a CP-free OFDM system called TSE-OFDM by exploiting a truncated symbol extrapolation (TSE) module. The TSE module categorizes the received OFDM symbols into reliable and unreliable parts based on their susceptibility to ISI. By iteratively extrapolating the reliable portion unaffected by ISI, the TSE module restores the CC characteristic of the received symbols. We conduct noise analysis and simulations to evaluate the performance of the extrapolation algorithm, demonstrating its robustness against out-of-band noise. Furthermore, we simulate the TSE-OFDM system to assess its bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency (SE). The simulation results show that TSE-OFDM significantly improves SE while maintaining satisfactory BER performance. Compared to other CP-free OFDM schemes, TSE-OFDM exhibits ample tolerance to symbol timing offset (STO) and channel estimation errors.}

	abstract = {Cell-free (CF) networks are a promising architecture poised to revolutionize future wireless communication systems. To enhance performance, designing effective transmission strategies for CF networks is of practical significance. In this paper, we study the downlink beamforming design to maximize the resource efficiency (RE) of CF networks, which encompasses both energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization, thereby enabling the realization of an EE-SE tradeoff. Specifically, we formulate a RE maximization problem taking into account both the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users and the power constraint of the network. The RE optimization problem is a non-convex fractional program. To solve it efficiently, we first equivalently decompose the challenging RE problem into two more tractable problems, a subproblem and a primary problem. Then, we show that the subproblem is equivalent to a power minimization problem and propose two effective methods to obtain the optimal primal and dual solutions simultaneously. After that, we derive the gradient of the optimal value function of the subproblem exploiting the obtained primal and dual solutions that facilitates the design of efficient algorithms with rapid convergence to address the primary problem. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively balance the EE-SE tradeoff, surpassing existing approaches in terms of either EE or SE.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is known for its potential to enhance overall system performance. Thanks to the principle of channel reciprocity, it becomes possible to implement downlink beamforming by exploiting the estimated uplink channel in time-division duplex (TDD) mode. However, the assumption of perfect hardware conditions, as made in prior studies, is not reflective of practical realities. The involvement of hardware impairments disrupts this reciprocity, resulting in performance degradation. This paper investigates the impact of hardware impairments in downlink data transmission, where a novel model is established by jointly considering the radio frequency (RF) mismatches and nonlinear distortions. We first derive closed-form achievable user rate expressions and prove that the impact of RF mismatches vanishes as the number of access points (APs) M \\to \\infty in certain distributions of RF gains. Then, we study the scenarios when the number of user equipments (UEs) K \\to \\infty , as well as various degrees of hardware impairments’ severity scaling M. Finally, we introduce a channel calibration process and theoretically derive its performance, observing that in certain scenarios, the need for calibration becomes redundant as M \\to \\infty . These findings are further validated through numerical results, confirming the scaling laws derived in our study.}

We first study the implementation of diffusion bias-compensated Bayesian adaptation (DBCBA) for noisy inputs, which outperforms the existing solution. Next, an average-estimate step is applied to lessen the impact of link noise in the full diffusion case, yielding a diffusion average-estimate bias-compensated Bayesian adaptation (DABCBA) algorithm. A Bayes-based adaptation construction step is then presented to reconstruct the compressed diffusion information in the presence of link noise, resulting in a compressive DBCBA (CDBCBA) algorithm whose mean and mean-square behaviors are analyzed and the closed-form expression of the steady-state mean-square deviation is derived. In addition, estimators are devised for the input and output noise variances. The excellent performance of our algorithms is demonstrated via numerical examples while the theoretical calculation aligns closely with the simulation results.}

The first approach carries out modulation removal using the outermost symbols of APSK and then utilizes an iterative parabolic interpolation technique to mitigate the bias of FFT-based CFO estimation. The second method conducts two-stage full modulation removal and aggregates symbols to reduce the FFT size for CFO estimation. In the symbol aggregation process, modulation-removed symbols are paired and weighted based on their reliability to achieve accurate estimation. The first method demonstrates better performance, particularly for high-precision requirements, while the second method offers a more adaptable trade-off between performance and complexity by adjusting the aggregation length. Both methods are more efficient and provide better mean square error (MSE) performance compared to existing ones. Moreover, numerical complexity analyses show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.}

With the aid of a surface wave launcher that based on planar magnetic dipole antennas, a wireless coupled, indoor surface wave channel measurement apparatus is constructed to validate the channel characteristics, i.e., path loss, channel impulse response, and channel capacity. As validated in the 2.5-4.5GHz band, the path loss can be reduced by 30dB compared to the free-space propagation case, owing to the sufficient excitation and propagation of the surface wave mode. In addition, scattering paths can be clearly identified with mitigated multi-path effect. Unlike traditional coaxial surface wave launchers that cascading with the transmission line in a wired fashion, the surface wave launcher is coupled to a long, single conductor line with length longer than 30 wavelengths that emulating the long, bulky conductors in Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) in a wireless manner. Therefore, the wireless IIoT nodes can be flexibly networked and deployed as desired in a low-loss fashion with less multi-path effect.

The non-orthogonal multiuser transmission is realized by applying the GF(q) multiplication and superposition. In coordination with the high-order modulation, the proposed GF(q) codebook improves the cardinality of the superimposed constellation and reduces interference at each resource element. The proposed structure also characters for flexibility by spatially coupling the base graph when applying to different user scales. We have theoretically proved that both the system capacity and the error performance are improved due to the GF(q) operations. We utilize the simulated annealing algorithm to optimize both the base factor graph and the spatially-coupled graph, therefore short girths are eliminated or mitigated. The detection of the proposed scheme can be performed through iterative belief-propagation (BP) based on symbol-level log-domain probability vectors derived on the GF(q) factor graph. The numerical results in terms of upper bounds of maximum likelihood (ML) detection and symbol error rates through BP detection are both provided, which demonstrate the superiority of the GF(q) factor graphs to their binary counterparts. The performance can be further improved by increasing the field order q and/or by spatially coupling the non-binary factor graph.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted downlink multiuser communication system with improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) that serves as generalized Gaussian signaling and can effectively combat multiuser interference. We focus on the max-min achievable rate optimization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors and reflecting phase shifts, subject to the transmit power budget constraint at the access point (AP). We propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on a two-layer iterative procedure, which differs from these existing algorithms that rely on inefficient alternating optimization framework and high computational complexity convex optimization tools. Specifically, in the outer layer procedure, we employ a tractable lower bound of user communication rate to reformulate the original problem and repeatedly update the lower bound in each iteration. In the inner layer procedure, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we decompose the reformulated problem into several convex sub-problems, which can be alternately solved by closed-form solutions. Furthermore, we study the initialization, convergence, and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we simplify the algorithm to make it applicable for the cases of conventional proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) and without IRS. Finally, numerical results validate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over benchmarking algorithm in terms of rate performance and average execution time.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) is a paradigm that can improve users’ spectral efficiency (SE) far beyond traditional cellular networks. Increased spatial diversity in CFmMIMO is achieved by spreading the antennas into small access points (APs), which cooperate to serve the users. Sequential fronthaul topologies in CFmMIMO, such as the daisy chain and multi-branch tree topology, have gained considerable attention recently. In such a processing architecture, each AP must store its received signal vector in the memory until it receives the relevant information from the previous AP in the sequence to refine the estimate of the users’ signal vector in the uplink. In this paper, we adopt vector-wise and element-wise compression on the raw or pre-processed received signal vectors to store them in the memory. We investigate the impact of the limited memory capacity in the APs on the optimal number of APs. We show that with no memory constraint, having single-antenna APs is optimal, especially as the number of users grows. However, a limited memory at the APs restricts the depth of the sequential processing pipeline. Furthermore, we investigate the relation between the memory capacity at the APs and the rate of the fronthaul link.}

This allows for a simple (de)modulation process based on the usual DFT, enabling the interpretation of AFDM as a precoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. This makes the AFDM modulation scheme backward compatible with existing OFDM systems. Furthermore, the sampling frequency of the modulated AFDM signal can be finely tuned using the suggested methods, whereas the usual DAFT leads to signals sampled at the Nyquist rate. To achieve this, a DFT-based AFDM modulation technique is introduced, along with a corresponding demodulation method. The introduction considers necessary conditions on the AFDM signal parameters, albeit at the cost of reduced flexibility in parameter settings, as only a limited set of parameters can be considered. The validity of the presented method is supported by mathematical developments and proofs, and validated through simulations. Furthermore, a complexity analysis is conducted.}

On the other hand, the proposed active fully-connected architecture achieves a desirable trade-off between reliability and power consumption compared to conventional passive RIS and active RIS architectures. Additionally, to reduce detection complexity at the receiver, a low-complexity detection algorithm is proposed and the upper bound for the bit error rate (BER) of the system is derived.

The average performance has been comprehensively investigated for URLLC in CF mMIMO systems. However, URLLC places its central focus on extreme and rare events, requiring statistical quality of service (QoS) provisioning in CF mMIMO systems. In this paper, we model the statistical QoS provisioning constraints for URLLC in a CF mMIMO system based on extreme value theory (EVT), i.e., delay violation probability boundary and statistical properties of extreme queue values. Based on our analytical work, a power control optimization problem with long-term URLLC constraints is formulated, aiming at minimizing energy consumption. Then, Lyapunov optimization is utilized to decompose this long-term stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term deterministic problems. Since the short-term problems are non-convex and intractable, a learning-based hyper-heuristic algorithm, consisting of a high-level strategy and multiple low-level heuristics, is proposed. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of parameterizing URLLC in the CF mMIMO system based on EVT and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in both average delay and delay fluctuations, achieving statistical QoS provisioning.}

Moreover, unlike Zadoff-Chu sequences, the points of a constellation associated with a C4-sequence are not limited to the unit circle. This opens up possibilities for achieving shaping gain, leading to enhanced spectral efficiency. By combining a truncated C4-sequence modulation as an inner code with a fixed-rate non-binary outer code, flexible and performant rate-adaptive communication systems can also be achieved. Finally, the notion of C4-sequences can be generalized.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has garnered growing interest and attention due to its potential for facilitating and supporting wireless communications and sensing. This paper studies a semi-passive IRS-enabled sensing system, where an IRS consists of both passive reflecting elements and active sensors. Our goal is to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for parameter estimation under both point and extended target cases. Towards this goal, we begin by deriving the CRB for the direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in closed-form and then theoretically analyze the IRS reflecting elements and sensors allocation design based on the CRB under the point target case with a single-antenna base station (BS). To efficiently solve the corresponding optimization problem for the case with a multi-antenna BS, we propose an efficient algorithm by jointly optimizing the IRS phase shifts and the BS beamformers. Under the extended target case, the CRB for the target response matrix (TRM) estimation is minimized via the optimization of the BS transmit beamformers. Moreover, we explore the influence of various system parameters on the CRB and compare these effects to those observed under the point target case. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the semi-passive IRS and our proposed beamforming design for improving the performance of the sensing system.}

	abstract = {Optimizations premised on open-loop metrics such as Age of Information (AoI) indirectly enhance the system’s decision-making utility. We therefore propose a novel closed-loop metric named Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT) to directly quantify the impact of semantic mismatches on goal-oriented decision-making utility. Leveraging the GoT, we consider a sampler & decision-maker pair that works collaboratively and distributively to achieve a shared goal of communications. We formulate a two-agent infinite-horizon Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to conjointly deduce the optimal deterministic sampling policy and decision-making policy. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality in obtaining an optimal deterministic joint policy through Brute-Force-Search, a sub-optimal yet computationally efficient algorithm is developed. This algorithm is predicated on the search for a Nash Equilibrium between the sampler and the decision-maker. Simulation results reveal that the proposed sampler & decision-maker co-design surpasses the current literature on AoI and its variants in terms of both goal achievement utility and sparse sampling rate, signifying progress in the semantics-conscious, goal-driven sparse sampling design.}

	abstract = {We study a remote monitoring system in which a mutually independent and heterogeneous collection of finite-state irreducible continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) based information sources is considered. In this system, a common remote monitor queries the instantaneous states of the individual CTMCs according to a Poisson process with possibly different intensities across the sources, in order to maintain accurate estimates of the original sources. Three information freshness models are considered to quantify the accuracy of the remote estimates: fresh when equal (FWE), fresh when sampled (FWS) and fresh when close (FWC). For each of these freshness models, closed-form expressions are derived for mean information freshness for a given source. Using these expressions, optimum sampling rates for all sources are obtained so as to maximize the weighted sum freshness of the monitoring system, subject to an overall sampling rate constraint. This optimization problem leads to a water-filling solution with quadratic worst case computational complexity in the number of information sources. Numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the optimum sampling policy in comparison to several baseline sampling policies.}

The goal is to design caching and delivery schemes to reduce the transmission latency measured by the metric named normalized delivery time (NDT). By delicately designing the data placement of the transmitters and users according to the topology, we show that a combinatorial structure called multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), which was originally proposed for the multiple-input single-output broadcast channels, can be also helpful in designing schemes for the partially connected linear network. Then, based on existing MAPDAs and our constructing approach, we propose new schemes that achieve the optimal NDT when {M_{\\text {T}}}+ {M_{\\text {U}}}\\geq N and smaller NDT than that of the existing schemes when ( {M_{\\text {T}}}+ {M_{\\text {U}}}\\leq N , \\frac {M_{\\text {U}}}{N}+\\frac {M_{\\text {T}}}{N} \\frac {L}{K}\\left \\lceil {{\\frac {K}{L} }}\\right \\rceil \\geq 1 ) or ( {M_{\\text {U}}}+ {M_{\\text {T}}}\\lt N, \\frac {K}{L}\\notin \\mathbb {Z}^{+} ). Moreover, our schemes operate in one-shot linear delivery and significantly reduce the subpacketizations compared to the existing scheme, which implies that our schemes have a wider range of applications and lower complexity of implementation.}

	abstract = {Edge computing has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to boost the performance of distributed learning by leveraging the distributed resources at edge nodes. Architecturally, the introduction of edge nodes adds an additional intermediate layer between the master and workers in the original distributed learning systems, potentially leading to more severe straggler effect. Recently, coding theory-based approaches have been proposed for stragglers mitigation in distributed learning, but the majority focus on the conventional workers-master architecture. In this paper, along a different line, we investigate the problem of mitigating the straggler effect in hierarchical distributed learning systems with an additional layer composed of edge nodes. Technically, we first derive the fundamental trade-off between the computational loads of workers and the stragglers tolerance. Then, we propose a hierarchical gradient coding framework, which provides better stragglers mitigation, to achieve the derived computational trade-off. To further improve the performance of our framework in heterogeneous scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the expected execution time for each iteration in the learning process. We develop an efficient algorithm to mathematically solve the problem by outputting the optimum strategy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our schemes compared with conventional solutions.}

As typical non-MDS codes, simple regenerating codes (SRCs) can achieve both smaller repair bandwidth and smaller repair locality than traditional MDS codes in repairing single-node erasure. In this paper, we propose generalized simple regenerating codes (GSRCs) that can support much more parameters than that of SRCs. We show that there is a trade-off between sub-packetization and fault tolerance in our GSRCs, and SRCs achieve a special point of the trade-off of GSRCs. We show that the fault tolerance of our GSRCs increases when the sub-packetization increases linearly. We also show that our GSRCs can locally repair any single-symbol erasure and any single-node erasure, and the repair bandwidth of our GSRCs is smaller than that of the existing related codes.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been vigorously promoted in wireless edge networks as it fosters collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models while preserving individual user privacy and data security. In conventional FL, user equipment (UE) and an aggregator can collaboratively train shared global ML models by transmitting interactive ML models. In wireless edge networks, heterogeneity of multi-dimensional resources (e.g., computing and communication resources) used to train and transmit FL models may introduce stragglers, characterized by a slow update and/or transmission of local models. The stragglers can significantly degrade learning performance of FL, as the slowest participating UE can dramatically slow down the entire convergence. In this paper, to alleviate the negative impact of stragglers, we propose a dynamic straggler-aware clustering based FL (FeDSC) mechanism via adaptive UE clustering. Specifically, we first group participating UEs into multiple clusters based on their available computing and wireless resources. Then, we propose an adaptive clustering scheme to synchronously update the cluster aggregation model. Meanwhile, an edge server performs global aggregation of different cluster models in an asynchronous manner. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the convergence of our proposed mechanism via numerical results. Numerical results show that our proposed mechanism can effectively reduce training time and wireless bandwidth consumption, while improving training efficiency and guaranteeing learning accuracy.}

To address the computational complexity and communication power consumption associated with conventional centralized optimization, we focus on user-centric dynamic networks in which each user is served by an adaptive subset of access points (AP) rather than all of them. We begin our research by analyzing a joint resource allocation problem for energy-efficient CF XL-MIMO systems, encompassing cooperative clustering and power control design, where all clusters are adaptively adjustable. Then, we propose an innovative double-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheme, which offers an effective strategy to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional signal processing. In the section of numerical results, we compare various algorithms with different network architectures. These comparisons reveal that the proposed MARL-based cooperative architecture can effectively strike a balance between system performance and communication overhead, thereby improving energy efficiency performance. It is important to note that increasing the number of user equipments participating in information sharing can effectively enhance SE performance, which also leads to an increase in power consumption, resulting in a non-trivial trade-off between the number of participants and EE performance.}

Analog error correction is an attractive method for low-latency communications; hence, in this paper, we propose the use of complex-valued neural networks and Quaternionic Neural Networks (QNNs) to decode analog codes. Furthermore, we propose mapping our codes to the baseband of the frequency domain to enable easy time and frequency synchronization as well as to mitigate frequency-selective fading using robust estimation theory. This is accomplished by applying inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) modulation, which achieves a significant reduction in hardware complexity, power, and cost as compared to our previously proposed analog coding scheme. Additionally, we introduce a scaled version of our previous analog codes that enables statistical signal processing, something we have not been able to achieve until now. This achieves significant noise immunity with drastic performance improvements at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) and a small loss at high SNR.}

Hierarchical FL (HFL) system has yet to be studied regrading its multiple levels of energy, computation, communication, and client scheduling, especially when it comes to clients relying on energy harvesting to power their operations. This paper presents a new two-phase deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework, referred to as “TP-DDPG”, to balance online the learning delay and model accuracy of an FL process in an energy harvesting-powered HFL system. The key idea is that we divide optimization decisions into two groups, and employ DDPG to learn one group in the first phase, while interpreting the other group as part of the environment to provide rewards for training the DDPG in the second phase. Specifically, the DDPG learns the selection of participating clients, and their CPU configurations and the transmission powers. A new straggler-aware client association and bandwidth allocation (SCABA) algorithm efficiently optimizes the other decisions and evaluates the reward for the DDPG. Experiments demonstrate that with substantially reduced number of learnable parameters, the TP-DDPG can quickly converge to effective polices that can shorten the training time of HFL by 39.4% compared to its benchmarks, when the required test accuracy of HFL is 0.9.}

However, popular approaches mainly focus on the purely data-driven architecture design, and fail to explore the professional knowledge of wireless communication which is particularly significant for radio signal essential feature extraction. Inspired by digital signal processing theories, we propose knowledge embedding networks (KENs) to introduce the high-order statistics and radio spectral information into deep neural networks, based on the high-order convolution and multi-spectral attention mechanism. KENs are the general form of attention mechanism from frequency perspective and leverage identical structures of the conventional convolution layer for high-order statistics. To extract efficient representations of radio signal, frequency loss with generative adversarial networks is proposed to enhance the discrimination and richness of attention knowledge in an explicit manner. KENs enhance interpretability concerning essential radio properties while achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy by a significant margin compared to traditional automatic modulation classification approaches on RADIOML 2018.01A dataset.}

In these contexts, both maintaining a low expected Age of Information (AoI) and guaranteeing a low Peak AoI (PAoI) even in the worst case may have significant user experience and safety implications. In this work, we investigate a theoretical model of a MEC server, deriving the expected AoI and the PAoI and latency distributions under the First In First Out (FIFO) and Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) resource allocation policies. We consider both synchronized and unsynchronized systems, and draw insights on the robust design of resource allocation policies from the analytical results, as well as considering the dimensioning of MEC capabilities in two realistic 6G use cases.}

The receiver has no prior information about the instantaneous channel coefficient, and shot noise with signal-dependent power is inserted by the photodetector device. In such a harsh scenario, suitable estimates of the timing error, channel attenuation and noise parameters are needed for reliable data detection. In this work, we employ the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the joint estimation of all the aforementioned parameters. In order to obtain a feasible scheme, the maximization step of the EM procedure is split into a sequence of simpler optimization tasks according to the Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM) principle. The resulting algorithm operates in a non-data-aided fashion using symbol-spaced samples, which is particularly advantageous in high-speed FSO communications where signal oversampling may require sophisticated hardware equipment. Computer simulations indicate that the accuracy of the proposed scheme is close to the relevant modified Cramér-Rao bounds (MCRBs), which amounts to saying that no room is left for a further improvement of the system performance.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) systems employing photovoltaic optical receivers (RXs). We consider the case, where the optical RX is illuminated by ambient light and an intensity-modulated information-carrying free space optical (FSO) signal. To overcome the possible absence of ambient light, e.g., indoors or at night, we additionally assume that the optical RX receives a dedicated energy-bearing broadband optical signal. Additionally, to efficiently harvest energy from broadband light, we propose a novel optical RX based on multi-junction photovoltaic cells. Exploiting the analysis of the equivalent two-diode electrical circuit for the multi-junction photovoltaic RX, we carefully model the current flow through the photovoltaic cell and derive an accurate energy harvesting (EH) model. Furthermore, we also derive novel approximate EH models for the two cases, where the optical RX is equipped with a single and multiple p-n junctions, respectively. Next, we derive the distribution of the transmit information signal that maximizes the achievable information rate and, for a practical pulse amplitude modulated information signal, we determine the symbol error rate at the RX. We validate the proposed EH models by circuit simulations and show that the photovoltaic RXs saturate for high received signal powers. For single-junction RXs, we compare the proposed EH model with two well-known baseline EH models, which are based on maximum point tracking and a single-diode electrical circuit, respectively. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the proposed EH model, both baseline EH models are not able to fully capture the non-linear behavior of photovoltaic RXs. Moreover, our results reveal that, since multi-junction RXs allow a more efficient allocation of the optical power, they are more robust against saturation, and thus, are able to harvest significantly more power and achieve higher data rates than RXs employing a single p-n junction. Finally, we highlight a tradeoff between the information rate and harvested power in SLIPT systems and demonstrate that the proposed transmit signal distribution yields significantly higher achievable information rates compared to uniformly distributed transmit signals, which are optimal for linear optical information RXs.}

	abstract = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) is expected to enable a wide range of applications in the next generation wireless networks. These applications are recognized as sensitive and prone to dangerous threats. So far, VLC research activities have been more focused on developing high data rate solutions and more robust systems for both indoor and outdoor applications, with a reduced focus on the security aspects. This is mostly due to the fact that VLC systems are based on short range and occurs in line of sight and it is then considered inherently secure by design. The specific characteristics of VLC systems make the traditional countermeasures adopted in radio-frequency-based systems not applicable, with a concrete need to conceive ad hoc solutions. Basing on these premises, in this work we consider a physical layer perspective by analyzing the intrinsic properties of visible light signals so as to develop a secure by design VLC system to be used in downlink. By exploiting the light bias, we guarantee an improved security level in respect of eavesdropper attack by granting also a good illumination level. A key aspect of this work is that the proposed solution does not rely on external devices or extra hardware.}

	abstract = {Physical layer security has attracted significant attention in the field of wireless communications. The application of artificial noise can reduce the eavesdropping ability of illegal eavesdroppers without affecting legitimate users. However, most current physical layer security schemes only consider static scenarios and do not account for mobility. Some schemes analyze security performance in mobile scenarios with friendly jammers but do not consider the handoff and cooperation of friendly jammers due to mobility. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme for soft-handoff-based cooperative jamming (CJSH) in mobility scenarios. Initially, we consider a common scenario where a base station communicates with a legitimate mobile user, alongside a mobile passive eavesdropper and multiple friendly jammers emitting artificial noise in the circular area covered by the base station’s signal. Next, We measure the connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) under the influence of multiple friendly jammers in the proposed scheme. We also design two corresponding thresholds for jammers to join and exit. To balance security and energy consumption, we define the Power Average Security Gain (PASG) as a measure of system performance. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results to verify the rationality of the proposed handoff scheme, demonstrating its effective improvement of the system’s security performance and power utilization.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is susceptible to blockages, even from humans. Previous studies that primarily focused only on static blockage may not accurately characterize the system performance. This paper investigates the coverage performance of mmWave UAV networks by jointly considering multiple types of blockages under finite homogeneous Poisson point process and Binomial point process, which are commonly employed in finite area scenarios with random and fixed number of UAVs, respectively. Particularly, we derive the average line-of-sight probability and coverage probability under static, dynamic, and self blockages. Simulations verify our theoretical results, demonstrating that: the above system performance predominantly depends on self-blockage if UAVs are at high altitudes. Conversely, at relatively low altitudes, all three types of blockages impact them, with static blockage being the dominant factor. To avoid self-blockage, UAV height should satisfy h\\!\\gt \\!h_{R}\\!+\\!\\frac {r_{i}}{\\tan \\varphi _{b}}\n, where h_{R}\nis the height of the user equipment (UE), r_{i}\nis the two-dimensional distance of the UAV-UE link, \\varphi _{b}\nis the elevation angle between UE and UAV. The required height is proportional to r_{i}\nand increases as distance d between the user and UE decreases, as \\varphi _{b}\nis proportional to d. The findings help on designing the network parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the coverage of mmWave UAV networks under multiple types of blockages.}

Therefore, the conventional far-field uniform plane wave (UPW) assumption is no longer valid. By discarding the UPW assumption, we consider the generic non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) model for accurate characterization of signal amplitude and phase variations on different antenna elements. A novel expression is derived for the near-field SC in terms of the scatterer distribution, which generalizes the conventional far-field SC. It is revealed that the developed near-field SC is determined by the power location spectrum (PLS), which is characterized not only by the scatterers’ directions but also by their distances from the array, while the conventional far-field model is only dependent on the power angular spectrum (PAS). In addition, the near-field SC no longer exhibits spatial wide-sense stationarity (SWSS), since the SC coefficient between each pair of transmit-receive antenna components is determined by their specific positions, not just by their relative locations. Furthermore, the developed near-field SC is utilized to obtain the optimal transmission strategy to maximize the ergodic spectral efficiency based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Besides, we consider the specific multi-ring scattering model for scatterer distribution, where semi-closed expressions for the near-field SC can be obtained. Simulation results are given to validate the developed near-field SC for XL-MIMO communications.}

Assuming that the implementation of the ODDM is based on IDFT/DFT and sample-wise pulse shaping/receiver filtering, we study the input-output (IO) relation for ODDM and characterize the equivalent sampled delay-Doppler (ESDD) domain channel in terms of the parameters of the physical channel and the DD plane orthogonal pulse (DDOP). The established IO relation can describe the patterns of inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and inter-carrier-interference (ICI) for more general delay and Doppler shifts of the physical channel. Based on the results, we also examine the influence of the transmitter configuration on the sparsity of the ESDD channel and on the resulting performance-complexity tradeoff of ODDM. We further introduce a pilot-assisted method of estimating the physical channel parameters by leveraging the derived IO relation and the root-MUSIC algorithm. We also present a low-complexity symbol detector for ODDM systems based on conjugate gradients (CG). Simulation results under various settings show that the error performance of ODDM based on the estimate of the physical channel approaches that with perfect channel state information (CSI) at a low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but has an increased gap from the perfect CSI case when the SNR increases.}

In this work, we consider a multi-STAR-RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for multi-users and investigate the impact of different STAR-RIS schemes on the system performance. We jointly optimize the beamforming matrix of the base station and the transmitting and reflecting coefficient (TRC) matrix of each STAR-RIS to maximize the sum rate of users. We propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the beamforming matrix and the TRC matrices. We reformulate the optimization problem and optimize the beamforming matrix using the Lagrange duality method to reduce the computational complexity and then employ the constrained concave-convex procedure to tackle the optimization problem for the TRC matrices. When the energy splitting (ES) scheme is applied, our proposed method achieves a remarkable improvement of up to 17.97% in the user sum rate compared to the mode switching and the equal ES schemes in the multi-STAR-RIS-assisted system. Furthermore, when compared with systems assisted by multiple conventional RISs, our system can achieve a substantial gain of 38.99%. The improvement is even more pronounced compared to systems with a single STAR-RIS or a single conventional RIS.}

	abstract = {Multibeam satellite system (MSS) plays an increasingly important role in the future communication system because of the ability to provide seamless information services. However, multibeam technology will cause serious inter-beam co-frequency interference (IBCFI), significantly deteriorating communication performance. Existing IBCFI management schemes mainly depend on precoding technologies, which regard MSS as multi-antenna systems and ignore characteristics of satellite beam gain and the limited computational resources. Meanwhile, terrestrial channels tend to be independent while satellite channels have a high correlation, which is rarely considered by existing work. On the other hand, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has recently emerged due to the advantages of flexible multiple access and robust interference management. Therefore, we design a two-step adaptive grouping access scheme based on the promising RSMA to handle these challenges, where the first step takes the characteristics of satellite beam gain and computational resources into consideration, and the second step optimizes the channel correlation. Building on the two-step adaptive grouping access scheme, we formulate different weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problems for different user groups. Furthermore, we introduce an improved alternating optimization algorithm to solve these non-convex problems. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in WSR and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {With the emergence of the metaverse and its applications in representing humans and intelligent entities in social and related augmented reality (AR) applications. The current bit-oriented network faces challenges in supporting real-time updates for the vast amount of associated information, which hinders development. Thus, a critical revolution in the sixth generation (6G) networks is envisioned through the joint exploitation of information context and its importance to the goal, leading to a communication paradigm shift towards semantic and effectiveness levels. However, current research has not yet proposed any explicit and systematic communication framework for AR applications that incorporate these two levels. To fill this research gap, this paper presents a goal-oriented semantic communication framework for augmented reality (GSAR) to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness in 6G. Specifically, we first analyse the traditional wireless AR point cloud communication framework and then summarize our proposed semantic information along with the end-to-end wireless communication. We then detail the design blocks of the GSAR framework, covering both semantic and effectiveness levels. Finally, numerous experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that, compared to the traditional point cloud communication framework, our proposed GSAR significantly reduces wireless AR application transmission latency by 95.6%, while improving communication effectiveness in geometry and color aspects by up to 82.4% and 20.4%, respectively.}

Nevertheless, its user experience suffers from degradation caused by obstacles like humans and objects. Unlike base station (BS) solutions, user-side approaches offer greater flexibility in addressing blockage issues. This paper introduces an innovative beam management architecture named reference-signal-received-power (RSRP)-based blockage-prediction-aided compressive sensing (RSRP-BPCS). Unlike existing methods, our proposed algorithm accounts for real communication system constraints and protocol procedures, ensuring practicality. The key advantage lies in deriving channel information based on RSRP without requiring signal phase knowledge. Additionally, we present two novel strategies on the user side: a multiple-beam-sweeping procedure (MBSP) and a proactive blockage prediction approach. These techniques enable the monitoring of different beam pair links and early anticipation of blockage instances. To achieve rapid recovery, we design an explainable deep learning beam tracking scheme which is joint data and model-based to explore the compressive projection of the power spectrum. The best part is that our strategies are standard-compatible, demanding no supplementary side information, which significantly simplifies implementation with minimal complexity. Through extensive simulations, our proposed algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance in mitigating the impact of blockage, proving its efficacy and practicality.}

In this paper, we address the problem of flexible/reconfigurable antenna configuration selection for point-to-point MIMO antenna systems by using physics-inspired heuristics. Firstly, we optimize the antenna configuration to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver by leveraging two basic heuristic solvers, i.e., coherent Ising machines (CIMs), that mimic quantum mechanical dynamics, and quantum annealing (QA), where a real-world QA architecture is considered (D-Wave). A mathematical framework that converts the configuration selection problem into CIM- and QA- compatible unconstrained quadratic formulations is investigated. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed designs outperform classical counterparts and achieve near-optimal performance (similar to exhaustive search with exponential complexity) while ensuring polynomial complexity. Moreover, we study the optimal antenna configuration that maximizes the end-to-end Shannon capacity. A simulated annealing (SA) heuristic which achieves near-optimal performance through appropriate parameterization is adopted. A modified version of the basic SA that exploits parallel tempering to avoid local maxima is also studied, which provides additional performance gains. Extended numerical studies show that the SA solutions outperform conventional heuristics (which are also developed for comparison purposes), while the employment of the SNR-based solutions is highly sub-optimal.}

In this article, we consider a RIS-assisted single-user (SU) massive MIMO millimeter wave (mmWave) downlink communication system. Our goal is to maximize spectral efficiency by selecting the optimal RIS, optimizing reflection coefficients of the RIS, and designing hybrid beamforming (HBF) at the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) through a decoupling strategy. To be more precise, we first suggest a novel approach for computable channels (CC) based on location data and select the optimal RIS reflection path based on CC. we then propose a CC-based method to select the array response vectors and their corresponding path gains and angle information of the mmWave channels between the BS (RIS) and RIS (UE) required to formulate a passive beamforming vector, which is also solved via the manifold optimization (MO)-based algorithm. Lastly, the optimal problem of traditional HBF is decoupled into two stages. In the analog beamforming (ABF) stage, the selected path gains and angle information enable the simultaneous determination of ABF weight vectors. Based on the ABF matrix, in the digital beamforming (DBF) stage, the DBF matrix is designed to maximize spectral efficiency. Simulation results show that spectrum efficiency can be improved by selecting the optimal RIS and the computational complexity can be reduced by designing the RIS phase shifts.}

	abstract = {We address the reflection optimization problem for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), where the RIS elements feature a set of non-uniformly spaced discrete phase shifts. This is motivated by the actual behavior of practical RIS elements, where it is shown that a uniform phase shift assumption is not realistic. A problem is formulated to find the optimal reflection amplitudes and reflection phase shifts of the RIS elements such that the channel capacity of the target user is maximized. We first prove that in the optimal configuration, each RIS element is either turned off or operates at maximum amplitude. We then develop a method that finds the optimal reflection amplitudes and phases with complexity linear with the number of RIS elements. An interesting insight into the reflection optimization problem is also provided.}
