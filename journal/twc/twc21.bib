	abstract = {The state-of-the-art radio-frequency (RF) devices limit the deployment of extremely high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats (e.g., 16384-QAM) to meet the high-capacity demand on microwave backhaul links. This paper turns to faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) transmission using lower-order constellations and lower-cost RF devices as a solution to the demand. To realize low-complexity interference cancellation, we pre-equalize the FTN-induced inter-symbol interference at the transmitter by using Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP), while at the receiver suppressing the phase noise (PHN) generated by the RF local oscillators with pilot symbol assisted approaches. However, the THP may distort the pilots, which degrades the performance of PHN compensation. To resolve this problem, we propose two pilot designs that are distortion-free to precisely estimate the PHN samples. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression of the symbol detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), in terms of the THP-FTN waveform parameters. With the SNR expression, a waveform optimization procedure is developed to maximize the SNR and enhance the achievable FTN capacity. The proposed scheme is validated in the simulated platform of 4096-QAM microwave link. The results demonstrate that the FTN signaling achieves the system capacity equivalent to that of the 16384-QAM Nyquist signaling with an SNR gain of 5.8 dB.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) enables ultra-high throughput and low latency for tile-based adaptive virtual reality (VR) 360° video transmission in wireless network. In this paper, we consider a massive MIMO system where multiple users in a single-cell theater watch an identical VR 360° video. Based on tile prediction, base station (BS) deliveries the tiles in predicted field of view (FoV) to users. By introducing practical supplementary transmission for missing tiles and unacceptable VR sickness, we propose the first stable transmission scheme for VR video. we formulate an integer non-linear programming (INLP) problem to maximize users’ average quality of experience (QoE) score. Moreover, we derive the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) expression of predictive tile groups and the approximately achievable SE expression of missing tile groups, respectively. Analytically, the overall throughput is related to the number of tile groups and the length of pilot sequences. By exploiting the relationship between the structure of viewport tiles and SE expression, we propose a multi-lattice multi-stream grouping method aimed at improving the overall throughput for VR video transmission. Moreover, we analyze the relationship between QoE objective and number of predictive tile. We transform the original INLP problem into an integer linear programming problem by setting the predictive tiles groups as some constants. With variable relaxation and recovery, we obtain the optimal average QoE. Extensive simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm effectively improves QoE.}

A harvest-then-transmit protocol is applied with base stations (BSs) transfer wireless energy to users in the first downlink phase. Then, the users utilize the harvested energy for their information transmission to the BS in the subsequent uplink phase. In this configuration, we employ a general \\alpha –fair utility to maximize the network throughput. In particular, the maximization of sum-rate, proportional fairness and minimum rate are investigated individually. We introduce a new message-passing based framework to provide an efficient distributed solution for the user association and optimize the time allocation between the downlink and uplink phase. To achieve this joint goal, each user selects a BS in a distributed manner to maximize the \\alpha –fair utility. After identifying the user association, the time allocation is determined by an efficient line search technique. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing approaches.}

A low-complexity semi-blind joint estimation scheme of multiple channels, CFOs and IQ imbalances is proposed. By utilizing the subspace approach, CFOs and channels corresponding to\nU\nusers are first separated into\nU\ngroups. For each individual user, CFO is extracted by minimizing the smallest eigenvalue whose corresponding eigenvector is utilized to estimate channel blindly. The IQ imbalance parameters are estimated jointly with channel ambiguities by very few subcarriers. The proposed scheme is feasible for a wider range of receive antennas number and has no constraints on the assignment scheme of subsymbols and subcarriers, modulation type, cyclic prefix length and the number of subsymbols per GFDM symbol. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of bit error rate, outage probability, mean-square-errors of CFO estimation, channel and IQ imbalance estimation, while at much higher spectral efficiency and lower computational complexity. The Cramér-Rao lower bound is derived to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which is shown to be close to simulation results.}

	abstract = {In the era of big data, anonymity is recognized as an important attribute in privacy-preserving communications. The existing anonymous authentication and routing designs are applied at higher layers of networks, ignoring the fact that physical layer (PHY) also contains privacy-critical information. In this paper, we introduce the concept of PHY anonymity, and reveal that the receiver can unmask the sender’s identity by only analyzing the PHY information, i.e., the signaling patterns and the characteristics of the channel. We investigate two scenarios, where the receiver has more antennas than the sender in the strong receiver case, and vice versa in the strong sender case. For each scenario, we first investigate sender detection strategies at the receiver, and then we develop anonymous precoding to address anonymity while guaranteeing high signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) for communications. In particular, an interference suppression anonymous precoder is first proposed, assisted by a dedicated transmitter-side phase equalizer for removing phase ambiguity. Afterwards, a constructive interference anonymous precoder is investigated to utilize inter-antenna interference as a beneficial element without loss of the sender’s anonymity. Simulations demonstrate that the anonymous precoders are able to preserve the sender’s anonymity and simultaneously guarantee high SINR, opening a new dimension on PHY anonymous designs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a multiple cluster-based transmission diversity scheme is proposed for asynchronous joint transmissions (JT) in private networks. The use of multiple clusters or small cells is adopted to reduce the transmission distance to users thereby increasing data-rates and reducing latency. To further increase the spectral efficiency and achieve flexible spatial degrees of freedom, we consider that a distributed remote radio unit system (dRRUS) is installed in each of the clusters. A key characteristic of deploying the dRRUS in private networks is the associated multipath-rich and asynchronous delay propagation environment. Therefore, we consider asynchronous multiple signal reception at the remote radio units and propose an intersymbol interference free distributed cyclic delay diversity (dCDD) scheme for JT to achieve the full transmit diversity gain without requiring full channel state information of the private network. The spectral efficiency of the proposed dCDD-based JT is analyzed by deriving a new closed-form expression, and then compared with link-level simulations for non-identically distributed frequency selective fading over the entire network. Due to its distributed structure, the dRRUS relies on backhaul communications between the private network server and cluster master (CM), which is the main backhaul connection, and between the CM to remote radio units, which are the secondary backhaul connections. Thus, it is important for us to investigate the impact of reliability of main and secondary backhaul connections on the system. Our results show that the resulting composite backhaul connections can be accurately modeled by our proposed product of independent Bernoulli processes.}

	abstract = {The demand for satellite communication increases with digitalization and globalization in the era of 5G and beyond; therefore, research and development of high-throughput satellites (HTSs) to increase the communication capacity and improve the flexibility of satellite communication systems is underway. Additionally, digital beamforming (DBF), which can control the directivity of multiple beams through high-speed digital signal processing, has received significant attention as a technology to improve the flexibility of resource allocation with HTSs. The principal control parameters in the DBF-based HTS, including the transmission power, beam gain, and placement location of each beam, cause alterations in the positional characteristics of the total throughput in the coverage area of an HTS. However, there are no power resource allocation models with dual control of these control parameters, based on the above positional characteristic. This study clarifies the effect of such control parameters on the total throughput in the coverage area of an HTS. We demonstrate a method for improving the flexibility of resource allocation to satisfy the geographic distribution of traffic requirements by constructing a power resource allocation model with a DBF-based fusion control in the HTS communication system. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method through a simulation analysis using exponential annealing.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a new virtualization method for the downlink of a multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, to achieve service isolation among multiple Service Providers (SPs) that share the base station resources of an Infrastructure Provider (InP). Each SP designs a virtual precoder for its users in each cell, as its service demand to the InP, without the need to be aware of the existence of the other SPs or to know the channel state information (CSI) outside the cell. The InP performs network virtualization to meet the SPs’ service demands while managing both the inter-SP and inter-cell interference. We consider coordinated multi-cell precoding at the InP and formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of signal leakage and precoding deviation, with per-cell transmit power constraints. We propose a fully distributed semi-closed-form solution at each cell, without any CSI exchange across cells. We further propose a low-complexity scheme to allocate the virtual transmit power, for the InP to regulate between interference elimination and virtual demand maximization. Simulation results demonstrate that our precoding solution for network virtualization substantially outperforms the traditional spectrum isolation alternative. It can approach the performance of fully cooperative precoding when the number of antennas is large.}

The MTC networks will be deployed by using low-power transceivers with finite discrete configurations. This paper considers minimum length scheduling problem for full-duplex WPCNs, where users transmit information to a hybrid access point at a rate chosen from a finite set of discrete-rate levels. The optimization problem considers energy causality, data and maximum transmit power constraints, and is proven to be NP-hard. As a solution strategy, we define the minimum length scheduling (MLS) slot, which is slot of minimum transmission completion time while starting transmission at anytime after the decision time. We solve the problem optimally for a given transmission order based on the optimality analysis of MLS slot. For the general problem, we categorize the problem based on whether the MLS slots of users overlap over time. We propose optimal algorithm for non-overlapping scenario by allocating the MLS slots, and a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for overlapping scenario by allocating the transmission slot to the user with earliest MLS slot. Through simulations, we demonstrate significant gains of scheduling and discrete rate allocation.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the fast adaptive beamforming for the multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink. Existing deep learning-based approaches assume that training and testing channels follow the same distribution which causes task mismatch, when the testing environment changes. Although meta learning can deal with the task mismatch, it relies on labelled data and incurs high complexity in the pre-training and fine tuning stages. We propose a simple yet effective adaptive framework to solve the mismatch issue, which trains an embedding model as a transferable feature extractor, followed by fitting the support vector regression. Compared to the existing meta learning algorithm, our method does not necessarily need labelled data in the pre-training and does not need fine-tuning of the pre-trained model in the adaptation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through two well-known applications, i.e., the signal to interference plus noise ratio balancing problem and the sum rate maximization problem. Furthermore, we extend our proposed method to online scenarios in non-stationary environments. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of both performance and complexity. The proposed framework can also be applied to general radio resource management problems.}

	abstract = {To alleviate the impact of outages caused by dynamic blockage of propagation paths in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, 3GPP has proposed multi-connectivity operation, where user equipment (UE) maintains simultaneous links to both sub-6 GHz and mmWave BSs. We address one of the most challenging prospective deployments – multi-lane street deployment with intra- and inter-RAT multi-connectivity. By utilizing the mixture of analytical and simulation tools, we first characterize the outage characteristics at mmWave layer. These characteristics further serve as an input to the queuing model characterizing service performance of sub-6 GHz BS serving sub-6 GHz and temporarily offloaded mmWave sessions and implementing traffic protection strategies. Our numerical results show that the use of inter-RAT multi-connectivity to offload mmWave sessions decreases sub-6 GHz session rate multiple times while utilizing multi-connectivity at the mmWave layer allows to partially compensate it. Traffic “jam” road conditions affect the sub-6 GHz session rate reducing it by approximately 20% compared to “normal” road traffic conditions. Furthermore, reserving shares of resources to sub-6 GHz and mmWave traffic favors “heavy-weight” mmWave sessions. On the other hand, individual session resource allocation leads to fair performance. However, this option induces the trade-off between the attained rate and the session drop probability.}

	abstract = {Power control policies that minimize the weighted combination of age of information (AoI) and total energy consumption are studied in this paper. It is assumed that the status update information is acquired at the transmitter through sensors and then sent in packets to the receiver at fixed rate over Rayleigh fading channels. Retransmission mechanism is introduced to guarantee the reliability of the received update packets, and a limit on the maximum number of transmission rounds is imposed. On the one hand, with the channel distribution information (CDI) available at the transmitter, the age-energy tradeoff is optimized by formulating the problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) which takes into account the sensing power consumption as well as the average transmission power constraint. Employing the Lagrangian relaxation, the CMDP problem is transformed into an unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) problem. A threshold-based policy is also provided. Subsequently, a dynamic programming approach is proposed to obtain the optimal power allocation policy. On the other hand, when the environment is unknown, two probabilistic reinforcement learning algorithms are proposed to optimize the age-energy tradeoff. Through simulation results, it is shown that the age-energy tradeoffs can be improved by the proposed optimal policies compared with benchmark schemes.}

We consider a state-dependent network, where the pay-off achieved by the users are a function of their actions as well as the state of the system. We consider four different scenarios depending on the state evolution and the users’ knowledge of the system state. In this context, we present completely uncoupled algorithms for utility maximization, where the users’ action is entirely a function of its past actions and its received pay-off.

	abstract = {Physical layer security (PLS) is promising for secure short-packet transmissions in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications. The bottlenecks of applying PLS in practice include 1) lack of accurate channel state information (CSI) of both the intended user and the eavesdropper; 2) high computational complexity for solving optimization problems. To address the first issue, we compare the secure transmission rates of short packets in different scenarios (i.e., with/without eavesdropper’s instantaneous CSI and with/without channel estimation errors) and derive the closed-form optimal power control policy in a special case. To find numerical solutions in general cases, we apply an unsupervised deep learning method, which has low complexity after the training stage. Through numerical results, we obtain the following three key findings: 1) The learning-based power control policy approaches the closed-form optimal policy in the special case and outperforms two existing power control policies in general cases. 2) Knowing the instantaneous CSI of the eavesdropper only provides a marginal gain of the secure data rate in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. 3) In the presence of channel estimation errors, the learning-based policy trained by the estimated channels can guarantee the average transmit power constraint, while the closed-form policy cannot.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which are capable of adjusting radio propagation conditions by controlling the phase shifts of the waves that impinge on the surface, have been widely analyzed for enhancing the performance of wireless systems. However, the reflective properties of widely studied IRSs restrict the service coverage to only one side of the surface. In this paper, to extend the wireless coverage of communication systems, we introduce the concept of intelligent omni-surface (IOS)-assisted communication. More precisely, an IOS is an important instance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that can provide service coverage to mobile users (MUs) in a reflective and a refractive manner. We consider a downlink IOS-assisted communication system, where a multi-antenna small base station (SBS) and an IOS jointly perform beamforming, for improving the received power of multiple MUs on both sides of the IOS, through different reflective/refractive channels. To maximize the sum-rate, we formulate a joint IOS phase shift design and SBS beamforming optimization problem, and propose an iterative algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex program. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that an IOS significantly extends the service coverage of the SBS when compared to an IRS.}

However, the dimensionality reduction of the group-specific beam-domain channel based on the OBF causes significant performance degradation in the subsequent spatial-filtering detection. To compensate for this drawback, this paper introduces a novel layered belief propagation (BP) detector with a concatenated structure of beam- and antenna-domain BP layers for post-stage OBF processing. The proposed detector is designed for improving the convergence of iterative detection by suppressing intra- and inter-group interference in stages. The layered structure provides the advantages of both beam and antenna domains while maintaining low signal-processing complexity.

	abstract = {With emerging applications, e.g., factory automation, autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality, there have been increasing technical challenges regarding reliability, latency and data rates for existing communication systems. Owing to abundant available bandwidth, millimeter Wave (mmWave) communications can potentially provide reliable communication with an order of magnitude capacity improvement relative to microwave, e.g., sub 6 GHz communications. Though there are many research results showing improved throughputs, the latency and reliability performance of mmWave communications is still not quite clear, especially for finite blocklength regimes. In this paper, we investigate achievable rates of mmWave channels using random coding error exponents. Under the assumption of perfect and imperfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), exact and approximate analytical expressions of achievable rates are derived to capture the relationships among rate, latency and reliability. Furthermore, we show that the achievable rate always increases as the bandwidth increases with perfect CSIR. However, there exists a critical bandwidth that maximizes the achievable rate for non-line-of-sight mmWave signals with imperfect CSIR, beyond which the achievable rate will decrease with increasing bandwidth. For imperfect CSIR, the training symbol length and power allocation factor for maximizing the achievable rate at the training phase are investigated and closed-form expressions for special cases are derived.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has received considerable attention as a promising candidate for future mobile networks. How to reduce traffic delay through cross-layer scheduling in NOMA systems is a challenging issue. In this paper, a cross-layer approach for NOMA systems is designed to fulfill the delay requirements. In particular, scheduling decisions should adapt to the system dynamics. With the distribution information of the system dynamics, the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) is employed to characterize the scheduling decision. The optimal scheduling policy can be obtained by converting the scheduling problem to linear programming. A computational approach based on the Kronecker product is conceived to formulate the linear programming when the dimension of the CMDP is high. Then the optimal delay-power tradeoff can be achieved. Moreover, the optimal decoding order is demonstrated that it can be obtained directly based on the channel states. The threshold-based structure of the optimal scheduling decisions is revealed. Without the distribution information, the Lyapunov approach is exploited to propose an online scheduling policy, where the virtual power queue is used to tackle the power constraint. In NOMA systems, our CMDP-based approach achieves a better performance over the Lyapunov approach by taking advantage of the distribution information.}

	abstract = {Emerging wireless control applications demand for extremely high closed-loop reliability under strict latency constraints, which the conventional Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) solutions with static schedules fail to provide. To overcome this issue and enable data-link layer error control for ultra reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services, we propose a novel protocol: the Closed-Loop ARQ (CLARQ), which forces to accomplish an information exchange round within a fixed loop-back latency, and dynamically re-allocates the remaining resource between uplink and downlink slots upon the result of last uplink transmission. The proposed method guarantees to meet the latency requirement, while delivering high communication reliability and power efficiency. It can be efficiently offline optimized by means of dynamic programming techniques, and is capable of real-time deployment with a low-cost implementation based on look-up tables. Numerical evaluations have verified that CLARQ outperforms baselines with significantly improved closed-loop reliability and reduced energy consumption. Especially, over a Rayleigh channel with 0 dB mean SNR, it is able to provide a closed-loop error rate below 10 −7 within 10 ms loop-back latency, which makes our proposal competitive for practical URLLC applications in future 5G-and-beyond networks.}

	abstract = {Wireless network virtualization is emerging as a promising technology for cellular networks. A key advantage of introducing virtualization in cellular networks is that wireless services can be decoupled from network resources (e.g., infrastructure and spectrum) so that multiple virtual networks can be built using a shared pool of network resources. This paper develops an optimization framework for orchestrating virtualized cellular networks while enabling and exploiting statistical multiplexing. Our proposed framework has two phases: virtual network deployment (static) and statistical multiplexing (adaptive). In the virtual network deployment phase, network resources are aggregated, sliced, and allocated to the virtual networks considering the presence of uncertainty in user equipment (UE) locations and channel conditions, without knowing which realization of UE locations and channel conditions will occur. Once the virtual networks are deployed, each of the aggregated base stations (BSs) performs statistical multiplexing, i.e., allocates excess resources from the over-satisfied slices to the under-satisfied slices, according to the realized channel conditions of associated UEs. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing virtualization frameworks in terms of probabilistically satisfying virtual networks’ rate and coverage demands while minimizing resource over-provisioning, in the presence of uncertainty in UE locations and channel conditions.}

	abstract = {Spectrum mapping has emerged as an important problem in wireless communications, which generates a spectrum map for the spectrum resource analysis and management. Given the constrained transceiver volume and the limited energy consumption, how to effectively reconstruct the spectrum situation by the limited sampling data is a pressing challenge for spectrum mapping. In this paper, by exploiting the sparse nature of spectrum situation, we firstly attempt to solve the three-dimensional (3D) compressed spectrum mapping problem in the way of compressed sensing. Then, we develop a quadrature and right-triangular (QR) pivoting based measurement matrix optimization algorithm. By iteratively selecting new dominant sampling locations, it promotes the recovery accuracy compared to random measurement. After that, we propose a 3D spatial subspace based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm to recover spectrum situation for 3D compressed spectrum mapping. Finally, simulations are presented to show the comparisons in terms of localization, source signal strength recovery, recovery success rate and situation recovery. Results show our proposed 3D spectrum mapping scheme not only effectively reduces the sampling number, but also achieves a high level of spectrum mapping accuracy.}

This paper considers the DADD problem for both uncoded and coded media modulation based mMTC with a slotted access frame structure, where the device activity remains unchanged within one frame. Specifically, due to the slotted access frame structure and the adopted media modulated symbols, the access signals exhibit a doubly structured sparsity in both the time domain and the modulation domain. Inspired by this, a doubly structured approximate message passing (DS-AMP) algorithm is proposed for reliable DADD in the uncoded case. Also, we derive the state evolution of the DS-AMP algorithm to theoretically characterize its performance. As for the coded case, we develop a bit-interleaved coded media modulation scheme and propose an iterative DS-AMP (IDS-AMP) algorithm based on successive inference cancellation (SIC), where the signal components associated with the detected active devices are successively subtracted to improve the data decoding performance. In addition, the channel estimation problem for media modulation based mMTC is discussed and an efficient data-aided channel state information (CSI) update strategy is developed to reduce the training overhead in block fading channels. Finally, simulation results and computational complexity analysis verify the superiority of the proposed DS-AMP algorithm over state-of-the-art algorithms in the uncoded case. Also, our results confirm that the proposed SIC-based IDS-AMP algorithm can enhance the data decoding performance in the coded case and verify the validity of the proposed data-aided CSI update strategy.}

	abstract = {Identification of the type of communication technology and/or modulation scheme based on detected radio signal are challenging problems encountered in a variety of applications including spectrum allocation and radio interference mitigation. They are rendered difficult due to a growing number of emitter types and varied effects of real-world channels upon the radio signal. Existing spectrum monitoring techniques are capable of acquiring massive amounts of radio and real-time spectrum data using compact sensors deployed in a variety of settings. However, state-of-the-art methods that use such data to classify emitter types and detect communication schemes struggle to achieve required levels of accuracy at a computational efficiency that would allow their implementation on low-cost computational platforms. In this paper, we present a learning framework based on an LSTM denoising auto-encoder designed to automatically extract stable and robust features from noisy radio signals, and infer modulation or technology type using the learned features. The algorithm utilizes a compact neural network architecture readily implemented on a low-cost computational platform while exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy. Results on realistic synthetic as well as over-the-air radio data demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably and efficiently classifies received radio signals, often demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the passive beamforming and deployment design for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided full-duplex (FD) wireless system, where an FD access point (AP) communicates with an uplink (UL) user and a downlink (DL) user simultaneously over the same time-frequency dimension with the help of IRS. Under this setup, we consider three deployment cases: 1) two distributed IRSs placed near the UL user and DL user, respectively; 2) one centralized IRS placed near the DL user; 3) one centralized IRS placed near the UL user. In each case, we aim to minimize the weighted sum transmit power consumption of the AP and UL user by jointly optimizing their transmit power and the passive reflection coefficients at the IRS (or IRSs), subject to the UL and DL users’ rate constraints and the uni-modulus constraints on the IRS reflection coefficients. First, we analyze the minimum transmit power required in the IRS-aided FD system under each deployment scheme, and compare it with that of the corresponding half-duplex (HD) system. We show that the FD system outperforms its HD counterpart for all IRS deployment schemes, while the distributed deployment further outperforms the other two centralized deployment schemes. Next, we transform the challenging power minimization problem into an equivalent but more tractable form and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate our analysis as well as the efficacy of the proposed passive beamforming design.}

	abstract = {In dense small cell networks, dynamic time-division duplex (D-TDD) technology has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate the fast variants of volatile traffic conditions because it allows each cell to dynamically configure the uplink and downlink transmission directions. However, the flexibility of traffic configuration introduces additional inter-cell interference, which largely deteriorates network throughput. This paper proposes an interference coordination technology for D-TDD small cell networks by integrating fractional frequency reuse (FFR) with cell clustering. To evaluate the system performance, we develop a theoretical framework to analytically characterize the mean packet throughput (MPT) performance by considering the impact of spatio-temporal traffic. The analytical model can be extended to further study the FFR-based D-TDD, clustered D-TDD, and traditional D-TDD networks. We verify the accuracy of our analysis through simulations and whereby explore the effect of different network parameters. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms clustered D-TDD and traditional D-TDD for both the downlink and uplink spatially averaged MPT, and can significantly improve the performance in uplink while slightly decreasing that in downlink compared with FFR-based D-TDD. Furthermore, by jointly optimizing network parameters, the spatially averaged MPT can be maximized while enduring MPT per user.}

	abstract = {A novel Twitter context aided content caching (TAC) framework is proposed for enhancing the caching efficiency by taking advantage of the legibility and massive volume of Twitter data. For the purpose of promoting the caching efficiency, three machine learning models are proposed to predict latent events and events popularity, utilizing collected Twitter data with geo-tags and geographic information of the adjacent base stations (BSs). Firstly, we propose a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for latent events forecasting because of the superiority of LDA model in natural language processing (NLP). Then, we conceive long short-term memory (LSTM) with skip-gram embedding approach and LSTM with continuous skip-gram-Geo-aware embedding approach for the events popularity forecasting. Furthermore, we associate the predict latent events and the popularity of the events with the caching strategy. Lastly, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based content transmission scheme. Extensive practical experiments demonstrate that: 1) the proposed TAC framework outperforms conventional caching framework and is capable of being employed in practical applications thanks to the associating ability with public interests; 2) the proposed LDA approach conserves superiority for natural language processing (NLP) in Twitter data; 3) the perplexity of the proposed skip-gram based LSTM is lower compared with conventional LDA approach; and 4) evaluation of the model demonstrates that the hit rates of tweets of the model vary from 50% to 65% and the hit rate of the caching contents is up to approximately 75% with smaller caching space compared to conventional algorithms. Simulation results also shows that the proposed NOMA-enabled caching scheme outperforms conventional least frequently used (LFU) scheme by 25%.}

Although there have been some qualitative comparisons between these two technologies, quantitative comparisons are still lacking, especially for massive IoT networks. In this paper, we address this gap in the research literature, and perform a quantitative comparison between BC and RF-EH in massive IoT networks with multiple primary users and multiple low-power devices acting as secondary users. An essential feature of our model is that it includes the interferences caused by the secondary users to the primary users, and we show that these interferences significantly impact the system performance of massive IoT networks. For the RF-EH model, the power requirements of digital-to-analog and signal amplification are taken into account. We pose and solve a power minimization problem for BC, and we show analytically when BC is better than RF-EH. The results of the numerical simulations illustrate the significant benefits of using BC in terms of saving power and supporting massive IoT, compared to using RF-EH. The results also show that the backscatter coefficients of the BC devices must be individually tunable, in order to guarantee good performance of BC.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a joint resource allocation for ultra-reliable and low-latency radio access networks (URLLRANs) with edge computing. Compared with conventional networks, URLLRANs have more restrictive latency and reliability requirements, and always feature short packet communications. It is a challenging work to provide edge computing services in URLLRANs, since the processing and transmission delay as well as packet loss during computation and communications should all be taken into considerations. Along these lines, to specify the trade-off between latency and reliability, this paper defines computation rates and transmission rates for short packets. Different from the existing work, the proposal takes effective information as well as energy consumption as performance metrics based on the definition. The packet request rates, computation latency, service rates, communication power, blocklength, and transmission information amounts are jointly optimized to reduce energy consumption and meanwhile generate more effective information for both the computation system and the communication system. To solve the NP-hard problem, the locally optimal solution and global optimal solution are both derived. Simulation results validate the performance advantage of the proposal and also indicate that the locally optimal solution can greatly reduce the computation complexity with only a small performance loss when compared with the global optimal solution.}

	abstract = {To support multifarious vehicular applications, content sharing among vehicles or between vehicles and infrastructures can enable efficient service provisioning. In this work, we investigate joint communication, caching, and computing (3C) resource allocation to support efficient content sharing between content providers (CPs) and content requesters (CRs) in vehicular networks. To tackle the high complexity of joint 3C resource allocation, we decouple the problem into a long-term content caching strategy to allocate caching resources plus a method for short-term CP-CR pairing and corresponding communication-computing resource allocation. Specifically, a popularity and social similarity (P-SS) based caching strategy is proposed by incorporating both physical and social information. As selfish CRs may refuse to reveal their quality of service (QoS) requirements to the CPs and lead to the information asymmetry, we adopt contract theory to allocate communication and computing resources for each potential CR-CP pair. We then propose a stable-matching based algorithm to match CPs and CRs for efficient content sharing. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can effectively solve the problem with low complexity.}

Supposing the eavesdropper is equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas, we jointly exploit the role of inherent multiuser interference and artificial noise (AN) to enhance security, and propose a noniterative secure transceiver design under a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) framework. The quantity relationship of system parameters is then analyzed to ensure feasibility. And the achievable secrecy rate is then derived without any knowledge of the eavesdropper. Finally, to balance the power allocated to AN and secrecy data, a power allocation strategy aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate is designed, while guaranteeing legitimate users the required quality of service. With the adopted design, both the multiuser interference and AN are leveraged to facilitate communication security such that the proposed secure transceiver design can adapt to changes in eavesdropping antennas. Extensive numerical results have verified our analysis and demonstrated that the proposed power allocation strategy outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the achievable secrecy rate.}

Our goal is to design efficient distributed scheduling algorithms to maximize the network utility, which is a function of the achieved throughput by the user equipment (UEs), subject to the average and instantaneous power consumption constraints of the BSs. We propose a Media Access Control (MAC) and a power allocation/adaptation mechanism utilizing the Lyapunov stochastic optimization framework and non-cooperative games. In particular, we first decompose the original utility maximization problem into two sub-optimization problems for each time frame, which are a convex optimization problem and a non-convex optimization problem, respectively. By formulating the distributed scheduling problem as a non-cooperative game where each BS is a player attempting to optimize its own utility, we provide a distributed solution to the non-convex sub-optimization problem via finding the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the game whose weights are determined optimally by the Lyapunov optimization framework. Finally, we conduct simulation under various network settings to show the effectiveness of the proposed game-based beam scheduling algorithm in comparison to that of several reference schemes.}

The localization problem is first recast into a convex form by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, the solution of which converges to global optimum. We also propose a closed-form solution warranting global convergence, in which the object position is estimated by two stages. In the stage-one solution, the auxiliary variables are introduced to transform the nonlinear problem into a linear form. The stage-two solution is further designed to refine the estimates obtained from the stage-one solution. The minimum number of receivers and the complexity are also analyzed for the proposed solutions. The simulated results show that the SDR and closed-form solutions provide good estimates for the object position and transmitter positions.

Recently, tandem spreading multiple access (TSMA) has been raised for mIoT without mobility which achieves high connectivity and reliability. Meanwhile, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation shows its potential to combat high mobility in point-to-point communication systems. To this end, in this article, we jointly design OTFS and TSMA, and propose OTFS-TSMA for HSR mIoT. The principle of OTFS-TSMA transceiver is described, where OTFS and TSMA are improved respectively. Especially, two-dimension cyclic shift of DD domain elements in OTFS is transformed into cyclic shift of Doppler elements, segments, symbols and chips by the proposed novel resource allocation and interleaving schemes. Data recovery approaches of the four categories of cyclic shift are given, thus massive user interference is mitigated. Simulation results illustrate that both high user connectivity and transmission reliability in HSR massive IoT can be achieved by OTFS-TSMA.}

To this end, we formulate the joint design of the transmit power and the IRS reflection coefficients by taking into account the communication covertness for the cases with global channel state information (CSI) and without a warden’s instantaneous CSI. For the case of global CSI, we first prove that perfect covertness is achievable with the aid of the IRS even for a single-antenna transmitter, which is impossible without an IRS. Then, we develop a penalty successive convex approximation (PSCA) algorithm to tackle the design problem. Considering the high complexity of the PSCA algorithm, we further propose a low-complexity two-stage algorithm, where analytical expressions for the transmit power and the IRS’s reflection coefficients are derived. For the case without the warden’s instantaneous CSI, we first derive the covertness constraint analytically facilitating the optimal phase shift design. Then, we consider three hardware-related constraints on the IRS’s reflection amplitudes and determine their optimal designs together with the optimal transmit power. Our examination shows that significant performance gain can be achieved by deploying an IRS into covert communications.}

	abstract = {Synchronization is a fundamental procedure in cellular systems whereby user equipment (UE) acquires the time and frequency information required to decode the data transmitted by a base station (BS). Due to the small antenna aperture at millimeter wave (mmWave), large antenna arrays are used to compensate for the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. For this reason, synchronization is often performed jointly with beam training as in 5G New Radio (NR) to boost the receive SNR. However, if the mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel is to be estimated, then synchronization must be performed in the low SNR regime owing to the lack of directional beamforming during compressive channel estimation. Current mmWave channel estimation algorithms implicitly take synchronization for granted, which is a not practical assumption in the low SNR regime. To solve this problem, this work proposes the first synchronization framework for hybrid mmWave MIMO that is robust to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PHN) synchronization errors. We propose two novel multi-stage algorithms to jointly estimate the various unknown parameters, based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using the QuaDRiGa 5G NR channel simulator, we show that compressive channel estimation without prior synchronization is possible, and the proposed approaches outperform current solutions for joint beam training and synchronization currently considered in 5G NR.}

	abstract = {Despite the narrowbeam nature of Terahertz (THz) communications, the physical layer security in the THz band is challenging when eavesdroppers are inside the beam radiation sector. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN)-based self-interference cancellation (SIC)-free receiver artificial noise (AN) assisted mechanism is proposed to address the in-beam security challenge, by considering randomly distributed eavesdroppers in THz secure communications. By exploiting the different temporal broadening effects of the AN signals at distinct distances, the SIC can be saved with a proper signal detection design rather than using conventional high-complexity cancellation techniques. To combat the non-linearity and non-convexity of the optimization problem, the system parameters including carrier frequency, power of transmission signal and AN signal power, and frame time are designed by an efficient deep neural network (DNN) algorithm to minimize the secrecy outage probability. Numerical results demonstrate that the maximum secrecy rate of our proposed DNN-powered SIC-free receiver AN scheme is up to 3.3 bps/Hz over 10 m transmission when the eavesdropper is in close proximity. Moreover, the secrecy outage probability is less than 0.5% when the eavesdropper density is 0.001 per square meter, which is approximately 33% lower than that of conventional transmitter AN schemes.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a potential technology to build programmable wireless environment in future communication systems. In this paper, we consider a multi-IRS-assisted multi-base station (multi-BS) multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) downlink communication system, exploiting IRS to extend mmWave signal coverage to blind spots. Considering the impact of IRS on user association in multi-BS mmWave systems, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing passive beamforming at IRS, power allocation and user association. This leads to an intractable non-convex problem, for which to tackle we propose a computationally affordable iterative algorithm, capitalizing on alternating optimization, sequential fractional programming (SFP) and forward-reverse auction (FRA). In particular, passive beamforming at IRS is optimized by utilizing the SFP method, power allocation is solved through means of standard convex optimization method, and user association is handled by the network optimization based FRA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant performance gains, e.g., it can provide up to 147% higher sum rate compared with the benchmark and 116% higher energy efficiency compared with amplify-and-forward relay.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has drawn worldwide attention because of its attractive capability to improve the electromagnetic propagation environment and surprising advantages of low cost and low power consumption. Recently, RIS is further advanced to realize the independent control of two orthogonal polarizations in real time. In this paper, we study the dual-polarized RIS-assisted mobile communication system and investigate its performance under practical polarization imperfections. Specifically, we provide a tight upper bound of the ergodic spectrum efficiency. Through the bound, we find that the performance is greatly dependent on the polarization imperfections and RIS phase shifts of the RIS-assisted link, when the number of base station antennas is large enough and the deterministic component exists in the RIS-assisted link. On basis of this tight bound, we propose an approximate optimal RIS phase shift design to maximize the ergodic spectrum efficiency upper bound and emphasize the necessity to make phase adjustment between two polarizations of the RIS. Theoretical analysis further gives guidance for the configuration of RIS. Numerical results demonstrate that the upper bound is very tight and the proposed phase shift design with adjustment is approximate optimal.}

	abstract = {The use of Wi-Fi signals for human sensing has gained significant interest over the past decade. Such techniques provide affordable and reliable solutions for healthcare-focused events such as vital sign detection, prevention of falls and long-term monitoring of chronic diseases, among others. Currently, there are two major approaches for Wi-Fi sensing: (1) passive Wi-Fi radar (PWR) which uses well established techniques from bistatic radar, and channel state information (CSI) based wireless sensing (SENS) which exploits human-induced variations in the communication channel between a pair of transmitter and receiver. However, there has not been a comprehensive study to understand and compare the differences in terms of effectiveness and limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we present the fundamentals of the two systems with associated methodologies and signal processing. A thorough measurement campaign was carried out to evaluate the human activity detection performance of both systems. Experimental results show that SENS system provides better detection performance in a line-of-sight (LoS) condition, whereas PWR system performs better in a non-LoS (NLoS) setting. Furthermore, based on our findings, we recommend that future Wi-Fi sensing applications should leverage the advantages from both PWR and SENS systems.}

The outage event of SatCom link connecting to a network is more critical in an infrastructure-deficient remote area. In this paper, we analyze outage probability (OP) and symbol error rate (SER) over SatCom downlink channels when the users are randomly located in single beam and multibeam area. The downlink beams will suffer from propagation loss and the shadowed-Rician fading depending on the user location which is assumed to follow a Poisson point process. For mathematically tractable, informative, and insightful interpretation, we obtain the asymptotic OP and SER expressions of user link under several channel conditions in the high power regime. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the analysis and show the accuracy of the asymptotic results.}

Resource allocation in multicarrier NOMA systems is a non-deterministic polynomial time-hard problem requiring exhaustive search, which has prohibitive computational complexity. Instead, efficient algorithms that provide a good trade-off between system performance and implementation practicality are needed. In this paper, exact values of the optimal channel gain ratios between a pair of NOMA users are presented for the first time for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. Further, numerical limits are derived for the values of channel gain ratios that fulfill the system constraints. These findings are used to propose a user pairing algorithm with quasi-linear complexity. Further, a novel scheme for data rate and continuous power allocation is proposed. Through numerical simulations, it is proved that the proposed scheme yields an achievable sum-rate close to the performance of exhaustive search, and it outperforms other suboptimal resource allocation schemes.}

In this paper, we present a new system, named IoTAthena, to unveil IoT device activities from raw network traffic consisting of timestamped IP packets. IoTAthena characterizes each IoT device activity using an activity signature consisting of an ordered sequence of IP packets with inter-packet time intervals. IoTAthena has two novel polynomial time algorithms, sigMatch and actExtract . For any given signature, sigMatch can capture all matches of the signature in the raw network traffic. Using sigMatch as a subfunction, actExtract can accurately unveil the sequence of various IoT device activities from the raw network traffic. Using the network traffic of heterogeneous IoT devices collected at the router of a real-world smart home testbed and a public IoT dataset, we demonstrate that IoTAthena is able to characterize and generate activity signatures of IoT device activities and accurately unveil the sequence of IoT device activities from raw network traffic.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of resource allocation for a wireless communication network with distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this network, multiple RISs are spatially distributed to serve wireless users and the energy efficiency of the network is maximized by dynamically controlling the on-off status of each RIS as well as optimizing the reflection coefficients matrix of the RISs. This problem is posed as a joint optimization problem of transmit beamforming and RIS control, whose goal is to maximize the energy efficiency under minimum rate constraints of the users. To solve this problem, two iterative algorithms are proposed for the single-user case and multi-user case. For the single-user case, the phase optimization problem is solved by using a successive convex approximation method, which admits a closed-form solution at each step. Moreover, the optimal RIS on-off status is obtained by using the dual method. For the multi-user case, a low-complexity greedy searching method is proposed to solve the RIS on-off optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves up to 33% and 68% gains in terms of the energy efficiency in both single-user and multi-user cases compared to the conventional RIS scheme and amplify-and-forward relay scheme, respectively.}

	abstract = {Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a widely adopted framework for training an artificial intelligence (AI) model distributively at edge devices to leverage their data while preserving their data privacy. The execution of a power-hungry learning task at energy-constrained devices is a key challenge confronting the implementation of FEEL. To tackle the challenge, we propose the solution of powering devices using wireless power transfer (WPT). To derive guidelines on deploying the resultant wirelessly powered FEEL (WP-FEEL) system, this work aims at the derivation of the tradeoff between the model convergence and the settings of power sources in two scenarios: 1) the transmission power and density of power-beacons (dedicated charging stations) if they are deployed, or otherwise 2) the transmission power of a server (access-point). The development of the proposed analytical framework relates the accuracy of distributed stochastic-gradient estimation to the WPT settings, the randomness in both communication and WPT links, and devices’ computation capacities. Furthermore, the local-computation at devices (i.e., mini-batch size and processor clock frequency) is optimized to efficiently use the harvested energy for gradient estimation. The resultant learning-WPT tradeoffs reveal the simple scaling laws of the model-convergence rate with respect to the transferred energy as well as the devices’ computational energy efficiencies. The results provide useful guidelines on WPT provisioning to yield a guaranteer on learning performance. They are corroborated by experimental results using a real dataset.}

	abstract = {Multi-Gbps 60 GHz millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, are considered as the enabling technology for emerging applications such as untethered VR and 4K/8K Miracast. However, user motion, and even orientation change, can cause mis-alignment between mmWave transceivers’ directional beams and thus severe link outage. Within the practical 3D spaces, the combination of location and orientation dynamics leads to the exponential growth of beam searching complexity, which substantially exacerbates the outage. In this paper, we first measure the impact of 3D motion on 60 GHz link performance in the context of VR and Miracast applications. We find that 3D motion exhibits inherent non-predictability, so conventional beam steering solutions are no longer effective. Therefore, we propose a model-driven 3D beam-steering mechanism called Parallel Scanner (PSCAN), which can maintain high performance for mobile 60 GHz links. To enable PSCAN, we first discover and prove a hidden interaction between 3D beams and the spatial channel profile of 60 GHz radios. Leveraging on which, PSCAN strategically scans the 3D space to reduce the search latency by more than one order of magnitude. Experiment results based on a custom-built 60 GHz platform demonstrate PSCAN’s remarkable throughput gain, up to\n5×\n, compared with the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {The orthogonal-time-frequency-space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising modulation scheme for high mobility wireless communications. To harvest the time and frequency diversity promised by OTFS, some promising detectors, especially message passing based ones, have been developed by taking advantage of the sparsity of the channel in the delay-Doppler domain. However, when the number of channel paths is relatively large or fractional Doppler shifts have to be considered, the complexity of existing detectors is a concern, and the existing message passing based detectors suffer from performance loss. In this work, we investigate the design of OTFS detectors based on the approximate message passing (AMP). In particular, leveraging the unitary AMP (UAMP), we design new detectors that enjoy the structure of the channel matrix and allow efficient implementation. In addition, the estimation of noise variance is incorporated into the UAMP-based detectors. Thanks to the robustness of UAMP relative to AMP, the UAMP-based detectors deliver superior performance, and outperform state-of-the-art detectors significantly. We also investigate iterative joint detection and decoding in a coded OTFS system, where the OTFS detectors are integrated into a powerful turbo receiver, leading to considerable performance gains.}

	abstract = {In millimeter-wave (mm-wave) cellular networks, directional antenna arrays are typically adopted to mitigate the severe propagation loss. However, the interference caused by such highly directional beams may, in turn, result in a significant number of transmission failures, especially for dense networks. To tackle this problem, we propose two inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) schemes in mm-wave bands: one is merely based on the path loss incorporating the blockage effect (PL-ICIC); the other considers both path loss and directivity gain (PG-ICIC). To fully investigate both schemes, we first derive an exact expression for the success probability (reliability) of the typical (served) user. We further provide an asymptotic analysis for the success probability and propose an effective approximation based on the asymptotic signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) gain relative to no ICIC. Secondly, to incorporate the cost of ICIC schemes, we derive the approximate normalized throughput taking into account that some users cannot be served due to limited resources. Numerical results show that the two proposed schemes provide significant reliability improvements in the low-SIR regime, and the higher the number of antennas, the wider the SIR range for which there is an improvement. In addition, compared with PL-ICIC, PG-ICIC balances the available resources among all users well.}

	abstract = {With the help of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), the number of connections of the beamspace multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can be improved with enhanced sum-rate performance, which constitutes beamspace MIMO-NOMA. Thus, most relevant papers focus on improving the system sum rate, which may inflict unbearable rate loss to weak users. To ensure the achievable rates of weak users, we maximize and analyze the minimal rate of the system in the single-beam case as well as the multi-beam case, where two completely different phenomena are revealed. Particularly, in the single-beam case, the maximized minimal rate of the beamspace MIMO-NOMA always grows rapidly with the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and is larger than that of the beamspace MIMO using orthogonal multiple access (beamspace MIMO-OMA). However, in the multi-beam case, the maximized minimal rate of the beamspace MIMO-NOMA grows slower and slower in the high-SNR region, where it is smaller than that of the beamspace MIMO-OMA. To explain this difference, it is disclosed that the intra-beam interference in the single-beam case is of successive pattern , which is proved to have no limit on the max-min rate. In contrast, the inter-beam interference in the multi-beam case is of mutual pattern , which is proved to restrict the max-min rate to a derived upper bound.}

	abstract = {The next generations of mobile networks will be deployed as ultra-dense networks, to match the demand for increased capacity and the challenges that communications in the higher portion of the spectrum (i.e., the mmWave band) introduce. Ultra-dense networks, however, require pervasive, high-capacity backhaul solutions, and deploying fiber optic to all base stations is generally considered to be too expensive for network operators. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has thus introduced Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), a wireless backhaul solution in which the access and backhaul links share the same hardware, protocol stack, and also spectrum. The multiplexing of different links in the same frequency bands, however, introduces interference and capacity sharing issues, thus calling for the introduction of advanced scheduling and coordination schemes. This paper proposes a semi-centralized resource allocation scheme for IAB networks, designed to be flexible, with low complexity, and compliant with the 3GPP IAB specifications. We develop a version of the Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) problem that can be applied on a spanning tree that represents the IAB network and whose complexity is linear in the number of IAB-nodes. The proposed solution is compared with state-of-the-art distributed approaches through end-to-end, full-stack system-level simulations with a 3GPP-compliant channel model, protocol stack, and a diverse set of user applications. The results show that our scheme can increase the throughput of cell-edge users up to 3 times, while decreasing the overall network congestion with an end-to-end delay reduction of up to 25 times.}

	abstract = {Wireless links adapt the data transmission parameters to the dynamic channel state – this is called link adaptation . Classical link adaptation relies on tuning parameters that are challenging to configure for optimal link performance. Recently, reinforcement learning has been proposed to automate link adaptation, where the transmission parameters are modeled as discrete arms of a multi-armed bandit. In this context, we propose a latent learning model for link adaptation that exploits the correlation between data transmission parameters. Further, motivated by the recent success of Thompson sampling for multi-armed bandit problems, we propose a latent Thompson sampling (LTS) algorithm that quickly learns the optimal parameters for a given channel state. We extend LTS to fading wireless channels through a tuning-free mechanism that automatically tracks the channel dynamics. In numerical evaluations with fading wireless channels, LTS improves the link throughout by up to 100% compared to the state-of-the-art link adaptation algorithms.}

Using Myerson’s lemma and the concept of virtual welfare maximization, we develop an optimal dominant-strategy incentive-compatible mechanism for the AP to maximize its expected revenue, based on the devices’ bid profiles, valuation distributions, demand profiles, and channel state information. In so doing, we formulate the revenue maximization problem, which is a mixed-integer non-linear program, and propose an efficient Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm to solve the problem using semidefinite relaxation technique in each branch. Since the problem has exponential time complexity, using BnB algorithms can be impractical for real-time applications. To circumvent this, a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed, and trained to predict the optimal mechanism for beamforming the data and the energy towards the information and energy devices, respectively. We use the BnB algorithm to solve the problem offline and populate the training dataset. The proposed DNN architecture is indeed a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained well to map the heterogeneous input to the desired output with high accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic iterative solution whose accuracy performance is comparable to that of the DNN-based solution. The heuristic solution has polynomial time complexity whereas the DNN-based solution has linear time complexity.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a new medium access control (MAC) protocol for multi-channel heterogeneous networks (HetNets) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), referred to as multi-channel deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (MC-DLMA). Specifically, we consider a HetNet where different radio networks adopt different MAC protocols to transmit data packets to a common access point on different wireless channels. Three key challenges for the MC-DLMA node are (i) no environmental knowledge is known in advance; (ii) the channels in HetNets are allocated to nodes using different MAC protocols; (iii) the capacities of different channels may be different. The main goal of MC-DLMA is to find an optimal access policy to transmit on those pre-allocated channels and expedite more efficient spectrum utilization. Due to the complex temporal correlation of spectrum states in HetNets, the traditional DRL technique, e.g., original deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, is no longer applicable to our problem. In our MC-DLMA design, an advanced class of recurrent neural network, termed as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), is embedded into the original DQN technique to aggregate observations over time and reason the underlying temporal feature in multi-channel HetNets. Furthermore, we analytically give the optimal spectrum access patterns and derive the optimal throughputs in various HetNet scenarios. With judicious definitions of the state, action, and reward function in the parlance of the DRL framework, simulation results show that MC-DLMA can (i) find the optimal spectrum access strategies in various HetNets, (ii) outperform the random access policy, the whittle index policy, and the original DQN, (iii) perform cooperative transmission in a fully distributed manner in the presence of multiple agents, and (iv) adapt well to the environmental changes.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) based federated learning (FL) is capable of achieving fast model aggregation by exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple-access channels. However, the model aggregation performance is severely limited by the unfavorable wireless propagation channels. In this paper, we propose to leverage intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to achieve fast yet reliable model aggregation for AirComp-based FL. To optimize the learning performance, we present the convergence analysis of our proposed IRS-assisted AirComp-based FL system, based on which we propose to maximize the number of scheduled devices of each communication round under certain mean-squared error (MSE) requirements. To tackle the formulated highly-intractable problem, we propose a two-step optimization framework. Specifically, we induce the sparsity of device selection in the first step, followed by solving a series of MSE minimization problems to find the maximum feasible device set in the second step. We then propose an alternating optimization framework, supported by the difference-of-convex programming for low-rank optimization, to efficiently design the aggregation beamformers at the BS and phase shifts at the IRS. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm and the deployment of an IRS can achieve a higher FL prediction accuracy than the baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {We thoroughly investigate the outage performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications by exploiting statistical channel state information (CSI). Kornecker channel model is adopted to characterize the impact of spatial correlations among MIMO antennas and reconfigurable reflectors. Mellin transform and random matrix theory are then utilized to derive the outage probability, with which we further conduct the asymptotic outage analysis to obtain insightful findings. In particular, the asymptotic analysis reveals that the number of reflecting elements at the RIS should not be smaller than the total number of MIMO transmit and receive antennas to get rid of the rank deficiency of the cascaded MIMO channels. Moreover, the asymptotic outage probability is a monotonically increasing and convex function with respect to the transmission rate. The numerical outcomes not only corroborate our analytical results, but also demonstrate the negative impact of the spatial correlation and the benefit of increasing the number of reconfigurable reflectors. Finally, we apply the asymptotic results to optimally devise the phase shifts with a low computational complexity.}

	abstract = {We propose a comprehensive scheme for realizing a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with dual-polarized antennas in frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode. Dual-polarized arrays are commonly employed due to the favorable property that, in principle, they can double the number of channel spatial degrees of freedom with a less-than-proportional increase in array size. However, processing a dual-polarized massive MIMO channel is demanding due to the high channel dimension and the lack of Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL) channel reciprocity in FDD mode. In particular, the difficulty arises in common channel training and DL precoding in a multi-user setup. To address this, we develop a unified framework consisting of three steps: (1) covariance estimation to efficiently estimate the UL covariance from noisy UL pilots; (2) a UL-DL covariance transformation method that obtains the DL covariance from the estimated UL covariance, eliminating the need for DL channel covariance training via pilot transmission; (3) a joint multi-user DL channel training method, which enables the BS to estimate effective DL channels given any protocol-specific pilot dimension and to use them for interference-free DL beamforming and data transmission. Through extensive simulations, we show that our scheme is applicable to a variety of communication scenarios in terms of the number of antennas, UL and DL pilot dimensions, and angular scattering properties. Unlike the common trend in the literature, we do not make strong structural assumptions about the wireless channel (such as angular sparsity), ensuring a general treatment of the problem.}

Most works in this area investigate the fundamental performance limits of coded caching from an information-theoretic perspective. In this paper, from a practical perspective, we focus on the design and analysis of the coded caching scheme in large-scale stochastic networks with dynamic traffic. Aiming at the challenges of the large number of users, dynamic packet requests, and distance-dependent interference, the packet caching scheme and packet delivery scheme are jointly designed to ensure the availability of the coded caching gain. To characterize the coded caching performance, the queue dynamic of the packet requests and channel state are first analyzed. Then by combining the successive group decoding theory and stochastic geometry approach, the network interference is characterized and the successful transmission probability of the multicast coded signal is further derived. Moreover, the coded caching scheme is optimized to minimize the average delay of the packet request, which is proved to ensure service fairness and reduce the complexities of network performance analysis. The analytical and numerical results provide useful insights for the provisioning and planning of the coded caching network.}

Being able to combat the distance limitation with reduced hardware complexity, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid dynamic array-of-subarrays (DAoSA) beamforming are a promising technology for THz wireless communications. However, fundamental challenges in THz DAoSA systems include millidegree-level three-dimensional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and millisecond-level beam tracking with reduced pilot overhead. To address these challenges, an off-grid subspace-based DAoSA-MUSIC and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) methods are proposed for DoA estimation. Furthermore, by exploiting the temporal correlations of the channel variation, an augmented DAoSA-MUSIC-T and a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) solutions are further developed to realize DoA tracking. Extensive simulations and comparisons on the proposed subspace- and deep-learning-based algorithms are conducted. Results show that both DAoSA-MUSIC and DCNN achieve super-resolution DoA estimation and outperform existing solutions, while DCNN performs better than DAoSA-MUSIC at a high signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, DAoSA-MUSIC-T and ConvLSTM can capture fleeting DoA variation with an accuracy of 0.1° within milliseconds, and reduce 50% pilot overhead. Compared to DAoSA-MUSIC-T, ConvLSTM can tolerate large angle variation and remain robust over a long duration.}

When wireless systems operate in dynamic environments, the DNN has to be re-trained frequently and hence training complexity should be low. A promising approach to deal with this issue is to construct DNNs with prior knowledge. In this paper, we show that the power allocation policy in multi-cell-multi-user systems exhibits a combination of permutation equivariance properties, which can be harnessed by graph neural networks (GNNs). In particular, we construct a heterogeneous graph and resort to heterogeneous GNN for learning the policy, whose outputs are only equivariant to some permutations of vertexes rather than arbitrary permutations as homogeneous GNNs. We prove that the properties of the functions learned by existing heterogeneous GNN for the formulated graph are inconsistent with the properties of the policy. To avoid the performance degradation by embedding wrong priors, we design a parameter sharing scheme for heterogeneous GNN such that the learned relationship satisfies the desired properties. Simulation results show that the sample and computational complexities for training the constructed GNN are much lower than existing DNNs to achieve the same sum rate.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is one of the main tasks in realizing practical intelligent reflecting surface-assisted multi-user communication (IRS-MUC) systems. However, different from traditional communication systems, an IRS-MUC system generally involves a cascaded channel with a sophisticated statistical distribution. In this case, the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator requires the calculation of a multidimensional integration which is intractable to be implemented in practice. To further improve the channel estimation performance, in this paper, we model the channel estimation as a denoising problem and adopt a deep residual learning (DReL) approach to implicitly learn the residual noise for recovering the channel coefficients from the noisy pilot-based observations. To this end, we first develop a versatile DReL-based channel estimation framework where a deep residual network (DRN)-based MMSE estimator is derived in terms of Bayesian philosophy. As a realization of the developed DReL framework, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DRN (CDRN) is then proposed for channel estimation in IRS-MUC systems, in which a CNN denoising block equipped with an element-wise subtraction structure is specifically designed to exploit both the spatial features of the noisy channel matrices and the additive nature of the noise simultaneously. In particular, an explicit expression of the proposed CDRN is derived and analyzed in terms of Bayesian estimation to characterize its properties theoretically. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of the optimal MMSE estimator requiring the availability of the prior probability density function of channel.}

	abstract = {The network control plays a vital role in the mega satellite constellation (MSC) to coordinate massive network nodes to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of operations and services for future space wireless communications networks. One of the critical issues in satellite network control is how to design an optimal network control structure (ONCS) by configuring the least number of controllers to achieve efficient control interaction within a limited number of hops. Considering the wide coverage, rising capacity, and no geographical constraints of space platforms, this paper contributes to designing the ONCS by constructing an optimal space control network (SCN) to improve the temporal effectiveness of network control. Specifically, we formulate the optimal SCN construction problem from the perspective of satellite coverage factors, and apply geometric topology analysis to derive both the conditions for constructing the optimal SCN and the formulaic conclusions for SCN and MSC configurations (i.e., scale and structure). From numerical results, we investigate the tradeoff between network scale, the number of controllers, and control delays in several satellite network control scenarios, to provide guidelines for the MSC control. We also design the optimal SCN for an existing MSC system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ONCS.}

	abstract = {The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicular communications offers the possibility to unleash the potential of future proliferating vehicular applications. However, the high-mobility-induced rapidly varying channel state information (CSI) has been making it challenging to obtain the accurate instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) and to cope with the incurable high signaling overhead. The situation may become worse when the RIS with a large number of passive reflecting elements is deployed. To overcome this challenge, we investigate in this paper a robust transmission scheme for the time-varying RIS-aided mmWave vehicular communications, in which, specifically, a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves vehicle user equipments (VUEs) with the help of RIS at the mmWave frequency. The uplink average achievable rate is maximized relying only upon the imperfect knowledge of statistical CSI. Considering the time-varying characteristics, we first propose an effective transmission protocol by reasonably configuring the time-scale of CSI acquisition in order to significantly relax the frequency of channel information updates, which constitutes one of the most critical issues in RIS-aided vehicular communications. Then, the formulated resource allocation problem is discussed in the single- and multi-VUE case, respectively. To be specific, for the single-VUE case, a closed-form expression of the average rate is derived by extracting the statistical characteristics of mmWave channels, and an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed. For the multi-VUE case, we develop an efficient algorithm, called JAPMC, to circumvent the unavailability of the closed-form of the objective function and probabilistic constraint by constructing quadratic surrogates of that. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Massive access is a critical design challenge of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In this paper, we consider the grant-free uplink transmission of an IoT network with a multiple-antenna base station (BS) and a large number of single-antenna IoT devices. Taking into account the sporadic nature of IoT devices, we formulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) problem as a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. This problem can be solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however either suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational complexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we map the original iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into an unrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence rate and computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the proposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by reducing the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the simplified unrolled deep neural network structures enjoy a linear convergence rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble signatures show that the proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of the convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy.}

	abstract = {We introduce a set of multiple access protocols, called hierarchical multiple access (HiMA) , which are based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA), optimized for the hierarchical network scenario. The proposed protocols can be efficiently utilized in various network configurations with an hierarchical form, such as relay networks, cloud-radio access networks (C-RANs), and fog-radio access networks (F-RANs). In particular, C-RANs and, more recently, F-RANs are regarded as promising paradigms to fully utilize the edge of the networks. Therefore, the implementation of novel multiple access protocols to properly exploit these configurations is critical for the fifth generation and beyond of wireless access. Furthermore, the resource allocation problem is formulated for each protocol with respect to the timeslot duration and power. As a result two fairness metrics are optimized, namely max-min rate fairness and proportional fairness. Finally, numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the joint design in the hierarchical network and an interesting trade-off is identified between fairness and achievable rate. Interestingly, despite NOMA being a very promising alternative to conventional multiple access schemes, the protocol that is solely based on NOMA does not always outperform the rest.}

While the available energy, which relies on EH, becomes an extra nonnegligible factor in resource allocation. Besides, we integrate uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with D2D communication to provide multiple access for D2D transmitters for more efficient IoT service and more efficient utilization of limited spectrum. In this scenario, ingenious resource allocation approach is a key focus for utilizing the advantages in energy and spectral efficiency. Aiming to investigate the inherent resource allocation issue, we set our goal as maximizing the energy efficiency for both NOMA-based D2D groups and cellular users (CUs), where the power and spectrum allocation are both considered. Then we propose a two-stage game approach, which is theoretically proved to be capable of obtaining the equilibrium and a stable result, to solve the unilateral energy efficiency maximization problems. Besides, an energy-aware screening method is proposed to reduce the computations based on the available energy of user equipment. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method is verified through elaborated simulation results.}

	abstract = {To relieve the stress on channel estimation and decoding complexity in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, user grouping problem is investigated in this paper, where access points (APs) based on time-division duplex (TDD) are considered to serve users on different time resources and the same frequency resource. In addition, when quality of service (QoS) requirements are considered, widely-used max-min power control is no longer applicable. We derive the minimum power constraints under diverse QoS requirements considering user grouping. Based on the analysis, we formulate the joint power and user grouping problem under QoS constraints, aiming at minimizing the total transmit power. A generalized benders decomposition (GBD) based algorithm is proposed, where the primal problem and master problem are solved iteratively to approach the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that by user grouping, the number of users served in cell-free MIMO systems can be as much as the number of APs without increasing the complexity of channel estimation and decoding. Furthermore, with the proposed user grouping strategy, the power consumption can be reduced by 2–3 dB compared with the reference user grouping strategy, and by 7 dB compared with the total transmit power without grouping.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a pre-coded multi-carrier\nM\n-ary chaotic vector cyclic shift keying (PC-MC-\nM\n-CVCSK) transceiver for reliable information transmissions. In this design, we exploit the principle of diagonalization to combat noises and interferences. At the PC-MC-\nM\n-CVCSK transmitter, we propose to precode the\nM\n-ary modulated symbols based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the reverse matrix of an eigenvalue matrix. Meanwhile, the chaotic generator outputs chaotic sequences, which are then cyclically shifted and used to modulate precoded symbols. At the receiver, reverse operations are conducted to recover the data. Moreover, we prove that a circulant matrix can be constructed by selecting the cyclic shift length, while the DFT aided processing will diagonalize the circulant matrix. Thanks to the diagonalization design, the inner product of information-bearing chaotic vectors becomes zero, thus signals can be orthogonalized to suppress interferences. Furthermore, theoretical performances of the proposed transceiver, including the bit error rate (BER), the symbol rate, the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency, and the computational complexity are analyzed. Simulation results validate the exact analysis. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the proposed PC-MC-\nM\n-CVCSK system outperforms the counterpart schemes, which can provide\nM\n-ary high symbol rate transmission services with enhanced reliability performances.}

	abstract = {The integration of blockchain and mobile edge computing (MEC), as a secure, efficient, and reliable edge computing paradigm, has been widely applied in many applications, such as large-scale Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and smart grid. However, due to the restricted transaction throughput of blockchain, the combination of blockchain and MEC in most existing works cannot support applications with frequent transaction requirements. In this paper, we propose an integrated blockchain and MEC (IBM) framework based on a space-structured ledger to meet the transaction demands for IoT applications. In the framework, a collaborative mining process is designed, where we consider the cooperation between mobile devices (MDs) and MEC servers. To promote mining efficiency, we further develop a high-performance consensus mechanism called reputation-based proof of work (Re-PoW), in which differentiated mining targets are assigned according to the reputation of MDs. In the Re-PoW consensus mechanism, heterogeneous capabilities and historical behaviors of MDs are all considered for accurately evaluating their reputation. In addition, we present an alternating optimization algorithm by jointly optimizing bandwidth allocation and computation resource allocation to further enhance the performance of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant throughput improvement.}

However, bit error rate (BER) expressions of QAM for SLJ have not been presented in previous studies. In this paper, we derive the exact BER expressions of QAM considering phase coherent and noncoherent scenarios under SLJ. Using the derived expressions, we investigate the SLJ order that maximizes BER of QAM for jamming-to-signal ratio (JSR). Further, we present BER of QAM with tone jamming and show that tone jamming is a special case of noncoherent SLJ. In addition, we use a probability density function of the SLJ amplitude to show that the high order noncoherent SLJ is similar to noise jamming. To increase BER in a low JSR region, we present a BER expression of QAM when SLJ exists in a pulse form. Using the derived expression, we investigate the order and pulse duration ratio to maximize BER for JSR. The derived expressions are verified using computer simulations.}

	abstract = {The benefits of end-to-end learning has been demonstrated over AWGN channels but has not yet been quantified over realistic wireless channel models. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the gains of end-to-end learning over a frequency- and time-selective fading channel using OFDM. With imperfect channel knowledge at the receiver, the shaping gains observed on AWGN channels vanish. Nonetheless, we identify two other sources of performance improvements. The first comes from a neural network-based receiver operating over a large number of subcarriers and OFDM symbols which allows to reduce the number of orthogonal pilots without loss of BER. The second comes from entirely eliminating orthogonal pilots by jointly learning a neural receiver together with either superimposed pilots (SIPs), combined with conventional QAM, or an optimized constellation. The learned constellation works for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, Doppler and delay spreads, has zero mean and does hence not contain any form of SIP. Both schemes achieve the same BER as the pilot-based baseline with 7% higher throughput. Thus, we believe that a jointly learned transmitter and receiver are a very interesting component for beyond-5G communication systems which could remove the need and associated overhead for demodulation reference signals.}

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology based on extreme value theory (EVT) to statistically model the behavior of extreme events in a wireless channel for ultra-reliable communication. This methodology includes techniques for fitting the lower tail distribution of the received power to the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), determining the optimum threshold over which the tail statistics are derived, ascertaining the optimum stopping condition on the number of samples required to estimate the tail statistics by using GPD, and finally, assessing the validity of the derived Pareto model. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea under various engine vibrations and driving scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides the best fit to the collected data, significantly outperforming the conventional extrapolation-based methods. Moreover, the usage of the EVT in the proposed method decreases the required number of samples for estimating the tail statistics significantly.}

Our analysis pays particular attention to the existence of a finite number of UL pilots for channel estimation and the effect of pilot contamination. We study for the first time the joint impact of the number of UL pilot sequences, the user density, and the base-station density on the pilot contamination issue in a mMIMO network, which in turn characterizes the DL and UL network performance. Moreover, using the proposed framework, we investigate two different scheduling problems—UE and pilot scheduling—, to find the optimal simultaneously scheduled UE density per time-frequency resource as well as the optimal UL pilot number to maximise the spectral efficiency.}

To satisfy the requirements, this paper proposes two types of mixed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (X-OFDM) waveforms. The Hermitian symmetry (HS) characteristic of the sub-carriers in the frequency domain, guarantees the signal in the time domain to be real, which reduces the spectral efficiency to 1/2. For the odd sub-carriers in the frequency domain, the signal in the time domain after the inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) is antisymmetric. For the even sub-carriers in the frequency domain, the signal in the time domain after the IFFT is symmetric. Based on the antisymmetric and symmetric characteristics, the two types of X-OFDM waveforms are designed to guarantee the signal in the time domain to be non-negative. With\nM\nsub-carriers in the frequency domain, the generated signal in the time domain has\n3M/2\npoints, which further reduces the spectral efficiency to 1/3. The numerical simulations show that, the two types of X-OFDM waveforms greatly enhance the power efficiency considering the OWC channel with the signal-dependent noise and/or the signal-independent noise.}

	abstract = {Backscatter communications have received increasingly attention in Internet of Things (IoT) due to its advantages of requiring no internal battery and almost zero maintenance. However, the drawback of backscatter communications is that, its channel fades deeper than conventional channel. To improve the performance, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been investigated for backscatter communications. By considering duty cycle, a particular behavior of backscatter communications, as a new performance criterion, we propose a\n2×2\northogonal space-time block code for MIMO backscatter communications. The new code is a rotation of the classical Alamouti code, and in MIMO backscatter channels, this simple rotation will incur an improved duty cycle for both linear and nonlinear energy harvester models, as well as a same, or even better symbol error rate performance. We provide both rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical simulations to show the above results. An interesting thing is that, this new code does not outperform Alamouti code in conventional MIMO channels, which indicates that the space-time code design criteria for conventional channels is not the optimal one for backscatter channels, and existing space-time codes should be reconsidered and/or redesigned to achieve a higher performance in MIMO backscatter communications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel semi-passive elements-aided channel estimation framework for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), where a small portion of IRS reflecting elements are able to process the received signal for facilitating the channel estimation. Specifically, the BS-IRS channel is estimated by applying the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT), while the user-IRS channels are estimated by combining the use of total least square (TLS) ESPRIT and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods. The required training time of the proposed channel estimation scheme is irrelevant to the number of IRS reflecting elements, thus substantially reducing the training overhead. Simulation results show the great advantages of our proposed scheme over both the conventional compressed sensing (CS)-based channel estimation and cascaded channel estimation schemes.}

	abstract = {In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is important for the base station (BS) to perform effective downlink beamforming. So far, there have been few reports on DOA estimation considering gain-phase perturbations in massive MIMO systems. However, gain-phase perturbations indeed exist in practical applications and cannot be ignored. In this paper, an efficient method for two-dimensional (2-D) DOA estimation of incoherently distributed (ID) sources considering array gain-phase perturbations is proposed for massive MIMO systems. Firstly, a shift invariance structure is established in the subspace framework, and a constrained optimization problem is formulated to estimate the nominal azimuth and elevation DOAs as well as gain-phase perturbations with closed-form expressions, under the assumption that some of the BS antennas are well calibrated; secondly, the corresponding angular spreads are obtained with the aid of the estimated gain-phase perturbations. Theoretical analysis and an approximate Cramér-Rao bound are also provided. An improved estimation performance is achieved by the proposed method as demonstrated by numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {Scalable video coding (SVC) has received much attention for video transmission over wireless due to its flexibility. However, most previous work only considered SVC video streaming from a single base station (BS). At present, the densification of BSs enables a user equipment (UE) to connect to multiple BSs in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). In this paper, we consider the problem of SVC video streaming in a UDN, which allows different layers of a video block to be downloaded from different BSs. An optimization problem is formulated aiming to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of users by selecting the optimal connection strategy and optimal number of video layers. Considering the complexity, to efficiently solve the problem in a distributed manner, the problem of choosing connection strategy is formulated as a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) problem with only few information exchange. Each user can adapt its connection strategy in a distributed self-learning system. To obtain the optimal arm for the MA-MAB problem, we propose a multi-user arm decision algorithm. To avoid large computation and handover costs, we adopt the same connection strategy for the entire video sequence. Then for each video block, with the given connection strategy, the number of video layers is adjusted adaptively according to dynamic network conditions. Finally, based on the above designs, we provide the SVC-based video downloading scheme to obtain an approximate optimal solution to the original optimization problem. Extensive simulations and comparisons show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Among the existing satellite types, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites provide short round-trip delays and are becoming increasingly important. Due to its low orbital profile, the LEO satellites can provide high-speed, low-latency and no dead zone network services for ground users. However, as the number of satellites continues to increase, frequency bands as non-renewable resources will seriously restrict the future development of the Space-Earth integration network. In this paper, a flexible spectrum sharing and cooperative service method is proposed to address the co-linear interference issue caused by LEO satellites while passing through the coverage area of the GEO beam and allows the LEO satellites to provide services for multiple LEO ground users. In our proposed scheme, through continuous power allocation optimization, we ensure that the service of LEO satellites will not reduce the service quality of the GEO beam. At by taking full advantage of the cooperation between LEO satellites, the quality of their service can be significantly improved. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme converges quickly, the transmission efficiency and the stability of the system can all be guaranteed.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is one of the promising technologies contributing to the next generation smart radio environment. A novel physics-based RIS channel model is proposed. In the model, the signal reflected through the scatters and the RIS elements are jointly studied as multipath components of the overall received envelope. This novel strategy simplifies the mathematical structure of the channel gain and is able to compactly derive the distribution of the overall channel. For the case of continuous phase shifts, the distribution depends on the number of elements of the RIS and the observing direction of the receiver. For the case of discrete phase shifts, the distribution further depends on the number of phase quantization levels. The scaling law of the average received power is obtained from the scale factor of the distribution. For the application scenarios where RIS functions as an anomalous reflector, we investigate the performance of single RIS-assisted multiple access networks for time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the proposed channel model are derived. It is proved that a constant diversity order exists, which is independent of the number of RIS elements. Simulation results are presented to confirm that the proposed model applies effectively to the element-based RISs.}

	abstract = {Grant-free (GF) transmission holds promise in terms of low latency communication by directly transmitting messages without waiting for any permissions. However, collision situations may frequently happen when limited spectrum is occupied by numerous GF users. The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique can be a promising solution to achieve massive connectivity and fewer collisions for GF transmission by multiplexing users in power domain. We utilize a semi-grant-free (semi-GF) NOMA scheme for enhancing network connectivity and spectral efficiency by enabling grant-based (GB) and GF users to share the same spectrum resources. With the aid of semi-GF protocols, uplink NOMA networks are investigated by invoking stochastic geometry techniques. We propose a novel dynamic protocol to interpret which part of the GF users are allocated in NOMA transmissions via transmitting various channel quality thresholds by an added handshake. We utilize open-loop protocol with a fixed average threshold as the benchmark to investigate performance improvement. It is observed that dynamic protocol provides more accurate channel quality thresholds than open-loop protocol, thereby the interference from the GF users is reduced to a large extent. We analyze the outage performance and diversity gains under two protocols. Numerical results demonstrate that dynamic protocol is capable of enhancing the outage performance than open-loop protocol.}

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) plays a vital role in scheduling and capacity-approaching transmission optimization of massive MIMO communication systems. In frequency division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems, forward link CSI reconstruction at transmitter relies on CSI feedback from receiving nodes and must carefully weigh the tradeoff between reconstruction accuracy and feedback bandwidth. Recent application of recurrent neural networks (RNN) has demonstrated promising results of massive MIMO CSI feedback compression. However, the cost of computation and memory associated with RNN deep learning remains high. In this work, we exploit channel temporal coherence to improve learning accuracy and feedback efficiency. Leveraging a Markovian model, we develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework called MarkovNet to efficiently encode CSI feedback to improve accuracy and efficiency. We explore important physical insights including spherical normalization of input data and deep learning network optimizations in feedback compression. We demonstrate that MarkovNet provides a substantial performance improvement and computational complexity reduction over the RNN-based work. We demonstrate MarkovNet’s performance under different MIMO configurations and for a range of feedback intervals and rates. CSI recovery with MarkovNet outperforms RNN-based CSI estimation with only a fraction of computational cost.}

The vast majority of recent research on RIS has focused on system level optimizations. However, developing straightforward and tractable electromagnetic models that are suitable for RIS aided communication modeling remains an open issue. In this paper, we address this issue and derive communication models by using rigorous scattering parameter network analysis. We also propose new RIS architectures based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks that can adjust not only the phases but also the magnitudes of the impinging waves, which are more general and more efficient than conventional single connected reconfigurable impedance network that only adjusts the phases of the impinging waves. In addition, the scaling law of the received signal power of an RIS aided system with reconfigurable impedance networks is also derived. Compared with the single connected reconfigurable impedance network, our group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance network can increase the received signal power by up to 62%, or maintain the same received signal power with a number of RIS elements reduced by up to 21%. We also investigate the proposed architecture in deployments with distance-dependent pathloss and Rician fading channel, and show that the proposed group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks outperform the single connected case by up to 34% and 48%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Energy harvesting (EH) aided communications hold a great potential in the design of green communication systems for their high energy efficiency. However, the random power supply due to EH may cause an intolerable delay in data transmission. To overcome this, a Reliable Energy Source (RES) is desired to provide transmission power when the large delay is induced. In this paper, we study the delay-optimal scheduling policy for EH aided communications with the constraint of average power provided by RES. More specifically, the delay-minimal scheduling is obtained through the two-dimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming (LP) formulation. To further reduce the computational complexity, we present a value iteration algorithm, based on which we not only reveal a threshold-based structure of the delay-optimal scheduling policy for EH-aided communications with large-capacity batteries, but also conceive a low complexity policy that is asymptotically optimal. For EH-aided communications with finite-capacity batteries, we present a unified framework based on large deviation theory. The non-asymptotic framework demonstrates that the delay-power tradeoff curve of the low complexity scheduling policy is capable of converging to that of the delay-optimal policy exponentially as the capacity of the battery increases.}

The server attempts to fulfill the pending requests with minimal transmissions exploiting multicasting and coding opportunities among the pending requests. We consider a queue in which requests for the same file from different users is merged and transmitted simultaneously to all the requested users. We study and compare the performance of this queuing system in terms of queuing delays when LRU caches are used and when coded caching schemes proposed in the literature are used.

	abstract = {Due to the emergence of non-terrestrial platforms with extensive coverage, flexible deployment, and reconfigurable characteristics, the hybrid satellite-aerial-terrestrial networks (HSATNs) can accommodate a great variety of wireless access services in different applications. To effectively reduce the transmission latency and facilitate the frequent update of files with improved spectrum efficiency, we investigate the performance of cache-enabled HSATN, where the user retrieves the required content files from the cache-enabled aerial node (AN) or the satellite with the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. If the required content files of the user are cached in the AN, the cache-enabled node would serve directly. Otherwise, the user would retrieve the content file from the satellite system, where the satellite system seeks opportunities for proactive content pushing to ANs during the user content delivery phase. Specifically, taking into account the uncertainty of the number and location of ANs, along with the channel fading of terrestrial users, the outage probability and hit probability of the considered network are, respectively, derived based on stochastic geometry. Numerical results unveil the effectiveness of the cache-enabled HSATN with the NOMA scheme and proclaim the influence of key factors on the system performance. The realistic, tractable, and expandable framework, as well as associated methodology, provide both useful guidance and a solid foundation for evolved networks with advanced configurations in the performance of cache-enabled HSATN.}

To this aim, prior work on the full-stack evaluation of mmWave cellular networks has been extended by including the modeling of MU-MIMO and HBF. Our results reveal novel relations between the networking layers and the HBF MU-MIMO performance at the physical layer.

	abstract = {A novel device-to-device (D2D) aided cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme (termed as D2D-SG-NOMA) is proposed, where two similar gain (SG) near users (NUs) with the capability of D2D communication and one far user (FU) are served within two time slots. The NOMA pair is formed with a NU and the FU. The paired NU is employed as a decode-and-forward relay to assist FU. Contrarily, the unpaired NU can receive signals simultaneously from the base station (BS) and the other NU during the second time slot. Two different scenarios (i.e., S 1 and S 2 ) are investigated insightfully. In S 1 , the direct link between the BS and FU does not exist, whereas the direct link between the BS and FU exists in S 2 . The delay-tolerant capacity (DTC), outage probability, diversity order, and delay-limited capacity are investigated along with analytical formulation. The D2D-SG-NOMA achieves an increase of around 66% and 85% in DTC at 0 dB signal-to-noise (SNR) under S 1 and S 2 , respectively than the existing NOMA scheme with successive relaying (termed as SR-NOMA). Contrarily, a reduced DTC improvement (i.e., around 3% and 10% in S 1 and S 2 , respectively) is obtained at 40 dB SNR due to increased inter-symbol interference.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as flying base stations (FlyBSs) are considered as an efficient tool to enhance the capacity of future mobile networks and to facilitate the communication in emergency cases. These benefits are, however, conditioned by an efficient control of the FlyBSs and management of radio resources. In this paper, we propose a novel solution jointly selecting the optimal clusters of an arbitrary number of the users served at the same time-frequency resources by means of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), allocating the optimal transmission power to each user, and determining the position of the FlyBS. This joint problem is constrained with the FlyBS’s propulsion power consumed for flying and with a continuous guarantee of a minimum required capacity to each mobile user. The goal is to enhance the duration of a communication coverage in NOMA defined as the time interval within which the FlyBS always provides the minimum required capacity to all users. The proposed solution clusters the users and allocates the transmission power of the FlyBS to the users efficiently so that the communication coverage provided by the FlyBSs is extended by 67%–270% comparing to existing solutions while the propulsion power is not increased.}

OTFS modulations operate in the delay-Doppler domain whereas two-dimensional (2D) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulations operate in the time-frequency domain. For 2D OFDM modulations in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels, we investigate the pilot pattern design problem, which minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation. The MSE lower bound (LB) is theoretically derived to provide the design criterion. Based on the criterion, we show that the LB achieving design can be found by exhaustive 2D pilot location search. Exhaustive 2D search has high computational complexity. To reduce the complexity, sufficient conditions on the existence of LB achieving design are provided to decouple the 2D problem into two one-dimensional (1D) problems. For the 1D problem, we propose the LB achieving design when the number of possible pilot locations is divisible by the number of pilots. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed LB achieving design is superior to the random pilot pattern design and the bilinear interpolation channel estimation method.}

	abstract = {This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless sensor network, in which one UAV flies in the sky to collect the data transmitted from a set of ground nodes (GNs) via distributed beamforming. We consider two scenarios with delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive applications, in which the GNs send the common/shared messages to the UAV via adaptive- and fixed-rate transmissions, respectively. For the two scenarios, we aim to maximize the average data-rate throughput and minimize the transmission outage probability, respectively, by jointly optimizing the UAV’s trajectory design and the GNs’ transmit power allocation over time, subject to the UAV’s flight speed constraints and the GNs’ individual average power constraints. However, the two formulated problems are both non-convex and thus generally difficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this issue, we first consider the relaxed problems in the ideal case with the UAV’s flight speed constraints ignored, for which the well-structured optimal solutions are obtained to reveal the fundamental performance upper bounds. It is shown that for the two approximate problems, the optimal trajectory solutions have the same multi-location-hovering structure, but with different optimal power allocation strategies. Next, for the general problems with the UAV’s flight speed constraints considered, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions by using the techniques from convex optimization and approximation. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed designs significantly outperform other benchmark schemes, in terms of the achieved data-rate throughput and outage probability under the two scenarios. It is also observed that when the mission period becomes sufficiently long, our proposed designs approach the performance upper bounds when the UAV’s flight speed constraints are ignored.}

In the SAIECN, GUE’s computing tasks can be offloaded to HAP(s) or LEO satellite. In this paper, we minimize the weighted sum energy consumption of SAIECN via joint GUE association, multi-user multiple input and multiple output (MU-MIMO) transmit precoding, computation task assignment, and resource allocation. To solve the nonconvex problem, we decompose the optimization problem into four subproblems and solve each one iteratively. For the GUE association subproblem, quadratic transform based fractional programming (QTFP) and difference of convex function are utilized. The MU-MIMO transmit precoding subproblem is solved via QTFP and the weighted minimum mean-squared method. The computation task assignment is addressed using the classic interior point method while the computation resource allocation is derived in closed form. The numerical results show that the proposed SAIECN and the corresponding algorithm can solve the satellite based edge computing quite well and the energy cost is maintained at a relative low level.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we employ multiple wireless-powered relays to assist information transmission from a multi-antenna access point to a single-antenna receiver. The wireless relays can operate in either the passive mode via backscatter communications or the active mode via RF communications, depending on their channel conditions and energy states. We aim to maximize the overall throughput by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the relays’ radio modes and operating parameters. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial problem structure, we develop a novel optimization-driven hierarchical deep deterministic policy gradient (H-DDPG) approach to adapt the beamforming and relay strategies. The optimization-driven H-DDPG algorithm firstly decomposes the binary relay mode selection into the outer-loop deep\nQ\n-network (DQN) algorithm and then optimizes the continuous beamforming and relaying strategies by using the inner-loop DDPG algorithm. Secondly, to improve the learning efficiency, we integrate the model-based optimization into the inner-loop DDPG framework by providing a better-informed target estimation for DNN training. Simulation results reveal that these two special designs ensure a more stable learning performance and achieve a higher reward, up to 20%, compared to the conventional model-free DDPG approach.}

	abstract = {Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of the most important components in the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks for realizing mission-critical applications. In this paper, we jointly optimize the transceiver design and decoding error probability (DEP) of a full-duplex (FD) URLLC system, where the base station (BS) operates in FD mode, while the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users work in half-duplex (HD) mode. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the achievable total (UL plus DL) rate for an FD URLLC system under finite blocklength, subject to the end-to-end (E2E) reliability constraint from the UL user to each DL user and the total transmission power constraint at the UL user and at the BS. We analyze the problem structure and convexify the problem by approximating the channel dispersion in scenarios of high and mid-to-high signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) regimes, respectively. Next, efficient iterative algorithms are proposed to find the near-optimal power allocation for the UL user and transceiver weights for the BS. Furthermore, closed-form expressions of the transceiver weights are derived, and the convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved. Simulation examples demonstrate the impact of the code blocklength, number of DL users, transmitter/receiver distortion and DEP threshold on the system performance.}

For such a system, we propose a novel absorbing-Markov-chain-based analysis framework to shed light on the puzzling relationship between the delay and reliability, as well as to quantify the system energy efficiency. We derive the transition probabilities of the absorbing Markov chain considering the Rayleigh fading, the channel estimation error, the zero-forcing multi-user-detection (ZF-MUD), the grant-free access, the ACK-enabled retransmissions within the delay bound and the interactions among these technical ingredients. Then, the delay-constrained reliability and the system energy efficiency are derived based on the absorbing Markov chain formulated. Finally, we study the optimal number of user equipments (UEs) and the optimal number of receiving antennas that maximize the system energy efficiency, while satisfying the reliability and latency requirements of URLLC simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of massive MIMO in supporting large-scale URLLC systems.}

	abstract = {We study federated learning (FL), where power-limited wireless devices utilize their local datasets to collaboratively train a global model with the help of a remote parameter server (PS). The PS has access to the global model and shares it with the devices for local training using their datasets, and the devices return the result of their local updates to the PS to update the global model. The algorithm continues until the convergence of the global model. This framework requires downlink transmission from the PS to the devices and uplink transmission from the devices to the PS. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of the bandwidth-limited shared wireless medium on the performance of FL with a focus on the downlink. To this end, the downlink and uplink channels are modeled as fading broadcast and multiple access channels, respectively, both with limited bandwidth. For downlink transmission, we first introduce a digital approach, where a quantization technique is employed at the PS followed by a capacity-achieving channel code to transmit the global model update over the wireless broadcast channel at a common rate such that all the devices can decode it. Next, we propose analog downlink transmission, where the global model is broadcast by the PS in an uncoded manner. We consider analog transmission over the uplink in both cases, since its superiority over digital transmission for uplink has been well studied in the literature. We further analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed analog transmission approach over the downlink assuming that the uplink transmission is error-free. Numerical experiments show that the analog downlink approach provides significant improvement over the digital one with a more notable improvement when the data distribution across the devices is not independent and identically distributed. The experimental results corroborate the convergence analysis, and show that a smaller number of local iterations should be used when the data distribution is more biased, and also when the devices have a better estimate of the global model in the analog downlink approach.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform data-driven air-to-ground channel estimation for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless network. First, an effective channel estimation approach is developed to collect mmWave channel information, allowing each UAV to train a stand-alone channel model via a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) along each beamforming direction. Next, in order to expand the application scenarios of the trained channel model into a broader spatial-temporal domain, a cooperative framework, based on a distributed CGAN architecture, is developed, allowing each UAV to collaboratively learn the mmWave channel distribution in a fully-distributed manner. To guarantee an efficient learning process, necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal UAV network topology that maximizes the learning rate for cooperative channel modeling are derived, and the optimal CGAN learning solution per UAV is subsequently characterized, based on the distributed network structure. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed CGAN approach is robust to the local training error at each UAV. Meanwhile, a larger airborne network size requires more communication resources per UAV to guarantee an efficient learning rate. The results also show that, compared with a stand-alone CGAN without information sharing and two other distributed schemes, namely: A multi-discriminator CGAN and a federated-learning CGAN method, the proposed distributed CGAN approach yields a higher modeling accuracy while learning the environment, and it achieves a larger average data rate in the online performance of UAV downlink mmWave communications.}

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) during communication is emerging. This technology promises to provide information on propagation environments and transceivers’ location, thus creating several new services and applications for the Internet of Things and environment-aware communication. Using crowdsourcing data collected by multiple agents appears to be much potential for enhancing SLAM performance. However, the measurement uncertainties in practice and biased estimations from multiple agents may result in serious errors. This study develops a robust SLAM method with measurement plug-and-play and crowdsourcing mechanisms to address the above problems. First, we divide measurements into different categories according to their unknown biases and realize a measurement plug-and-play mechanism by extending the classic belief propagation (BP)-based SLAM method. The proposed mechanism can obtain the time-varying agent location, radio features, and corresponding measurement biases (such as clock bias, orientation bias, and received signal strength model parameters), with high accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios without any prior information on anchors and agents. Next, we establish a probabilistic crowdsourcing-based SLAM mechanism, in which multiple agents cooperate to construct and refine the radio map in a decentralized manner. Our study presents the first BP-based crowdsourcing that resolves the “double count” and “data reliability” problems through the flexible application of probabilistic data association methods. Numerical results reveal that the crowdsourcing mechanism can further improve the accuracy of the mapping result, which, in turn, ensures the decimeter-level localization accuracy of each agent in a challenging propagation environment.}

	abstract = {Reflection modulation based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered to be a promising information transfer mechanism, which does not require any additional radio frequency chains. However, existing reflection modulation schemes consider manipulating the ON/OFF states of RIS elements, which may result in some power loss. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, called RIS-aided quadrature reflection modulation (RIS-QRM), for better utilizing the reflection power in RIS-aided downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems. To this end, RIS-QRM partitions the RIS elements into two subsets in order to reflected the incident signals towards two orthogonal directions by using passive beamforming and encodes its local data onto the two partitions. A closed-form expression for the unconditional pairwise error probability of RIS-QRM in Rician fading is derived assuming maximum-likelihood detection at the receiver. Moreover, a low-complexity detection method that decouples the joint search of the constellation symbol and the RIS element partition is proposed. Computer simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of RIS-QRM and validate the analytical results. It is shown that RIS-QRM improves the error performance of the additional bits delivered by the RIS without deteriorating the error performance of the bits modulated on the constellation symbol, as compared to ON/OFF-based RIS-aided schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we optimize user scheduling, power allocation and beamforming in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks implementing user-centric clustering. We study both the coherent and non-coherent transmission modes, formulating a weighted sum rate maximization problem for each; finding the optimal solution to these problems is known to be NP-hard. We use tools from fractional programming, block coordinate descent, and compressive sensing to construct an algorithm that optimizes the beamforming weights and user scheduling and converges in a smooth non-decreasing pattern. Channel state information (CSI) being crucial for optimization, we highlight the importance of employing a low-overhead pilot assignment policy for scheduling problems. In this regard, we use a variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering, which provides a suboptimal, but feasible, pilot assignment scheme; for our cell-free case, we formulate an area-based pilot reuse factor. Our results show that our scheme provides large gains in the long-term network sum spectral efficiency compared to benchmark schemes such as zero-forcing and conjugate beamforming (with round-robin scheduling) respectively. Furthermore, the results show the superiority of coherent transmission compared to the non-coherent mode under ideal and imperfect CSI for the area-based pilot-reuse factors we consider.}

	abstract = {A novel framework is proposed for cellular offloading with the aid of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is employed at each UAV to further improve the spectrum efficiency of the wireless network. The optimization problem of joint three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design and power allocation is formulated for maximizing the throughput. Since ground mobile users are considered as roaming continuously, the UAVs need to be re-deployed timely based on the movement of users. In an effort to solve this pertinent dynamic problem, a K-means based clustering algorithm is first adopted for periodically partitioning users. Afterward, a mutual deep Q-network (MDQN) algorithm is proposed to jointly determine the optimal 3D trajectory and power allocation of UAVs. In contrast to the conventional deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, the MDQN algorithm enables the experience of multi-agent to be input into a shared neural network to shorten the training time with the assistance of state abstraction. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed MDQN algorithm is capable of converging under minor constraints and has a faster convergence rate than the conventional DQN algorithm in the multi-agent case; 2) The achievable sum rate of the NOMA enhanced UAV network is 23% superior to the case of orthogonal multiple access (OMA); 3) By designing the optimal 3D trajectory of UAVs with the MDON algorithm, the sum rate of the network enjoys 142% and 56% gains than invoking the circular trajectory and the 2D trajectory, respectively.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a full-duplex (FD) relaying network operating with finite blocklength (FBL) codes. Based on Polyanskiy’s FBL model, we characterize the FBL reliability of the relaying network under both decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying schemes. Based on the characterisation, we provide reliability-optimal designs via optimal power allocation for both schemes in a single-carrier scenario. In particular, we prove that under the FD DF relaying scheme the (tightly approximated) overall error probability is convex in the transmit power at the relay. In addition, we show that minimizing the overall error probability of the FD AF relaying is equivalent to maximizing the overall signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which is further proved to be pseudo-concave. Then, the designs for a single-carrier scenario are further extended to a multi-carrier scenario with a joint power and data allocation among carriers. In particular, for either the FD DF or FD AF relaying scheme, a joint optimization problem is reformulated to a single problem maximizing the reliability via finding and achieving the optimal SINRs, while auxiliary variables are introduced in FD AF relaying to facilitate the reformulation. Based on mathematical analysis, we respectively construct convex approximations and subsequently propose iterative algorithms, with which the error probability is reduced iteratively until an eventual convergence to an efficient suboptimal value. Hence, a corresponding suboptimal data and power allocation solution can be constructed for the multi-carrier scenario. Via numerical analysis, we validate our analytical model and the proposed allocation algorithms. The FD DF and FD AF relaying schemes are compared with direct transmission in both single-carrier and multi-carrier scenarios, and the benefits of applying FD relaying schemes and joint optimization among multiple carriers are observed.}

The scheduling task is formulated as an image segmentation problem for which a supervised encoder-decoder like ANN is proposed. It consists of serially concatenated contraction and expansion layers to maximize the (regularized) cross-entropy, followed by a binary projection to undo the relaxation problem. Besides the robustness to scenarios with a time-varying system load and fronthaul bandwidth, the proposed architecture provides a complexity-efficient solution that fulfills the fronthaul bandwidth constraints and satisfies the real-time considerations. Our experimental results verify the competitive performance of the proposed solution with respect to both nonlinear solvers and state-of-art convex algorithms while the time efficiency of the ANN model outperforms the state of the art, especially, in scenarios with a large number of users.}

	abstract = {The deployment of federated learning in a wireless network, called federated edge learning (FEEL), exploits low-latency access to distributed mobile data to efficiently train an AI model while preserving data privacy. In this work, we study the spatial (i.e., spatially averaged) learning performance of FEEL deployed in a large-scale cellular network with spatially random distributed devices. Both the schemes of digital and analog transmission are considered, providing support of error-free uploading and over-the-air aggregation of local model updates by devices. The derived spatial convergence rate for digital transmission is found to be constrained by a limited number of active devices regardless of device density and converges to the ground-true rate exponentially fast as the number grows. The population of active devices depends on network parameters such as processing gain and signal-to-interference threshold for decoding. On the other hand, the limit does not exist for uncoded analog transmission. In this case, the spatial convergence rate is slowed down due to the direct exposure of signals to the perturbation of inter-cell interference. Nevertheless, the effect diminishes when devices are dense as interference is averaged out by aggressive over-the-air aggregation. In terms of learning latency (in second), analog transmission is preferred to the digital scheme as the former dramatically reduces multi-access latency by enabling simultaneous access.}

	abstract = {The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and multiple access provides a promising solution to improved coverage and massive connections at low cost. However, securing IRS-aided networks remains a challenge since the potential eavesdropper also has access to an additional IRS reflection link, especially when the eavesdropping channel state information is unknown. In this paper, we propose an IRS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to achieve secure communication via artificial jamming, where the multi-antenna base station sends the NOMA and jamming signals together to the legitimate users with the assistance of IRS, in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The sum rate of legitimate users is maximized by optimizing the transmit beamforming, the jamming vector and the IRS reflecting vector, satisfying the quality of service requirement, the IRS reflecting constraint and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding condition. In addition, the received jamming power is adapted at the highest level at all legitimate users for successful cancellation via SIC. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, and then each subproblem is converted into a convex one using successive convex approximation. An alternate optimization algorithm is proposed to solve them iteratively. Numerical results show that the secure transmission in the proposed IRS-NOMA scheme can be effectively guaranteed with the assistance of artificial jamming.}

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) massive multiple-input-and-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which explore degrees of freedom in both the vertical and the horizontal dimensions, are a promising technology to enhance spectral efficiency in the next-generation communication systems. As an emerging modulation technology with millimetre wave (mm-wave) communication in massive MIMO systems with limited radio-frequency (RF) chains, the spatial scattering modulation (SSM) makes use of beamspace domain resources to further improve the spectral efficiency. However, most published works on the SSM only focus on two-dimensional (2-D) MIMO systems. In this paper, we generalize the SSM system to 3-D space. First, we design a novel generalized 3-D SSM system by considering both vertical and horizontal angles to determine scattering paths, which are selected to convey information bits. Then, we propose a whitening filter based optimal detection algorithm to detect the received symbols with correlated noise, where the correlation is generated by the combination of the received signals from the large-scale planar receiving antenna array. Next, we design a 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT) based transceiving approach to improve the hardware friendliness. After that, we propose a low-complexity detector based on the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection algorithm. Moreover, we derive the union upper bound on average bit error probability (ABEP) in a closed form and the asymptotic performance expression for the generalized 3-D SSM system. Finally, we analyse the impact of transmission environment on the ABEP performance. Numerical results show that the generalized 3-D SSM system outperforms the conventional 2-D SSM system, which reduces the ABEP by 10\\times with the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level under the typical indoor environment.}

	abstract = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system has emerged as a promising technology for coverage extension and capacity enhancement. Prior works on IRS have mostly assumed perfect channel state information (CSI), which facilitates in deriving the upper-bound performance but is difficult to realize in practice due to passive elements of IRS without signal processing capabilities. In this paper, we propose a compressive channel estimation techniques for IRS-assisted mmWave multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system. To reduce the training overhead, the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels is exploited. By utilizing the properties of Kronecker products, IRS-assisted mmWave channel is converted into a sparse signal recovery problem, which involves two competing cost function terms (measurement error and sparsity term). Existing sparse recovery algorithms solve the combined contradictory objectives function using a regularization parameter, which leads to a suboptimal solution. To address this concern, a hybrid multiobjective evolutionary paradigm is developed to solve the sparse recovery problem, which can overcome the difficulty in the choice of regularization parameter value. Simulation results show that under a wide range of simulation settings, the proposed method achieves competitive error performance compared to existing channel estimation methods.}

In particular, the time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) distributions of the first-arriving multipath component (MPC) are derived. These statistics find their utility in many applications such as cellular-based localization, channel modeling, and link establishment for mm-wave initial access (IA). Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, a Boolean model is used to statistically characterize the random locations, orientations, and sizes of reflectors, i.e. , buildings. Assuming non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is due to first-order ( i.e. , single-bounce) reflections, and that reflectors can either facilitate or block reflections, the distribution of the path length ( i.e. , absolute time delay) of the first-arriving MPC is derived. This result is then used to obtain the first NLOS bias distribution in the localization literature that is based on the absolute delay of the first-arriving MPC for outdoor time-of-flight (TOF) range measurements. This distribution is shown to match exceptionally well with commonly assumed gamma and exponential NLOS bias models in the literature, which were only attained previously through heuristic or indirect methods. Continuing under this analytical framework, the AOA distribution of the first-arriving MPC is derived, which gives novel insight into how environmental obstacles affect the AOA and also represents the first AOA distribution derived under the Boolean model.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has emerged as a prominent technology for emergency communications (e.g., natural disaster) in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks to enhance the ability of disaster prediction, damage assessment, and rescue operations promptly. A UAV can be deployed as a flying base station (BS) to collect data from time-constrained IoT devices and then transfer it to a ground gateway (GW). In general, the latency constraint at IoT devices and UAV’s limited storage capacity highly hinder practical applications of UAV-assisted IoT networks. In this paper, full-duplex (FD) radio is adopted at the UAV to overcome these challenges. In addition, half-duplex (HD) scheme for UAV-based relaying is also considered to provide a comparative study between two modes (viz., FD and HD). Herein, a device is considered to be successfully served if its data is collected by the UAV and conveyed to GW timely during flight time. In this context, we aim to maximize the number of served IoT devices by jointly optimizing bandwidth, power allocation, and the UAV trajectory while satisfying each device’s requirement and the UAV’s limited storage capacity. The formulated optimization problem is troublesome to solve due to its non-convexity and combinatorial nature. Towards appealing applications, we first relax binary variables into continuous ones and transform the original problem into a more computationally tractable form. By leveraging inner approximation framework, we derive newly approximated functions for non-convex parts and then develop a simple yet efficient iterative algorithm for its solutions. Next, we attempt to maximize the total throughput subject to the number of served IoT devices. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform benchmark approaches in terms of the number of served IoT devices and system throughput.}

	abstract = {Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently received wide attention for reducing signaling overhead and transmission latency in massive machine-type communications (mMTC). In grant-free NOMA systems, user activity and data (UAD) has to be detected, which is challenging in practice. As an emerging technique, compressive sensing (CS) shows great promise in solving this problem by exploiting the inherent sparsity nature of user activity. This paper proposes to use the weighted\nℓ\n2,1\nminimization (WL21M) to jointly detect UAD in realistic dynamic scenarios. At first, the average recoverability of the WL21M is analyzed. This analysis reveals the fact that the WL21M can improve the detection performance by means of an appropriate weighting and the incorporation of intrinsic temporal correlation. Motivated by the analysis, a collaborative hierarchical match pursuit (C-HiMP) algorithm is proposed for dynamic UAD detection. In the C-HiMP, a sequence of WL21M problems are solved in the subspaces spanned by all of the components in the hierarchical estimated support sets, where the weights are collaboratively updated by the solutions in previous time slots so that an attractive self-correction capacity is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed C-HiMP can obtain significant performance improvements, in terms of detection accuracy and computational complexity, compared with several state-of-the-art CS-based detection algorithms.}

	abstract = {In urban fields, Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) become ubiquitous. Accurate GPS positioning for sensors is a fundamental problem for MWSNs. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Crowdsourcing-Aided Positioning scheme, which takes an ideal situation and a more realistic situation into account. In the ideal situation, all participants are considered accurate. Then, two optimization objectives are addressed for the efficient Crowdsourcing-Aided Positioning task. Their utility functions are proven to be submodular and a greedy algorithm is given to solve them. In the more realistic situation, randomly selected participants cannot guarantee the accuracy of the data. We propose a data-accuracy-calibration-based participant selection framework to solve this dilemma. Through data accuracy calibration, participants gain their data accuracy and reliability with the help of wireless sensor networks. First, we design three kinds of data accuracy calibration methods based on probabilistic models. Then, we propose a Truthful-Data-Driven Participant Selection problem, which tends to raise the data accuracy and reliability. The optimization problem is proved to be NP-hard and its optimization function has submodular property. We give a greedy algorithm with\n1−\n1\ne\napproximation ratio to solve this problem. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the algorithmic effectiveness at last.}

	abstract = {Convergecast is a fundamental operation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To support long-term deployment of WSNs, sensor nodes normally operate at low-duty-cycles. However, the low-duty-cycle operation significantly reduces the communication chance between nodes. Consequently, the risk of data collisions significantly increases when multiple senders transmit packets to a receiver during its very short active period. This problem further causes not only wasted packet retransmissions, but also a large delivery latency. Under such conditions, collision-free medium access is more appealing than recovering after collision for low-duty-cycle WSNs. In this work, we propose an i ncast- co llision-f re e convergecast protocol, named iCore, to address the many-to-one collision problem in low-duty-cycle WSNs. iCore employs the dynamic forwarding technique, establishes a non-conflicting schedule for efficient convergecast, and improves the channel utilization by allowing senders to opportunistically transmit packets once detecting unused slots. Specifically, we design efficient forwarder assignment and forwarding optimization algorithms that ensure low end-to-end latency under diverse data traffic types. Through comprehensive performance evaluations, we demonstrate that, compared with the baseline protocol, iCore effectively minimizes the end-to-end delay by 25% ~ 57% and maintains high delivery ratio and energy efficiency for different many-to-one convergecast scenarios.}

Two-way ranging methods are commonly adopted to mitigate those effects in localization networks but requiring a large amount of signal transmission to measure the distance between all pairs of nodes. This paper establishes a network localization framework, which fully mitigates clock drifts using only a minimum number of signal transmissions. The enabler is the proposed signal-multiplexing network ranging (SM-NR) method that minimizes communication overhead via signal multiplexing and eliminates clock drifts by exploiting the interconnections of timestamps. The proposed localization framework also allows some nodes to work in silent mode, of which the positions can be precisely determined without extra ranging signal transmissions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high-precision localization in the presence of clock drifts with minimum signal overhead.}

Radio maps are constructed from measurements collected by spectrum sensors distributed across space. Since radio maps are complicated functions of the spatial coordinates due to the nature of electromagnetic wave propagation, model-free approaches are strongly motivated. Nevertheless, all existing schemes for radio occupancy map estimation rely on interpolation algorithms unable to learn from experience. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel approach in which the spatial structure of propagation phenomena such as shadowing is learned beforehand from a data set with measurements in other environments. Relative to existing schemes, a significantly smaller number of measurements is therefore required to estimate a map with a prescribed accuracy. As an additional novelty, this is also the first work to estimate radio occupancy maps using deep neural networks. Specifically, a fully convolutional deep completion autoencoder architecture is developed to effectively exploit the manifold structure of this class of maps.}

However, the timely delivery of requested content is a major concern for CPs to improve the quality of service (QoS) of their subscribe users. Roadside unit (RSU)-based caching appears as a promising solution for CPs wherein CPs proactively store their content at the RSU to reduce the content delivery time. Since the RSUs are enabled with limited storage capacity, the competition among multiple CPs for storage space is unavoidable. Further, the CPs are connected with RSUs using capacity limited backhaul links. Hence the allocation of RSUs’ storage among CPs becomes a fundamental issue in RSU-based caching networks. In this paper, we design a market scenario in which the set of CPs competes for the storage space of RSUs. In the unavailability of utility and cost functions of the CPs and the RSUs, we introduce a market maker to manage the marketplace. Further, we employ iteration-based double-sided auction mechanism to compute the optimal storage allocation and corresponding payment transfer for CPs which maximizes the social welfare of the networks. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed auction mechanism improves the social welfare of the network by at least 29.3% compared to the benchmark schemes. Further, with the help of both analytical and numerical analysis, we show that the proposed auction mechanism also holds vital economical properties.}

Specifically, we propose new IRS-assisted downlink and uplink NOMA schemes to hide the existence of Bob’s covert transmission from a warden (Willie), which cost-effectively exploits the phase-shift uncertainty of the IRS and the non-orthogonal signal transmission of Roy as the cover medium without requiring additional uncertainty sources. Assuming the worst-case covert communication scenario where Willie can optimally adjust the detection threshold for his detector, we derive an analytical expression for the minimum average detection error probability of Willie achieved by each of the proposed schemes. To further enhance the covert communication performance, we propose to maximize the covert rates of Bob by jointly optimizing the transmit power and the IRS reflect beamforming, subject to given requirements on the covertness against Willie and the quality-of-service at Roy. Simulation results demonstrate the covertness advantage of the proposed schemes and confirm the accuracy of the derived analytical results. Interestingly, it is found that covert communication is impossible without using IRS or NOMA for the considered setup while the proposed schemes can always guarantee positive covert rates.}

	abstract = {Age-of-Information (AoI), or simply age, which measures the data freshness, is essential for real-time Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. On the other hand, energy saving is urgently required by many energy-constrained IoT devices. This paper studies the energy-age tradeoff for status update from a sensor to a monitor over an error-prone channel. The sensor can sleep, sense and transmit a new update, or retransmit by considering both sensing energy and transmit energy. An infinite-horizon average cost problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average AoI and average energy consumption. By solving the associated discounted cost problem and analyzing the Markov chain under the optimal policy, we prove that there exists a threshold optimal stationary policy with only two thresholds, i.e., one threshold on the AoI at the transmitter (AoIT) and the other on the AoI at the receiver (AoIR). Moreover, the two thresholds can be efficiently found by a line search. Numerical results show the performance of the optimal policies and the tradeoff curves with different parameters. Comparisons with the conventional policies show that considering sensing energy is of significant impact on the policy design, and introducing sleep mode greatly expands the tradeoff range.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a wireless network with a base station (BS) conducting timely status updates to multiple clients via adaptive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)/orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Specifically, the BS is able to adaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the downlink transmission to optimize the information freshness of the network, characterized by the Age of Information (AoI) metric. For the simple two-client case, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and develop the optimal policy for the BS to decide whether to use NOMA or OMA for each downlink transmission based on the instantaneous AoI of both clients. The optimal policy is shown to have a switching-type property with obvious decision switching boundaries. A suboptimal policy with lower computation complexity is also devised, which is shown to achieve near-optimal performance via numerical simulations. For the more general multi-client scenario, the optimal solution is the computationally intractable due to the large state and action spaces. As such, we devote to provide a feasible suboptimal policy with low computation complexity. Specifically, inspired by the proposed suboptimal policy of the two-client scenario, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem to determine the optimal power allocated to each client by maximizing the expected AoI drop of the network in each time slot (i.e., minimizing the expected network-wide AoI of the next slot). The problem is shown to be non-convex, we manage to solve it by approximating it as a convex optimization problem. Simulation results validate the tightness of the adopted approximation. Specifically, the performance of the adaptive NOMA/OMA scheme by solving the convex optimization is shown to be close to that of the max-weight policy solved by exhaustive search. Besides, the adaptive NOMA/OMA scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared to the OMA scheme, especially when the number of clients in the network is large and the transmission SNR is high.}

	abstract = {The multi-connectivity is a key enabler for ultra-reliable low-latency communications. To evaluate its performance and suitability to various use cases system-level studies are essential, where the physical layer (PHY) plays an important role. Therefore, PHY modeling is required which is time-intensive and requires highly complex computations. For this purpose, the PHY performance is usually abstracted in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), also known as physical layer abstraction (PLA). However, due to fading, the symbols inside a packet could have different SINRs which require effective SINR mapping to compute an equivalent SINR. In the context of multi-connectivity, the received SINR depends on all connected links where each link experiences independent fading and on the used link combining technique. As a result, the computation of effective SINR also depends on the combining technique and fading experienced by individual links. To model PHY performance by considering all these effects, we develop PLA for multi-connectivity communications. This includes the computation of received symbols SINR for various link combining techniques and mapping them to effective SINR using enhanced exponential effective SINR mapping (eEESM). Furthermore, a new optimization method is introduced for eEESM to reduce its optimization complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed PLA accurately estimate the performance of different order of multi-connectivity communications under various fading conditions.}

	abstract = {Multiuser techniques play a central role in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks that exploit spatial diversity to serve multiple users simultaneously in the same frequency resource. It is well known that a multi-antenna base station (BS) can efficiently serve a number of users not exceeding the number of antennas at the BS via precoding design. However, when there are more users than the number of antennas at the BS, conventional precoding design methods perform poorly because inter-user interference cannot be efficiently eliminated. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a highly-loaded multiuser system in which a BS simultaneously serves a number of users that is larger than the number of antennas. We propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation and precoding design framework and apply it to two important problems in multiuser systems: i) User fairness maximization and ii) Transmit power minimization, both subject to predefined quality of service (QoS) requirements. The premise of the proposed framework is to dynamically assign orthogonal frequency channels to different user groups and carefully design the precoding vectors within every user group. Since the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose two iterative algorithms based on successive convex approximations (SCA), whose convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity user grouping policy based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) to further improve the system performance. Finally, we demonstrate via numerical results that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing designs in the literature.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of a heterogeneous network (HetNet) supported by dual connectivity (DC) by adopting multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as passive relays that carry reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). More specifically, RISs are deployed under the UAVs termed as UAVs-RISs that operate over the micro-wave (\nμW\n) channel in the sky to sustain a strong line-of-sight (LoS) connection with the ground users. The macro-cell operates over the\nμW\nchannel based on orthogonal multiple access (OMA), while small base stations (SBSs) operate over the millimeter-wave (mmW) channel based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). We study the problem of total transmit power minimization by jointly optimizing the trajectory/velocity of each UAV, RISs’ phase shifts, subcarrier allocations, and active beamformers at each BS. The underlying problem is highly non-convex and the global optimal solution is intractable. To handle it, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., a subproblem which deals with the UAVs’ trajectories/velocities, RISs’ phase shifts, and subcarrier allocations for\nμW\n; and a subproblem for active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for mmW. In particular, we solve the first subproblem via the dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach by developing a distributed algorithm which leads to a better policy evaluation. Then, we solve the active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for the mmW via the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme compared to other baseline schemes. In particular, it is revealed that by deploying UAVs-RISs, the transmit power can be reduced by 6 dBm while maintaining similar guaranteed QoS.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is one of the key issues in practical massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Compared with conventional estimation algorithms, deep learning (DL) based ones have exhibited great potential in terms of performance and complexity. In this paper, an attention mechanism, exploiting the channel distribution characteristics, is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy of highly separable channels with narrow angular spread by realizing the “divide-and-conquer” policy. Specifically, we introduce a novel attention-aided DL channel estimation framework for conventional massive MIMO systems and devise an embedding method to effectively integrate the attention mechanism into the fully connected neural network for the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture. Simulation results show that in both scenarios, the channel estimation performance is significantly improved with the aid of attention at the cost of small complexity overhead. Furthermore, strong robustness under different system and channel parameters can be achieved by the proposed approach, which further strengthens its practical value. We also investigate the distributions of learned attention maps to reveal the role of attention, which endows the proposed approach with a certain degree of interpretability.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize the downlink multi-user communication of a millimeter wave base station, which is assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent reflector (IR). In particular, a channel estimation approach is developed to measure the channel state information (CSI) in real-time. First, for a perfect CSI scenario, the precoding transmission of the BS and the reflection coefficient of the IR are jointly optimized, via an iterative approach, so as to maximize the sum of downlink rates towards multiple users. Next, in the imperfect CSI scenario, a distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed to learn the optimal IR reflection and maximize the expectation of downlink capacity. In order to model the transmission rate’s probability distribution, a learning algorithm, based on quantile regression (QR), is developed, and the proposed QR-DRL method is proved to converge to a stable distribution of downlink transmission rate. Simulation results show that, in the error-free CSI scenario, the proposed approach yields over 30% and 2-fold increase in the downlink sum-rate, compared with a fixed IR reflection scheme and direct transmission scheme, respectively. Simulation results also show that by deploying more IR elements, the downlink sum-rate can be significantly improved. However, as the number of IR components increases, more time is required for channel estimation, and the slope of increase in the IR-aided transmission rate will become smaller. Furthermore, under limited knowledge of CSI, simulation results show that the proposed QR-DRL method, which learns a full distribution of the downlink rate, yields a better prediction accuracy and improves the downlink rate by 10% for online deployments, compared with a Q-learning baseline.}

	abstract = {Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) are poised to provide ubiquitous connectivity for billions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the required low-latency massive access necessitates a paradigm shift in the design of random access schemes, which invokes a need of efficient joint activity and data detection (JADD) algorithms. By exploiting the feature of sporadic traffic in massive access, a beacon-aided slotted grant-free massive access solution is proposed. Specifically, we spread the uplink access signals in multiple subcarriers with pre-equalization processing and formulate the JADD as a multiple measurement vectors (MMV) compressive sensing problem. Moreover, to leverage the structured sparsity of uplink massive access signals among multiple time slots, we develop two computationally efficient detection algorithms, which are termed as orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP)-MMV algorithm with simplified structure learning (SSL) and accurate structure learning (ASL). To achieve accurate detection, the expectation maximization algorithm is exploited for learning the sparsity ratio and the noise variance. To further improve the detection performance, channel coding is applied and successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based OAMP-MMV-SSL and OAMP-MMV-ASL algorithms are developed, where the likelihood ratio obtained in the soft-decision can be exploited for refining the activity identification. Finally, the state evolution of the proposed OAMP-MMV-SSL and OAMP-MMV-ASL algorithms is derived to predict the performance theoretically. Simulation results verify that the proposed solutions outperform various state-of-the-art baseline schemes, enabling low-latency random access and high-reliable massive IoT connectivity with overloading.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the robust beamforming design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled networks, where the rate-splitting (RS) scheme and the power-splitting (PS) energy harvesting (EH) receiver are adopted for secure information transfer and EH, respectively. In order to explore the worst-case energy efficiency (EE) performance limit of the system, an EE maximization problem is formulated with the elliptically bounded channel state information error model under the constraints of the quality of service (QoS) requirements of information decoding users, the EH requirements of EH users and the power budget at the transmitter. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, a sequential minimal optimization-based algorithm is first proposed to construct a mapping table and the optimal PS ratios of the PS EH receiver are found by searching the table. Then, a dual-layer iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the maximal EE based on the Dinkelbach’s method in the inner loop and the successive convex approximation method in the outer loop. To accelerate the convergence of the outer loop, an efficient initialization algorithm is also designed. Simulation results show that the RS scheme contributes to the EE enhancement, and the PS EH receiver enlarges the rate-energy region restricted by the non-linear EH circuit. Moreover, traditional sum-rate maximization design and power minimization design may induce a notable worst-case EE performance loss at the high-power region and the low-QoS requirement region, respectively.}

In the considered system, macro base stations (MBSs) are supplied by the grid power and small base stations (SBSs) have the energy harvesting capability in addition to the grid power supplement. Multiple infrastructure providers (InPs) own the physical resources, i.e., BSs and radio resources. The Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) are able to recent these resources from the InPs and operate the virtualized resources for providing services to different users. In particular, aiming to maximize the overall utility for the MVNOs, a joint resource (spectrum and power) allocation and user association problem is presented. First, we present an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm solution to find the near-optimal solution in a static manner. Moreover, we also utilize deep reinforcement learning to design the optimal policy without knowing a priori knowledge of the dynamic nature of networks. We have conducted extensive simulation and the performance evaluation demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is envisioned to play a significant role in future wireless communication systems as an effective means of reconfiguring the radio signal propagation environment. In this paper, we study a new multi-IRS aided massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where a multi-antenna BS transmits independent messages to a set of remote single-antenna users using orthogonal beams that are subsequently reflected by different groups of IRSs via their respective multi-hop passive beamforming over pairwise line-of-sight (LoS) links. We aim to select optimal IRSs and their beam routing path for each of the users, along with the active/passive beamforming at the BS/IRSs, such that the minimum received signal power among all users is maximized. This problem is particularly difficult to solve due to a new type of path separation constraints for avoiding the IRS-reflected signal induced interference among different users. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal BS/IRS active/passive beamforming solutions based on their practical codebooks given the reflection paths. Then we show that the resultant multi-beam multi-hop routing problem can be recast as an equivalent graph-optimization problem, which is however NP-complete. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an efficient recursive algorithm to partially enumerate the feasible routing solutions, which is able to effectively balance the performance-complexity trade-off. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance with low complexity and outperforms other benchmark schemes. Useful insights into the optimal multi-beam multi-hop routing design are also drawn under different setups of the multi-IRS aided massive MIMO network.}

In this paper, we investigate short-packet communications to provide both reliability and security guarantees simultaneously with an eavesdropper. In particular, an outage probability considering both reliability and secrecy is defined according to the characteristics of short-packet transmission, while the effective throughput in the sense of outage is established as the performance metric. Specifically, a general analytical framework is proposed to approximate the outage probability and effective throughput. Furthermore, closed-form expressions for these quantities are derived for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Both effective throughput obtained via a general analytical framework and a high-SNR approximation are maximized under an outage-probability constraint by searching for the optimal blocklength. Numerical results verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed analytical framework, and illustrate the influence of the main system parameters on the blocklength and system performance under the outage-probability constraint.}

	abstract = {Federated learning provides a promising paradigm to enable network edge intelligence in the future sixth generation (6G) systems. However, due to the high dynamics of wireless circumstances and user behavior, the collected training data is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which causes severe performance degradation of federated learning. To solve this problem, federated learning with non-IID data in wireless networks is studied in this paper. Firstly, based on the derived upper bound of expected weight divergence, a federated averaging scheme is proposed to reduce the distribution divergence of non-IID data. Secondly, to further harmonize the distribution divergence, data sharing is associated with federated learning in wireless networks, and a joint optimization algorithm is designed to keep a sophisticated balance between the model accuracy and the cost. Finally, the simulation results based on a common-used image data set are provided to evaluate the performance of our proposed schemes, which can achieve significant performance gains with a small price of latency and energy consumption.}

This paper investigates the capacity of RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbiotic communications utilizing multiple reflecting patterns, where each reflecting pattern is non-uniformly activated to carry additional information. To enhance transmission performance, the reflecting patterns, reflecting activation probability, and the transmit covariance matrix are jointly designed. Since the exact expression of the system capacity is intractable, the lower and upper bounds on the capacity are derived and used for optimization in this paper. Based on the lower bound on the capacity, a gradient ascent algorithm is developed to find the optimal reflecting patterns, reflecting activation probability, and the transmit covariance matrix. By taking advantage of the concise-form upper bound on the capacity, closed-form solutions of the reflecting activation probability and transmit covariance matrix can be derived after optimizing the reflecting patterns. The superiority of the proposed design is investigated and verified by computer simulations. Some selected numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve a higher capacity than the benchmark adopting only one reflecting pattern.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emergent architecture, which brings computation and storage resources to the edge of mobile network and provides rich services and applications near the end users. The joint problem of task offloading and resource allocation in the multi-user collaborative mobile edge computing network (C-MEC) based on Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a challenging issue. In this paper, we investigate the offloading decision, collaboration decision, computing resource allocation and communication resource allocation problem in C-MEC. The delay-sensitive tasks of users can be computed locally, offloaded to collaborative devices or MEC servers. The goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of all mobile users under the delay constraint. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which involves the joint optimization of task offloading decision, collaboration decision, subcarrier and power allocation, and computing resource allocation. A two-level alternation method framework is proposed to solve the formulated MINLP problem. In the upper level, a heuristic algorithm is used to handle the collaboration decision and offloading decisions under the initial setting; and in the lower level, the allocation of power, subcarrier, and computing resources is updated through deep reinforcement learning based on the current offloading decision. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent performance in energy efficient and task completion rate (CR) for different network parameter settings.}

However, the multidimensional constellation design (MCD) and multiuser detection (MUD) in GF-NOMA are usually optimized in a divide and conquer way, leading to local optima and performance degradation. To address this issue, we investigate the joint optimization of MCD and MUD for GF-NOMA. The formulated joint optimization is based on variational inference, which is intractable due to the signal superimposition that makes the optimization variables intricately coupled. Then, we resort to end-to-end deep learning (DL) to obtain the optimal solution. Specifically, we propose a DL-based multi-task variational autoencoder (Mul-VAE) that adopts a variational autoencoder network to optimize the distribution of the constellation points. We further derive the loss function of the proposed network and analyze it from an information-theoretic perspective. On this basis, multi-task learning is employed to deal with mutually conflicting yet related detection processes. Besides, taking heterogeneous transmission rates of users into account, a multi-task prioritizing strategy is designed to balance training performance. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method enables significant gains compared to state-of-the-art techniques.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology for improving the spectral and energy efficiency in 5G-and-beyond wireless networks. For a tractable analysis, most of the previous works on Massive MIMO have been focused on the system performance with complex Gaussian channel impulse responses under rich-scattering environments. In contrast, this paper investigates the uplink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) of each user under the double scattering channel model. We derive a closed-form expression of the uplink ergodic SE by exploiting the maximum ratio (MR) combining technique based on imperfect channel state information. We further study the asymptotic SE behaviors as a function of the number of antennas at each base station (BS) and the number of scatterers available at each radio channel. We then formulate and solve a total energy optimization problem for the uplink data transmission that aims at simultaneously satisfying the required SEs from all the users with limited data power resource. Notably, our proposed algorithms can cope with the congestion issue appearing when at least one user is served by lower SE than requested. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the closed-form ergodic SE over Monte-Carlo simulations. Besides, the system can still provide the required SEs to many users even under congestion.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a joint signal detection algorithm under the framework of the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for uplink massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with generalized spatial modulation (GSM). By projecting the discrete probability distribution into a multivariate complex Gaussian function, the symbol beliefs of the tridimensional GSM constellation are calculated via the iterative propagation of the mean vectors and covariance matrices. To reduce the computational complexity, an efficient separate signal detection called two-stage EP (TS-EP) algorithm is designed. In the first stage, the active transmit antenna indices are determined via the EP. Each vector-valued variable node (VN) in the factor graph is decomposed into multiple sub-VNs, and the invalid sub-VNs of the determined silent transmit antennas are pruned from the factor graph. In the second stage, since the modulation symbols are independent conditioned on the active transmit antennas, the symbols are independently detected by adopting the EP with univariate complex Gaussian approximations, and the number of probability calculations for each symbol belief is significantly reduced in the subsequent EP update. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed EP and TS-EP signal detection schemes outperform the recently proposed counterparts. Moreover, the proposed TS-EP algorithm strikes a desirable and flexible performance-complexity tradeoff.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel network framework of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where IRS is used to enhance the NOMA performance and the wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency of SWIPT. We formulate a problem of minimizing base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, BS transmit beamforming vector, power splitting (PS) ratio and IRS phase shift while taking into account the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement and energy harvested threshold of each user. The formulated problem is non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult to solve it directly. Hence, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problem by applying semidefinite relaxation (SDR), Gaussian randomization and successive convex approximation (SCA). Specifically, after determining SIC decoding order by designing IRS phase shift in the first stage, we alternately optimize BS transmit beamforming vector, PS ratio, and IRS phase shift to minimize the BS transmit power. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed optimization algorithm in reducing BS transmit power compared to other baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, compared with non-IRS-assisted network, the IRS-assisted SWIPT NOMA network can decrease BS transmit power by 51.13%.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter wave (mmWave) are two key enabling technologies for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and beyond. In this paper, we consider uplink communications with a hybrid beamforming structure and focus on improving the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA systems with enhanced user grouping and power allocation. It is noted that the optimization of the SE/EE is a challenging task due to the non-linear programming nature of the corresponding problem involving user grouping, beam selection, and power allocation. Our idea is to decompose the overall optimization problem into a mixed integer problem comprised of user grouping and beam selection only, followed by a continuous problem involving power allocation and digital beamforming design. Exploiting the directionality property of mmWave channels, we first propose a novel initial agglomerative nesting (AGNES) based user grouping algorithm by taking advantage of the channel correlations. To avoid the prohibitively high complexity of the brute-force search approach and to address the overlapping beam problem, we propose two suboptimal low-complexity user grouping and beam selection schemes, the two-stage direct AGNES (D-AGNES) scheme and the joint successive AGNES (S-AGNES) scheme. We also introduce the quadratic transform (QT) to recast the non-convex power allocation optimization problem into a convex one subject to a minimum required data rate of each user. The continuous problem is solved by iteratively optimizing the power and the digital beamforming. Extensive simulation results have shown that our proposed mmWave-NOMA design outperforms the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scenario and the state-of-art NOMA schemes.}

	abstract = {Visible light positioning and computer vision-based localization have the potential to be cost-effective technologies for accurate indoor localization. However, the feasibility of existing methods in this domain is limited. In this paper, a novel visible light communication (VLC)-assisted perspective-four-line algorithm (V-P4L) is proposed for practical indoor localization. The basic idea of V-P4L is to jointly use VLC and computer vision techniques to achieve high localization accuracy regardless of LED height differences. In particular, the space-domain information is first exploited to estimate the orientation and coordinate information of a single rectangular LED luminaire in the camera coordinate system based on plane geometry theory and solid geometry theory. Then, by using time-domain information transmitted by VLC and the estimated luminaire information, the proposed V-P4L can estimate the position and pose of the camera using single-view geometry theory and the linear least square (LLS) method. To further mitigate the effect of height differences among LEDs on localization accuracy, a correction algorithm based on the LLS method and a simple optimization method is proposed. Due to the combination of time- and space-domain information, V-P4L can achieve accurate localization using a single luminaire without limitation on the correspondences between the features and their projections in conventional perspective-n-line (PnL) algorithms. Simulation results show that the position error caused by the proposed V-P4L algorithm is always less than 15 cm and the orientation error is always less than 4° using popular indoor luminaires. Experimental results with real hardware show that the average position error is less than 3 cm under both similar and different heights for the LEDs.}

	abstract = {A key enabler for both scalability and sustainability in beyond 5G (B5G) network slicing consists on minimizing the exchange of raw monitoring data across different domains. This is achieved by bringing the analysis functions closer to the data collection points. To this end, we introduce in this paper statistical federated learning (SFL) provisioning models that can learn over a live network non independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets in an offline fashion while respecting slice-level service level agreement (SLA) long-term statistical constraints. Specifically, we consider three resource SLA metrics, namely, cumulative distribution function (CDF),\nQ\n- th percentile and maximum/minimum bounds . These metrics are dataset-dependent and non-convex non-differentiable and, to sidestep the inaccuracy of settling only for surrogates, we propose a novel formulation that jointly considers the statistical objective and constraints as well as their smooth approximation using the proxy-Lagrangian framework, which we solve via a non-zero sum two-player game strategy. Numerical results on various slice-level resources show that SFL enables SLA enforcement while significantly reducing the overhead compared to both state-of-the-art FedAvg and centralized constrained deep learning schemes. Finally, we provide an analysis for the lower bound of the so-called reliable convergence probability in the SFL setup.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), consisting of low-cost passive elements, is a promising technology for improving the spectral and energy efficiency of the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. It is also noteworthy that an IRS can shape the reflected signal propagation. Most works in IRS-assisted systems have ignored the impact of the inevitable residual hardware impairments (HWIs) at both the transceiver hardware and the IRS while any relevant works have addressed only simple scenarios, e.g., with single-antenna network nodes and/or without taking the randomness of phase noise at the IRS into account. In this work, we aim at filling up this gap by considering a general IRS-assisted multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with imperfect channel state information (CSI) and correlated Rayleigh fading. In parallel, we present a general computationally efficient methodology for IRS reflecting beamforming (RB) optimization. Specifically, we introduce an advantageous channel estimation (CE) method for such systems accounting for the HWIs. Moreover, we derive the uplink achievable spectral efficiency (SE) with maximal-ratio combining (MRC) receiver, displaying three significant advantages being: 1) its closed-form expression, 2) its dependence only on large-scale statistics, and 3) its low training overhead. Notably, by exploiting the first two benefits, we achieve to perform optimization with respect to the RB that can take place only per several coherence intervals, and thus, reduces significantly the computational cost compared to other methods based on instantaneous CSI which require frequent phase optimization. Among the insightful observations, we highlight that the unrealistic assumption of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading does not allow optimization of the SE, which makes the application of an IRS ineffective. Also, in the case that the phase drifts, describing the distortion of the phases in the RBM, are uniformly distributed, the presence of an IRS provides no advantage. The analytical results outperform previous works and are verified by Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations.}

	abstract = {Coded caching has become a hot research topic in recent years. However, existing studies rarely consider the delay constrained transmissions over wireless fading channels. For strict delay constrained content delivery over wireless fading channels, power optimization is usually required to achieve energy-efficient transmissions. Moreover, in coded caching, since the data to different users is transmitted via many coded multicast transmissions, the scheduling of these transmissions over fading channels is also critical for minimizing energy consumption. To this end, a joint scheduling and power optimization problem is formulated to minimize the expected energy consumption over wireless fading channels under strict delay constraints. Causal channel state information (CSI) is considered in this paper for practical cases, which nonetheless makes the optimal solution to this problem hard to achieve due to the uncertain future channel states. Therefore, a heuristic approach is developed to solve this problem. The number of slots for each coded multicast transmission is first determined by obtaining the optimal result of a nonlinear integer programming (NLIP) problem based on statistical channel estimations. Next, a closed-form inverse-waterfilling algorithm is carried out to allocate power for the coded transmissions under delay constraints, and then the one that saves the maximum energy consumption is scheduled for transmission. The heuristic approach is proved to achieve a result that is upper-bounded by a parameter times the optimal result of the original problem under non-causal CSI. Simulation results further show that compared to the benchmark with only slot allocation for each coded transmission, our approach with joint scheduling and power optimization can significantly save energy consumption while ensuring strict delay constraints.}

	abstract = {Coded computation has attracted great interests as a promising technique to cope with straggling computing nodes in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Contrary to the existing coded computation schemes developed with a fixed network topology, this paper studies a MDS coded computation for random networks. Specifically, we put forth maximum distance separable (MDS) coded task offloading and investigate its MDS coded computing gain by deriving the average successful retrieval probability with stochastic geometry in random wireless edge computing networks, where it encodes the original task into multiple equal and small sized MDS coded sub-tasks and offloads their subset to edge computing nodes for computation. We also identify a tradeoff between the latency in processing a sub-task at an edge node and the minimal number of edge nodes required to retrieve the original task output, according to the size of MDS coded sub-tasks. To efficiently control the tradeoff, we determine the desirable size of MDS coded sub-tasks in a semi-closed form to maximize the average successful retrieval probability for regime 1 and regime 2 networks, which correspond to the cases that communication latency is negligible compared to computation latency and that computation latency is negligible compared to communication latency, respectively, and develop an efficient algorithm with low search complexity for a general environment. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms the other conventional task offloading schemes such as partial task offloading and replication task offloading in terms of average successful retrieval probability.}

	abstract = {In frequency-division-duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, channel state information (CSI) feedback waiting phase does not get fully exploited since base station needs to wait for the CSI feedback before transmitting downlink data. The proportion of the CSI feedback waiting phase during the downlink transmission would be high as the MIMO system scales up, which sacrifices downlink rates of the FDD massive MIMO systems significantly. In this paper, we first present a channel prediction-aided FDD scheme to utilize the idle waiting time efficiently. Then we propose a novel channel prediction method based on Bayesian neural network (BNN), which can handle the uncertainty in a natural manner and learn regularization from data without painstaking manual pre-tuning of network hyperparameters. Numerical results show that our proposed channel prediction-aided FDD scheme can achieve remarkable performance gains in terms of either achievable downlink rates or bit error rate. Moreover, our proposed BNN-based channel predictor is much more effective and robust in contrast to the state-of-the-art channel prediction techniques such as autoregressive model and recurrent neural network.}

	abstract = {This work studies the quality of service (QoS) performance of wireless networks that integrate light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi). While the hybrid network is potential for improving network capacity, load balancing becomes essential and challenging due to the nature of heterogeneous access points (APs). A number of studies have been conducted to address this issue, focusing on maximising the network capacity with user fairness constraints. However, in practice, QoS metrics including packet loss ratio and latency are important to network services. In this paper, QoS-driven load balancing is studied for hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks (HLWNets) in two scenarios: single-AP association (SA) and multi-AP association (MA). In each case, an optimisation problem is formulated to minimise the packet loss ratio and latency, and a low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Results show that the novel methods, especially MA, can effectively balance the traffic loads among the APs and improve the QoS performance. In addition, the more subflows the better performance MA provides. Targeting the same level of QoS, MA can achieve a system throughput up to 160% higher than the signal strength strategy and 130% higher than the proportional fairness load balancing.}

Firstly, we derive the achievable rates for Gaussian distributions inputs and practical finite-alphabet inputs. Then, we investigate the SE maximization problems subject to both the total transmit power constraint and the average optical power constraint with the above two inputs, respectively. By exploiting the relationship between the mutual information and the minimum mean-squared error, an optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to maximize the SE with finite-alphabet inputs. To reduce the computational complexity of the power allocation scheme, we derive a closed-form lower bound of the SE. Also, considering the quality of service, we further tackle the non-convex EE maximization problems of ACO-OFDM with the two inputs, respectively. The problems are solved by the proposed Dinkelbach-type iterative algorithm. In each iteration, the interior point algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal power allocation.The performance of the proposed power allocation schemes for the SE and EE maximization are validated through numerical analysis.}

In this paper, we propose a positioning pipeline for wireless LAN MIMO-OFDM systems which uses uplink CSI measurements obtained from one or more unsynchronized access points (APs). For each AP receiver, novel features are first extracted from the CSI that are robust to system impairments arising in real-world transceivers. These features are the inputs to a NN that extracts a probability map indicating the likelihood of a UE being at a given grid point. The NN output is then fused across multiple APs to provide a final position estimate. We provide experimental results with real-world indoor measurements under line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS propagation conditions for an 80MHz bandwidth IEEE 802.11ac system using a two-antenna transmit UE and two AP receivers each with four antennas.

In Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), which is a candidate solution in 5G and future communication networks, cooperation is applied by means of central processors (CPs) connected to simple remote radio heads with finite capacity fronthaul links. In this study, we consider a downlink C-RAN with a wireless fronthaul and aim to minimize total power spent by jointly designing beamformers for fronthaul and access links. We consider the case where perfect channel state information is not available in the CP. We first derive a novel theoretical performance bound for the problem defined. Then we propose four algorithms with different complexities to show the tightness of the bound. The first two algorithms apply successive convex optimizations with semi-definite relaxation ideas where the other two are adapted from well-known beamforming design methods. The detailed simulations under realistic channel conditions show that as the complexity of the algorithm increases, the corresponding performance becomes closer to the bound.}

Beamforming achieves such directional or spatial concentration of signals and enables phased array-based radios to achieve high data rates. Designing beams for millimeter wave and terahertz communication using massive phased arrays, however, is challenging due to hardware constraints and the wide bandwidth in these systems. For example, beams which are optimal at the center frequency may perform poor in wideband communication systems where the radio frequencies differ substantially from the center frequency. The poor performance in such systems is due to differences in the optimal beamformers corresponding to distinct radio frequencies within the wide bandwidth. Such a mismatch leads to a misfocus effect in near-field systems and the beam squint effect in far-field systems. In this paper, we investigate the misfocus effect and propose InFocus, a low complexity technique to construct beams that are well suited for massive wideband phased arrays. The beams are constructed using a carefully designed frequency modulated waveform in the spatial dimension. InFocus mitigates beam misfocus and beam squint when applied to near-field and far-field systems.}

	abstract = {The reliability of current virtual reality (VR) delivery is low due to the limited resources on VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) and the transmission rate bottleneck of sub-6 GHz networks. In this paper, we propose a dual-connectivity sub-6 GHz and mmWave heterogeneous network architecture empowered by mobile edge capability. The core idea of the proposed architecture is to utilize the complementary advantages of sub-6 GHz links and mmWave links to conduct a collaborative edge resource design, which aims to improve the reliability of VR delivery. From the perspective of stochastic geometry, we analyze the reliability of VR delivery and theoretically demonstrate that sub-6 GHz links can be used to enhance the reliability of VR delivery despite the large mmWave bandwidth. Based on our analytical work, we formulate a joint caching and computing optimization problem with the goal to maximize the reliability of VR delivery. By analyzing the coupling caching and computing strategies at HMDs, sub-6 GHz and mmWave base stations (BSs), we further transform the problem into a multiple-choice multi-dimension knapsack problem. A best-first branch and bound algorithm and a difference of convex programming algorithm are proposed to obtain the optimal and sub-optimal solution, respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance improvement using the proposed algorithms, and reveal that caching more monocular videos at sub-6 GHz BSs and more stereoscopic videos at mmWave BSs can improve the VR delivery reliability efficiently.}

	abstract = {Recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been considered as a promising candidate for accommodating various emerging communication and sensing applications in high-mobility environments. In this paper, we propose a novel cross domain iterative detection algorithm to enhance the error performance of OTFS modulation. Different from conventional OTFS detection methods, the proposed algorithm applies basic estimation/detection approaches to both the time domain and delay-Doppler (DD) domain and iteratively updates the extrinsic information from two domains with the unitary transformation. In doing so, the proposed algorithm exploits the time domain channel sparsity and the DD domain symbol constellation constraints. We evaluate the estimation/detection error variance in each domain for each iteration and derive the state evolution to investigate the detection error performance. We show that the performance gain due to iterations comes from the non-Gaussian constellation constraint in the DD domain. More importantly, we prove that the proposed algorithm can indeed converge and, in the convergence, the proposed algorithm can achieve almost the same error performance as the maximum-likelihood sequence detection even in the presence of fractional Doppler shifts. Furthermore, the computational complexity associated with the domain transformation is low, thanks to the structure of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) kernel. Simulation results are consistent with our analysis and demonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to conventional OTFS detection methods.}

	abstract = {Recently, networks operate at frequencies over 28 GHz (mmWave) have emerged as a viable solution for 5G mobile networks to provide Gbps data rate. Due to the high directivity and attenuation of mmWave signals, mmWave communication links are highly vulnerable to the frequent mmWave channel blockages, which can trigger excessive handovers. Thanks to its ability to enrich the scattering environment and create reflective signal multipaths, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has great potential to counter the blockage effect and thus greatly reduce the number of unnecessary handovers. However, this potential has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted handover scheme by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Under various channel blockage conditions, the DRL agent manages to reduce the cumulative handover overhead by jointly adjusting beamformers and RIS phase shifts. Compared with the existing schemes without considering RIS, the RIS-assisted handover scheme significantly reduces the number of handovers and achieves higher spectrum efficiency. Besides, to alleviate the impact from the limited observations of the fast fading channels, we propose a lightweight algorithm to sense the blockage status and such sensing results can be utilized to improve the performance of model training. Numerical results show that DRL agent is able to further improve the performance when integrated with the blockage status sensing algorithm.}

We propose two channel estimation and data detection designs for SP-OTFS systems which, unlike the existing OTFS designs, do not designate any slots for pilots, and consequently have higher spectral efficiency (SE). The first SP design estimates channel by treating data as interference, which degrades its performance at high signal to noise ratio. The second SP design alleviates this problem by iterating between channel estimation and data detection. Both these designs detect data using message passing algorithm which exploits OTFS channel sparsity, and consequently has low computational complexity. We also derive a lower bound on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the proposed designs and maximize it by optimally allocating power between data and pilot symbols. We numerically validate the derived analytical results, and show that the proposed designs have superior SE than the existing OTFS channel estimation and data detection designs.}

	abstract = {Beam management is central in the operation of beamformed wireless cellular systems such as 5G New Radio (NR) networks. Focusing the energy radiated to mobile terminals (MTs) by increasing the number of beams per cell increases signal power and decreases interference, and has hence the potential to bring major improvements on area spectral efficiency (ASE). This paper proposes a first system-level stochastic geometry model encompassing major aspects of the beam management problem: frequencies, antenna configurations, and propagation; physical layer, wireless links, and coding; network geometry, interference, and resource sharing; sensing, signaling, and mobility management. This model leads to a simple analytical expression for the effective rate that the typical user gets in this context. This in turn allows one to find the number of beams per cell and per MT that maximizes the effective ASE by offering the best tradeoff between beamforming gains and beam management operational overheads and costs, for a wide variety of 5G network scenarios including millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-6 GHz. As part of the system-level analysis, we define and analyze several underlying new and fundamental performance metrics that are of independent interest. The numerical results discuss the effects of different systemic tradeoffs and performance optimizations of mmWave and sub-6 GHz 5G deployments.}

Invoking an asymptotic characterization, we address two particular applications.

We further validate our derivations through various numerical experiments.}

The user grouping is performed simultaneously with JADCE, which provides the prerequisites of the joint spatial division and multiplexing to achieve significant savings both in the downlink training and feedback of channel state information at the transmitter. Based on the acquired knowledge of user grouping, we further propose a per-group processing based JADCE (PGP-JADCE) approach. It significantly reduces the computational overhead for JADCE and the BS is capable to process all the user groups in parallel. Further, the analysis of detection error probabilities and channel estimation error of PGP-JADCE is provided.}

To obtain the necessary channel parameters, i.e., angles, delays and gains, for environment mapping and user localization, we propose a novel twin-IRS structure consisting of two IRS planes with a relative spatial rotation. We model the training signal from the user equipment to the base station via IRSs as a third-order canonical polyadic tensor with a maximal tensor rank equal to the number of IRS unit cells. We present four designs of IRS training coefficients, i.e., random, structured, grouping and sparse patterns, and analyze the corresponding uniqueness conditions of channel estimation. We extract the cascaded channel parameters by leveraging array signal processing and atomic norm denoising techniques. Based on the characteristics of the twin-IRS structures, we formulate a nonlinear equation system to exactly recover the multipath parameters by two efficient decoupling modes. We realize environment mapping and user localization based on the estimated channel parameters. Simulation results indicate that the proposed twin-IRS structure and estimation schemes can recover the channel state information with remarkable accuracy, thereby offering a centimeter-level resolution of user positioning.}

In particular, by exploiting the simultaneously sparse and low-rank structure of mmW/THz channels with spreads in the delay-angular domain, we propose two multi-rank aware JADCE algorithms via applying the quotient geometry of product of complex rank-\nL\nmatrices with the number of clusters\nL\n. It is proved that the proposed algorithms require a smaller number of measurements than the currently known bounds on measurements of conventional simultaneously sparse and low-rank recovery algorithms. Statistical analysis also shows that the proposed algorithms can linearly converge to the ground truth with low computational complexity.

However, the development of NR-U networks should consider the coexistence with the incumbent Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) based mmWave NR-U and WiGig coexistence network for uplink transmission. Our aim for the proposed coexistence network is to maximize the spectral efficiency while ensuring the strict NR-U delay requirement and the WiGig transmission performance in real time environments. A joint user grouping, hybrid beam coordination and power control strategy is proposed, which is formulated as a Lyapunov optimization based mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) with unit-modulus and nonconvex coupling constraints. Hence, we introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework, which first transfers the formulated MINLP into a tractable augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem. Thereafter, we integrate both convex-concave procedure (CCCP) and inexact block coordinate update (BCU) methods to approximately decompose the AL problem into multiple nested convex subproblems, which can be iteratively solved under the PDD framework. Numerical results illustrate the performance improvement ability of the proposed strategy, as well as demonstrating the effectiveness to guarantee the NR-U traffic delay and WiGig network performance.}

This paper investigates a deep learning-based optimization approach of the downlink beamforming to maximize the system sum rate, when only the uplink channel information is available. Our main contribution is to propose a model-driven learning technique that exploits the structure of the optimal downlink beamforming to design an effective hybrid learning strategy with the aim to maximize the sum rate performance. This is achieved by jointly considering the learning performance of the downlink channel, the power and the sum rate in the training stage. The proposed approach applies to generic cases in which the uplink channel information is available, but its relation to the downlink channel is unknown and does not require an explicit downlink channel estimation. We further extend the developed technique to massive multiple-input multiple-output scenarios and achieve a distributed learning strategy for multicell systems without an inter-cell signalling overhead. Simulation results verify that our proposed method provides the performance close to the state of the art numerical algorithms with perfect downlink channel information and significantly outperforms existing data-driven methods in terms of the sum rate.}

	abstract = {In the areas after natural disaster strikes, the ground communication network can be failed, due to the damage of the communication infrastructure. However, during or after the natural disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis, ground vehicles may not enter the affected areas easily to set up mobile base stations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be an alternate to provide emergency coverage for ground nodes (GNs). Therefore, how to determine the best location for UAV to achieve the maximum coverage is a key issue. In this paper, an adaptive UAV deployment scheme is proposed to solve the coverage problem of UAV- aided GNs communication. The objective is to optimize the location of the UAV to cover as many GNs as possible and reduce communication energy consumption. We construct a unique analysis method assisted by the collected ground information to solve this problem. First, we propose an information collection method based on the communication probability of Line-of-Sight (LoS) to guarantee the integrity of ground information acquisition. Then, based on the results of the information collection, a virtual obstacle model is built around each GN. Meanwhile, the UAV’s coverage problem is decomposed from the horizontal and vertical dimensions to simplify the difficulty of solving the problem. Finally, the best location of the UAV and the optimal transmission power of GNs can be obtained through the iterative methods and the power control, respectively. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deployment scheme outperforms its counterparts.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of training signal design for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication under a sparse channel model is considered. The problem is approached based on the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRB) on the mean-square error (MSE) of channel estimation. By exploiting the sparse structure of mmWave channels, the CRB for the channel parameter composed of path gains and path angles is derived in closed form under Bayesian and hybrid parameter assumptions. Based on the derivation and analysis, an IRS reflection pattern design method is proposed by minimizing the CRB as a function of design variables under constant modulus constraint on reflection coefficients. Extensions of the proposed design to a multi-antenna transceiver, a uniform planar array (UPA)-based IRS, and multi-user case are discussed. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design method for sparse mmWave channel estimation.}

	abstract = {In Band Full Duplex (IBFD) is a promising technology to double Spectral Efficiency (SE). Due to practical limitations in realizing IBFD User Equipments (UEs), Hybrid IBFD Cellular Network (HICN), composed of an IBFD Base Station (BS) and legacy Half Duplex (HD) UEs, is preferred. Optimum resource allocation algorithm for HICNs has been of great interest, and it primarily relies on UE-to-UE Channel State Information (CSI). Though computational and signaling intensive approaches are used in literature to obtain this CSI, we introduce a location-aware technique without these overheads at UEs. Using proposed idea of frequency sharing within UE groups, we formulate a constrained optimization problem for HICNs to maximize sum-SE. Based on multiple constraints imposed, frequency sharing possibilities amongst UEs are captured in the adjacency matrix, which lays the foundation for UE grouping. An exhaustive search from adjacency matrix identifies the theoretically best UE groups to achieve maximum frequency sharing. For practical realizations, a computationally efficient algorithm to identify optimal groups of two and/or three UEs is derived. We propose a novel correlation approach to avoid expensive resource allocations in every scheduling interval. Simulation results reveal median sum-SE of 89% over HD systems, thus making the proposed solution far more attractive.}

The original optimization problem aims to maximize time-average QoE subject to delay and queue stability constraints. The intractability of the considered problem comes from the necessity to allocate resources across periods of time slots. After applying virtual queue transformation and Lyapunov optimization method, the targeting problem can be converted into two independent AC and BA sub-problems in each time slot. The converted problem involves actual and virtual queues, which causes conflicting tendency. With the design of a flexible Lyapunov function, the influences of actual and virtual queues are theoretically to be proved balanced. Moreover, the AC sub-problem can be solved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition, whereas mmWave BA sub-problem is tackled by genetic algorithm and matching game for the CU-based and DU-based FSOs, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed CU-/DU-based algorithms in terms of average data rate, admission control rate, queue length, and corresponding system delay under either uniform or dense deployment of DUs. Moreover, the proposed scheme achieves the lowest delay and highest QoE performances while sustaining the system stability compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms in open literatures.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communication is considered as an attractive way to overcome the bandwidth bottleneck and satisfy the ever-increasing capacity demand in the future. Due to the high directivity and propagation loss of THz waves, a massive MIMO system using beamforming is envisioned as a promising technology in THz communication to realize high-gain and directional transmission. However, pilots, which are the fundamentals for many beamforming schemes, are challenging to be accurately detected in the THz band owing to the severe propagation loss. In this paper, a unified 3D beam training and tracking procedure is proposed to effectively realize the beamforming in THz communications, by considering the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. In particular, a novel quadruple-uniform planar array (QUPA) architecture is analyzed to enlarge the signal coverage, increase the beam gain, and reduce the beam squint loss. Then, a new 3D grid-based (GB) beam training is developed with low complexity, including the design of the 3D codebook and training protocol. Finally, a simple yet effective grid-based hybrid (GBH) beam tracking is investigated to support THz beamforming in an efficient manner. The communication framework based on this procedure can dynamically trigger beam training/tracking depending on the real-time quality of service. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed beam training and tracking over the benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {Information freshness, which is characterized by a new performance metric called age of information (AoI), significantly influences decision making in numerous applications. In wireless sensor networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely adopted for fresh data collection. The key to applying UAV lies in UAV trajectory planning. Considering several fixed waypoints in UAV trajectory, the trajectory planning is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, and is difficult to solve in practice. To well balance between the accuracy and efficiency, we propose an end-to-end AI-based framework in this paper to deal with the UAV trajectory planning within two stages. First, the hover positions of UAV and data transmission time are decided using a clustering module. Then, the AoI-minimal flight path is obtained through a neural trajectory solver. Compared with classic heuristic algorithms, the proposed AI-based framework achieves a smaller AoI with two orders of magnitude lower computational time. Besides, the proposed AI-based framework can be easily generalized to larger-scale scenarios (e.g., up to 2,000 sensor nodes) which cannot be solved by exact algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) in a limited time. Moreover, the AI-based framework is comparable in accuracy with the commercial open-source solver Google OR-tools, but the efficiency is increased by 200%.}

	abstract = {Deep learning-based classification algorithms offer no performance guarantees when deployed on testing data not generated by the same process as the training data. Such out-of-distribution (OOD) data often cause classification errors that are hard to detect since they do not generate explicit errors in the model. In real-world applications, there is no way to ensure that the testing data and the training data are drawn from the same or sufficiently similar distributions. This problem is especially challenging in wireless communications applications. Because the radio propagation channel is highly dynamic, it is very difficult to ensure that a deep learning model is not tested on OOD data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called FOOD (Feature representation for detecting OOD data) to detect OOD data in wireless communications applications. FOOD incorporates a new model architecture to detect OOD data accurately and minimizes the instances of normal data being recognized as OOD. We evaluated the performance of FOOD extensively using transmitter classification and modulation recognition tasks, with both experimental datasets and simulation-generated datasets. As far as we know, this is the first systematic study on the impact and detection of OOD data in deep learning-based wireless communications applications.}

	abstract = {In frequency division duplexing systems, the base station (BS) acquires downlink channel state information (CSI) via channel feedback, which has not been adequately investigated in the presence of RIS. In this study, we examine the limited channel feedback scheme by proposing a novel cascaded codebook and an adaptive bit partitioning strategy. The RIS segments the channel between the BS and mobile station into two subchannels, each with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) paths. To quantize the path gains, the cascaded codebook is proposed to be synthesized by two sub-codebooks whose codeword is cascaded by LoS and NLoS components. This enables the proposed cascaded codebook to cater the different distributions of LoS and NLoS path gains by flexibly using different feedback bits to design the codeword structure. On the basis of the proposed cascaded codebook, we derive an upper bound on ergodic rate loss with maximum ratio transmission and show that the rate loss can be cut down by optimizing the feedback bit allocation during codebook generation. To minimize the upper bound, we propose a bit partitioning strategy that is adaptive to diverse environment and system parameters. Extensive simulations are presented to show the superiority and robustness of the cascaded codebook and the efficiency of the adaptive bit partitioning scheme.}

	abstract = {Coded multicasting is considered to be an effective approach to simultaneously serve multiple users in the same frequency/time/code resource, which is made possible by exploiting the information available in users’ caches. Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as an alternative transmission technique for cache-aided network. In cache-aided NOMA system, cache-enabled interference cancellation (CIC) is employed to cancel the interference using the information in the cache, and thus enhance the user transmission rate, particularly for the weak users. Despite the enhanced spectral efficiency offered by both techniques, complexity issue arises from handling large number of users. Therefore, user pairing/clustering should be employed to limit the number of users served in the same time-frequency resource. However, the key question is which delivery technique performs better under different pairing scenarios. In this paper, the performance of NOMA and coded multicasting for two-user pairing are investigated in terms of probability of sum rate comparison and outage probability. In order to exploit the benefits of NOMA and coded multicasting, we also propose a hybrid delivery scheme, which select either NOMA or coded multicasting depending on the channel conditions of the paired users in each resource block (RB). A joint mode selection, power allocation and user pairing scheme is developed to enhance the performance of the hybrid scheme. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that NOMA outperforms coded multicasting when pairing users whose channel gains are highly distinctive, while coded multicasting is preferred when the paired users have similar channel gains. In addition, the hybrid scheme is demonstrated to offer enhanced sum rate performance in comparison to NOMA and coded multicasting.}

	abstract = {Cooperative spectrum sensing has proved to be an effective method to improve the detection performance in cognitive radio systems. This work focuses on centralized cooperative schemes based on the soft fusion of the energy measurements at the cognitive radios (CRs). In these systems, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is the optimal detection rule, but the sufficient statistic depends on the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the CRs, which are unknown in most practical cases. Therefore, the detection problem becomes a composite hypothesis test. The generalized LRT is the most popular approach in those cases. Unfortunately, in mobile environments, its performance is well below the LRT because the local energies are measured under varying SNRs. In this work, we present a new algorithm that jointly estimates the instantaneous SNRs and detects the presence of primary signals. Due to its adaptive nature, the algorithm is well suited for mobile scenarios where the local SNRs are time-varying. Simulation results show that its detection performance is close to the LRT in realistic conditions.}

It fills the void of wireless resource allocation for multiple simultaneous FL services in the existing literature. Our method designs a two-level resource allocation framework comprising intra-service resource allocation and inter-service resource allocation. The intra-service resource allocation problem aims to minimize the length of FL rounds by optimizing the bandwidth allocation among the clients of each FL service. Based on this, an inter-service resource allocation problem is further considered, which distributes bandwidth resources among multiple simultaneous FL services. We consider both cooperative and selfish providers of the FL services. For cooperative FL service providers, we design a distributed bandwidth allocation algorithm to optimize the overall performance of multiple FL services, meanwhile catering it to the fairness among FL services and the privacy of clients. For selfish FL service providers, a new auction scheme is designed with the FL service providers as the bidders and the network operator as the auctioneer. The designed auction scheme strikes a balance between the overall FL performance and fairness. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform other benchmarks under various network conditions.}

It dispenses with the cell boundary of conventional multi-cell MIMO systems, while drastically reducing the power consumption by limiting the number of radio frequency (RF) chains at the access points (APs). In this paper, we aim for maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of mmWave cell-free MIMO systems by conceiving a low-complexity hybrid precoding algorithm. We formulate the WSR optimization problem subject to the transmit power constraint for each AP and the constant-modulus constraint for the phase shifters of the analog precoders. A block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed for iteratively solving the problem. In each iteration, the classic Lagrangian multiplier method and the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method are combined for obtaining near-optimal hybrid analog/digital precoding matrices. Furthermore, we extend our proposed algorithm for deriving closed-form expressions for the precoders of fully digital cell-free MIMO systems. Moreover, we present the convergency analysis and complexity analysis of our proposed method. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the algorithms proposed for both fully digital and hybrid precoding matrices.}

We show that the partitioning rule without losing the feature of being a CS coincides with the non-squashing partitions of a positive integer and leads to a symmetric separation of clusters. We analytically derive the number of partitioned CSs for given bandwidth and a minimum distance constraint and obtain the corresponding recursive methods for enumerating the values of separations. We show that partitioning can increase the spectral efficiency (SE) without changing the alphabet of the non-zero elements of the CS, i.e., standard CSs relying on Reed-Muller (RM) code. We also develop an encoder for partitioned CSs and a maximum-likelihood-based recursive decoder for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. Our results indicate that the partitioned CSs under a minimum distance constraint can perform similar to the standard CSs in terms of average block error rate (BLER) and provide a higher SE at the expense of a limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted full-duplex (FD) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system based cellular network, aiming to improve overall sum-rate throughput of the system through dynamic user clustering, optimal UAV placement and power allocation. Since each UAV operates in FD mode, self-interference (SI), co-channel interference (CCI), inter-UAV interference (IUI) and intra-node interference (INI) dominate the system’s performance. Consequently, we propose an unconventional two-stage dynamic user clustering for user nodes (UNs) to reduce the cross-interference in multi-UAV aided FD-NOMA system. Particularly, all UNs are initially clustered into\nK\nclusters using k-means clustering in the first stage where each cluster is served by an UAV. Furthermore, each cluster is further divided into sub-clusters and each sub-clusters are operated in FD-NOMA scheme. Finally, to control interferences, a sum-rate throughput maximization problem is formulated for each UAV to jointly optimize uplink and downlink power allocation and UAV placement. The joint optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly, for which we decoupled the original problem by addressing UAV placement and power allocation separately. We first fix the UAV position and then solve the problem iteratively using successive convex approximation (SCA) method. By utilizing brute-force search algorithm, an optimal UAV placement is later performed which corresponds to maximum possible sum-rate throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution for the considered FD-NOMA system outperforms the conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {In wireless networks, an essential step for precise range-based localization is the high-resolution estimation of multipath channel delays. The resolution of traditional delay estimation algorithms is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the training signals used for channel probing. Considering that typical training signals have limited bandwidth, delay estimation using these algorithms often leads to poor localization performance. To mitigate these constraints, we exploit the multiband and carrier frequency switching capabilities of wireless transceivers and propose to acquire channel state information (CSI) in multiple bands spread over a large frequency aperture. The data model of the acquired measurements has a multiple shift-invariance structure, and we use this property to develop a high-resolution delay estimation algorithm. We derive the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for the data model and perform numerical simulations of the algorithm using system parameters of the emerging IEEE 802.11be standard. Simulations show that the algorithm is asymptotically efficient and converges to the CRB. To validate modeling assumptions, we test the algorithm using channel measurements acquired in real indoor scenarios. From these results, it is seen that delays (ranges) estimated from multiband CSI with a total bandwidth of 320 MHz show an average RMSE of less than 0.3 ns (10 cm) in 90% of the cases.}

	abstract = {A very popular theory circulating among non-scientific communities claims that the massive deployment of Base Stations (BSs) over the territory, a.k.a. cellular network densification, always triggers an uncontrolled and exponential increase of human exposure to Radio Frequency “Pollution” (RFP). To face such concern in a way that can be understood by the layman, in this work we develop a very simple model to compute the RFP, based on a set of worst-case and conservative assumptions. We then provide closed-form expressions to evaluate the RFP variation in a pair of candidate 5G deployments, subject to different densification levels. Results, obtained over a wide set of representative 5G scenarios, dispel the myth: cellular network densification triggers an RFP decrease (up to three orders of magnitude) when the radiated power from the BS is adjusted to ensure a minimum sensitivity at the cell edge. Eventually, we analyze the conditions under which the RFP may increase when the network is densified (e.g., when the radiated power does not scale with the cell size), proving that the amount of RFP is always controlled. Finally, the results obtained by simulation confirm the outcomes of the RFP model.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to enhance the coverage and performance of wireless networks. We consider the application of IRS to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where a base station transmits superposed signals to multiple users by the virtue of an IRS. The performance of an IRS-assisted NOMA networks with imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC) is investigated by invoking 1-bit coding scheme. In particular, we derive new exact and asymptotic expressions for both outage probability and ergodic rate of the m\n-th user with ipSIC/pSIC. Based on analytical results, the diversity order of the m\n-th user with pSIC is in connection with the number of reflecting elements and channel ordering. The high signal-to-noise radio (SNR) slope of ergodic rate for the m\n-th user is obtained. The throughput and energy efficiency of IRS-NOMA networks are discussed both in delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. Additionally, we derive new exact expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for IRS-assisted orthogonal multiple access (IRS-OMA). Numerical results are presented to substantiate our analyses and demonstrate that: i) The outage behaviors of IRS-NOMA are superior to that of IRS-OMA and relaying schemes; ii) The M\n-th user has a larger ergodic rate than IRS-OMA and benchmarks. However, the ergodic performance of the m\n-th user exceeds relaying schemes in the low SNR regime; and iii) The IRS-assisted NOMA networks have ability to achieve the enhanced energy efficiency compared to conventional cooperative communications.}

We consider the effect of interference incurred by another established communication network, which makes our problem challenging and different from the state of the art. We aim to design the 3D trajectories and power allocation for the UAVs to maximize the data flow of the network while keeping the interference on the existing communication network below a threshold. We utilize the mobility feature of the UAVs to evade the (un)-intended interference caused by (un)-intentional interferers. To this end, we propose an alternating-maximization approach to jointly obtain the 3D trajectories and the UAVs transmission powers. We handle the 3D trajectory design by resorting to spectral graph theory and subsequently address the power allocation through convex optimization techniques. We also approach the problem from the intentional interferer’s perspective where smart jammers chase the UAVs to effectively degrade the data flow of the network. We also extend our work to the case for multiple UEs. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method through extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {We study the design of receivers in extra-large scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems, i.e. systems in which the base station is equipped with an antenna array of extremely large dimensions. While XL-MIMO can significantly increase the system’s spectral efficiency, they present two important challenges. One is the increased computational cost of multi-antenna processing. The second one is the presence of spatial non-stationarities in the channel response, which imply that the mean energy of a given user’s signal varies across the array. Such non-stationarities limit the performance of the system. In this paper, we propose a distributed receiver for such an XL-MIMO system that can address both challenges. Based on variational message passing (VMP), we propose a set of receiver options providing a range of complexity-performance characteristics to adapt to different requirements. Furthermore, we distribute the processing into local processing units (LPU), that can perform most of the complex processing in parallel, before sharing their outcome with a central processing unit (CPU). Our designs are specifically tailored to exploit the spatial non-stationarities and require lower computations than linear receivers. Our simulation study, performed with a channel model accounting for the special characteristics of XL-MIMO channels, confirms the superior performance of our proposals compared to the state of the art methods.}

	abstract = {Symbol rate is one of the most important parameters in signal demodulation process. In real-time signal processing, traditional symbol rate estimation algorithms for the Multiple Phase Shift Keying (M-PSK) and the Multiple Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) are based on the Fourier transform of signal’s complex envelope. At the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the accuracy of symbol rate estimation can be improved by increasing the number of symbols as much as possible. However, this improvement is infeasible in many applications such as the energy-limited Internet of Things devices and sporadic noncooperative transmissions. In this paper, we propose a data-driven bandpass filter (BPF) design scheme for accurate estimation of symbol rate under low SNR with only a small number of symbols available. The proposed scheme considerably improves the estimation performance by optimizing the BPF design using the equivalent dynamic linearization model with time-varying pseudo-partial derivatives. Specifically, the proposed scheme iteratively optimizes the upper and lower cut-off frequencies of the BPF based on the measured complex envelope spectrum until achieving the optimal BPF. Therefore, the peaks of the complex envelope spectrum are extracted as the estimate of the symbol rate by applying the optimal BPF. Experimental results indicate the promise of the proposed scheme as an efficient symbol rate estimator for sporadic signal at low SNR and with a small number of symbols.}

	abstract = {Supporting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in non-coherent joint transmission (NCJT) systems is beneficial for improving spectral efficiency (SE), but the interference coordination, user scheduling, and resource allocation problems in this new scenario have not been well studied. In this paper, a NOMA-enabled NCJT system is considered in which the connected users are jointly served by two multi-antenna transmitting-receiving points (TRPs) with non-ideal backhauls. Each user has two independent receiving (RX) chains that can work with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or NOMA mode. A joint resource allocation and hybrid OMA/NOMA mode selection is proposed to maximize the throughput. The primal non-convex and NP-hard problem is decomposed into the following three subproblems, i.e., power allocation (PA) of a single TRP, hybrid mode selection (HMS) of a single TRP, and cross-TRP interference optimization (CIO). Firstly, a successive convex approximation (SCA) method is proposed to solve the non-convex PA subproblem, which achieves a local maximum solution. Secondly, the combinatorial HMS subproblem is transformed into finding the maximum matching of bipartite graphs. By constructing two weighted bipartite graphs for the OMA/near UEs and far UEs, a suboptimal solution is found. Thirdly, an alternating optimization is proposed to solve the CIO subproblem by iteratively performing PA and HMS of the two TRPs. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of throughput improvement of the proposed method, and the sum rate of the NOMA-enabled NCJT system can approach the sum rate of individual TRPs without interference.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a competitive solution to address blockage issues in millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) communications due to its capability of reshaping wireless transmission environments. Nevertheless, obtaining the channel state information of IRS-assisted systems is quite challenging because of the passive characteristics of the IRS. In this paper, we develop an efficient downlink beam training/alignment method for IRS-assisted mmWave/THz systems. Specifically, by exploiting the inherent sparse structure of the base station-IRS-user cascade channel, the beam training problem is formulated as a joint sparse sensing and phaseless estimation problem, which involves devising a sparse sensing matrix and developing an efficient estimation algorithm to identify the best beam alignment from compressive phaseless measurements. Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed method can identify the best alignment with only a modest amount of training overhead. Numerical results show that, for both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS scenarios, the proposed method obtains a significant performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it can achieve performance close to that of the exhaustive beam search scheme, while reducing the training overhead by 95%.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising paradigm to improve the capacity and reliability of a wireless communication system by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. To achieve the promising gains of IRS, the acquisition of the channel state information (CSI) is essential, which however is practically difficult since the IRS does not employ any transmit/receive radio frequency (RF) chains in general and it has limited signal processing capability. In this paper, we study the uplink channel estimation problem for an IRS-aided multiuser single-input multi-output (SIMO) system. The existing channel estimation approach for IRS-aided multiuser systems mainly consists of three phases, where the direct channels from the base station (BS) to all the users, the reflected channel from the BS to a typical user via the IRS, and the other reflected channels are estimated sequentially based on the estimation results of the previous phases. However, this approach will lead to a serious error propagation issue, i.e., the channel estimation errors in the first and second phases will deteriorate the estimation performance in the second and third phases. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a novel two-phase channel estimation (2PCE) strategy which is able to alleviate the negative effects caused by error propagation and enhance the channel estimation performance with the same amount of channel training overhead as in the existing approach. Specifically, in the first phase, the direct and reflected channels associated with a typical user are estimated simultaneously by varying the reflection patterns at the IRS, such that the estimation errors of the direct channel associated with this typical user will not affect the estimation of the corresponding reflected channel. In the second phase, we estimate the CSI associated with the other users and demonstrate that by properly designing the pilot symbols of the users and the reflection patterns at the IRS, the direct and reflected channels associated with each user can also be estimated simultaneously, which helps to reduce the error propagation. Moreover, the asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed 2PCE strategy is analyzed when the least-square (LS) channel estimation method is employed, and we show that the 2PCE strategy can outperform the existing approach. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation strategy.}

In this paper, we study a joint beam activation and user scheduling problem in a 5G cellular network with massive MIMO and CoMP utilizing orthogonal random beamforming technique. This paper aims to minimize total Remote Radio Heads’ (RRHs’) energy expenditure in a dynamic C-RAN architecture while ensuring finite service time for all user traffic arrivals in the communication coverage. We leverage Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to transform an original long-term average problem into a series of per-slot modified problems. Since the provided per-slot problem is combinatorial and nonlinear optimization problem, we are inspired by a greedy algorithm to design energy and delay guaranteed joint beam activation and user scheduling policy, namely BEANS . We prove that the proposed BEANS ensures finite upper bounds of average RRH energy consumption and average queue backlogs for all traffic arrival rates within constant ratio of capacity region and all energy-delay tradeoff parameters. These proofs are the first attempt to theoretically demonstrate guarantees of energy and queue bounds in a framework consisting of possibly negative submodular objective function and non-matriod constraints . Finally, via extensive simulations, we compare the capacity region and energy-queue backlog tradeoff of BEANS with optimal and existing algorithms, and show that BEANS attains up to 65% of energy saving for the same average queue backlog compared to the algorithms which do not take traffic dynamics and energy consumption into considerations.}

The reconfigurable antenna includes several elements, each controlled individually using a radio frequency (RF) switch. The antenna has only one RF chain, resulting in simple hardware design and enabling low-complexity algorithms. We exploit space-time diversity to find two separate combinations of activating or deactivating antenna elements to allow for interference neutralization/elimination. Finding such states is a cumbersome task for which we develop novel, efficient algorithms. We further devise simple encoding and decoding with short precoder length to exploit the benefits of our designs. Our implementation does not rely on channel state information at the transmitters; works at finite signal-to-noise ratios, unlike the typical degrees-of-freedom results; and works in slow-fading environments. We calculate the average achievable rates, the minimum number of elements to reach a specific level of interference suppression, and we provide outage analysis of our technique.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) high frequency (HF) skywave communications. We first introduce a model for HF skywave massive MIMO channels within the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmission framework by using the matrix of sampled steering vectors. Considering the large antenna array aperture and increased signal bandwidth, the effect of the propagation delay across the large-scale antenna array cannot be ignored, and thus the steering vectors vary across different subcarriers. Specifically, we derive a wideband beam based channel model and show that the beam domain statistical channel state information (CSI) is frequency-independent. Then, we consider minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) based uplink receiver and downlink precoder with perfect CSI at the base station (BS). With a large number of antennas at the BS, the sum-rate can be asymptotically increased proportionally to the number of user terminals (UTs) while the transmit power per UT is scaled down inverse-proportionally to the number of antennas. In order to reduce the design complexities of the MMSE receiver and precoder, we derive a polynomial expansion based design using a deterministic equivalent. Simulation results demonstrate very significant performance advantages of the proposed HF skywave massive MIMO system.}

	abstract = {Stringent constraints on both reliability and latency must be guaranteed in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To fulfill these constraints with computationally constrained receivers, such as low-budget IoT receivers, optimal transmission parameters need to be studied in detail. In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective optimization framework for the optimal design of URLLC in the presence of decoding complexity constraints. We consider transmission of short-blocklength codewords that are encoded with linear block encoders, transmitted over a binary-input AWGN channel, and finally decoded with order-statistics (OS) decoder. We investigate the optimal selection of a transmission rate and power pair, while satisfying the constraints. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated. Based on the empirical model that accurately quantifies the trade-off between the performance of an OS decoder and its computational complexity, the MOOP is solved and the Pareto boundary is derived. In order to assess the overall performance among several Pareto-optimal transmission pairs, two scalarization methods are investigated. To exemplify the importance of the MOOP, a case study on a battery-powered communication system is provided. It is shown that, compared to the classical fixed rate-power transmissions, the MOOP provides the optimum usage of the battery and increases the energy efficiency of the communication system while maintaining the constraints.}

	abstract = {Multiple-access edge computation offloading (MECO) systems have been highlighted as a solution for extending the battery life and computation capability of mobile devices. However, in scenarios where information data and computation offloading (CO) data coexist, CO users and information users affect each other. It means that the communication resources for information data transmission are inevitably reduced by the communication resources allocated for CO in the conventional half-duplex (HD) based systems. Hence, improving the spectral efficiency of MECO systems in coexistence scenarios is essential, and we investigate a full-duplex (FD)-aided MECO (FD-MECO) system. A step-wise resource configuration is proposed to improve the performance of computation offloading under the information data rate constraint. The main idea is to improve spectral efficiency by maximizing the opportunity of operating in FD mode. By comparing all the communication phases in FD-MECO systems, the proposed resource configuration maximizes the amount of delivered CO data while guaranteeing the required information data rate. The simulation results show that FD-MECO systems with the proposed resource configuration always outperform HD-MECO systems.}

	abstract = {We investigate the age-of-information (AoI) in the context of random access networks, in which transmitters need to send a sequence of information packets to the intended receivers over a shared spectrum. Due to interference, the dynamics at the link pairs will interact with each other over both space and time, and the effects of these spatiotemporal interactions on the AoI are not well understood. In this paper, we straddle queueing theory and stochastic geometry to establish an analytical framework, that accounts for the interplay between the temporal traffic attributes and spatial network topology, for such a study. Specifically, we derive accurate and tractable expressions to quantify the network average AoI as well as the outage probability of peak AoI. Besides, we develop a decentralized channel access policy that exploits the local observation at each node to make transmission decisions that minimize the AoI. Our analysis reveals that when the packet transmissions are scheduled in a last-come first-serve (LCFS) order, whereas the newly incoming packets can replace the undelivered ones, depending on the deployment density, there may or may not exist a tradeoff on the packet arrival rate that minimizes the network average AoI. Moreover, the slotted ALOHA protocol is shown to be instrumental in reducing the AoI when the packet arrival rates are high, yet it cannot contribute to decreasing the AoI in the regime of infrequent packet arrivals. The numerical results also confirm the efficacy of the proposed scheme, where the gain is particularly pronounced when the network grows in size because our method is able to adapt the channel access probabilities with the change of ambient environment.}

	abstract = {In recent years, developments in data collection schemes based on multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are facilitating the realization of the so-called underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). As yet, the lack of suitable collaboration mechanisms among multiple AUVs, which are based on functional or resource distributions, prevents effective information sharing and yields increased data collection delays, thus reducing the capacity of the networks. In this article, to address these shortcomings, we propose a state prediction-based data collection (SPDC) algorithm for UASNs. The principle of operation is as follows. First, some cluster pairs named observation clusters obtain and exchange the state information about AUVs between the adjacent subregions. Based on the shared information, the AUVs predict each other’s status and adjust their data collection areas. Then, the AUVs use a heuristic strategy to complete the path planning based on the updated access area. Finally, a scheduling data forwarding mechanism reduces the diving number of the AUVs, by reasonably allocating the overlapped data unloading intervals between the AUVs and a mobile sink. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm shows satisfactory performance in reducing data collection delays and in improving the total network lifetime.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of full-duplex covert millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, where a mmWave transmitter (Alice) sends information signals to its intended receiver (Bob) covertly in the presence of a watchful warden (Willie). For covering the presence of Alice, Bob operates in the full-duplex mode and generates jamming signals with a time-varying power. We investigate the covert rate optimization for both the single data stream case and the multiple data streams case under the constraints of the detection error probability at Willie. Specifically, for the single data stream case, we analytically characterize the minimum detection error probability at Willie and establish a framework for optimizing the analog beamforming, transmit power, and analog jamming jointly. As for the case of multiple data streams, we derive a tractable lower bound of the minimum detection error probability at Willie and formulate a joint optimization of the hybrid precoder and analog jamming design problem for the maximization of the achievable covert rate. Although the joint design problem is nonconvex, we adopt the penalty decomposition technique to handle the effect of the coupling between the analog precoder and digital precoder paving the way for the development of an iterative algorithm to locate its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Finally, we show that our proposed joint design algorithm can be adapted to handle the multi-antenna Willie scenario and simulation results show that our proposed joint design algorithms can achieve significantly better performance as compared with some benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Large-scale antenna array techniques are key enablers for modern wireless communication systems. Channel state information (CSI) is indispensable for large-scale multi-antenna systems, but is challenging to obtain. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a unified precoding and pilot design framework, that allows minimal and precoding-sensitive modified CSI (mCSI) to be collected. This results in a significant reduction in the CSI overheads and complexity compared to classical physical CSI (pCSI) estimation. Based on this unified framework, we further propose an intelligent pilot (IP) approach that senses and selects the mCSI to be collected. The IP approach utilizes a compressive sensing formulation to attach sensing and selection of significant mCSI to precoding optimization. We apply the above techniques to the multi-user frequency division duplexing (FDD) downlink as an example. Our study shows that the advantages of the IP approach are three-fold. First, in contrast to the pCSI, precoding-sensitive information is only captured, which reduces the training and feedback overheads. Second, the precoders are optimized directly based on the mCSI, which avoids recovering the pCSI of high-dimension. Third, since the mCSI of reduced dimension is utilized, the scale of the problem to optimize the precoder is also reduced and thus it is much easier to solve.}

	abstract = {Wireless powered communication via backscatter and/or harvest-then-transmit (HTT) has been considered a promising solution to connecting nodes in the Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. However, the harvested energy at an IoT node is heavily limited by the distance between the node and the power beacon (PB) due to the high propagation loss. In this paper, we propose to employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile PB to provide energy signals on demand to the IoT nodes, which convey their information to a reader via backscattering or active transmission using the harvested energy. We maximize the total energy efficiency (EE) of all the IoT nodes powered by the UAV by jointly optimizing the UAV’s transmit power and trajectory, the IoT nodes’ backscatter reflection coefficients and their transmit power for active transmission, and the time allocation between backscattering and active transmission. To solve the formulated non-linear fractional programming problem, we use the generalized fractional programming theory and a block coordinated decent method to decompose it into two sub-problems: one optimizes the communication resource allocation under a fixed UAV trajectory, and the other optimizes the UAV trajectory for given communication resource allocation. We then devise a Dinkelbach-based iterative algorithm to solve the two sub-problems by employing a Lagrangian dual method and a successive convex programming technique, respectively and iteratively. Simulation results show that our proposed iterative algorithm converges very fast, and the optimized UAV-enabled hybrid backscatter-HTT communication achieves a much higher EE of all the IoT nodes than the benchmark schemes including the UAV-enabled backscatter, UAV-enabled HTT, and hybrid BackCom-HTT with a fixed PB.}

In HetNet environments, before data transmission starts, there is a user association (UA) process with a specific base station (BS). Additionally, during data transmission, diverse resource allocation (RA) schemes are employed. UA-RA solutions play a critical role in improving network load balancing, spectral performance, and energy efficiency. Although several studies have examined the joint UA-RA problem, there is no optimal strategy to address it with low complexity while also reducing the time overhead. We propose two different versions of simulated annealing (SA): Reduced Search Space SA (\nR\nS\n3\nA\n) and Performance-Improved Reduced Search Space SA (\nPIR\nS\n3\nA\n), algorithms for solving UA-RA problem in HetNets. First, the UA-RA problem is formulated as a multiple knapsack problem (MKP) with constraints on the maximum BS capacity and transport block size (TBS) index. Second, the proposed\nR\nS\n3\nA\nand\nPIR\nS\n3\nA\nare used to solve the formulated MKP.

In this paper, we investigate the cooperative multilayer edge caching in the integrated satellite-terrestrial network to reduce the communication delay, in which the base station cache, the satellite cache, and the gateway cache cooperatively provide content service for ground users. We first propose the three-layer cooperative caching model of the network, based on which we analyze the content retrieving process and derive the cache hit probability for different caching locations. Considering limited cache sizes, we formulate the content placement problem to minimize the average content retrieving delay of users. Then, two caching strategies, the non-cooperative caching strategy and the cooperative caching strategy, are proposed with exhaustive theoretical analysis. By introducing the concept of delay reduction gains, the optimal caching strategies are obtained based on the proposed iterative algorithms. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed cooperative caching architecture and the caching strategies.}

	abstract = {In this study, we propose index modulation (IM) with circularly-shifted chirps (CSCs) (CSC-IM) for dual-function radar and communication (DFRC) systems. The proposed scheme encodes the information bits with the CSC indices and the phase-shift keying (PSK) symbols. It allows the receiver to exploit the frequency selectivity naturally in fading channels by combining IM and wideband CSCs. It also leverages the fact that a CSC is a constant-envelope signal to achieve a controllable peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR). For radar functionality, CSC-IM maintains the good autocorrelation (AC) properties of a chirp by ensuring that the transmitted CSCs are separated apart sufficiently in the time domain through index separation (IS). We investigate the impact of IS on spectral efficiency (SE) and obtain the corresponding mapping functions. For theoretical results, we derive the union bound (UB) of the block error rate (BLER) for arbitrary chirps and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the range and reflection coefficients for the matched filter (MF)-based estimation. We also prove that complementary sequences (CSs) can be constructed through CSCs by linearly combining the Fourier series of CSCs. Finally, through comprehensive comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme for DFRC scenarios.}

In this work, we design an ad hoc tracking system that exploits the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) standard for communication and an extended version of the Constant Turn Rate and Acceleration (CTRA) motion model to predict drone movements in a 3D environment. We analyze the trade-off in setting the main parameters of the communication system and Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme, showing how our tracking system can handle large swarms of drones at distances up to 4 km. Simulation results on a publicly available dataset show that our system can reliably estimate the position and trajectory of a swarm of UAVs, significantly outperforming baseline tracking approaches.}

	abstract = {Existing wireless communication systems have been mainly designed to provide substantial gain in terms of data rates. However, 5G and Beyond will depart from this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher data rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Supporting massive uplink communications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size, as it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the control signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. In addition, channel estimation becomes challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission due to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new uplink multiple access (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of uncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed uplink MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as well as pilots and preambles related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for device identification (DI) is employed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated to each IoT device as identifier. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading purpose and DI. Two IoT DI algorithms which employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the active IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the Bayesian information criterion model order selection method is employed to develop an IoT DI algorithm for unknown and time-varying activity rate. Our proposed MA scheme benefits from a new non-coherent nonlinear multiuser detection algorithm designed on the basis of unsupervised machine learning techniques to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel state information. For performance improvement, an extension to multiple receive antennas through hard decision combining is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed MA scheme for known and unknown activity rate and high overloading factor is supported by simulation results.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new transmission policy for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) empowered wireless powered internet of things systems. Particularly, an energy station (ES) wirelessly charges for multiple IoT devices during downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) and then these devices deliver their own message to an access point (AP) during uplink wireless information transfer (WIT). Also, an IRS is deployed to improve energy harvesting and data transmission capabilities. To enhance self-sustainability of the IRS, the IRS harvests energy from the ES based on the harvest-then-transmit protocol. In this paper, we maximize the sum throughput via optimizing the phase shifts of the IRS, the transfer time scheduling as well as the power splitting ratio. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we divide the problem into two sub-problems, each of which can be handled separately. Then, we adopt an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Also, we consider a special case where the circuit power consumption of IoT devices can be neglected. In this case, we derive a closed form solution for the optimal transmission time slots, power allocation and phase shift by the Lagrange dual method. Finally, numerical evaluations validate effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which significantly benefits from the IRS in improving network throughput.}

	abstract = {To support massive connectivity for sporadically active devices is a challenging task, as the randomness of the channel and the large number of users lead to enormous increase of communication overhead. Different to the existing methods that differentiate users in resources including time, frequency and code, we propose a new joint activity detection and channel estimation framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where angular domain information of active users is exploited to enhance activity detection and channel estimation. By exploiting the sporadic activity of users and the angular spread of the wireless signals, the activity detection and channel estimation is formulated as a compressive sensing problem with multiple measurement vectors, which has a simultaneously row-sparse and clustered sparse structure. The sizes and positions of the nonzero clusters are arbitrary, which brings new challenges for algorithm derivation. To this end, we develop new algorithms based on sparse Bayesian learning, where novel hyper-priors are proposed to capture the structural signal characteristics, and appropriate approximations are employed to facilitate algorithm derivations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved activity detection and channel estimation performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the existing methods.}

The IRS designs under both the ideal IRS with continuous phase shifting and the non-ideal IRS with discrete phase shifting are considered. For both cases, by leveraging the isotropic random vector and the Laguerre series, we derive insightful results and closed-form expressions on performance measures including the average required transmit power, the outage probability, and the diversity order. Our analytical results show that the transmit power scales down linearly with the BS antenna number and quadratically with the IRS element number. The diversity order equals the smaller of the BS antenna number and the IRS element number with a scaling coefficient. Our results also reveal the effect of the phase quantization resolution to the system performance when non-ideal IRS is used. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of our analysis and the non-ideal IRS with four or more bits for quantization is shown to achieve nearly the same performance as the ideal IRS.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communications systems are expected to become a major enabling technology at the air interface in sixth-generation (6G) cellular systems. However, utilizing extremely narrow antenna radiation patterns at both base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) sides, these systems are affected by not only dynamic blockage but micromobility of UEs. To alleviate the impact of both factors one may utilize the multiconnectivity mechanism allowing for UE to remain connected to several BSs simultaneously and switch between them in case the active connection is lost. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to characterize the outage probability and spectral efficiency associated with different degrees of multiconnectivity in dynamic blockage and micromobility environment for different beamsearching design options. Our results demonstrate that the presence of UE micromobility may have a positive impact on system performance. Particularly, multiconnectivity allows improving outage and spectral efficiency for small and medium blockers density (up to 0.5 bl./m 2 ) up to that of an ideal system with zero beamsearching times. Furthermore, higher gains are observed for higher degrees of multiconnectivity (e.g., greater than two) as compared to the system with only blockage impairments. For higher blockers densities, however, the reverse effect is observed.}

The PN estimation, however, suffers from high computational complexity due to its fundamental characteristics, such as spectral spreading and fast-varying fluctuations. In this paper, we propose a new framework for low-complexity PN compensation in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. The proposed framework also includes a pilot allocation strategy to minimize its overhead. The key ideas are to exploit the coherence bandwidth of mmWave systems and to approximate the actual PN spectrum with its dominant components, resulting in a non-iterative solution by using linear minimum mean squared-error estimation. The proposed method obtains a reduction of more than\n2.5×\nin total complexity, as compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for normalized mean squared-errors (NMSEs) as a function of critical system parameters, which help in understanding the NMSE behavior in low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Lastly, we study a trade-off between performance and pilot-overhead to provide insight into an appropriate approximation of the PN spectrum.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of machine-type communications (MTC), the future communication architecture needs to provide services for both human-type communications (HTC) and MTC with unique characteristics. The huge connections from MTC bring serious challenges to the existing wireless network. Ultra-dense network (UDN), a promising candidate technology, can support massive device access through dense deployment of small base stations (SBSs). Different from the resource management in traditional wireless network with single base station (BS), the resource allocation problem at BS level is more prominent in UDN, and the diversity of devices will make this problem more complicated. In view of this, we investigate the joint optimization of massive access and resource management in the UDN where HTC and MTC coexist. Considering the computational complexity and scalability, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based SBS state selection scheme, in which each SBS acts as an agent and selects the optimal state between active and idle by continuously interacting with the environment. In addition, we adopt the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access to further improve system throughput, and use grant-based and grant-free access manners for HTC and MTC respectively, so as to meet their unique characteristics. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superior performances of proposed scheme in multiple perspectives.}

In the absence of secrecy constraints, the largest such parameter regime for\nK\nuser interference networks is the CTIN regime (so named for the C onvexity of the GDoF region achieved by Treating Interference as Noise (TIN)) originally discovered by Yi and Caire, whose optimality was established by Chan et al. For the corresponding broadcast networks the largest regime is the SLS (Simple Layered Superposition) regime discovered by Davoodi and Jafar, but only for small networks with\nK≤3\nusers. By including secrecy constraints, we identify much larger regimes, the STIN regime and the SLS regime, where GDoF are fully characterized for arbitrary number of users under finite precision CSIT, for interference networks and broadcast networks, respectively. The optimal achievable scheme in both cases is based on TIN along with power control and jamming. Proofs of optimality rely on a combination of secrecy constraints and Aligned Images sum-set inequalities.}

	abstract = {The novel concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is investigated, where the incident wireless signal is divided into transmitted and reflected signals passing into both sides of the space surrounding the surface, thus facilitating a full-space manipulation of signal propagation. Based on the introduced basic signal model of ‘STAR’, three practical operating protocols for STAR-RISs are proposed, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). Moreover, a STAR-RIS aided downlink communication system is considered for both unicast and multicast transmission, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends information to two users, i.e., one on each side of the STAR-RIS. A power consumption minimization problem for the joint optimization of the active beamforming at the BS and the passive transmission and reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS is formulated for each of the proposed operating protocols, subject to communication rate constraints of the users. For ES, the resulting highly-coupled non-convex optimization problem is solved by an iterative algorithm, which exploits the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Then, the proposed penalty-based iterative algorithm is extended to solve the mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for MS. For TS, the optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which can be consecutively solved using state-of-the-art algorithms and convex optimization techniques. Finally, our numerical results reveal that: 1) the TS and ES operating protocols are generally preferable for unicast and multicast transmission, respectively; and 2) the required power consumption for both scenarios is significantly reduced by employing the proposed STAR-RIS instead of conventional reflecting/transmitting-only RISs.}

In such networks, each user is served by a subset of nearby transmitters that we call distributed units or DUs. The operation of the DUs in a region is controlled by a central unit (CU). Our first scheme is implemented at the DUs, while the second is implemented at the CUs controlling these DUs. We define a hybrid quality of service metric that enables distributed optimization of system resources in a proportional fair manner. Specifically, each of our algorithms performs user scheduling, beamforming, and power control while accounting for channel estimation errors. Importantly, our algorithm does not require information exchange amongst DUs (CUs) for the DU-distributed (CU-distributed) system, while also smoothly converging. Our results show that our CU-distributed system provides 1.3- to 1.8-fold network throughput compared to the DU-distributed system, with minor increases in complexity and front-haul load - and substantial gains over benchmark schemes like local zero-forcing. We also analyze the trade-offs provided by the CU-distributed system, hence highlighting the significance of deploying multiple CUs in user-centric cell-free networks.}

	abstract = {Recently, with the advances in self-interference cancellation, full-duplex (FD) techniques have become a feasible approach to improve the spectrum usage in new generation wireless systems. In particular, in cognitive radio networks, FD allows a secondary user to simultaneously sense the spectrum and transmit, improving the network efficiency. However, the residual self interference (RSI) arising from an imperfect cancellation, represents a bottleneck for the spectrum sensing performance. This paper analytically demonstrates that RSI represents a colored noise which leads to the SNR Wall phenomenon making the typical OFDM signal detectors no longer robust. To overcome this drawback, we propose a generalized likelihood ratio test detector exploiting the multipath correlation due to the primary user’s (PU) channel. It is proven that the proposed method is not affected by the SNR Wall, hence it is robust w.r.t an imperfect self-interference cancellation. Specifically, best detection performance is achieved when an approximated knowledge of the maximum delay spread of the PU channel is available, otherwise it is shown that a limited performance degradation occurs. Moreover, provided results highlight that our approach outperforms the classical alternatives in different scenarios, including when PU employs a mixed numerology OFDM signal, which characterizes the 5G New Radio waveform.}

To investigate the impacts of UAV jitter on mmWave communications, we firstly model UAV mmWave channel based on the geometric relationship between element antennas of the uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Then, we extract the relationship between (I) UAV attitude angles & position coordinates and (II) angle of arrival (AoA) & angle of departure (AoD) of mmWave channel, and we also derive the distribution of AoA/AoD at UAV side from the random fluctuations of UAV attitude angles, i.e., UAV jitter. In beam training design, with the relationship between attitude angles and AoA/AoD, we propose to generate a rough estimate of AoA and AoD from UAV navigation information. Finally, with the rough AoA/AoD estimate, we develop a compressed sensing (CS) based beam training scheme with constrained sensing range as the fine AoA/AoD estimation. Particularly, we construct a partially random sensing matrix to narrow down the sensing range of CS-based beam training. Numerical results show that our proposed UAV beam training scheme assisted by navigation information can achieve better accuracy with reduced training length in AoA/AoD estimation and is thus more suitable for UAV mmWave communications under jittering effects.}

	abstract = {Wireless powered backscatter communications (WPBC) is capable of implementing ultra-low-power communication, thus promising in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In practice, however, it is challenging to apply WPBC in large-scale IoT networks because of its short communication range. To address this challenge, this paper exploits an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assist WPBC in large-scale IoT networks. In particular, we investigate the joint design of network planning and dynamic resource allocation of the access point (AP), tag reader, and UGV to minimize the total energy consumption. Also, the AP can operate in either half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD) multiplexing mode. Under HD mode, the optimal cell radius is derived and the optimal power allocation and transmit/receive beamforming are obtained in closed form. Under FD mode, the optimal resource allocation, as well as two suboptimal ones with low computational complexity, is developed. Simulation results disclose that dynamic power allocation at the tag reader rather than at the AP dominates the network energy efficiency while the AP operating in FD mode outperforms that in HD mode concerning energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {We study a decentralized channel allocation problem in an ad-hoc Internet of Things network underlaying on the spectrum licensed to a primary cellular network. In the considered network, the impoverished channel sensing/probing capability and computational resource on the IoT devices make them difficult to acquire the detailed Channel State Information (CSI) for the shared multiple channels. In practice, the unknown patterns of the primary users’ transmission activities and the time-varying CSI (e.g., due to small-scale fading or device mobility) also cause stochastic changes in the channel quality. Decentralized IoT links are thus expected to learn channel conditions online based on partial observations, while acquiring no information about the channels that they are not operating on. They also have to reach an efficient, collision-free solution of channel allocation with limited coordination. Our study maps this problem into a contextual multi-player, multi-armed bandit game, and proposes a purely decentralized, three-stage policy learning algorithm through trial-and-error. Theoretical analyses shows that the proposed scheme guarantees the IoT links to jointly converge to the socially optimal channel allocation with a sub-linear (i.e., polylogarithmic) regret with respect to the operational time. Simulations demonstrate that it strikes a good balance between efficiency and network scalability when compared with the other state-of-the-art decentralized bandit algorithms.}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) has attracted a significant amount of research interest due to its ability to support high data-rates. However, the issue of inter-cell interference (ICI) caused by resource sharing and the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage problem are significant challenges that need to be considered in the design and analysis of VLC systems. This paper investigates the resource allocation problem for the downlink of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access-based multi-cell VLC system, while considering ICI and LoS blockage. This is carried out under various system configurations employing different transmission modes. Specifically, the joint problem of subchannel allocation (SA) and power allocation (PA) to maximize the sum-rate is formulated as a combinatorial and highly non-convex optimization problem due to the binary and continuous optimization variables. To obtain an efficient solution, the original problem is first separated into the SA problem and the PA problem. Two simple, yet efficient, procedures based on the quality of the channel conditions and matching theory are proposed for the SA problem, respectively. Then, the quadratic transform approach is exploited to develop an algorithm for the PA problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in terms of their fast convergence and overall performance.}

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the fifth generation (5G) standardization process, positioning has been considered as a key element in future cellular networks. In order to perform accurate positioning, solutions for estimating and processing location-related measurements such as direction of arrival (DoA) and time of arrival (ToA) for various use-cases need to be developed. In this paper, building on the existing 5G new radio (NR) specifications and millimeter wave frequencies, we propose a novel estimation and tracking solution of the DoA and ToA such that only analog/radio frequency (RF) beamforming-based observations are utilized. In addition to the proposed extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based estimation and tracking approach, we derive Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the considered RF multi-beam system, and propose an information-based criterion for selecting the necessary beams for the estimation process in order to provide highly accurate performance with feasible computational complexity. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using extensive ray-tracing simulations and numerical evaluations, and the results are compared with other estimation and beam-selection approaches. Based on the obtained results, beam-selection at the receiver can have a significant impact on the DoA and ToA estimation performance as well as on the subsequent positioning accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the highly accurate performance of the methods when extended to joint multi-receiver-based device positioning and clock synchronization.}

	abstract = {The emerging mobile edge computing (MEC) technology has been recently applied to improve adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming service quality under time-varying wireless channels. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous multi-user MEC-enabled video streaming network with time-varying wireless channels in sequential time frames. In particular, we aim to design an online joint transcoding and transmission resource allocation algorithm to maximize the ABR streaming user’s quality of experience (QoE) subject to the bandwidth and CPU constraints. The algorithm is “online” in the sense that the bitrate and resource allocation decisions made at each frame depend only on the observation of past events. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) that jointly determines bitrate adaptation, bandwidth allocation, and CPU cycle assignment. To cope with the challenge arising from the coupling decisions of adjacent frames, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm, named OCCA. Specifically, by introducing queueing model constraints, we transform the offline non-conex MINLP problem into a multi-frame problem. Then, we analytically decouple the multi-stage(frame) problem to multiple per-frame convex subproblems that can be solved with high robustness and low computational complexity. We perform simulations with realistic scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results manifest that compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed algorithm can provide 97.84% (on average) extra QoE.}

	abstract = {Optical wireless communication (OWC) meets the demands of the future six-generation mobile network (6G) as it operates at several hundreds of Terahertz and has the potential to enable data rate in the order of Tbps. However, most beam-steering OWC technologies require high-accuracy positioning and high-speed control. Resonant beam communication (RBCom), as one kind of non-positioning OWC technologies, has been proposed for high-rate mobile communications. The mobility of RBCom relies on its self-alignment characteristic where no positioning is required. In a previous study, an external-cavity second-harmonic-generation (SHG) RBCom system has been proposed for eliminating the echo interference inside the resonator. However, its energy conversion efficiency and complexity are of concern. In this paper, we propose an intra-cavity SHG RBCom system to simplify the system design and improve the energy conversion efficiency. We elaborate the system structure and establish an analytical model. Numerical results show that the energy consumption of the proposed intra-cavity design is reduced to reach the same level of channel capacity at the receiver compared with the external-cavity one.}

	abstract = {Single carrier modulation (SCM) schemes are attractive for uplink (UL) transmissions due to improved power efficiency at the user equipment (UE) transmitter compared with multi-carrier modulation schemes. In a massive MIMO scenario with SCM, the UL detection must mitigate the effects of inter-symbol interference and multi-user interference. This processing is effectively performed in the frequency domain (FD) using a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detector when the transmission is framed with a cyclic prefix. This paper analyzes an MMSE-based detector compatible with distributed processing in a time-division duplex (TDD) system. The matrix inverses computed for the UL detection are then reused to perform multi-user precoding for the downlink (DL). We find that this scheme yields tremendous savings in computational complexity compared to commonly used zero-forcing (ZF) precoding without sacrificing any performance. Since MMSE processing introduces a bias to the estimates, we derive the scalar coefficients necessary to cancel the MMSE bias. The impact of channel estimation errors is analyzed for both the UL and DL cases in conjunction with a power-efficient approach to SCM channel estimation. Moreover, extensive simulations are performed to confirm our theoretical findings.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with a focus on multicast transmissions in a game-theoretic way, where a transmitter first harvests energy from a power station (PS) and then transmits the information to multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a multicast form. An IRS is deployed to assist the wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT) processes. Considering that the PS and the transmitter belong to different service providers, we propose two schemes based on Stackelberg game, namely IRS-aided transmitter dominant energy trading (IRS-TDET) with the transmitter as the leader and IRS-aided PS dominant energy trading (IRS-PDET) with the PS as the leader. To solve the non-convex optimization problem of the leader-level game in the IRS-TDET scheme, we first derive the closed-form optimal phase shifts in the WET stage, and then use the semidefinite relaxation approach to solve the max-min problem about the phase shifts of the WIT stage. Finally, a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve the simplified non-convex optimization problem with regard to the energy price and WET time. Numerical results show that the performance of proposed IRS-TDET and IRS-PDET is superior to that of the corresponding non-IRS aided schemes, and the deployment of IRS can effectively improve the utilities of both the PS and the transmitter. In addition, it is preferred to deploy the IRS near the transmitter in WPCN, and the transmitter can be deployed near the PS or the IoT devices to obtain higher utility.}

	abstract = {Multi-antenna coded caching is known to combine a global caching gain that is proportional to the cumulative cache size found across the network, with an additional spatial multiplexing gain that stems from using multiple transmitting antennas. However, a closer look reveals two severe bottlenecks; the well-known exponential subpacketization bottleneck that dramatically reduces performance when the communicated file sizes are finite, and the considerable optimization complexity of beamforming multicast messages when the SNR is finite. We here present an entirely novel caching scheme, termed cyclic multi-antenna coded caching, whose unique structure allows for the resolution of the above bottlenecks in the crucial regime of many transmit antennas. For this regime, where the multiplexing gain can exceed the coding gain, our new algorithm is the first to achieve the exact one-shot linear optimal DoF with a subpacketization complexity that scales only linearly with the number of users, and the first to benefit from a multicasting structure that allows for exploiting uplink-downlink duality in order to yield optimized beamformers ultra-fast. In the end, our novel solution provides excellent performance for networks with finite SNR, finite file sizes, and many users.}

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) is being widely embraced with the number of connected devices growing rapidly. Moreover, IoT applications are emerging in diverse verticals such as connected cars, connected factories, and smart agriculture. For new business models, in order to meet key network performance indicators, connectivity must be flexible and agile. An integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial network (I-SAT) has recently stimulated interest in providing wireless communication due to its high maneuverability, versatile deployment, and pervasive connectivity. The resource planning, task distribution, and action management of an I-SAT can be accomplished through effective acquisition, coordination, transmission, and aggregation of diverse information. This paper considers an I-SAT network, in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with aerial stations and a terrestrial base station (BS), in a cognitive setting, in the presence of satellite-receiver communication, are deployed to support smart vehicles on the ground. By taking into account different limitations and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, the goal is to maximize the average throughput among users by jointly optimizing user association, BS/UAV transmission power, and UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem with a complicated expression that is hard to solve. To tackle this problem, an alternating iterative algorithm based on the block descent method is proposed. Precisely, the problem is subdivided into three subproblems, transmitter-vehicle association optimization, BS/UAV power allocation optimization, and UAV trajectory control. Then, in an iterative process, these subproblems are solved sequentially. The proposed solution uses a segment-by-segment technique, which breaks the complete UAV flight trajectory into smaller time segments to reduce computation time when the network service period is considerable. As a result, each time segment’s optimization can be solved more quickly. Furthermore, the paper presents the results of network simulations carried out to assess the efficiency of the proposed solution. The findings show that the presented scheme outperforms different benchmark schemes in terms of the average user throughput when observing multiple different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Energy consumption accounts for a significant portion of OPEX in 5G networks, which will be further increased when millimeter-wave (mmWave) base stations are deployed. To reduce the cost, renewable energy has been introduced to provide complementary power supply. Nevertheless, how to cost-efficiently utilize radio resources and renewable energy remains a challenge. In this paper, we jointly investigate the beamwidth management and resource allocation in mmWave backhaul HetNets with hybrid energy supply aiming to maximize long-term cost efficiency. This requires solving a mixed stochastic combinatorial optimization problem, characterizing the causal property of renewable energy harvesting process, stochastic channel conditions, and imperfect antenna alignment. Considering the complexity and dynamic environment, a learning system is established instead of using traditional optimization methods which typically experience exponential worst-case complexity and require complete information. Specifically, we propose a Learning-based Cost-efficient Resource Allocation (LCRA) algorithm that employs deep neural network to learn policies from experiences to ensure system performance while achieving cost-efficiency. To enhance the sampling efficiency and stability of the conventional deep reinforcement learning methods for our problem, an improved proximal policy optimization method is proposed to reuse the history samples. Specifically, a modified clip function is designed to deal with the hard restrictions between current and old policies. Furthermore, random network distillation is introduced to enhance the exploration capability. Numerical results reveal the convergence performance of the LCRA and the superiority in improving the cost efficiency in a hybrid energy powered mmWave backhaul HetNet compared with state-of-the-arts}

	abstract = {Due to the proliferation of mobile devices, provisioning of massive connectivity has become a major challenge for future networks. The combination of millimeter wave (mmWave) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) provides a promising solution to massive connectivity. However, the security issue therein cannot be ignored due to the openness of wireless channels. To overcome the security challenge in mmWave-NOMA based networks, the nonorthogonal interference can be exploited to improve the security. In this paper, we propose a novel mmWave-NOMA framework where the users are classified as secure users (SUs) and common users (CUs), to satisfy their heterogeneous security service needs with the presence of randomly located eavesdroppers. According to their channel disparity, the NOMA users with stronger channel gains are deemed as SUs for better secrecy performance, while the remaining ones are served as CUs. To further enhance the security, hybrid precoding for SUs is designed to strengthen the desired signal and reduce interference. In addition, to reduce the complexity and satisfy the diverse demands, user grouping and power allocation are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate of CUs subject to the SUs’ requirements. To solve the intractable non-convex problem, we decompose it into two subproblems, i.e., user grouping and power optimization, and a hybrid SU-CU grouping algorithm and a successive convex approximation based algorithm are proposed to solve them, respectively. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the advantages of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The specification of fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) describes the procedure of calculating the transport block size according to the amount of radio resources. The procedure first calculates an intermediate number of information bits and then quantizes it to obtain the transport block size. In the initial transmission, the transport block size should match the size of the application packet for some scenarios. In the retransmission, the transport block size should be exactly the same as that in the initial transmission. Thus, we are also interested in the inverse procedure: calculating the amount of radio resources according to the desired transport block size. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to solve this inverse procedure. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to introduce an auxiliary variable: the critical intermediate number of information bits. Based on this variable, the amount of radio resources can be easily scheduled according to the desired transport block size. The spectral efficiency is improved and the transmission latency is reduced. Numerical results are also given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {It is challenging to acquire accurate channel knowledge for sufficient beamforming gain because of the large number of antennas. In this paper, a deep learning aided channel estimation algorithm is proposed for mmWave cellular systems, in which both the base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) gain directional beamforming by employing large antenna arrays. We consider the off-grid (OG) mmWave channel estimation and propose a deep network architecture for solving this problem, which is different from most existing works concerning the compressed sensing (CS)-based channel estimation. Firstly, the off-grid channel model is used to relieve the basis mismatch issue by exploiting first-order Taylor-series approximation of the array manifold taken on a fixed grid of both BS and MS. Secondly, a new formulation of this off-grid channel estimation problem is solved by using a low computational complexity alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, dubbed ADMM-OG algorithm. Thirdly, the idea of algorithm unrolling guides us to design a deep network architecture ADMM-OGChannelNet corresponding to the ADMM-OG algorithm for the mmWave channel estimation. Based on the interpretability of this deep network architecture, the optimal parameters of this network can be learned without tuning in a hand-crafted way. The Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the off-grid channel model is derived for performance comparison as well. Finally, from the simulation results, we can verify that the ADMM-OGChannelNet has better estimation accuracy and relatively low computational complexity compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the downlink transmission of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cooperative non-orthogonal-multiple-access (C-NOMA), where both half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) relaying modes are considered. The system model consists of one base station (BS), two users and one RIS. The goal is to minimize the total transmit power at both the BS and at the user-cooperating relay for each relaying mode by jointly optimizing the power allocation coefficients at the BS, the transmit power coefficient at the relay user, and the passive beamforming at the RIS, subject to power budget constraints, the successive interference cancellation constraint and the minimum required quality-of-service at both cellular users. To address the high-coupled optimization variables, an efficient algorithm is proposed by invoking an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the original problem into a power allocation sub-problem and a passive beamforming sub-problem, which are solved alternately. For the power allocation sub-problem, the optimal closed-form expressions for the power allocation coefficients are derived. Meanwhile, with the aid of difference-of-convex rank-one representation and successive convex approximation, an efficient solution for the passive beamforming is obtained. The simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived power control closed-form expressions and demonstrate the gain in the total transmit power brought by integrating the RIS in C-NOMA networks.}

	abstract = {In the massive grant-free orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), the timing and frequency offsets between users impose new challenges on joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) for the subsequent data recovery. In the asynchronous OFDMA, the timing and frequency offset effects can be modeled as the phase-shifting on the pilot matrix. As such, by constructing the measurement matrix with timing and frequency offsets, the joint estimation problem can be formulated as a multiple measurement vector (MMV) recovery problem with structured sparsity. However, such structured sparsity cannot be tackled by the existing compressed sensing (CS) techniques. To address this issue, we develop an efficient structured generalized approximate message passing (S-GAMP) algorithm, which includes the parallel AMP-MMV algorithm as a particular case. To deal with the high dimensionality of the measurement matrix, we propose the dynamic S-GAMP algorithm with a dynamic measurement matrix to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithms in grant-free OFDMA with both timing and frequency offsets.}

	abstract = {In limited space scenarios, the antennas in a multiantenna cognitive radio (CR) system are closely spaced and often experience correlation among them. In this paper, the sensing performance of arbitrarily correlated antennas over the Nakagami-\nm\nfading channel for the mobile CR user is analysed. In particular, the analytical expression for the average detection probability for a mobile CR user employing the selection combining with arbitrarily correlated triple diversity branches is derived as a special case. Moreover, to characterize the performance of an energy detector under mobility, the area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic is analysed. Furthermore, as the sensing decisions can be utilized to improve the sensing performance, a comprehensive analysis of sensing performance of the mobile secondary user conditioned on the primary user (PU) activity statistics is carried out. We assume the PU traffic to be following the Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model, and its\nidle\nand\nbusy\nperiods to be following generalised Pareto distribution. The analytical framework is substantiated by Monte Carlo simulations. Results indicate that antenna correlation deteriorates detection performance. Moreover, the detection performance deteriorates further due to the mobility of CR users, especially in the deep fading channel scenarios. Furthermore, findings also suggest that under mobility, the sensing performance improves if the duty cycle of the PU channel is low. This work provides a realistic sensing framework for CR enabled vehicles.}

	abstract = {A cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising cellular network, wherein densely deployed multi-antenna remote-radio-heads (RRHs) jointly serve many users using the same time-frequency resource. By extremely high signaling overheads for both channel state information (CSI) acquisition and data sharing at a baseband unit (BBU), finding a joint transmission strategy with a significantly reduced signaling overhead is indispensable to achieve the cooperation gain in practical C-RANs. In this paper, we present a novel sparse joint transmission (sparse-JT) method for C-RANs, where the number of transmit antennas per unit area is much larger than the active downlink user density. Considering the effects of noisy-and-incomplete CSI and the quantization errors in data sharing by a finite-rate fronthaul capacity, the key innovation of sparse-JT is to find a joint solution for cooperative RRH clusters, beamforming vectors, and power allocation to maximize a lower bound of the sum-spectral efficiency under the sparsity constraint of active RRHs. To find such a solution, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees to find a local-optimal solution for a relaxed sum-spectral efficiency maximization problem. By system-level simulations, we exhibit that sparse-JT provides significant gains in ergodic spectral efficiencies compared to existing joint transmissions.}

The user association, power allocation of NOMA, deployment of UAVs and caching placement of UAVs are jointly optimized to minimize the content delivery delay. A branch and bound (BaB) based algorithm is proposed to obtain the per-slot optimization. To cope with the dynamic content requests and mobility of users in practical scenarios, the original optimization problem is transformed to a Stackelberg game. Specifically, the game is decomposed into a leader level user association sub-problem and a number of power allocation, UAV deployment and caching placement follower level sub-problems. The long-term minimization was further solved by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm. Simulation result shows that the content delivery delay of the proposed BaB based algorithm is much lower than benchmark algorithms, as the optimal solution in each time slot is achieved. Meanwhile, the proposed DRL based algorithm achieves a relatively low long-term content delivery delay in the dynamic environment with lower computation complexity than BaB based algorithm.}

Starting with a posteriori channel model, we formulate the robust precoder design to maximize an upper bound of ergodic weighted sum-rate under a total power budget. We derive the generalized eigenvector structure for optimal precoder with matrix manifold optimization. However, since the precoding of multiple users is coupled in the structure, we maximize the objective function for each user in alternation and prove the solution of each individual problem is the generalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum generalized eigenvalue. In accordance with this, we design an iterative algorithm and present its convergence analysis. Furthermore, we propose a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) for higher efficiency in the precoder design algorithm.}

	abstract = {For the physical (PHY) layer in the 5th generation (5G) networks, there may be only time division multiplexing (TDM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as candidates to serve multiple information flows via a single wireless link. Such two multiplexing schemes require the timing/ frequency synchronizations strictly, which is not suitable for power division based medium access control (MAC) protocols, i.e., non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To address this, associating with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, a power division multiplexing (PDM) scheme is proposed as an alternative option to MIMO-TDM/MIMO-OFDM. The proposed MIMO-PDM directly utilizes the division of transmit power to replace the conventional time-slot/sub-band for the different information flows. Thus, it owns high compatibility with NOMA which is a promising multiple access protocol in 5G. With regarding the quality of service (QoS) required by the information flows, this paper derives the optimum power division of MIMO-PDM in conditions of multiple-input single-output (MISO), single-input multiple-output (SIMO), and MIMO, respectively. Additionally, we study the optimum pre- and post-coding of MIMO when serving arbitrary number of information flows. The proposed optimization algorithms of MIMO-PDM own reasonable computational complexity which is not higher than the classic water-filling algorithms. Consequently, the proposed MIMO-PDM could efficiently achieve the optimum performance as well as ensure the QoS of multiple information flows.}

We present a unified treatment of this problem for two practically motivated partial and statistical channel state information (CSI) models with quantized feedback. They differ in the CSI available at the D2D receiver. In both models, the nodes only have statistical information of inter-D2D and inter-cell interferences, and employ fractional power control. We present two polynomial-time algorithms to assign multiple D2D pairs to subchannels, namely, relaxation-pruning algorithm (RPA) and cardinality-constrained subchannel assignment algorithm (CCSAA). RPA and CCSAA guarantee a D2D sum rate that is at least one-half and one-third, respectively, of the optimal sum rate. We also propose a novel statistical rate upgradation technique that exploits the allocation information to improve the D2D rates. We observe that inter-D2D interference has a more pronounced effect in the statistical CSI model. The algorithms respond differently to the two CSI models. RPA outperforms CCSAA in the partial CSI model, while CCSAA outperforms RPA in the statistical CSI model despite its weaker performance guarantee.}

We prove that the original ZigZag and a modified version of it, called double-zipper ZigZag , attain the same performance as the optimal coordinated time-sharing in the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime, even in the presence of channel state information (CSI) errors. We then extend the results to the case of arbitrary number of users employing delay-domain processing. Specifically, we introduce delay-domain zero forcing and its regularized version, which are able to cancel and suppress the interference among users, respectively. By obtaining a post-processing system model and characterizing the accumulated noise during the decoupling process, we also derive bounds on the achievable sum-rates of the proposed algorithm for both cases of perfect and imperfect CSI. Simulation results show that the newly proposed approach have comparable performance with coordinated time-sharing at high SNRs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a dense Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is studied in which a large number of devices contend for transmitting timely status packets to their corresponding receivers over wireless noisy channels, using a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme. When each device completes one transmission, due to possible transmission failure, two cases with and without transmission feedback to each device must be considered. Particularly, for the case with no feedback, the device uses policy (I): It will go to an idle state and release the channel regardless of the outcome of the transmission. For the case with perfect feedback, if the transmission succeeds, the device will go to an idle state, otherwise it uses either policy (W), i.e., it will go to a waiting state and re-contend for channel access; or it uses policy (S), i.e., it will stay at a service state and occupy this channel to attempt another transmission. For those three policies, the closed-form expressions of the average age of information (AoI) of each device are characterized under schemes with and without preemption in service. It is shown that, for each policy, the scheme with preemption in service always achieves a smaller average AoI, compared with the scheme without preemption. Then, a mean-field approximation approach with guaranteed accuracy is developed to analyze the asymptotic performance for the considered system with an infinite number of devices and the effects of the system parameters on the average AoI are characterized. Simulation results show that the proposed mean-field approximation is accurate even for a small number of devices. The results also show that olicy (S) achieves the smallest average AoI compared with policies (I) and (W), and the average AoI does not always decrease with the arrival rate for all three policies.}

	abstract = {The weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT)-based hybrid carrier (HC) system has been proposed to bridge the gap between orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and single-carrier system with frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE). In this paper, we propose a novel HC system based on efficient fast-convolution (FC) without a cyclic prefix to meet the requirements of complex scenarios towards future communications. The proposed system can achieve flexible optimization of system performance, such as minimizing out-of-band emission (OOBE), peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and bit error rate (BER). This efficient FC based hybrid carrier (FCHC) system is among the most competitive waveforms. The closed-form BER expressions are derived and analyzed over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency-selective fading channels. A modified equalizer over frequency-selective channels is also provided to resist the inter-block interference (IBI). Moreover, the banded minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalization based on FC can be embedded in the proposed system over doubly-selective channels, and then the interference caused by fading channels can be further suppressed through the combination of FC and HC. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system over the conventional HC system in terms of OOBE, PAPR and BER. The significant flexibility and combined performance advantages make the proposed system a potential scheme for future communications.}

	abstract = {The emerging uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) decoupled radio access networks (RAN) has attracted a lot of attention due to the significant gains in network throughput, load balancing and energy consumption, etc. However, due to the diverse vehicular service requirements in different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, how to provide customized cellular V2X services with diversified requirements in the UL/DL decoupled 5G and beyond cellular V2X networks is challenging. To this end, we investigate the feasibility of UL/DL decoupled RAN framework for cellular V2X communications, including the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and relay-assisted cellular vehicle-to-vehicle (RAC-V2V) communications. We propose a two-tier UL/DL decoupled RAN slicing approach. On the first tier, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is leveraged to allocate bandwidth to different base stations. On the second tier, we model the QoS metric of RAC-V2V communications as an absolute-value optimization problem and solve it by the alternative slicing ratio search (ASRS) algorithm with global convergence. The extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the UL/DL decoupled access can significantly promote load balancing and reduce C-V2X transmit power. Meanwhile, the simulation results show that the proposed solution can significantly improve the network throughput while ensuring the different QoS requirements of cellular V2X.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate dynamic resource scheduling (i.e., joint user, subchannel, and power scheduling) for downlink multi-channel non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) systems over time-varying fading channels. Specifically, we address the weighted average sum rate maximization problem with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. In particular, to facilitate fast resource scheduling, we focus on developing a very low-complexity algorithm. To this end, by leveraging Lagrangian duality and the stochastic optimization theory, we first develop an opportunistic MC-NOMA scheduling algorithm whereby the original problem is decomposed into a series of subproblems, one for each time slot. Accordingly, resource scheduling works in an online manner by solving one subproblem per time slot, making it more applicable to practical systems. Then, we further develop a heuristic joint subchannel assignment and power allocation (Joint-SAPA) algorithm with very low computational complexity, called Joint-SAPA-LCC, that solves each subproblem. Finally, through simulation, we show that our Joint-SAPA-LCC algorithm provides good performance comparable to the existing Joint-SAPA algorithms despite requiring much lower computational complexity. We also demonstrate that our opportunistic MC-NOMA scheduling algorithm in which the Joint-SAPA-LCC algorithm is embedded works well while satisfying given QoS requirements.}

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a globally optimal joint successive interference cancellation (SIC) ordering and power allocation (JSPA) algorithm for the sum-rate maximization problem in downlink multi-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. The proposed algorithm is based on the exploration of base stations (BSs) power consumption, and closed-form of optimal powers obtained for each cell. Although the optimal JSPA algorithm scales well with larger number of users, it is still exponential in the number of cells. For any suboptimal decoding order, we propose a low-complexity near-optimal joint rate and power allocation (JRPA) strategy in which the complete rate region of users is exploited. Furthermore, we design a near-optimal semi-centralized JSPA framework for a two-tier heterogeneous network such that it scales well with larger number of small-BSs and users. Numerical results show that JRPA highly outperforms the case that the users are enforced to achieve their channel capacity by imposing the well-known SIC necessary condition on power allocation. Moreover, the proposed semi-centralized JSPA framework significantly outperforms the fully distributed framework, where all the BSs operate in their maximum power budget. Therefore, the centralized JRPA and semi-centralized JSPA algorithms with near-optimal performances are good choices for larger number of cells and users.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a dual-hop cooperative satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system including a satellite (S) and a group of cluster headers (CHs) which are respectively with a group of uniformly distributed UAVs. Specifically, the CHs serve as aerial decode-and-forward relays to forward the information transmitted by the S to the UAVs. Moreover, free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) technologies are respectively adopted over S-CH and CH-UAV links to exploit the high directivity of FSO over long-distance transmission and the omnidirectional coverage ability of RF. The positions of the CHs in the three-dimensional space follow the Matérn hard-core point processes type-II, in which each CH cannot be closer to another by less than a predefined distance. Three different cases over CH-UAV links are considered during the performance modeling: interference-free, interference-dominated, and interference-and-noise. Then, the coverage performance of the S-CH link and the CH-UAV link in the aforementioned three cases is studied and the closed-form analytical expressions of the coverage probability (CP) over both two links are derived. Additionally, the asymptotic expressions for the CP over S-CH link and CH-UAV link in the interference-free case are derived. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our proposed analytical models and thus some meaningful conclusions are achieved.}

	abstract = {The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has drawn increasing attention for its benefits, such as wide coverage, high throughput for 5G and 6G communications. As one of the links, space-air communications between multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Ka-band orbiting low earth orbit (LEO) satellites face a crucial challenge in tracking the 3D dynamic channel information. This paper exploits a statistical dynamic channel model called the multi-dimensional Markov model (MD-MM), which investigates the more realistic spatial and temporal correlation in the sparse UAVs-satellite channel. Specifically, the spatial and temporal probabilistic relationships of multi-user (MU) hidden support vector, single-user (SU) joint hidden support vector, and SU hidden value vector are investigated. The specific transition probabilities that connect the SU and MU hidden support vector for both azimuth and elevation directions are defined. Moreover, based on the proposed MD-MM, we derive a novel multi-dimensional dynamic turbo approximate message passing (MD-DTAMP) algorithm for tracking the 3D dynamic channel in multiple UAVs systems. Furthermore, we also develop a gradient update scheme to recursively find the azimuth and elevation offset for 3D off-grid estimation. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm shows superior 3D channel tracking performance with smaller pilot overhead and comparable complexity.}

Our design objective is to maximize the achievable weighted sum rate (WSR) of SUs subject to the total transmit power constraint at the SAP and the interference constraints at PUs, by jointly optimizing the transmit precoding at the SAP and the reflecting coefficients at the IRS. To deal with the complex objective function, the problem is reformulated by employing the well-known weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method and an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, a special scenario with only a single PU and multiple SUs is considered and AO algorithm is adopted again. It is worth mentioning that the proposed algorithm has a much lower computational complexity than the above algorithm without the performance loss. Finally, some numerical simulations have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {The unique and often-weird properties of quantum mechanics allow an information carrier to propagate through multiple trajectories of quantum channels simultaneously. This ultimately leads us to quantum trajectories with an indefinite causal order of quantum channels. It has been shown that indefinite causal order enables the violation of bottleneck capacity , which bounds the amount of the transferable classical and quantum information through a classical trajectory with a well-defined causal order of quantum channels. In this treatise, we investigate this beneficial property in the realm of both entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communications. To this aim, we derive closed-form capacity expressions of entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communication for arbitrary quantum Pauli channels over classical and quantum trajectories. We show that by exploiting the indefinite causal order of quantum channels, we obtain capacity gains over classical trajectory as well as the violation of bottleneck capacity for various practical scenarios. Furthermore, we determine the operating region where entanglement-assisted communication over quantum trajectory obtains capacity gain against classical trajectory and where the entanglement-assisted communication over quantum trajectory violates the bottleneck capacity.}

By considering the practical imperfect channel state information (CSI) model, we formulate a joint task offloading, IRS phase shift optimization, and power allocation problem to minimize the total energy consumption. We solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem in three steps. First, we solve the IRS phase shift optimization problem with the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm for a given power- and computational resource allocation. Then, we exploit a differential convex (DC) optimization framework to determine the power allocation decision that minimizes the total energy consumption. Given the IRS phase shifts, the computational resources, and the power allocation, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm for finding the jointly optimized results. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as compared with other benchmark schemes, and the energy efficient offloading strategy for the proposed fog computing system can be chosen according to the asymptotic form of the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).}

With two-time-slot transmission, the relay receives the transmitted signal from both users in the first time-slot and splits it into two parts for information forwarding and energy harvesting, respectively, in accordance with a particular power splitting ratios. The phases of the RF signals used for energy harvesting at each relay antenna are shifted before being combined to achieve the highest power. Meanwhile, the RF signals used for information forwarding are passed through a linear precoder and then broadcast to the users in the second time-slot. We aim to optimize the power splitting ratios, precoding matrix, and RF phase shifting factors such that the sum-rate is maximized. Since joint optimization is intractable, the parameters are partitioned into three sub-optimization problems. For each parameter, a sub-optimal solution is derived in a (semi-)closed form. It shows numerically that the proposed sub-optimal solutions for the optimal phase shift and power split ratio are close to the global optimal solutions. Moreover, the proposed solution for the precoding matrix outperforms the so-called ’General Power Iterative’ algorithm proposed in the literature.}

Yet, the performance of radio-frequency sub-TeraHertz systems is severely degraded by strong oscillator phase noise. Therefore, we investigate in this paper the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with energy detection receivers to achieve high rate communications robust to phase noise. First, the design of the receiver detection algorithm is addressed. Two detectors are proposed for the studied nonlinear MIMO channel, either derived from the maximum likelihood decision rule by using a Gaussian approximation, or based on the use of neural networks. Second, the communication performance is assessed through numerical simulations for uncoded and coded systems. We consider a realistic scenario modeling an indoor wireless link in D-band with directive antennas and strongly correlated line-of-sight channels. Our results demonstrate that spatial multiplexing with non-coherent sub-TeraHertz transceivers can be realized on strongly correlated line-of-sight channels using the proposed detection schemes. Thereby, we highlight that high-rate radio-frequency sub-TeraHertz systems can be implemented with low-complexity and low-power architectures using MIMO systems with energy detection receivers.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate covert communication over millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies. In particular, a mmWave transmitter, referred to as Alice, attempts to reliably communicate to a receiver, referred to as Bob, while hiding the existence of communication from a warden, referred to as Willie. In this regard, operating over the mmWave bands not only increases the covertness thanks to directional beams, but also increases the transmission data rates given much more available bandwidths and enables ultra-low form factor transceivers due to the lower wavelengths used compared to the conventional radio frequency (RF) counterpart. We first assume that the transmitter Alice employs two independent antenna arrays in which one of the arrays is to form a directive beam for data transmission to Bob. The other antenna array is used by Alice to generate another beam toward Willie as a jamming signal while changing the transmit power independently across the transmission blocks in order to achieve the desired covertness. For this dual-beam setup, we characterize Willie’s detection error rate with the optimal detector and the closed-form of its expected value from Alice’s perspective. We then derive the closed-form expression for the outage probability of the Alice-Bob link, which enables characterizing the optimal covert rate that can be achieved using the proposed setup. We further obtain tractable forms for the ergodic capacity of the Alice-Bob link involving only one-dimensional integrals that can be computed in closed forms for most ranges of the channel parameters. Finally, we highlight how the results can be extended to more practical scenarios, particularly to the cases where perfect information about the location of the passive warden is not available. Our results demonstrate the advantages of covert mmWave communication compared to the RF counterpart. The research in this paper is the first analytical attempt in exploring covert communication using mmWave systems.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system constitutes an effective structure conceived for efficiently utilizing the channel information, which is capable of achieving a promising transmission performance in high-mobility environment. To extract enough channel diversity, a two-dimensional Fourier transformation combined with a pulse shape is designed at the OTFS transmitter. Consequently, the amplitude of OTFS signals may fluctuate drastically, owing to the combined dependency of the OTFS transformation and the pulse shape. To quantify the amplitude fluctuation, we investigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OTFS signals, for a large amount of data in the delay-Doppler domain. We first reveal that when the number of data points approaches to infinity, based on central limit theorems for dependent variables, the complex-valued OTFS signals weakly converge to a Gaussian distribution. Then, according to the extremal theory of the Chi-squared process for stationary OTFS signals, an accurate expression of the PAPR distribution is derived, depending on the transmit pulse and the number of data points. It is also demonstrated that upon modifying the exponential factor, the analytical PAPR expression is applicable for the non-stationary Gaussian distribution caused by the bandlimited pulse with a large roll-off factor. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical PAPR probability for practical conditions.}

	abstract = {Targeting at implementing the next generation radio access networks (RANs) with virtualized network components, the open RAN (O-RAN) has been regarded as a novel paradigm towards fully open, virtualized and interoperable RANs. Through particularly introducing RAN intelligent controllers (RICs), machine learning (ML) can be unprecedentedly installed, adapting to various vertical applications and deployment environments without sophisticated planning efforts. However, the O-RAN also suffers two critical challenges of load balancing and frequent handovers in the massive base station (BS) deployment. In this paper, an intelligent user access control scheme with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. To optimize the performance of distributed deep Q-networks (DQNs) trained by user equipments (UEs), a federated DRL-based scheme is proposed with a global model server installed in the RIC to update the DQN parameters. To further predictively train a global DQN with acceptable signaling overheads, the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to select the optimal UE set and a dueling structure to decompose the DQN parameters are developed. With the proposed scheme, each UE effectively maximizes the long-term throughput and avoids frequent handovers. The simulation results well justify the outstanding performance of the proposed scheme over the-state-of-the-arts, to serve as references for the O-RAN standardization.}

	abstract = {Security is a critical consideration in Underwater Acoustic Networks (UANs) due to the importance of the applications in which these types of networks are often employed, from military applications to marine natural disaster prevention. Furthermore, even simple Denial of Service (DoS) attacks such as jamming can be very effective in disrupting the communication, with significant negative consequences for these critical applications. While jamming has been widely studied in the context of terrestrial networks, the peculiarities of propagation in UANs, such as the low propagation speed, the multipath, and the high delay spread, need to be considered: the relative positions of the jammer, transmitter, and receiver can have a huge impact on the feasibility and impact of reactive jamming, opening the way for the exploitation of other jamming models. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of a reactive and a blind jammer through a game theoretical framework, comparing them for different geometries of the scenario. We assess the impact of the different jammers, employing different active and evasive strategies, where the first type of countermeasure implies the use of additional energy to protect the communication, while the second tries to avoid the jamming signals by randomizing the transmission pattern.}

Due to the non-convex constraints, traditional optimization-based algorithms either obtain sub-optimal solutions or take exponential complexity to reach the optimum. In this paper, we propose a learning based branch-and-bound (LBB) algorithm for solving the considered CMCPs. LBB regards the search procedure of the global optimal argument-cut based branch-and-bound (AC-BB) algorithm as a sequential decision problem in a binary tree and learns the optimal pruning policy via supervised learning. We first propose to apply ensemble learning to train multiple classifiers and then combine them to achieve better performance. To tackle the imbalanced issue, we propose an undersampling-supervised learning method to sample several balanced subsets and train a classifier on each of them. We also show that the computational complexity of LBB is determined by the depth of the binary tree and give its expression in the worst case. Finally, we validate the proposed LBB with two classic problems in wireless communications, i.e., multicast beamforming and MIMO detection. Numerical results show that LBB runs significantly faster than AC-BB while achieving nearly the same optimal performance.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is a practical challenge for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless communication. As the number of IRS reflecting elements or IRS-aided users increases, the channel training overhead becomes excessively high, which results in long delay and low throughput in data transmission. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new anchor-assisted channel estimation approach, where two anchor nodes, namely A1 and A2, are deployed near the IRS for facilitating its aided base station (BS) in acquiring the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels required for data transmission. Specifically, in the first scheme, the partial channel state information (CSI) on the element-wise channel gain square of the common BS-IRS link for all users is first obtained at the BS via the anchor-assisted training and feedback. Then, by leveraging such partial CSI, the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels are efficiently resolved at the BS with additional training by the users. While in the second scheme, the BS-IRS-A1 and A1-IRS-A2 channels are first estimated via the training by A1. Then, with additional training by A2, all users estimate their individual cascaded A2-IRS-user channels simultaneously. Based on the CSI fed back from A2 and all users, the BS resolves the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels efficiently. In both schemes, the channels among the fixed BS, IRS, and two anchors are estimated in a large timescale, which greatly reduces the real-time training overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed anchor-assisted channel estimation schemes achieve superior performance as compared to existing IRS channel estimation schemes, under various practical setups. In addition, the first proposed scheme outperforms the second one when the number of antennas at the BS is sufficiently large, and vice versa.}

To tackle these challenges, a joint model and data driven receiver scheme is proposed in this paper. Specifically, based on the conventional linear receiver model, the least squares (LS) estimation and zero forcing (ZF) equalization are first employed to extract the initial features for channel estimation and data detection. Then, shallow neural networks, named CE-Net and SD-Net, are developed to refine the channel estimation and data detection, where the imperfect hardware is modeled as a nonlinear function and data is utilized to train these neural networks to approximate it.

In particular, an universal iterative two-stage joint SI cancellation and data detection framework is considered and its performance bound independent of any specific estimation and detection methods is derived. First, the channel and phase noise estimation mean square error (MSE) lower bounds in each iteration are derived by analyzing the Fisher information of the received signal. Then, by substituting the derived MSE lower bound into the SINR expression, which is related to the channel and phase noise estimation MSE, the SINR upper bound in each iteration is computed. Finally, by exploiting the SINR upper bound and the transition information of the detection errors between two adjacent iterations, the universal bit error rate (BER) lower bound for data detection is derived.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically employ hybrid mixed signal processing to avoid expensive hardware and high training overheads. However, the lack of fully digital beamforming at mmWave bands imposes additional challenges in channel estimation. Prior art on hybrid architectures has mainly focused on greedy optimization algorithms to estimate frequency-flat narrowband mmWave channels, despite the fact that in practice, the large bandwidth associated with mmWave channels results in frequency-selective channels. In this paper, we consider a frequency-selective wideband mmWave system and propose two deep learning (DL) compressive sensing (CS) based algorithms for channel estimation. The proposed algorithms learn critical apriori information from training data to provide highly accurate channel estimates with low training overhead. In the first approach, a DL-CS based algorithm simultaneously estimates the channel supports in the frequency domain, which are then used for channel reconstruction. The second approach exploits the estimated supports to apply a low-complexity multi-resolution fine-tuning method to further enhance the estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based schemes significantly outperform conventional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) techniques in terms of the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), computational complexity, and spectral efficiency, particularly in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime. When compared to OMP approaches that achieve an NMSE gap of\n{4−10}dB\nwith respect to the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), the proposed algorithms reduce the CRLB gap to only\n{1−1.5}dB\n, while reducing complexity by two orders of magnitude.}

	abstract = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is emphasized as a controlled scattering cluster. To this end, scatterers and traveling paths of multipath components are classified to build a new channel model. Unlike the conventional modeling, where the channels between system units are modeled independently, the new model considers the channel as a whole and decomposes it based on the traveling paths. The model shows clearly how IRS, in the beam-space context, converts the channel from a problem into a design element. After investigating IRS as a scattering cluster, based on a proposed segmentation scheme, the beamforming problem is considered with a focus on first-order reflections. Passive beamforming at IRS is shown to have two tiers; at the scatterer and antenna levels. A segment-activation scheme is proposed to maximize the received signal power, where the number of transmitting antenna elements to be used is given as a function of IRS positioning and beamforming at the receiver. The results show that while using more transmitting antenna elements to get narrower beams is possible, using fewer elements can give better performance, especially for larger IRS at close distances. The developed model also proves useful in addressing emerging issues in massive MIMO communication, namely, stationarity and spherical wavefronts.}

In order to obtain accurate prediction with low complexity, we propose a novel context-aware popularity prediction policy based on federated learning (FL). Firstly, user preference learning is applied by considering that users prefer to request the contents they are interested in. Then, users’ context information is utilized to cluster users efficiently by adaptive context space partitioning. After that, we formulate a popularity prediction optimization problem to learn the local model parameters by using the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. Finally, FL based model integration is proposed to learn the global popularity prediction model based on local models using the distributed approximate Newton (DANE) algorithm with SVRG. Our proposed popularity prediction policy not only can predict content popularity accurately, but also can significantly reduce computational complexity. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the convergence bound of our proposed FL based model integration algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed policy increases the cache hit rate by up to 21.5 % compared to existing policies.}

	abstract = {This paper presents channel-aware adversarial attacks against deep learning-based wireless signal classifiers. There is a transmitter that transmits signals with different modulation types. A deep neural network is used at each receiver to classify its over-the-air received signals to modulation types. In the meantime, an adversary transmits an adversarial perturbation (subject to a power budget) to fool receivers into making errors in classifying signals that are received as superpositions of transmitted signals and adversarial perturbations. First, these evasion attacks are shown to fail when channels are not considered in designing adversarial perturbations. Then, realistic attacks are presented by considering channel effects from the adversary to each receiver. After showing that a channel-aware attack is selective (i.e., it affects only the receiver whose channel is considered in the perturbation design), a broadcast adversarial attack is presented by crafting a common adversarial perturbation to simultaneously fool classifiers at different receivers. The major vulnerability of modulation classifiers to over-the-air adversarial attacks is shown by accounting for different levels of information available about the channel, the transmitter input, and the classifier model. Finally, a certified defense based on randomized smoothing that augments training data with noise is introduced to make the modulation classifier robust to adversarial perturbations.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatial-spectral terahertz (THz) networks, where transmitters equipped with leaky-wave antennas send information to their receivers at the THz frequency bands. As a directional and nearly planar antenna, the leaky-wave antenna allows for information transmissions with narrow beams and high antenna gains. The conventional large antenna arrays are confronted with challenging issues such as scaling limits and path discovery in the THz frequencies. Therefore, this work exploits the potential of leaky-wave antennas in the dense THz networks, to establish low-complexity THz links. By addressing the propagation angle-frequency coupling effects, the transmission rate is analyzed. The results show that the leaky-wave antenna is efficient for achieving the high-speed transmission rate. The co-channel interference management is unnecessary when the THz transmitters with large subchannel bandwidths are not extremely dense. A simple subchannel allocation solution is proposed, which enhances the transmission rate compared with the same number of subchannels with the equal allocation of the frequency band. After subchannel allocation, a low-complexity power allocation method is proposed to improve the energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {Device activity detection is one main challenge in grant-free massive access, which is recently proposed to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC). Existing solutions for device activity detection fail to consider inter-cell interference generated by massive IoT devices or important prior information on device activities and inter-cell interference. In this paper, given different numbers of observations and network parameters, we consider both non-cooperative device activity detection and cooperative device activity detection in a multi-cell network, consisting of many access points (APs) and IoT devices. Under each activity detection mechanism, we consider the joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimation and joint maximum a posterior probability (MAP) estimation of both device activities and interference powers, utilizing tools from probability, stochastic geometry, and optimization. Each estimation problem is a challenging non-convex problem, and a coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to obtain a stationary point. Each proposed joint ML estimation extends the existing one for a single-cell network by considering the estimation of interference powers, together with the estimation of device activities. Each proposed joint MAP estimation further enhances the corresponding joint ML estimation by exploiting prior distributions of device activities and interference powers. The proposed joint ML estimation and joint MAP estimation under cooperative detection outperform the respective ones under non-cooperative detection at the costs of increasing backhaul burden, knowledge of network parameters, and computational complexities. Numerical results show the substantial gains of the proposed designs over well-known existing designs and reveal the importance of explicit consideration of inter-cell interference, the value of prior information, and the advantage of AP cooperation in device activity detection.}

	abstract = {This paper characterizes the latency of the simplified successive-cancellation (SSC) decoding scheme for polar codes under hardware resource constraints. In particular, when the number of processing elements P\nthat can perform SSC decoding operations in parallel is limited, as is the case in practice, the latency of SSC decoding is O\\left({N^{1-1/\\mu }+\\frac {N}{P}\\log _{2}\\log _{2}\\frac {N}{P}}\\right)\n, where N\nis the block length of the code and \\mu\nis the scaling exponent of the channel. Three direct consequences of this bound are presented. First, in a fully-parallel implementation where P=\\frac {N}{2}\n, the latency of SSC decoding is O(N^{1-1/\\mu })\n, which is sublinear in the block length. This recovers a result from our earlier work. Second, in a fully-serial implementation where P=1\n, the latency of SSC decoding scales as O(N\\log _{2}\\log _{2} N)\n. The multiplicative constant is also calculated: we show that the latency of SSC decoding when P=1\nis given by (2+o(1)) N\\log _{2}\\log _{2} N\n. Third, in a semi-parallel implementation, the smallest P\nthat gives the same latency as that of the fully-parallel implementation is P=N^{1/\\mu }\n. The tightness of our bound on SSC decoding latency and the applicability of the foregoing results is validated through extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems. It adaptively configures massive passive reflecting elements to control wireless channel in a desirable way. Due to hardware characteristics and deploying environments, an IRS may be subject to reflecting element blockages and failures, and hence developing diagnostic techniques is of great significance to system monitoring and maintenance. In this paper, we develop diagnostic techniques for IRS systems to locate faulty reflecting elements and retrieve failure parameters. Three cases of channel state information (CSI) availability are considered. In the first case where full CSI is available, a compressed sensing based diagnostic technique is proposed, which significantly reduces the required number of measurements. In the second case where only partial CSI is available, we jointly exploit the sparsity of the millimeter-wave channel and the failure, and adopt compressed sparse and low-rank matrix recovery algorithm to decouple channel and failure. In the third case where no CSI is available, a novel atomic norm is introduced as the sparsity-inducing norm of the cascaded channel, and the diagnosis problem is formulated as a joint sparse recovery problem. Finally, the proposed diagnostic techniques are validated through numerical simulations.}

For the first time, actual received Ka-band data from a deep-space satellite mission (Hayabusa2 mission from JAXA and supported by ESA) were available for operational tests. RMOP-predicted link-budget parameters were delivered in real-time before each scheduled satellite transmission period. After each transmission, received data measured by the ground stations were exploited for the RMOP validation. The data-volume actually received (transmitted and lost) by Hayabusa2 was compared with the one that would have been obtained if the transmission had been configured according to RMOP predictions. The results prove that RMOP model is capable of receiving more than 100% of extra data-volume with respect to the classical link-budget design techniques while keeping data losses under control. A specific approach usable in case of rainy events is described, too. These outstanding results will pave the way to an operative use of the weather-forecast based RMOP model for future satellite missions.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (OAC) is a promising technique to realize fast model aggregation in the uplink of federated edge learning (FEEL). OAC, however, hinges on accurate channel-gain precoding and strict synchronization among edge devices, which are challenging in practice. As such, how to design the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator in the presence of residual channel-gain mismatch and asynchronies is an open problem. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the problem of misaligned OAC for FEEL and puts forth a whitened matched filtering and sampling scheme to obtain oversampled, but independent samples from the misaligned and overlapped signals. Given the whitened samples, a sum-product ML (SP-ML) estimator and an aligned-sample estimator are devised to estimate the arithmetic sum of the transmitted symbols. In particular, the computational complexity of our SP-ML estimator is linear in the packet length, and hence is significantly lower than the conventional ML estimator. Extensive simulations on the test accuracy versus the average received energy per symbol to noise power spectral density ratio (EsN0) yield two main results: 1) In the low EsN0 regime, the aligned-sample estimator can achieve superior test accuracy provided that the phase misalignment is not severe. In contrast, the ML estimator does not work well due to the error propagation and noise enhancement in the estimation process. 2) In the high EsN0 regime, the ML estimator attains the optimal learning performance regardless of the severity of phase misalignment. On the other hand, the aligned-sample estimator suffers from a test-accuracy loss caused by phase misalignment.}

	abstract = {Large-scale deployment of connected vehicles with cooperative sensing technologies increases the demand on the vehicular communication spectrum in 5.9 GHz allocated for the exchange of safety messages. To support the high data rates needed by such applications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar spectrum at 76–81 GHz can be utilized for wideband communication as well. For this purpose, various joint automotive radar-communication (JARC) systems have been proposed in the literature to perform both functions using the same wideband waveform. However, the wideband joint waveforms encounter frequency-selectivity in both radar and communication channels due to multi-path propagation. In this paper, we address the optimal joint waveform design problem to exploit the frequency-selectivity for wideband JARC operations via orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wherein subcarrier coefficients are designed for optimal power allocation and phase coding. We show that the problem is a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem which is known to be NP-hard. Existing approaches to solve QCQP include semidefinite relaxation (SDR) which incurs high time complexity. Instead, we propose approximation methods to solve QCQP more efficiently by leveraging structured matrices and using convex approximations. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches through numerical simulations.}

We derive the achievable rate expressions of the aggregated LiFi-WiFi system for the first time. Then, we study the rate maximization problem via optimizing the constellation distribution and power allocation jointly. Specifically, a multilevel mercy-filling power allocation scheme is proposed by exploiting the relationship between the mutual information and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) of discrete inputs. Meanwhile, an inexact gradient descent method is proposed for obtaining the optimal probability distributions. To strike a balance between the computational complexity and the transmission performance, we further develop a framework that maximizes the lower bound of the achievable rate where the optimal power allocation can be obtained in closed forms and the constellation distributions problem can be solved efficiently by Frank-Wolfe method. Extensive numerical results show that the optimized strategies are able to provide significant gains over the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of the achievable rate.}

Users arrive to the system at random and be activated for a certain period of time slots and then disappear from the system. Under such dynamic network environment, we propose a distributed multichannel access protocol based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both throughput and fairness between active users. Unlike the previous approaches adjusting channel access probabilities at each time slot, the proposed RL algorithm deterministically selects a set of channel access policies for several consecutive time slots. To effectively reduce the complexity of the proposed RL algorithm, we adopt a branching dueling Q-network architecture and propose an efficient training methodology for producing proper Q-values over time-varying user sets. We perform extensive simulations on realistic traffic environments and demonstrate that the proposed online learning improves both throughput and fairness compared to the conventional RL approaches and centralized scheduling policies.}

	abstract = {With the stringent requirement of receiving video from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from anywhere in the stadium of sports events and the significant-high per-cell throughput for video transmission to virtual reality (VR) users, a promising solution is a cell-free multi-group broadcast (CF-MB) network with cooperative reception and broadcast access-points (AP). To explore the benefit of broadcasting user-correlated decode-dependent video resources to spatially correlated VR users, the network should dynamically schedule the video and cluster APs into virtual cells for a different group of VR users with overlapped video requests. By decomposing the problem into scheduling and association sub-problems, we first introduce the conventional non-learning-based scheduling and association algorithms, and a centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) association approach based on the rainbow agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate decisions from observation. To reduce its complexity, we then decompose the association problem into multiple sub-problems, resulting in a networked-distributed Partially Observable Markov decision process (ND-POMDP). To solve it, we propose a multi-agent deep DRL algorithm. To jointly solve the coupled association and scheduling problems, we further develop a hierarchical federated DRL algorithm with scheduler as meta-controller, and association as the controller. Our simulation results show that our CF-MB network can effectively handle real-time video transmission from UAVs to VR users. Our proposed learning architecture is effective and scalable for a high-dimensional cooperative association problem with increasing APs and VR users. Also, our proposed algorithms outperform non-learning based methods with significant performance improvement.}

	abstract = {We propose a new interference cancellation (IC) approach designed for coded uplink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that support a massive number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The performance of MIMO spatial multiplexing depends on the symbol detection schemes, which in general offer a trade-off between the error rate performance and computational complexity. Previous studies have shown that a simple matched-filter (MF)-based detector with powerful channel coding can achieve near-optimal performance as the number of base station (BS) antennas increases even without IC. However, if the number of BS antennas is the same order as that of the IoT devices supported by the BS, its achievable rate will be significantly degraded. Furthermore, channel estimation errors due to the lack of orthogonal pilot sequences should also become a dominant factor. This paper overcomes this problem by introducing a MF detector with quadrature interference cancellation (MF-QIC), which can improve error performance and spectral efficiency. Taking polar codes as our channel coding example, we propose a code design based on mutual information tailored for MF-QIC. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity polar-coded MF-QIC outperforms other conventional approaches even in the presence of imperfect channel state information.}

	abstract = {Wireless communications with extremely large-scale array (XL-array) correspond to systems whose antenna sizes are so large that conventional modeling assumptions, such as uniform plane wave (UPW) impingement, are no longer valid. This paper studies the mathematical modeling and performance analysis of XL-array communications. By deviating from the conventional modeling approach that treats the array elements as sizeless points, we explicitly model their physical area/aperture, which enables a unified modeling for the classical discrete antenna arrays and the emerging active continuous surfaces. As such, a generic array/surface model that accurately takes into account the variations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across array elements is proposed. Based on the proposed model, a closed-form expression of the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the optimal single-user maximum ratio combining/transmission (MRC/MRT) beamforming is derived. The expression reveals that instead of scaling linearly with the antenna number $M$ as in conventional UPW modeling, the SNR with the more generic model increases with $M$ with diminishing return, which is governed by the collective properties of the array, such as the array occupation ratio and the physical sizes of the array along each dimension, while irrespective of the properties of the individual array element. In addition, we have derived an alternative insightful expression for the optimal SNR in terms of the vertical and horizontal angular spans , which are fully determined by the geometric angles formed by the array/surface and user location. Furthermore, we also show that our derived results include the far-field UPW modeling as a special case. One important finding during the study of far-field approximation is the necessity to introduce a new distance criterion to complement the classical Rayleigh distance, termed uniform-power distance (UPD), which concerns the signal amplitude/power variations across array elements, instead of phase variations as for Rayleigh distance. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the necessity of proper modeling for XL-array communications by comparing the proposed model with various benchmark models.}

An implicit characterization of the maximum average throughput over an additive white Gaussian noise channel and the associated optimal power control policy is provided via the Bellman equation under the assumption that the energy arrival process is stationary and memoryless. A more explicit characterization is obtained for the case of Bernoulli energy arrivals by means of asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on both the maximum average throughput and the optimal power control policy. Apart from their pivotal role in deriving the desired analytical results, such bounds are highly valuable from a numerical perspective as they can be efficiently computed using convex optimization solvers.}

Our algorithm iteratively solves a relaxed version of a maximum a-posteriori JED problem and simultaneously exploits the sparsity of cell-free massive MU-MIMO channels as well as the boundedness of QAM constellations. In order to improve the performance and convergence of the algorithm, we propose methods that permute the access point and UE indices to form so-called virtual cells, which leads to better initial solutions. We assess the performance of our algorithm in terms of root-mean-squared-symbol error, bit error rate, and mutual information, and we demonstrate that JED significantly reduces the pilot overhead compared to orthogonal training, which enables reliable communication with short packets to a large number of UEs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a joint user pairing and power allocation problem in the 5th generation (5G) satellite random access (RA) networks, where some user equipments (UEs) are assisted by relay satellite UEs to establish satellite access. We aim to maximize the total sum rate of the RA system by jointly optimizing user pairing and power allocation. The above joint optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer problem, which is challenging to solve. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems. Firstly, a problem for optimal user pairing is formulated to find the optimal user pairing relationship. To solve this subproblem efficiently, a Q-learning based distributed user pairing algorithm (QL-DUPA) is proposed, which converts the user pairing problem to a Q-learning process. The Q-learning process can achieve a near-optimal solution and is practically feasible. Then, a problem for optimal power allocation is formulated to find the optimal power allocation coefficients in each user pair. The subproblem is convex and the optimal solution is obtained using convex optimization. Next, a satellite RA scheme with collision resolution is proposed based on the joint optimization of user pairing and power allocation, and we analyze its total sum rate. Simulation results show that the proposed satellite RA scheme with collision resolution greatly outperforms the existing schemes in terms of total sum rate.}

	abstract = {In general, target localization in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems requires synchronization among the sensors, which may not be feasible when the sensors are widely separated. In this paper, the target localization problem is addressed under asynchronous distributed MIMO radar systems in the presence of clock and frequency offsets with the aid of a cooperative target, whose position and velocity are known with measurement errors. Specifically, the influence of the cooperative target position and velocity errors on the unknown target localization accuracy is analyzed through the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) derivation firstly. Then two methods, namely, the offset estimation based localization method and the offset elimination based localization method, are proposed to estimate the unknown target location. The former estimates the clock and frequency offsets firstly and then locates the unknown target based on the offset estimates, and the latter achieves the unknown target location estimate based on the differential measurements of the two targets. Through the theoretical derivation and numerical simulations, the two proposed methods are demonstrated to be approximately unbiased and can attain the CRLB under mild noise. Moreover, the simulation results show that the proposed methods enjoy higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {Hybrid energy supply composed of batteries and radio frequency (RF) signals has been anticipated to be a prominent solution for balancing the reliability and self-sustainability of future IoT networks. The newly emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is also capable of greatly enhancing spectral and energy efficiencies. In this paper, by considering an asynchronous transmission protocol among all energy receivers (ERs) and assuming the perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) at the hybrid access point (HAP), we aim to maximize sum throughput in the RIS-aided hybrid powered communication networks (HPCNs) by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrices of the HAP and all ERs, the RIS reflection matrix and the downlink/uplink (DL/UL) time allocation. Generally, this optimization problem is intractable to solve due to strongly coupled variables and nonconvex unit-modulus constraints. To draw more insights into this joint design, we firstly carry out feasibility analysis on this problem, and then develop a 2-block alternating optimization algorithm, which consists of the semi-closed-form solution based iterative algorithm for deriving the optimal MIMO transceivers together with the DL/UL time allocation and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm for the RIS design. To avoid the potential high complexity of alternating optimization, we also propose a two-stage scheme, where the RIS design is independent of the others and aims to create favorable DL/UL channels. The extension of our proposed algorithms to the practical imperfect SIC case is then discussed. Numerical results illustrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms over the baselines in terms of the achievable sum throughput, and their time effectiveness in solving large-scale problems.}

The objective is to maximize the minimum robust information rate among the legitimate information receivers (IRs).

Then, an iteration-based algorithm framework was proposed, where the unit modulus constraint (UMC) of the IRS is handled by the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. Moreover, a stochastic SCA method is proposed to handle the outage constrained design with statistical CSI. Finally, simulation results validate the promising performance of the proposed design.}

We theoretically prove that CQ-GGADMM achieves the linear convergence rate when the local objective functions are strongly convex under some mild assumptions. Numerical simulations corroborate that CQ-GGADMM exhibits higher communication efficiency in terms of the number of communication rounds and transmit energy consumption without compromising the accuracy and convergence speed, compared to the censored decentralized ADMM, and the worker grouping method of GADMM.}

	abstract = {Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) has received considerable attention as a promising technology to improve the transmission rates and spectral efficiency of cell edge users for future networks. How to design coordinated scheduling through a cross-layer approach is challenging in CoMP systems. In this paper, a pilot-efficient scheduling policy is presented in CoMP systems with large-scale antennas. Our policy selects users to access the spectrum and allocates the power to users based on the queue state information (QSI) and channel state information (CSI). Based on the Lyapunov optimization, the cross-layer scheduling problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is nontrivial. To solve this problem, we decouple the combinatorial optimization problem as a user selection problem and a power allocation problem. Then a low-complexity iteration algorithm is proposed to solve the combinatorial optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our presented policy has better performance over traditional methods. Moreover, by comparing to the exhaustive search algorithm, the performance of our proposed policy is similar to that of an optimal policy.}

However, the self-interference (SI), which is usually more than 100 dB higher than the signal-of-interest, becomes the major bottleneck in developing these IBFD networks. We design and analyze a subarray-based hybrid beamforming IBFD-IAB system with the RF beamformers obtained via RF codebooks given by a modified Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm. The SI is canceled in three stages, where the first stage of antenna isolation is assumed to be successfully deployed. The second stage consists of the optical domain (OD)-based RF cancellation, where cancelers are connected with the RF chain pairs. The third stage is comprised of the digital cancellation via successive interference cancellation followed by minimum mean-squared error baseband receiver. Multiuser interference in the access link is canceled by zero-forcing at the IAB-node transmitter. Simulations show that under 400 MHz bandwidth, our proposed OD-based RF cancellation can achieve around 25 dB of cancellation with 100 taps. Moreover, the higher the hardware impairment and channel estimation error, the worse digital cancellation ability we can obtain.}

To achieve data rates on the order of gigabits per second in VLC systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission has been identified as a key technology. In this paper, we consider a centralized network architecture where the ceiling LED luminaries act as transmitter elements of a distributed massive MIMO VLC system. To obtain the full benefits of massive MIMO, channel state information must be available at the transmitter side. Downlink (DL) channel estimation in a massive MIMO system requires huge pilot overhead in DL as well as feedback overhead in uplink. This makes the implementation of massive MIMO system infeasible if not properly designed. In our study, we address the design of massive MIMO VLC systems with a limited number of DL pilot signals. We explore different DL pilot patterns (PPs) in frequency, time, and spatial domains where interpolation is performed to obtain the global channel matrix taking advantage of the indoor environment geometry and layout of luminaries. We then present data rate results for different DL PPs under the consideration of varying number of active user equipments through Monte-Carlo simulations.}

We consider a point-to-point communication setup employing packet combining strategies to transmit status update packets over an erroneous wireless data channel. The sender receives the positive acknowledgment (ACK) or negative acknowledgment (NACK) of packet reception over an error-prone wireless feedback channel. To mitigate the impact of the imperfect feedback channel on the system performance, we adopt an asymmetric signal detection model to control the detection accuracy of ACK and NACK signals. We then compute the explicit expressions for the average AoIs under preemptive and non-preemptive service management policies. We show the optimum parameter design for the control channel model in order to minimize the average AoI. The numerical results validate the analysis and provide detailed perspectives on the optimal signal detection setup minimizing the average AoI, and the possible trade-off between AoI and resource utilization. Generally, the analysis for a preemption setting illustrates that a better protection for the NACK messages compared to the ACK messages can preserve the minimum AoI performance. Especially, under a high noisy feedback channel setup, we show that the viable solution minimizing the average AoI is a blind transmission mechanism at the cost of increasing unnecessary utilization of the channel resources. Moreover, the analysis for a non-preemptive policy reveals the dependence of the optimal feedback signal detection design on the status packet generation rate at the sensor. Such a dependency makes the feedback signal detection approach to provide a more reliable ACK detection compared to NACK messages under the condition of more frequent packet arrival, whereas the opposite holds under the condition of less frequent packet arrival.}

Furthermore, we design a requirement satisfaction model by exploring practical variations in user request patterns for security provisioning, delay reduction and energy saving. Based on these, we propose a satisfaction-maximized secure computation offloading (SMax-SCO) scheme, and then formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing users’ requirement satisfactions subject to secrecy offloading rate, tolerable delay, task workload and maximum power constraints. Since the optimization problem is nonconvex, we present an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions. We demonstrate that the proposed SMax-SCO scheme achieves a significant improvement in security performance and requirement satisfaction compared with existing schemes. Moreover, we conclude that SMax-SCO can resist eavesdropping attacks of multiple eavesdroppers and even colluding eavesdroppers.}

It is inferred from the theoretical analysis that random jamming behaviour is impulsive and it reveals a destructive property over aperture-averaged FSO receivers. Analytical expressions of the average bit error rate (ABER) and outage probability (OP) are formulated for the considered FSO system in the presence of random jammer. The effects of pulse jamming on ABER and OP performances are shown. Additionally, the asymptotic ABER analysis is performed in order to investigate the response of the considered FSO system in high transmit power region and to analyze the diversity order under the pulse jamming effect. Pointing error impairments, being another important performance degrading parameter of the FSO communication system, are studied along with the pulse jamming effect.

In previous works, model training is mostly done via centralized learning (CL), where the whole training dataset is collected from the users at the base station (BS). This approach introduces huge communication overhead for data collection. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for channel estimation. We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the local datasets of the users without sending them to the BS. We develop FL-based channel estimation schemes for both conventional and RIS (intelligent reflecting surface) assisted massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems, where a single CNN is trained for two different datasets for both scenarios. We evaluate the performance for noisy and quantized model transmission and show that the proposed approach provides approximately 16 times lower overhead than CL, while maintaining satisfactory performance close to CL. Furthermore, the proposed architecture exhibits lower estimation error than the state-of-the-art ML-based schemes.}

	abstract = {We consider robust mobile location estimation using range measurements from multiple base stations under probabilistically mixed line-of-sight (LOS)/non-LOS (NLOS) conditions in a cellular network, where the NLOS statistics and occurrence probabilities (NOPs) are unknown. We develop new algorithms for achieving desirable performance under these challenging conditions. First, we propose a measurement preprocessing (MPP) scheme for dynamically bounding the NLOS influence on raw range measurements. The mobile positioning problem is cast as the state estimation of an MPP-based system model. Next, we introduce extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based reinforced robust regression and develop a gradient descent-type iterative M-estimation procedure with ensured stability, resulting in a reinforced M-estimation-based robust EKF (M-REKF). Subsequently, we present a fuzzy-tuning M-REKF (FTM-REKF) incorporating adequate fuzzy adaptation of measurement noise covariances in the M-REKF. A performance analysis provides insight into how adequate fuzzy rules can be established methodically for the FTM-REKF. Simulations demonstrate that despite varying NOPs and NLOS statistics, the FTM-REKF and M-REKF stably yield satisfactory location estimates of moving and stationary targets, with the former outperforming the latter, and they can meet the Enhanced 911 positioning requirements. Moreover, the proposed algorithms significantly outperform several salient iterative M-estimation-based EKFs, and their MPP-based counterparts.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a scenario where a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to allow the localization of mobile users adopting a single anchor node, even under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions. When the RIS is large and the operating frequency is high, as in the millimeter-wave band, the system is likely to operate in the near-field propagation regime, which can be exploited to obtain robust localization. To this purpose, two practical signaling and positioning algorithms, based on an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink system, are proposed along with methods to design the RIS time-varying reflection coefficients. In the numerical results, the two algorithms are compared in terms of performance in the presence of a synchronization mismatch and considering trade-offs between bandwidth, overhead, operating frequency, and latency. Finally, we provide an analysis of the soft-coverage capability, i.e., on the possibility of maintaining a high level of localization accuracy when in the presence of increasing levels of obstruction of the RIS.}

In particular, an IRS is employed to establish favorable communication channel conditions and to mitigate the malignant interference caused by D2D devices. We aim to maximize the system sum-rate by jointly designing the cellular user (CU) association, the active beamforming at the base stations (BSs), the passive beamforming at the IRS, and the transmit power of each D2D transmitter (DT). The resource allocation design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem while taking into account the quality of service (QoS) requirement of CUs, the power allocations for both CUs and D2D pairs, and the limited backhaul capacity. To handle the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a computationally efficient iterative algorithm exploiting the big-M formulation, the penalty method, and the successive convex approximation, which is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can increase the system sum-rate by 70% and 20% compared with the schemes with no IRS and random phase shifts, respectively, when the minimum required SINR of CUs is 5 dB. Additionally, our results confirm the superiority of introducing IRS for harnessing interference in wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technique in the 5G Era to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for online video streaming due to its ability to reduce the backhaul transmission by caching certain content. However, it still takes effort to address the user association and video quality selection problem under the limited resource of MEC to fully support the low-latency demand for live video streaming. We found the optimization problem to be a non-linear integer programming, which is impossible to obtain a globally optimal solution under polynomial time. In this paper, we formulate the problem and derive the closed-form solution in the form of Lagrangian multipliers; the searching of the optimal variables is formulated as a Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) and we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based algorithm exploiting the supply-demand interpretation of the Lagrange dual problem.

This is the first sixth generation (6G) massive MIMO mmWave UAV IS-GBSM that can model the UAV channel space-time non-stationarity, and can describe the impact of some unique UAV-related parameters, e.g., the UAV’s moving direction, height, and speed, on channel statistical properties. To better represent the space-time non-stationarity in UAV scenarios, a novel UAV-related space-time cluster evolution algorithm is developed. The developed algorithm considers the characteristics of UAV communications on the modeling of space-time non-stationarity. Based on the proposed model, some channel statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated, including the space-time-frequency correlation function, Doppler power spectral density, envelope level crossing rate, and average fade duration. Some numerical results and interesting observations are given, and the impact of UAV-related parameters on channel statistical properties is explored, which can provide assistance for the design of 6G massive MIMO mmWave UAV communication systems. Finally, the applicability of the proposed model is verified by the close agreement between simulation results and measurement.}

	abstract = {The cybersecurity breaches expose surveillance video streams to forgery attacks, under which authentic streams are falsified to hide unauthorized activities. Traditional video forensics approaches can localize forgery traces using spatial-temporal analysis on relatively long video clips, while falling short in real-time forgery detection. The recent work correlates time-series camera and wireless signals to detect looped videos but cannot realize fine-grained forgery localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Secure-Pose, which exploits the pervasive coexistence of surveillance and Wi-Fi infrastructures to defend against video forgery attacks in a real-time and fine-grained manner. We observe that coexisting camera and Wi-Fi signals convey common human semantic information and forgery attacks on video streams will decouple such information correspondence. Particularly, retrievable human pose features are first extracted from concurrent video and Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) streams. Then, a lightweight detection network is developed to accurately discover forgery attacks and an efficient localization algorithm is devised to seamlessly track forgery traces in video streams. We implement Secure-Pose using one Logitech camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it in different environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of 98.7% and localizes abnormal objects under playback and tampering attacks.}

In this paper, we consider non-cooperative multi-UAV scenarios, in which multiple UAVs need to fly from initial locations to destinations, while satisfying collision avoidance, wireless connectivity, and kinematic constraints. We aim to find trajectories for the UAVs with the goal to minimize their mission completion time. We first formulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem as a sequential decision making problem. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to obtain values given the agent’s joint state (including the agent’s information, the nearby agents’ observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). A signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-prediction neural network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs’ locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV’s SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.}

Since the communications in the first and second hops are kinds of single-user and multi-user communications, respectively the AS is done as optimal TAS/MRC or JTRAS is applied in the first hop while the suboptimal majority-based TAS/MRC or JTRAS is employed in the second hop. For both TAS/MRC and JTRAS schemes, the OP expressions are derived in single closed-form over Nakagami- {m}\nfading channels in the practical and ideal cases. Moreover, in the practical case, the lower bound OP expressions are found and at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, the OP reaches an error floor value, which means zero-diversity order. In the ideal case, asymptotic OP expressions are obtained in high SNR regime and demonstrate achievable non-zero diversity and array gains. Finally, through simulations and software-defined radio-based real-time tests, the accuracy of theoretical analysis is validated.}

	abstract = {We propose a full-duplex cooperative rate-splitting (FD-CRS) scheme in a downlink two-group multicast system. At the transmitter, two distinct messages requested by the two groups respectively are split and then encoded into one common stream and two private streams, based on the principles of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). The cell-center-users (CCUs) in one group decode the common stream and their own private stream successively, then cooperatively form a distributed beamformer to assist the cell-edge-users (CEUs) in common stream transmission. To make full utilization of the time resources during cooperation, all the CCUs operate in FD mode to enable information receiving and forwarding simultaneously. Moreover, since it is unfair to sacrifice the cooperator’ energy to forward, each CCU is enabled to harvest energy from the received signal by adopting power-splitting protocol. With the objective of minimizing the system transmission power while guaranteeing all the groups’ target rates, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly design the beamformers, message splitting and power-splitting ratio. We reformulate the non-convex problem by using the difference of convex (DC) programming, and then propose an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation to solve it to obtain a local minimum. Further, a robust algorithm combining the semi-positive definite relaxation (SDR) technique and penalty function method is developed for the case with imperfect channel state information. Although our proposed FD-CRS scheme adopts the seemingly energy-wasting wireless power transfer technique, the simulation results still confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme, i.e., it outperforms the other baseline schemes in terms of power consumption under various user deployment, network loads and target rates. That is attributed to the comprehensive utilization of FD cooperation gain, spatial multiplexing gain as well as power multiplexing gain.}

In this paper, we investigate a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving a single-antenna user with the help of a multi-element IRS in a multi-cell network with inter-cell interference. We consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the BS, i.e., imperfect CSIT, and focus on the robust optimization of the BS’s instantaneous CSI-adaptive beamforming and the IRS’s quasi-static phase shifts in two scenarios. In the scenario of coding over many slots, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the user’s ergodic rate. In the scenario of coding within each slot, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the user’s average goodput under the successful transmission probability constraints. The robust optimization problems are challenging two-timescale stochastic non-convex problems. In both scenarios, we obtain closed-form robust beamforming designs for any given phase shifts and more tractable stochastic non-convex approximate problems only for the phase shifts. Besides, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each of the stochastic problems for the phase shifts. It is worth noting that the proposed methods offer closed-form robust instantaneous CSI-adaptive beamforming designs which can promptly adapt to rapid CSI changes over slots and robust quasi-static phase shift designs of low computation and phase adjustment costs in the presence of imperfect CSIT and inter-cell interference. Numerical results further demonstrate the notable gains of the proposed robust joint designs over existing ones and reveal the practical values of the proposed solutions.}

However, a truly fair comparison with its direct concurrent and widely used Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation has not yet been provided. In this paper, we present such a fair comparison between the two digital modulation formats in terms of achievable communication rate. In this context, we explicitly address the problem of channel estimation by considering, for each modulation, a pilot scheme and the associated channel estimation algorithm specifically adapted to sparse channels in the Doppler-delay domain, targeting the optimization of the pilot overhead to maximize the overall achievable rate. In our achievable rate analysis we consider also the presence of a guard interval or cyclic prefix. The results are supported by numerical simulations, for different time-frequency selective channels including multiple scattering components and under non-perfect channel state information resulting from the considered pilot schemes. This work does not claim to establish in a fully definitive way which is the best modulation format, since such choice depends on many other features which are outside the scope of this work (e.g., legacy, intellectual property, ease and know-how for implementation, and many other criteria). Nevertheless, we provide the foundations to properly compare multi-carrier communication systems in terms of their information theoretic achievable rate potential, within meaningful and sensible assumptions on the channel models and on the receiver complexity (both in terms of channel estimation and in terms of soft-output symbol detection).}

To avoid a long decoding delay, we consider a sliding NC (SNC) design that allows a highly reliable transmission of each data packet with a guaranteed decoding delay. A few design examples are derived and their decoding error rates are analyzed. Through the analysis, we can show that the decoding error rate of SNC is much lower than that of\nK\n-repetition at the same spectral efficiency, which means a more reliable transmission can be achieved using SNC than\nK\n-repetition.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an attractive paradigm for making use of rich distributed data while protecting data privacy. Nonetheless, non-ideal communication links and limited transmission resources may hinder the implementation of fast and accurate FL. In this paper, we study joint optimization of communications and FL based on analog aggregation transmission in realistic wireless networks. We first derive closed-form expressions for the expected convergence rate of FL over the air, which theoretically quantify the impact of analog aggregation on FL. Based on the analytical results, we develop a joint optimization model for accurate FL implementation, which allows a parameter server to select a subset of workers and determine an appropriate power scaling factor. Since the practical setting of FL over the air encounters unobservable parameters, we reformulate the joint optimization of worker selection and power allocation using controlled approximation. Finally, we efficiently solve the resulting mixed-integer programming problem via a simple yet optimal finite-set search method by reducing the search space. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions developed for realistic wireless analog channels outperform a benchmark method, and achieve comparable performance of the ideal case where FL is implemented over error-free wireless channels.}

	abstract = {With the very stringent demand for real-time transmission of wireless communication services, the requirement of sub-millisecond ultra-low end-to-end delay has been initially proposed in the sixth generation (6G) communication networks. Finite blocklength transmission is one of the potential technologies to meet such a low end-to-end delay demand for the next generation networks. However, as the finite blocklength decreases, the transmission delay decreases while the queuing delay increases, which results in the tradeoff between the transmission delay and the queuing delay. To achieve the optimal balance, in this paper we propose an adaptive blocklength transmission framework to minimize the important part of the end-to-end delay of wireless networks, where we focus on the transmission delay and queuing delay. A dynamic buffering model for variable transmission time interval (V-TTI) is introduced for the time-varying arrival of packets adaptation. Then, we propose the Flexible proximal Alternating direction method of multipliers based Blocklength Optimization (FaBo) scheme to minimize the important part of the end-to-end delay for the single user case. We also propose the Multiple deep Q-learning network based Resource Allocation (MuRa) scheme, which can efficiently balance the transmission delay and queuing delay, to minimize the important part of the end-to-end delay for the multi-user case. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive blocklength framework can reduce the important part of the end-to-end delay compared with that of long-term evolution and the fifth generation (5G) new radio. We also show that our proposed schemes can quickly converge to the minimum end-to-end delay.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with huge-capacity batteries could be employed to wirelessly charge the ground sensor users (GSUs) and enhance the coverage of aerial wireless networks in outdoor Internet of Things (IoT). This paper investigates the information and energy coverage of UAV-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) networks. Both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receiver architectures are considered. By using stochastic geometry approach, the general and explicit expressions of the information coverage probability (ICP), the energy coverage probability (ECP) and the joint information and energy coverage probability (JIECP) are derived under the nonlinear and linear energy harvesting (EH) models, respectively. Particularly, the Laplace transform and the probability generating functional (PGFL) are used to derive the ICP. And, Campbell’s theorem and the maximum function are applied to obtain the ECP and the JIECP, respectively. To achieve the optimal UAVs’ deployment density, the maximization optimization problems are formulated for the PS-based and TS-based systems, respectively. By using the series expansion of\nQ(x)\n(\nQ\n-function) with large\nx\n, the closed-form approximating optimal solutions to the formulated problems are obtained. Monte Carlo simulations validate the correction of our obtained theoretical results, and numerical results show that the performance of the PS-based system is superior to that of the TS-based one. Moreover, when the energy requirement of GSUs or the transmit power of UAVs is relatively large, or when the information requirement of GSUs or the UAV deployment density is relatively small, compared with the nonlinear EH model, the analysis bias caused by traditional linear EH model is relatively large and in these cases, traditional linear EH model cannot be used to replace the nonlinear EH one for the system performance analysis or optimal system design.}

We derive an expression for the maximum likelihood (ML) detector of a differentially encoded phase information symbol received by a base station operating in the low-resolution ADC regime. We also present an equal performing reduced complexity receiver for detecting the phase information. To increase the supported data rate, we also present a maximum likelihood expression to detect differential amplitude phase shift keying symbols with low-resolution ADCs. We note that the derived detectors are unable to detect the amplitude information. To overcome this limitation, we use the Bussgang Theorem and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to develop two detectors capable of detecting the amplitude information. We numerically show that while the first amplitude detector requires multiple quantization bits for acceptable performance, similar performance can be achieved using one-bit ADCs by grouping the receive antennas and employing variable quantization levels (VQL) across distinct antenna groups. We validate the performance of the proposed detectors through simulations and show a comparison with corresponding coherent detectors. Finally, we present a complexity analysis of the proposed low-resolution differential detectors.}

	abstract = {With the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), we witness the explosive growth in the number of devices with sensing, computing, and communication capabilities, along with a large amount of raw data generated at the network edge. Mobile (multi-access) edge computing (MEC), acquiring and processing data at network edge (like base station (BS)) via wireless links, has emerged as a promising technique for real-time applications. In this paper, we consider the scenario that multiple devices sense then offload data to an edge server/BS, and the offloading throughput maximization problems are studied by joint radio-and-computation resource allocation, based on time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multiuser computation offloading. Particularly, we take the sequence of TDMA-based multiuser transmission/offloading into account. The studied problems are NP-hard and non-convex. A set of low-complexity algorithms are designed based on decomposition approach and exploration of valuable insights of problems. They are either optimal or can achieve close-to-optimal performance as shown by simulation. The comprehensive simulation results show that the sequence-optimized TDMA scheme achieves better throughput performance than the NOMA scheme, while the NOMA scheme is better under the assumptions of time-sharing strategy and the identical sensing capability of the devices.}

	abstract = {An irregular tiled array technique is proposed for the application of massive MIMO systems, where the uniformly spaced antenna array elements are irregularly divided into subarrays fed by only one radio frequency (RF) chain separately. As compared to conventional beamforming architecture, the number of RF chains is reduced to one-half or one-quarter of the original number by using domino-shaped subarrays or tetromino-shaped subarrays, respectively. Two beamforming architectures for such a framework are proposed and a minimum mean square error (MMSE) method is applied to design the layouts of irregular arrays efficiently. In the framework of single-user massive MIMO systems, numerical simulation results show that the proposed architectures outperform conventional beamforming architectures and antenna selection architecture under the same number of RF chains conditions. With saving half of the transceivers, the loss of gain of the state-of-the-art sparsely sampled array is 1.9dB in the broadside and 2.2 dB for scanning to 30° in comparison with reference array (i.e., one transceiver per element). By contrast, there is no loss of gain of domino-shaped irregular array (i.e., one transceiver per two elements) in the broadside as compared to reference array and the loss of gain will be about 1.5dB for scanning to 30°.}

	abstract = {Energy saving for mobile devices is considered to be one of prospective benefits of mobile edge computing (MEC) networks, where computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded from the mobile devices to their associated MEC servers for execution. Extra energy consumption for data migration should therefore be less than the energy consumption for local execution. However, in multi-cell MEC-assisted networks, due to both the presence of co-channel interference and the latency requirement of each offloading task, power control is tightly coupled with computation offloading, which becomes an obstacle to achieve the aim of energy saving. In this paper, we develop an analytic model to decouple power control and computation resource allocation from each other, in which the transmission power can be considered as a solution to a set of linear equations with a coefficient matrix depending on the computation resource budget. Based on this analytic foundation, we show that with a fixed offloading decision, the joint power control and computation resource allocation problem is invex, which ensures that every KKT (Karush–Kuhn–Tucker) stationary point of the problem must be a global minimizer. Moreover, we deduce a criterion for energy-efficient offloading decision making from the partial derivative of the total energy consumption of mobile devices with respect to the computation resource budget. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithms to jointly optimizing power and computation resource allocation, and offloading decision. The numerical results demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the power allocation at each time slot for energy-harvesting sensors in an IoT system, where each sensor transmits its observation via a coherent multiple access channel, and thus the observation vector received at the fusion center (FC) becomes a compressed version of the original observations. Our goal is to minimize the number of transmissions required by the high-fidelity reconstruction of the original observations in the FC. In this scenario, the power allocation, coupling with the channel effect, constitute an effective measurement matrix in compressive sensing. Because its performance decides the requirement on the number of transmissions, the goal can be achieved through constructing the measurement matrix as good as possible, or equivalently, solving the power optimization allocation problem, subject to the available energy constraints at each sensor. However, the sensors can only obtain unreliable and intermittent available energy, so that the traditional performance metric, i.e., mutual coherence (MC), of the measurement matrix cannot be directly used to guide the optimization, because an “equal-norm columns” assumption is implicitly required, but not satisfied in our scenario due to the available energy constraints. Moreover, this optimization problem is also non-convex. To overcome these obstacles, we first carry out a distortion analysis based on the generalized MC, which abandons the “equal-norm columns” assumption. The theoretical results indicate that the measurement matrix construction can be formulated as an optimization problem that not only minimizes the MC, but also minimizes the maximum and maximizes the minimum of the column norms of the effective matrix. We further transform this problem into a sequence of surrogate convex problems and iteratively find the solution. Numerical results show that the proposed framework improves the tradeoffs between reconstruction accuracy and the number of transmissions over various power allocation strategies. In some cases, where other strategies achieve a probability of exact recovery of below 0.7, the proposed framework can achieve a more than 0.9 probability.}

For quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels and the finite-blocklength regime, we derive the approximate closed-form expressions of the end-to-end (e2e) block error rate (BLER) for the TAS/MRC, TAS/SC, and MRT/MRC schemes. The asymptotic performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime is derived, from which the comparison among diversity schemes in terms of the diversity order, e2e BLER loss, and SNR gap is provided. Furthermore, based on the asymptotic results, we develop power-allocation, relay-location, and joint simplified optimizations to minimize the asymptotic e2e BLER under the system constraints. The e2e latency and throughputs are also analyzed for the considered schemes. The correctness of our analysis is confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) has emerged as a spectrum and energy-efficient communication paradigm for future passive Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider a multiuser multi- backscatter-device (BD) SR communication system to enhance the spectrum efficiency, by sharing a common time-frequency resource block. Due to the presence of inter-user and inter-BD interference, multiuser and multi-BD detection in the receiver design become much more challenging. Concretely, the detection problem involves several key components: direct-link channel estimation, backscatter-link channel estimation, user signal decoding, and BD symbol detection. A conventional way is to realise these components in two separate phases, in which a channel estimation phase is followed by a data decoding phase. However, channel state information (CSI) acquisition is very difficult for the multiuser multi-BD SR communication, as compared to the case of orthogonal multiple access. In addition, the backscatter-link is relatively weak, which further increases the difficulty of CSI acquisition. To address these issues, we propose a novel receiver design to perform joint channel estimation, user data decoding, and BD symbol detection. Based on the factor graph representation of the joint estimation problem, we design a message-passing receiver for the multiuser multi-BD SR system to iteratively refine the estimation outputs. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receiver design.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory optimization problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided wireless communication. Existing works mainly rely on the kinematic equations for UAV’s mobility modeling, while its dynamic equations are usually missing. As a result, the planned UAV trajectories are piece-wise line segments in general, which may be difficult to implement in practice. By leveraging the concept of state-space model, a control-based UAV trajectory design is proposed in this paper, which takes into account both of the UAV’s kinematic equations and the dynamic equations. Consequently, smooth trajectories that are amenable to practical implementation can be obtained. Moreover, the UAV’s controller design is achieved along with the trajectory optimization, where practical roll angle and pitch angle constraints are considered. Furthermore, a new energy consumption model is derived for quad-rotor UAVs, which is based on the voltage and current flows of the electric motors and thus captures both the consumed energy for motion and the energy conversion efficiency of the motors. Numerical results are provided to validate the derived energy consumption model and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.}

In this paper, we study a wireless powered time-division duplex (TDD) multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system, where the base station (BS) has its own power supply and all users can harvest radio frequency (RF) energy from the BS. We aim to maximize the users’ information rates by jointly optimizing the duration of users’ time slots and the signal covariance matrices of the BS and users. Different to the commonly used sum rate and max-min rate criteria, the proportional fairness of users’ rates is considered in the objective function. We first study the ideal case with the perfect channel state information (CSI), and show that the non-convex proportionally fair rate optimization problem can be transformed into an equivalent convex optimization problem. Then we consider practical systems with imperfect CSI, where the CSI mismatch follows a Gaussian distribution. A chance-constrained robust system design is proposed for this scenario, where the Bernstein inequality is applied to convert the chance constraints into the convex constraints. Finally, we consider a more general case where only partial knowledge of the CSI mismatch is available. In this case, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method is applied to solve the distributionally robust system rate optimization problem. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {LoRaWAN is one of the most employed systems among the Low Power Wide Area Networks. An open problem for the LoRaWAN system is the receiver’s overall synchronization, including the detection of the start of the LoRaWAN packet and the correction of the carrier frequency offset and time offset. The implementation of such a subsystem in currently available chipsets for LoRaWAN is not known. This paper provides a description of a new synchronization subsystem for a LoRaWAN receiver in realistic scenarios, considering the usual operating regions (in terms, for example, of Signal-to-Noise Ratio, maximum carrier frequency offset, and allowed Packet Error Rate). The ambiguity of the effects of the time offset and the carrier frequency offset on the LoRaWAN preamble are established analytically. Different options for the synchronization subsystem are provided, one of which is particularly suited if the requirements on the maximum frequency offset are those set for off–the–shelf chipsets. The performance of the proposed synchronization subsystem and the start of the packet detection algorithm is evaluated through a campaign of simulations. The results confirm that the proposed subsystem meets all of the requirements for successful demodulation and detection of the data part following the preamble.}

	abstract = {Communication limitation at the edge is widely recognized as a major bottleneck for federated learning (FL). Multi-hop wireless networking provides a cost-effective solution to enhance service coverage and spectrum efficiency at the edge, which could facilitate large-scale and efficient machine learning (ML) model aggregation. However, FL over multi-hop wireless networks has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we optimize FL over wireless mesh networks by taking into account the heterogeneity in communication and computing resources at mesh routers and clients. We present a framework that each intermediate router performs in-network model aggregation before sending the data to the next hop, so as to reduce the outgoing data traffic and hence aggregate more models under limited communication resources. To accelerate model training, we formulate our optimization problem by jointly considering model aggregation, routing, and spectrum allocation. Although the problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, we transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and develop a coarse-grained fixing procedure to solve it efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution approach, and the superiority of the in-network aggregation scheme over the counterpart without in-network aggregation.}

To improve the spectrum efficiency, uniform planar arrays are equipped at the UAVs and users for compensation of the high path loss and for mitigation of interference. We formulate a problem to jointly optimize the UAV positioning, user clustering, and hybrid analog-digital beamforming (BF) for the maximization of user achievable sum rate (ASR), subject to a minimum rate constraint for each user. Since the problem is highly non-convex and involves high-dimensional variable matrices and combinatorial programming variables, we develop a suboptimal solution via alternating optimization, successive convex optimization, and combinatorial optimization. First, we design the UAV positioning and user clustering under the assumption of ideal beam patterns, which significantly decouples the UAV positioning and directional BF. Then, the transmit and receive BF variables are successively optimized to approach the ideal beam patterns. Our simulation results verify the convergence and superiority of the proposed algorithm. Significant performance gains can be obtained compared to some benchmark schemes in terms of the ASR, and the proposed hybrid BF solution closely approaches a performance bound given by fully-digital BF.}

	abstract = {A systematic and general method for obtaining orthogonal far-field radiation patterns using any electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) embedded in a propagation environment with an arbitrary power angular spectrum (PAS) is described. The method is useful in designing single-RF multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems where the orthogonal patterns can be utilized as a basis set for beamspace MIMO. The method utilizes the correlation matrix of the open-circuit radiation patterns and is termed the pattern correlation decomposition method (PCDM). PCDM is applicable to any antenna type (including realistic antennas with losses), array configuration, PAS and overcomes the limitations of previously proposed techniques. PCDM also provides closed-form solutions for the antenna currents to generate the orthogonal patterns. It also provides an estimate of the effective aerial degrees-of-freedom of the ESPAR. In addition, efficient optimization approaches to finding the optimal reactive loads that excite the required orthogonal radiation patterns are provided. Simulation examples using a 5-element and a 8-element planar inverted-F antenna array including material losses in various PAS are provided. These show that the proposed approach increases system capacity by up to 7 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduces the required transmit power by up to 73% compared with previous approaches.}

	abstract = {In cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and internet-of-things applications, various sensor-actuator pairs are deployed for control purposes which require timely online communication. The sensors are measuring information about the CPS, e.g., process systems, whereas the actuators are using the information to take control actions. These sensor-actuator pairs usually communicate via the same wireless medium and thus their transmissions need to be scheduled in time. When transmitting the process data, a short blocklength source-channel coding approach is employed to reduce data errors. We investigate the influence of the decision policy consisting of communication parameters and scheduling design on data freshness and accuracy of process monitoring systems. An age-of-information (AoI) metric is used to assess data timeliness, while the mean square error (MSE) is used to assess the precision of the predicted process values. We characterize the AoI and MSE with closed-form expressions for the blocklengths and accuracy levels, for special types of scheduling strategies, namely, round-robin and maximum-age scheduling. We optimize the coding strategies by showing an achievability region of AoI and MSE. Other priority-based scheduling policies are also investigated. It is shown that the maximum-age policy provides excellent results in terms of AoI, while priority-based scheduling performs better in terms of MSE.}

	abstract = {Indoor location-based services (LBS) are widely used in large-scale indoor buildings, such as high-rise hospitals and multi-story shopping malls. At the same time, location privacy protection in such three-dimensional (3D) space has recently attracted considerable attention. Currently, most existing location privacy protection schemes focus on two-dimensional (2D) location protection and fail to prevent location inference attacks when the user’s location data include height dimension, i.e., 3D geolocation. Enlightened by the concept of differential privacy, in this paper we first study the impact factors of the degree of indistinguishability of 3D geolocations. Then, we quantify location privacy for LBS applications in the 3D space with geo-indistinguishability (3D-GI) rigorously and provably. We develop a mechanism of three-variates Laplacian to generate perturbed locations considering the locations’ X, Y, and Z-coordinates simultaneously, guaranteeing geo-indistinguishability. Furthermore, the discretization noise-adding mechanism is studied to satisfy geo-indistinguishability in the 3D space under the finite precision of hardware/devices. Considering the discretized mechanism can only satisfy geo-indistinguishability in finite 3D space and users visit the limited regions, we further study the truncation of the Laplacian mechanism to limit the generated perturbed locations within a specific region. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3D-GI outperforms the benchmarks while guaranteeing privacy regardless of the adversary’s prior knowledge.}

Single and double phase shifter-based analog radio frequency (RF) precoder/combiner strategies are proposed that are based on dissimilar beam squint awareness assumptions. The digital precoding/combining stage is implemented using centralized designs maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and relying on the uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) duality enabled by the time division duplex (TDD) protocol and the use of either phase shift-aware minimum mean square error (MMSE) or phase shift-unaware linear MMSE (LMMSE) channel estimators. The performance of the proposed beam squint-aware hybrid beamforming strategies is assessed through extensive numerical simulations under different scenarios. Numerical results show that beam squint-aware designs outperform the beam squint-unaware strategies, specially in typical wideband cell free mmWave massive MIMO-OFDM scenarios where a combination of a very high carrier frequency, a large system bandwidth, and a large-scale antenna array causes the spatial-wideband effect.}

We consider a network with multiple transmitters and receivers where each transmitter has specific information it needs to send to a set of receiving nodes. First, we conduct some structural analysis and show that the achievable sum-rate is maximized when each transmitter only transmits to a single receiver at a given time. Next, we consider one instance of the flexible network and by reducing the symmetric multiple receiver network to a single receiver network, we also show that the achievable sum-rate is maximized when either one transmitter or all the transmitters transmit. In fact, there exists a unique received signal-to-noise ratio at which the optimality changes from all-to-one. Finally, we design a novel low-cost algorithm that gives a sub-optimal solution to the achievable sum-rate maximization problem in a flexible half-duplex network. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of the proposed algorithm with respect to existing resource allocation techniques, and observe that our proposed algorithm provides significant sum-rate gains.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dynamic IRS beamforming framework to boost the sum throughput of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN). Specifically, the IRS phase-shift vectors across time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance the efficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink wireless information transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP) and multiple wirelessly powered devices. To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming, namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming , by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {A massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system can bring substantial improvement in spectral and energy efficiency for wireless communication systems. The high array gain and fine spatial resolution allow the utilization of relatively simple processing at the base station, such as the near-optimal regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. Nevertheless, such precoding schemes require computing the inverse and multiplication of matrices, which leads to a large burden for baseband processing when the system dimension grows large. To take full advantage of the spatial sparsity of massive MIMO channels in the finite scattering environment, we propose a virtual channel precoding strategy that directly utilizes the sparse virtual channel representation (VCR) in precoding. Furthermore, we develop a virtual channel RZF precoding algorithm based on the pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method, namely PCG-VC-RZF, which can directly use the sparse virtual channel matrix while avoiding the complex computation of the Gram matrix. The computational complexity and transmission delay are shown to be reduced tremendously by the proposed algorithm when operating in a large-dimension system. We further provide a beam selection strategy for improving the performance of the proposed approach under a complexity constraint. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed precoding scheme.}

	abstract = {Neighbor discovery on duty-cycled mobile devices in group settings arises in many applications. In such scenarios, it is sufficient for an arbitrary node in a group to discover a new node. While pairwise neighbor discovery schemes can be directly applied to group settings, their performance can be severely limited as they are not designed to coordinate the efforts of group members. Explicit coordination among the group members, however, can incur large overhead in mobile networks, where the group membership changes dynamically over time. In this paper, we focus on schemes that require no explicit communication among the group members, and nodes follow deterministic schedules that can be succinctly represented. We first define the notion of ideal duty cycle for a group, and then develop two deterministic neighbor discovery schemes for group settings, and show that both of them achieve effective duty cycle close to the ideal duty cycle. In addition, we show that the schemes are lightweight and easy to implement using experiments in a testbed. Last, we use a case study to demonstrate the usage of our proposed schemes and show that a simple enhancement leveraging the deterministic nature of the schemes leads to significant performance improvement, at the cost of only slight extra overhead.}

	abstract = {Antenna selection is capable of reducing the hardware complexity of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks at the cost of certain performance degradation. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective technique that can enhance the spectrum-efficiency of wireless networks by reconfiguring the propagation environment. By employing RIS to compensate for the performance loss due to antenna selection, in this paper we propose a new network architecture, i.e., RIS-assisted massive MIMO system with antenna selection, to enhance the system performance while enjoying a low hardware cost. This is achieved by maximizing the channel capacity via joint antenna selection and passive beamforming while taking into account the cardinality constraint of active antennas and the unit-modulus constraints of all RIS elements. However, the formulated problem turns out to be highly intractable due to the non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, for which an alternating optimization framework is provided, yielding antenna selection and passive beamforming subproblems. The computationally efficient submodular optimization algorithms are developed to solve the antenna selection subproblem under different channel state information assumptions. The iterative algorithms based on block coordinate descent are further proposed for the passive beamforming design by exploiting the unique problem structures. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are feasible to any finite number of antennas, and thus can be applicable in both ordinary MIMO and massive MIMO settings. Experimental results will demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and desirable performance of the proposed algorithms for RIS-assisted massive MIMO systems with antenna selection.}

We jointly optimize the active beamforming matrices at the access point (AP) and uplink users, and the passive beamforming matrix at the IRS to maximize the weighted sum-rate of the system. Since it is practically difficult to acquire the channel state information (CSI) for IRS-related links due to its passive operation and large number of elements, we conceive a mixed-timescale beamforming scheme. Specifically, the high-dimensional passive beamforming matrix at the IRS is updated based on the channel statistics while the active beamforming matrices are optimized relied on the low-dimensional real-time effective CSI at each time slot. We propose an efficient stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA)-based algorithm for jointly designing the active and passive beamforming matrices. Moreover, due to the high computational complexity caused by the matrix inversion computation in the SSCA-based optimization algorithm, we further develop a deep-unfolding neural network (NN) to address this issue. The proposed deep-unfolding NN maintains the structure of the SSCA-based algorithm but introduces a novel non-linear activation function and some learnable parameters induced by the first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the matrix inversion. In addition, we develop a black-box NN as a benchmark. Simulation results show that the proposed mixed-timescale algorithm outperforms the existing single-timescale algorithm and the proposed deep-unfolding NN approaches the performance of the SSCA-based algorithm with much reduced computational complexity when deployed online.}

	abstract = {Fluid antenna system represents an emerging technology that enables an antenna to switch its physical location in a predefined space. This paper explores the potential of using a single fluid antenna at each mobile user for multiple access, which we refer to it as fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA). FAMA exploits spatial moments of deep fade suffered by the interference to achieve a favourable channel condition for the desired signal, without requiring sophisticated signal processing. We analyze the FAMA network by first deriving the outage probability of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in a double integral form. We then obtain an outage probability upper bound in closed form and an average outage rate lower bound for the FAMA system, with an arbitrary number of interferers, from which the multiplexing gain of FAMA is characterized. We also estimate how large the number of locations is required to achieve a given multiplexing gain using fluid antennas with a given size. Results show that it is possible for FAMA to support hundreds of users using only one fluid antenna of a few wavelengths of space at each user, giving rise to significant gain in the average network outage rate.}

	abstract = {Rate-splitting (RS) has recently been recognized as a promising physical-layer technique for multi-antenna broadcast channels (BC). Due to its ability to partially decode the interference and partially treat the remaining interference as noise, RS is an enabler for a powerful multiple access, namely rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), that has been shown to achieve higher spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) than both space division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in a wide range of user deployments and network loads. As SE maximization and EE maximization are two conflicting objectives in the moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, the study of the tradeoff between the two criteria is of particular interest. In this work, we address the SE-EE tradeoff by studying the joint SE and EE maximization problem of RSMA in multiple input single output (MISO) BC with rate-dependent circuit power consumption at the transmitter. To tackle the challenges coming from multiple objective functions and rate-dependent circuit power consumption, we first propose two models to transform the original problem into two single-objective problems, namely, weighted-sum method and weighted-power method. A low-complexity algorithm with closed-form solution is proposed to solve each single-objective problem in the two-user system. For the generalized\nK\n-user system, a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is then proposed to optimize the precoders of each transformed problem. Numerical results show that our algorithm converges much faster than existing algorithms. In addition, the performance of RSMA is superior to or equal to SDMA and NOMA in terms of SE, EE and their tradeoff.}

Particularly, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose the fully dynamic IRS beamforming , where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless information transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and implementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming . For the former case, two different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT, respectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to be applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed for both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC case by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of IRS for enhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, especially with fully dynamic IRS beamforming, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN is able to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart with half-duplex when the self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.}

In this paper, we propose an approach named joint multi-branch weighted combining and equalization detector (JMWC-ED) where all inter-node links are independent frequency selective fading channels, and present the corresponding performance analysis. Compared with the existing approaches, in the JMWC-ED, the adjustment of weighted combining for all branches and the equalization of each branch are synthesized into an integrated detector. The weighted combining of multiple branches and the adjustment of the tap coefficient vector of each branch are not independent of each other, but are implemented jointly. Moreover, the weighted coefficients of all branches are adaptively adjusted in accordance with the corresponding channel qualities, and there is no need to know the channel state informations between nodes. Simulation results validate the adjustment ability of the JMWC-ED to weighted coefficients and the performance analysis for the JMWC-ED. We also show the superior performance of the JMWC-ED over existent counterparts.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a nonlinear MIMO scheme named as halved-phase only MIMO (HPO-MIMO), whose base station (BS) is equipped with multiple HPO radio-frequency (RF) chains extracting\nπ\n-periodic phase measurements from RF signals directly by phase detectors, and single classical RF chain sampling the combination of all the RF signals from HPO-RF chains. Compared to MIMO, HPO-RF receivers are simplified significantly, and have much lower power consumption and fabrication cost. Two types of channel estimators and multiuser detectors are developed for HPO-MIMO from the perspectives of numerical optimization and Bayesian inference. Firstly, because\nπ\n-periodic phases provide tan-relationships between the Inphase (I) and Quadrature (Q) components, the channel estimation (CE) and multiuser detection (MUD) problems are resolved by minimizing\nl\n2\n-norm cost functions with unit-norm constraint on the recovered vector. Their solutions are obtained by deriving the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue through shifted power method (SPW). Secondly, the CE and MUD problems are categorized as generalized linear mixing problems under (un-)quantized\nπ\n-periodic phase measurements, and then handled by generalized approximate message passing (GAMP), where closed-form solutions for mean-and-variance messages involving\nπ\n-periodic phases are derived. Finally, magnitude and\nπ\n-phase ambiguities persisting in signal recovery are removed based on the complex-valued full measurements from the single classical RF chain. Simulation results show that GAMP-type algorithms outperform SPW-type ones, and handle nonlinear phase quantization losses. 16-sector quantized HPO-MIMO could work as well as its un-quantized correspondence. HPO-MIMO reserves the MIMO advantages, but is more energy-efficient than the latter.}

	abstract = {Due to their beautiful aperiodic correlation properties and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), Golay complementary pairs (GCPs) and complementary sequence sets (CSSs) have been well studied. However, conventional GCPs and CSSs can only adapt to contiguous spectral resource allocation in wireless communication systems, and it is difficult for them to be compatible with non-contiguous resource allocation. Inspired by recent constructions of non-contiguous GCPs given by Şahin and Yang, we propose a new construction of non-contiguous GCPs, which can be regarded as an extension of Turyn’s construction. Besides, we then propose some constructions of non-contiguous CSSs, which can adapt to flexible resource allocation, having more flexible lengths, and lower time domain cross correlation than non-contiguous GCPs. Finally, we propose a CSS-based physical uplink control channels (PUCCH) scheme for up to 2 uplink control information (UCI) bits. Simulations show that its performance is similar to the GCP-based PUCCH scheme.}

	abstract = {Covert communication considers the ability of transmitter Alice to communicate reliably to receiver Bob without being detected by warden Willie. Previous work has generally considered a discrete-time model, and, in the standard Alice-Bob-Willie scenario, it has been shown that a discrete-time model captures the salient aspects of the underlying continuous-time covert communications system. However, in the presence of a jammer assisting Alice, where it has been shown in previous work that Alice can achieve a positive covert rate on a discrete-time model, we demonstrate here that a straightforward extension of the discrete-time construction to the continuous-time system does not guarantee a positive covert rate, hence indicating that the discrete-time model does not capture the salient aspects of the continuous-time system in such a scenario. This is because Willie is able to exploit excess bandwidth for co-channel interference suppression, as we demonstrate with an interference cancellation receiver. Hence, for the case when Alice is assisted by an uninformed jammer, we consider the continuous-time channel directly and study whether efficient covert communication can still be achieved against any possible receiver that Willie might employ. By presenting and characterizing an approach much different than that suggested by previous work for discrete-time systems in such a scenario, we establish that \\mathcal {O}(WT)\ninformation bits can be transmitted covertly and reliably on a continuous-time channel of asymptotic bandwidth W\nin T\nseconds, regardless of the receiver that Willie employs. This is done for two separate scenarios: 1) when there is perfect frame synchronization between Alice and the jammer’s signals; 2) when there is no frame synchronization between Alice and the jammer’s signals. Numerical results are provided to validate the theory.}

In the near future, wireless body area networks (WBANs) are expected to have widespread impact in medicine. To achieve this impact, however, significant advances in research are needed to cope with the changes of the human body’s state, which make coherent communications difficult or even impossible. In this paper, we consider a realistic noncoherent WBAN system model where transmissions and receptions are conducted without any channel state information due to the fast-varying channels of the human body. Using distributed reception, we propose several symbol detection approaches where on-off keying (OOK) modulation is exploited, among which a supervised-learning-based approach is developed to overcome the noncoherent system issue. Through simulation results, we compare and verify the performance of the proposed techniques for noncoherent WBANs with OOK transmissions. We show that the well-defined detection techniques with a supervised-learning-based approach enable robust communications for noncoherent WBAN systems.}

The trajectory design of the UAV provides an additional degree of freedom to improve the performance of AirComp. We aim to minimize the time-averaged mean-squared error (MSE) of AirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, receive normalizing factors, and sensors’ transmit power. To this end, we first propose a novel and equivalent problem transformation by introducing intermediate variables. This reformulation leads to a convex subproblem when fixing any other two blocks of variables, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle of block coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) techniques. In particular, we derive the optimal closed-form solutions for normalizing factors and intermediate variables optimization subproblems. We also recast the convex trajectory design subproblem into an ADMM form and obtain the closed-form expressions for each variable updating. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a smaller time-averaged MSE while reducing the simulation time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.}

This paper considers an IRS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system, and presents a detailed analysis and optimization framework for the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the downlink transmission over Rician fading channels. Unlike most of the prior works where the active beamformer at the base station (BS) and passive beamformer at the IRS are jointly designed based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a low-complexity transmission protocol where the IRS passive beamforming and BS power allocation coefficient vector are optimized in the large timescale based on the statistical CSI, and the BS transmit beamforming is designed in the small timescale based on only the instantaneous CSI of the effective BS-user channels. Therefore, the channel training overhead in each channel coherence interval under our proposed protocol is independent of the number of IRS reflecting elements, which is in sharp contrast to most of the prior works. By considering maximum-ratio transmit beamforming at the BS, we derive a lower bound of the ergodic WSR in closed-form. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the IRS passive beamforming and BS power allocation coefficient vector for maximizing the ergodic WSR lower bound. Numerical results validate the tightness of our derived WSR bound and show that the proposed scheme outperforms various existing schemes in terms of complexity or capacity performance.}

In this paper, NOMA is applied to improve the random access efficiency in high-density spatially-distributed multi-cell wireless IoT networks, where IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive\np\n-persistent slotted Aloha protocol. To enable a capacity-optimal network, a novel formulation of random channel access management is proposed, in which the transmission probability of each IoT device is tuned to maximize the geometric mean of users’ expected capacity. It is shown that the network optimization objective is high dimensional and mathematically intractable, yet it admits favourable mathematical properties that enable the design of efficient data-driven algorithmic solutions which do not require a priori knowledge of the channel model or network topology. A centralized model-based algorithm and a scalable distributed model-free algorithm, are proposed to optimally tune the transmission probabilities of IoT devices and attain the maximum capacity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms to the optimal solution is further established based on convex optimization and game-theoretic analysis. Extensive simulations demonstrate the merits of the novel formulation and the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {A new Differential Chaos Shift Keying modulation scheme exploiting Chaotic Shape-forming Filter and Sequence Mapping (CSF-SM-DCSK) is being proposed. The new CSF-SM-DCSK system employs a novel sequence mapping rule and includes a data correction module to achieve a good trade-off between the low Bit Error Rate (BER) performance and high transmission rate. It transmits two data streams simultaneously and preserves the simplicity and robustness of DCSK method. Channel one, transmitting a Low Priority Stream (LPS), generates the chaotic carrier by a Chaotic Shape-forming Filter (CSF) at the transmitter and applies a coherent Matched Filter (MF) at the receiver to recover the information. Channel two, transmitting a High Priority Stream (HPS), relies on conventional DCSK modulation, while the reference and information-bearing parts are transmitted simultaneously with orthogonal sine and cosine carriers. This double-stream solution eliminates the need for analog RF delay lines and doubles the data transmission rate. Before feeding the LPS data stream into the modulator, each LPS bit is encoded into a symbol sequence using sequence mapping. This approach, together with the coherent MF reception, equips the LPS channel with an extremely high robustness against channel noise and multipath propagation. To handle every possible redundancy in the received signal and to minimize the possibility of making wrong decisions, a data correction block is also introduced. Initially, a rough estimation of the received HPS DCSK bit is done at the receiver, then this estimation is used to remove the DCSK modulation from the received information-bearing signal. The three inputs of data correction blocks are: (i) the reference and (ii) the information-bearing parts of the received signal in their original form, and (iii) the received information-bearing signal where the DCSK modulation is removed. The data correction block improves the BER performance while the increased channel capacity, enabled by the double-stream approach, improves the spectral efficiency. Analytical expressions are derived to predict the BER performances in additive white Gaussian noise channel for both the LPS and HPS channels. Computer simulations are used to show that the system performance of the CSF-SM-DCSK modulation scheme proposed in this work is superior to that of the already published solutions. In addition to the computer simulations, the new chaos-based wireless communications system has been implemented on a wireless open-access research platform to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and the superiority of CSF-SM-DCSK.}

The heterogeneous optimal deployment of APs and FCs is modeled as an optimization problem with total wireless communication power consumption of the network as its objective function. We consider both static WSNs, where APs and FCs retain their deployed position, and mobile WSNs where APs and FCs can move from their initial deployment to their optimal locations. Based on the derived necessary conditions for the optimal deployment in static WSNs, we propose an iterative algorithm to deploy APs and FCs. In addition, we study the necessary conditions of the optimal movement-efficient deployment in mobile WSNs with constrained movement energy and present iterative algorithms to find such deployments, accordingly. Simulation results show that our proposed deployment algorithms outperform the existing methods in the literature, and achieve a lower total wireless communication power in both static and mobile WSNs.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting/refracting surface (IRS) has recently emerged as a promising solution to reconfigure wireless propagation environment for enhancing the communication performance by tuning passive signal reflection or refraction. In this paper, we study a new IRS-aided high-mobility communication system by employing the intelligent refracting surface with a high-speed vehicle to aid its passenger’s communication with a remote base station (BS). Due to the environment’s random scattering and vehicle’s high mobility, a rapidly time-varying channel is typically resulted between the static BS and fast-moving IRS/user, which renders the channel estimation for IRS with a large number of passive refracting elements more challenging, as compared to that for the conventional slow fading IRS channels with low-mobility users. In order to reap the high IRS passive beamforming gain with low channel training overhead, we propose a new and efficient two-stage transmission protocol to achieve both IRS channel estimation and refraction optimization for data transmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the IRS and user both moving at the same high speed as well as the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant channel between the BS and IRS, the user first estimates the LoS component of the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel in Stage I, based on which IRS passive refraction is designed to maximize the corresponding IRS-refracted channel gain. Then, the user estimates the resultant IRS-refracted channel as well as the non-IRS-refracted channel in Stage II for setting an additional common phase shift at all IRS refracting elements so as to align these two channels for maximizing the overall channel gain for data transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed design can efficiently achieve the full IRS passive beamforming gain in the high-mobility communication scenario, which also converts the overall BS-user channel from fast to slow fading for more reliable transmission. The proposed on-vehicle IRS system is further compared with a baseline scheme of deploying fixed IRSs (intelligent reflecting surfaces) on the roadside to assist high-speed vehicular communications, which achieves significant rate improvement due to its greatly saved channel training time.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the joint multislot design of user scheduling and precoding to minimize the time needed to serve all the users for unicast and multicast transmission in single-cell multiuser MISO downlink systems. In the literature, the joint design of scheduling and precoding is typically undertaken based on feedback from previous slots. In a system with time-varying channels and QoS requirements, joint multislot designs can achieve better performance since they have the flexibility to schedule users over multiple slots and also can split users across slots efficiently. Further, a joint multislot design can provide a feasible solution even when the sequential design fails. In this paper, scheduling is represented by a binary matrix where the rows represent users, columns represent slots and entries represent scheduling of users in the slots. Noticing that the users may not be permuted across slots for time-varying channels, service time needed for scheduling is rendered as the highest column index corresponding to non-zero columns. With the help of binary scheduling matrix, service time minimization is formulated as a structured mixed-Boolean fractional programming. Further, by exploiting the hidden convex-concave structure in the problem, a convex-concave procedure-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Finally, we vindicate the necessity and illustrate the superiority in performance of joint multislot design over the sequential solution through Monte-Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of downlink Coordinated Beamforming for dense fixed-wireless millimeter wave (mmWave) networks under a Centralized/Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) setting. To compensate for the increased mmWave path loss, we consider directional transmissions via antenna array analog beamforming, which leads to a discrete set of available beams. We apply the Lyapunov optimization framework to propose a throughput-optimal policy which explicitly accounts for stochastic traffic and channel fluctuations and dynamically performs joint Base Station-to-user association and analog beam selection. Our model makes minimal assumptions and considers realistic mmWave antenna radiation patterns, while it can be easily extended to include additional MAC and PHY layer controls. Since this flexibility comes at the cost of high computational complexity, we also propose two heuristic policies offering reduced complexity. Their performance is compared against a baseline Round-Robin (RR)-based policy, while a theoretical worst-case performance bound is derived. Extensive simulations show the optimal Lyapunov policy achieving a stable throughput increase of more than 2X per user compared to the RR policy, while the proposed heuristics incur only a 20-30% performance penalty with respect to the optimal Lyapunov policy with 60X-900X computational time savings.}

This paper investigates the feasible signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) region for the multi-cell downlink and uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Within a cell, the signals of different users are multiplexed on a channel with different power levels and successive interference cancellation is applied at the receivers to decode the signals. For the downlink, based on Perron-Frobenius Theory, we first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for an SINR vector to be feasible under a fixed decoding order. Then, a closed-form expression for the feasible SINR region is given by the union of the SINR regions under all possible decoding orders. Following a similar idea, the expression of the feasible SINR region for the uplink is also derived. Furthermore, the duality between the multi-cell downlink and uplink NOMA systems is explored. It is proved that the two systems have same feasible SINR region under dual channels. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm to approximate the SINR region boundary. Simulation results are provided to validate the efficiency of the algorithm and compare the performance with orthogonal multiple access scheme.}

To ease this task, in this paper, we provide a mathematical model to estimate the performance of a LoRaWAN gateway serving a set of devices that may or may not employ confirmed traffic. The model features a set of parameters that can be adjusted to investigate different gateway and end-device configurations, making it possible to carry out a systematic analysis of various trade-offs. The results given by the proposed model are validated through realistic ns-3 simulations that confirm the ability of the model to predict the system performance with high accuracy, and assess the impact of the assumptions made in the model for tractability.}

	abstract = {OFDM-based spatial data focusing (OFDM-SDF) is proposed as a novel means of performing wireless physical layer geocasting, i.e. spatially confined broadcasting. It is shown that this approach overcomes beamforming and directional modulation (DM) limitations by exhibiting higher spatial precision with a reduced number of antennas and offering uncoupled range-angle-dependent focusing. This paper describes the OFDM-SDF system model for multipath channels, including multipath robust equalization, design rules for steering phases and sidelobe mitigation, analytical geocast delivery zone derivation, and optimized symbol mapping. Using density-based clustering of the spatial bit error rate distribution, a procedure for identifying a practical geocast delivery zone and evaluating its precision and connectivity is proposed. OFDM-SDF’s performance and multipath robustness are evaluated through Rice channel simulations as a function of the Rice factor. In particular, it is shown that a 2-antenna OFDM-SDF array matches the radial and angular precision of, respectively, a 6 and 12-antenna DM array in recent literature, while robustness is ensured for 5G small cell channels.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as a key wireless technology to satisfy the need for wireless Terabit-per-second (Tbps) links in 6G systems. The THz band supports very large channel bandwidths with the cost of very high propagation losses. On the one hand, the absorption by water vapor molecules manifests itself in the form of absorption lines that broaden in frequency with distance, resulting into a highly distance-dependent channel bandwidth. On the other hand, the very high spreading or free-space losses require the use of highly directional antennas (DAs) simultaneously in transmission and reception at all times. As with the bandwidth, the beamwidth of such DAs is also related with the transmission distance, and introduces severe synchronization and, correspondingly, delay challenges. These issues become even worse when the system needs to support up to Tbps peak data-rates. The end-to-end (E2E) delay and, correspondingly, effective throughput in multi-hop THz communication networks can drastically suffer if all these peculiarities are not taken into account. In this paper, multi-hop relaying distribution strategies are developed for THz-band communication to minimize the multi-hop E2E delay by considering cross-layer effects between the THz channel, highly DAs, nodes’ buffer and the physical, link and network layers.}

So far, an underlying assumption in most of the existing MU-MISO design has been that all the users use infinite blocklength, so that they can achieve the Shannon capacity. This setup, however, is not suitable considering delay-constrained users whose blocklength tends to be finite. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous setting in MU-MISO systems where delay-constrained users and delay-tolerant users coexist, called a DCTU-MISO network. To maximize the sum spectral efficiency in this system, we present the spectral efficiency for delay-tolerant users and provide a lower bound of the spectral efficiency for delay-constrained users. We consider an optimization problem that maximizes the sum spectral efficiency of delay-tolerant users while satisfying the latency constraint of delay-constrained users, and propose a generalized power iteration (GPI) precoding algorithm that finds a principal precoding vector. Furthermore, we extend a DCTU-MISO network to the multiple time slots scenario and propose a recursive GPI precoding algorithm. In simulation results, we validate proposed methods outperform baseline schemes and present the effect of network parameters on the average sum spectral efficiency.}

This paper considers Cell-Free Massive MIMO systems with the assistance of an RIS for enhancing the system performance under the presence of spatial correlation among the engineered scattering elements of the RIS. Distributed maximum-ratio processing is considered at the access points (APs). We introduce an aggregated channel estimation approach that provides sufficient information for data processing with the main benefit of reducing the overhead required for channel estimation. The considered system is studied by using asymptotic analysis which lets the number of APs and/or the number of RIS elements grow large. A lower bound for the channel capacity is obtained for a finite number of APs and engineered scattering elements of the RIS, and closed-form expressions for the uplink and downlink ergodic net throughput are formulated in terms of only the channel statistics. Based on the obtained analytical frameworks, we unveil the impact of channel correlation, the number of RIS elements, and the pilot contamination on the net throughput of each user. In addition, a simple control scheme for optimizing the configuration of the engineered scattering elements of the RIS is proposed, which is shown to increase the channel estimation quality, and, hence, the system performance. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system design and performance analysis. In particular, the performance benefits of using RISs in Cell-Free Massive MIMO systems are confirmed, especially if the direct links between the APs and the users are of insufficient quality with high probability.}

We formulate a nonlinear mixed-integer program to capture the social cost minimization in the federated learning system.

This paper proposes 3D coordination model for interference management via multi-cell beamforming and signal-level cooperation in multi-antenna UAV networks, and analyzes system performance by deriving semi-closed expression of coverage probability using stochastic geometry. Specifically, UAVs are deployed according to 3D Poisson point process (PPP) with maximum height limit\nL\n, and user-centric cell group selection is considered according to specific signal threshold\nη\nfor interference coordination with the consideration of LOS/NLOS channel conditions. Zero-forcing beamforming and joint transmission is performed within the UAV cluster for interference mitigation with limited channel state information feedback taken account. In addition, considering the irregularity of UAV group, system performance is construed as three scenarios and coverage probability is derived by Gamma approximation with proposed novel coordinate system transformation. Numerical results match well with simulations and provide optimal deployment parameters for UAV deployments, where coverage probability can reach 92% when SIR threshold\nT=0\ndB.}

	abstract = {Accurate and efficient estimation of the high dimensional channels is one of the critical challenges for practical applications of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). In the context of hybrid analog-digital (HAD) transceivers, channel estimation becomes even more complicated due to information loss caused by limited radio-frequency chains. The conventional compressive sensing (CS) algorithms usually suffer from unsatisfactory performance and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) based framework for uplink channel estimation in HAD massive MIMO systems. To better exploit the sparsity structure of channels in the angular domain, a novel angular space segmentation method is proposed, where the entire angular space is segmented into many small regions and a dedicated neural network is trained offline for each region. During online testing, the most suitable network is selected based on the information from the global positioning system. Inside each neural network, the region-specific measurement matrix and channel estimator are jointly optimized, which not only improves the signal measurement efficiency, but also enhances the channel estimation capability. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CS algorithms in terms of estimation performance and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) for the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to support a large number of devices/users for short packet transmissions with low complexity and low energy consumption. By utilizing the simple while efficient noncoherent energy-based transmission scheme, this work aims to jointly detect the user activity and the desired data for mMTC. First, by exploiting the sparse characteristics of the user activity, approximation message passing (AMP) algorithm is proposed to eliminate the multi-user interference, and a denoiser is designed to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of the transmitted signals. Then, maximum\na\nposteriori (MAP) criterion is adopted to approximately detect the user activity and the desired data. By minimizing the symbol error probability of the above two-step algorithm, the power constellation for each user is designed, and it is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the number of the receiver antennas goes to infinity. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed noncoherent scheme outperforms the coherent one in the low SNR regime and for short packet transmissions.}

	abstract = {Increasingly serious data security and privacy protection issues make federated learning (FL) gradually evolve to be an important technology in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, in consideration of the huge demands for network access and computing resources from massive IoT devices, ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC), which integrates mobile edge computing (MEC) and ultra-dense network (UDN), has turned out to be a promising network architecture in the era of 5G and even 6G. Facing requirements on ultra-low processing latency, performing FL for UDEC confronts many challenges, one of which is how to relieve the barrel effect caused by the difference in computing power of local devices while ensuring overall FL efficiency. Nevertheless, little work can be found in this area. Toward this end, the paper takes the lead in studying FL for UDEC, and proposes an inter-server collaborative federated learning method by grouping the servers and clients. Theoretical analysis and numerical results corroborate that our proposed inter-server collaborative method can significantly reduce the waiting time during local training without reducing the learning accuracy, thus improving the overall efficiency.}

	abstract = {In federated learning (FL), reducing the communication overhead is one of the most critical challenges since the parameter server and the mobile devices share the training parameters over wireless links. With such consideration, we adopt the idea of SignSGD in which only the signs of the gradients are exchanged. Moreover, most of the existing works assume Channel State Information (CSI) available at both the mobile devices and the parameter server, and thus the mobile devices can adopt fixed transmission rates dictated by the channel capacity. In this work, only the parameter server side CSI is assumed, and channel capacity with outage is considered. In this case, an essential problem for the mobile devices is to select appropriate local processing and communication parameters (including the transmission rates) to achieve a desired balance between the overall learning performance and their energy consumption. Two optimization problems are formulated and solved, which optimize the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement, and vice versa. Furthermore, considering that the data may be distributed across the mobile devices in a highly uneven fashion in FL, a stochastic sign-based algorithm is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

In order to avoid being discovered by the suspicious users, the monitor restricts the SC quality-of-service (QoS) degradation caused by itself. Under this SC QoS constraint and the average transmit power constraint, the problems of optimizing the mode and transmit power of the monitor to maximize the average successful eavesdropping probability and the average eavesdropping rate are investigated for the delay-sensitive suspicious service and delay-tolerant suspicious service, respectively. By proving that the time-sharing condition is satisfied, the optimal solutions are derived based on the Lagrange duality method. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. It is shown that the proposed schemes can provide satisfactory eavesdropping performance improvement even with zero SC QoS degradation requirement.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a deep learning (DL) framework for the optimization of the resource allocation in multi-channel cellular systems with device-to-device (D2D) communication is proposed. Thereby, the channel assignment and discrete transmit power levels of the D2D users, which are both integer variables, are optimized for maximization of the overall spectral efficiency whilst maintaining the quality-of-service (QoS) of the cellular users. Depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI), two different configurations are considered, namely 1) centralized operation with full CSI and 2) distributed operation with partial CSI, where in the latter case, the CSI is encoded according to the capacity of the feedback channel. Instead of solving the resulting resource allocation problem for each channel realization, a DL framework is proposed, where the optimal resource allocation strategy for arbitrary channel conditions is approximated by deep neural network (DNN) models. Furthermore, we propose a new training strategy that combines supervised and unsupervised learning methods and a local CSI sharing strategy to achieve near-optimal performance while enforcing the QoS constraints of the cellular users and efficiently handling the integer optimization variables based on a few ground-truth labels. Our simulation results confirm that near-optimal performance can be attained with low computation time, which underlines the real-time capability of the proposed scheme. Moreover, our results show that not only the resource allocation strategy but also the CSI encoding strategy can be efficiently determined using a DNN. Furthermore, we show that the proposed DL framework can be easily extended to communication systems with different design objectives.}

	abstract = {Because each indoor site has its own radio propagation characteristics, a site survey process is essential to optimize a Wi-Fi ranging strategy for range-based positioning solutions. This study examines an unsupervised learning technique that autonomously learns an optimal ranging strategy for each site using Wi-Fi and sensor data accumulated while users access a positioning application. Using the collected sensor data, the device trajectory is regenerated, and a Wi-Fi ranging module is optimized to generate the shape of the estimated trajectory using Wi-Fi, similar to that obtained from sensors. In this process, the ranging module learns the way to identify the channel conditions from each Wi-Fi access point (AP) and produces ranging results accordingly. Furthermore, we collect the channel state information (CSI) from beacon frames to investigate the benefit of using CSI in addition to received signal strength measurements. With the CSI, the ranging module can identify diverse channel conditions from each AP and more accurately generate the reliability of each distance estimate to achieve accurate positioning results. The effectiveness of the proposed learning technique is verified using a real-time positioning application implemented on a PC platform.}

	abstract = {Nonlinear precoding and pulse shaping are jointly considered in multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low resolution D/A-converters (DACs) in terms of algorithmic approach as well as large system performance. Two design criteria are investigated: the mean squared error (MSE) with active constellation extension (ACE) and the symbol error rate (SER). Both formulations are solved based on a modified version of the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. Furthermore, theoretical performance results are derived based on the state evolution analysis of the GAMP algorithm. The MSE based technique is extended to jointly perform over-the-air (OTA) spectral shaping and precoding for frequency-selective channels, in which the spectral performance is characterized at the transmitter and at the receiver. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that the MSE based approach yields the same performance as the SER based formulation in terms of uncoded SER. The analytical results provide good performance predictions up to medium SNR. Substantial improvements in detection, as well as spectral performance, are obtained from the proposed combined pulse shaping and precoding approach compared to standard linear methods.}

	abstract = {In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing hybrid analog-digital precoder, there are two commonly used antenna structures that have their own pros and cons, namely, the fully-connected antenna structure (FCAS) and the partially-connected antenna structure (PCAS). The FCAS achieves better spectrum efficiency (SE) even with reduced radio frequency (RF) chains, but the hardware cost and power consumption are still grievous. Contrarily, the PCAS has less hardware cost and power consumption, but suffers from severe performance loss. In this paper, by combining the advantages of both structures, we first propose a sparse adaptive antenna structure (SAAS) for the implementation of the hybrid precoder, which can jointly control the on/off state of all phase shifters (PS) and RF chains through a switch network. Then, a sparse hybrid precoding (SHP) optimization problem based on the proposed SAAS is established aiming at minimizing the total power consumption under individual average data rate requirements. To tackle the challenging non-smooth non-convex stochastic optimization (NSO) emerged with the SHP design and reduce the power consumption of PSs and RF chains, we propose a sparse smooth approximation based an online algorithm to find a stationary point of the NSO problem and establish its convergence. Simulations verify that the proposed antenna structure and algorithm achieve a better balance between power consumption and system throughput than the existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Energy is a resource bottleneck in wireless sensing networks (WSNs) relying on energy harvesting for their operations. This is pronounced in WSNs whose data is used for remote parameter estimation because only a subset of the measured information can be transmitted to the estimator. While much attention has been separately paid to communication schemes for energy-aware data transmission in WSNs under resource constraints and controlled parameter estimation, there has yet to emerge a censoring policy that minimizes the variance of a measured process’ estimated component parameters subject to realistic constraints imposed by the WSN. Consequently, this paper presents the derivation of an optimal event-based policy governing data collection and transmission that accounts for energy and data buffer sizes, stochastic models of harvested energy and event arrivals, value of information of measured data, and temporal death. The policy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the information rate of transmitted data, thereby producing the best possible estimates of the process parameters using the modified maximum likelihood estimation given the system constraints. Experimental and simulation-based results reflect these objectives and illustrate that the framework is robust against significant uncertainty in the initial parameter estimates.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of joint wideband spectrum sensing and recovery of multi-band signals in a multi-antenna-based sub-Nyquist sampling framework. Specifically, the multi-band signal is composed of a number of uncorrelated narrowband signals spreading over a wide frequency band. Unlike existing works which assume the source signals impinge on the receiver via a line-of-sight (LOS) path, we consider a more practical unknown MIMO channel which results from multipath propagation. A new sub-Nyquist sampling architecture is proposed, where each antenna output passes through two channels, namely, a direct path and a delayed path with a controlled amount of time delay. The signal at each channel is then sampled by a synchronized low-rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC). We utilize the collected data samples to build a set of cross-correlation matrices with different time lags and develop a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition-based method to recover the carrier frequencies, power spectra as well as the source signals themselves. Recovery conditions of the proposed method are analyzed, and Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) results for our estimation problem are derived. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Hop count distribution (HCD), generally formulated as a discrete probability distribution of the hop count, constitutes an attractive tool for performance analysis and algorithm design. This paper devotes to deriving an analytical HCD expression for a finite ad hoc network under the minimum hop-count routing protocols. Formulating the node distribution with binomial point process, the network is provided as a bounded area with all nodes randomly and uniformly distributed. Considering an arbitrary pair of source node (SN) and destination node, an innovative and straightforward definition is presented for HCD. In order to derive HCD out, an original mathematical framework, named as the equivalent area replacement method (EARM), is proposed and verified. Under the EARM, HCD is derived by first considering the special case where SN locates at the network center and then extending to the general case where SN is randomly distributed. For each case, the accuracy of our HCD model is evaluated by simulation comparison. Results show that our model matches well with the simulation results over a wide range of parameters. Particularly, the derived HCD outperforms the existing formulations in terms of the Kullback Leibler divergence, especially when SN is randomly distributed.}

This paper investigates the spatial-temporal prediction of channel state information (CSI) and channel statistical characteristics (CSCs) based on deep-learning (DL) for the future smart HSR communication network. A propagation-graph simulation method is used to generate datasets of CSI and CSCs for massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) channels in a HSR cutting scenario, and realistic channel measurements are used to validate the datasets. Then, single-step ahead and multi-step ahead prediction problems are formulated with the consideration of both spatial and temporal information hidden in the datasets. By exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations of the HSR mMIMO channel, a novel spatial-temporal channel prediction model that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) is proposed and called as Conv-CLSTM. Moreover, the hyper-parameters of the Conv-CLSTM model are determined by autocorrelation and similarity analysis and cross-validation. Finally, the performance of the Conv-CLSTM model is evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and space and time computational complexity, and is compared with classical DL models. The evaluation results show that the proposed model has high prediction accuracy but acceptable computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the waveform and passive beamforming design for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless power transfer (WPT). Generalized multi-user and low complexity single-user algorithms are demonstrated based on alternating optimization (AO) framework to maximize the weighted sum output direct current (DC), subject to the transmit power constraints and passive beamforming modulus constraints. The input signal waveform and IRS passive beamforming phase shifts are jointly designed as a function of users’ individual frequency-selective channel state information (CSI). The energy harvester nonlinearity is explored and two IRS deployment schemes, namely frequency selective IRS (FS-IRS) and frequency flat IRS (FF-IRS), are modeled and analyzed. This paper highlights the fact that IRS can provide an extra passive beamforming gain on output DC power over conventional WPT designs and significantly influence the waveform design by leveraging the benefit of passive beamforming, frequency diversity and energy harvester nonlinearity. Even though FF-IRS exhibits lower output DC than the ideal FS-IRS, it still achieves substantially increased DC power over conventional WPT designs. Performance evaluations confirm the significant benefits of a joint waveform and passive beamforming design accounting for the energy harvester nonlinearity to boost the performance of single-user and multi-user WPT systems.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution for enabling the control of wireless environments. Most of existing works consider that an IRS consists of a large number of reconfigurable passive elements and each of them can reflect the signal independently. However, it is difficult and costly in practice to manufacture this kind of large-scale IRS. In this paper, we propose a practical electromagnetic-compliant reflection coefficient model for element-grouping IRS, which configures each sub-surface (including multiple homogeneous elements) but not each single element. Under this model, the reflection amplitude and the phase shift are coupled, which brings new challenges for optimizing the IRS configuration. We study a phase shift optimization problem to maximize the received power in an IRS-aided wireless system. As this problem is difficult to solve due to the complicated coupling in the practical model, we transform it into a vector composition problem equivalently. By constructing a geometry-based phase analysis model, we analyze the relationship of the vectors in a two-dimensional space to maximize the length of the sum vector. By exploiting the geometrical properties, we propose a low-complexity phase control algorithm to find the optimal phase shifts of IRS. Simulation results reveal that substantial performance gains are achieved by the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has recently attracted significant attention due to its superior capability to reduce the energy consumption and the latency of MEC offloading. In this paper, a general hybrid NOMA-MEC offloading strategy is proposed, which includes conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and pure NOMA based offloading as special cases. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize the energy consumption for MEC offloading, and a low-complexity resource allocation solution is derived and shown to be Pareto-optimal. Furthermore, by analyzing the properties of the obtained resource allocation solution, important insights regarding NOMA-MEC offloading are obtained. For example, it is proved that pure NOMA-MEC offloading cannot outperform hybrid NOMA-MEC. In addition, a precise condition under which NOMA-MEC outperforms OMA-MEC is established, and shown to match the one previously developed for the two-user special case. Furthermore, the developed analytical results also establish an interesting analogy between the proposed hybrid NOMA-MEC power allocation scheme and the well-known water-filling strategy.}

	abstract = {Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) based on frequency hopping (FH) MIMO radar (FH-MIMO DFRC) achieves symbol rate much higher than radar pulse repetition frequency. Such DFRC, however, is prone to eavesdropping due to the spatially uniform illumination of an FH-MIMO radar. In this paper, we reveal the potential of using permutations of hopping frequencies to achieve secure and high-speed FH-MIMO DFRC. Specifically, we identify the angle-dependent issue in detecting permutations and develop an element-wise phase compensation (EPC) to solve the issue for a legitimate user (Bob). EPC makes the demodulation at an eavesdropper (Eve) conditioned on knowing the angle-of-departure (AoD) of Bob. We also propose the random sign reversal (RSR) technique which randomly selects several antennas over hops and reverses their signs. Owing to EPC, there is a sign rule available for Bob. We employ the rule and develop a low-complexity algorithm for Bob to remove RSR. We further prove that, given the same signal-to-noise ratio, RSR plus EPC make the demodulation performance of Eve inferior to that of Bob in most angular regions. Confirmed by simulation, our design achieves substantially high physical layer security for FH-MIMO DFRC, improves demodulation performance compared with existing designs, and reduces mutual interference among radar targets.}

	abstract = {Machine-type communication (MTC) is one of the main enabling technologies to support various applications with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. Finite blocklength transmission has great potential in meeting the strict delay requirements of delay-sensitive MTC devices (MTCDs), while also causing loss of network capacity due to the decoding error probability. Aiming at this problem, we introduce uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and buffer-aided relaying to assist the finite blocklength transmission with delay requirements for improving the achievable effective capacity (EC), which is defined as the maximum short-packet constant arrival rate under specific statistical QoS constraints. To solve the EC maximization problem, we derive the closed-form expression of time allocation coefficient. Then we establish a concave lower bound of EC using successive convex approximation (SCA) for power allocation of MTCDs, and formulate a non-cooperative game based distributed power allocation algorithm for relay. Furthermore, a joint time and power allocation (JTPA) algorithm is proposed to implement joint resource allocation. Simulation results show that under finite blocklength and statistical QoS constraints, adopting buffer-aided relaying can improve EC by 41.82% compared with no-buffer relaying. Moreover, the achievable EC of JTPA algorithm is only 3.12% lower than that of exhaustive search while reducing complexity.}

We aim to maximize the information users’ (IUs’) sum data rate while guaranteeing the power harvesting requirements of energy users (EUs) and RIS. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm is adopted to alternately optimize the transmit precoding of IUs, RIS’s reflecting coefficients, and the position of RIS. Additionally, the penalty constrained convex approximation (PCCA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the deployment of the RIS, where the introduced penalties ensure that the solution is always feasible. The simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms the benchmark schemes, and the proposed BCD algorithm can greatly improve the performance of the STIPT system.}

To efficiently manage those resources, we propose a hierarchical and distributed resource management framework based on deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework minimizes the on-grid energy consumption while satisfying the data rate requirement of each user. It is composed of three different policies in a distributed and hierarchical way. An intercell interference coordination policy constrains the transmission power at each BS to coordinate the intercell interference among the BSs. Under the power constraints, a distributed radio resource allocation policy of each BS determines its own user scheduling and power control. Lastly, an energy sharing policy manages the energy resources of the BSs by sharing the harvested energy via power lines between them. Through the simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the on-grid energy consumption while satisfying the data rate requirements.}

	abstract = {We address the worst-user bottleneck of wireless coded caching, which is known to severely diminish cache-aided multicasting gains due to the fundamental worst-channel limitation of multicasting. We consider the quasi-static Rayleigh fading Broadcast Channel, for which we first show that the effective coded caching gain of the standard XOR-based coded-caching scheme completely vanishes in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Then, we reveal that this collapse is not intrinsic to coded caching. We do so by presenting a novel scheme that can fully recover the coded caching gains by capitalizing on one aspect that has remained unexploited to date: the shared side information brought about by the effectively unavoidable file-size constraint. As a consequence, the worst-user effect is dramatically ameliorated, as it is substituted by a much more subtle worst-group-of-users effect, where the suggested grouping is fixed, and it is decided before the channel or the demands are known. Furthermore, the theoretical gains are completely recovered as the number of users increases, and this is done without any user selection technique. We analyze the rate performance of the proposed scheme and derive approximations which prove to be very precise. Importantly, this novel approach can be translated to other coded caching schemes and scenarios, including decentralized scenarios.}

	abstract = {Securing necessary resources for edge computing processes via effective resource trading becomes a critical technique in supporting computation-intensive mobile applications. Conventional onsite spot trading could facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, incurs excessive decision-making latency/energy consumption, and further leads to underutilization of dynamic resources. Motivated by this, a hybrid market unifying futures and spot is proposed to facilitate resource trading among an edge server (seller) and multiple smart devices (buyers) by encouraging some buyers to sign a forward contract with seller in advance, while leaving the remaining buyers to compete for available resources with spot trading. Specifically, overbooking is adopted to achieve substantial utilization and profit advantages owing to dynamic resource demands. By integrating overbooking into futures market, mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contracts with appropriate overbooking rate can be achieved relying on analyzing historical statistics associated with future resource demand and communication quality, which are determined by an alternative optimization-based negotiation scheme. Besides, spot trading problem is studied via considering uniform/differential pricing rules, for which two bilateral negotiation schemes are proposed by addressing both non-convex optimization and knapsack problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves mutually beneficial player’s utilities, while outperforming baseline methods on critical indicators, e.g., decision-making latency, resource usage, etc.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a joint beamforming design in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication network aided with an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) panel. The symbol-level precoding (SLP) is adopted to enhance the system performance by exploiting the multiuser interference (MUI) with consideration of bounded channel uncertainty. The joint beamforming design is formulated into a nonconvex worst-case robust programming to minimize the transmit power subject to single-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements. To address the challenges due to the constant modulus and the coupling of the beamformers, we first study the single-user case. Specifically, we propose and compare two algorithms based on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and alternating optimization (AO) methods, respectively. It turns out that the AO-based algorithm has much lower computational complexity but with almost the same power to the SDR-based algorithm. Then, we apply the AO technique to the multiuser case and thereby develop an algorithm based on the proximal gradient descent (PGD) method. The algorithm can be generalized to the case of finite-resolution IRS and the scenario with direct links from the transmitter to the users. Numerical results show that the SLP can significantly improve the system performance. Meanwhile, 3-bit phase shifters can achieve near-optimal power performance.}

The RIS links the connection between the IUs and the BS as there is no direct path between the former and the latter. The EUs are located nearby the BS in order to effectively harvest energy from the high-power signal from the BS, while the much weaker signal reflected from the RIS hardly contributes to the EUs’ harvested energy. To provide reliable links for all users over the same time-slot, we adopt the transmit time-switching (transmit-TS) approach, under which information and energy are delivered over different time-slot fractions. This allows us to rely on conjugate beamforming for energy links and zero-forcing/regularized zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB/RZFB) and on the programmable reflecting coefficients (PRCs) of the RIS for information links. We show that ZFB/RZFB and PRCs can be still separately optimized in their joint design, where PRC optimization is based on iterative closed-form expressions. We then develop a path-following algorithm for solving the max-min IU throughput optimization problem subject to a realistic constraint on the quality-of-energy-service in terms of the EUs’ harvested energy thresholds. We also propose a new RZFB for substantially improving the IUs’ throughput.}

The channel state information (CSI) needs to be fed back from the user equipment to the base station in frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode. However, the overhead of the direct feedback is unacceptable due to the large antenna array in massive MIMO system. Recently, deep learning is widely adopted to the compressed CSI feedback task and proved to be effective. In this paper, a novel network named aggregated channel reconstruction network (ACRNet) is designed to boost the feedback performance with network aggregation and parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) activation. The practical deployment of the feedback network in the communication system is also considered. Specifically, the elastic feedback scheme is proposed to flexibly adapt the network to meet different resource limitations. Besides, the network binarization technique is combined with the feature quantization for lightweight and practical deployment. Experiments show that the proposed ACRNet outperforms loads of previous state-of-the-art networks, providing a neat feedback solution with high performance, low cost and impressive flexibility.}

For the practicality and suitability considerations, the\nM\n-ary differential chaos shift keying scheme is introduced to modulate the CM2-S3 channel with better performance than the standard modulations in WBAN. Due to the non-Gaussian-like distribution of the CM2-S3 channel model, the initial joint protograph extrinsic information transfer (JPEXIT) algorithm does not work as a coding analysis tool. To solve this problem, a numerical Gaussian approximation is employed to modify the iterative mutual information function of the JPEXIT for achieving more precise output. Then, a joint code rate compatible (JCRC) method, designed with compatibility in resisting variable channel variances and adapting different source statistics, is proposed for optimizing the DP-LDPC code pairs. Based on the JCRC method, the code searching algorithm is simplified with lower complexity because of the reduced cycle-index. The simulation results show that optimized code pairs have better bit-error ratio performances compared to existing codes, which provides a strong technical support to promote high-quality data transmission in eHealthcare on the physical layer.}

	abstract = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to become integral components of future cellular networks. To this end, one of the important problems to address is how to support energy-efficient UAV operation while maintaining reliable connectivity between those aerial users and cellular networks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of cellular-connected UAV via jointly designing the mission completion time and UAV trajectory, as well as communication base station (BS) associations, while ensuring a satisfactory communication connectivity with the ground cellular network during the UAV flight. An optimization problem is formulated by taking into account the UAV’s flight energy consumption and various practical aspects of the air-ground communication models, including BS antenna pattern, interference from non-associated BSs and local environment. The formulated problem is difficult to tackle due to the lack of closed-form expressions and non-convexity nature. To this end, we first assume that the channel knowledge map (CKM) or radio map for the considered area is available, which contains rich information about the relatively stable (large-scale) channel parameters. By utilizing path discretization technique, we obtain a discretized equivalent problem and develop an efficient solution based on graph theory by employing convex optimization technique and a dynamic-weight shortest path algorithm over graph. Next, we study the more practical case that the CKM is unavailable initially. By transforming the optimization problem to a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on multi-step learning and double Q-learning over a dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, where the UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its moving policy according to its local observations of the measured signal samples. Extensive simulations are carried out and the results show that our proposed designs significantly outperform baseline schemes. Furthermore, our results reveal new insights of energy-efficient UAV flight with connectivity requirements and unveil the tradeoff between UAV energy consumption and time duration along line segments.}

	abstract = {Traditional fingerprint-based positioning approaches work well on static data; they cannot handle scenarios where the data distribution, the feature space and even the signal source evolve over time, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. One straightforward approach for circumventing these difficulties is to repeat labeled data calibration for maintaining an up-to-date fingerprint database, which is usually infeasible or expensive in large-scale indoor environments. In this paper, we propose a Long Short-Term indoor Positioning (LSTP) framework that enables adaptation at different time scales with low human-effort, and thus extends the effectiveness of existing fingerprinting techniques for a more generalized environment. Specifically, LSTP mainly considers the distribution discrepancy caused by continuous environmental dynamics in short-term positioning and the feature space heterogeneity in long-term positioning. To address the first challenge, we design an incremental ensemble localization model which leverages multiple source classifiers to resolve distribution differences in an online manner. To address the second challenge, we seek to borrow knowledge learned from an earlier time period with plenty of labeled samples for the current time period, thus reducing the required number of new calibration samples. By fully capturing the transferable spatial information across different time periods with multi-level constraints (sample, feature, and model levels), we can study a discriminative domain-invariant space from which we can make better predictions. The experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by 18% in mean accuracy.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the age-oriented hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol design in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) scenarios. A real-time communication system, where the updates are delivered from the remote nodes to terrestrial devices, is formulated. As the end-to-end latency D is nontrivial, the traditional HARQ with frequent feedbacks is not always beneficial to timely transmission. Intuitively, there is a threshold D^{*} of D , only within which retransmission is advantageous to age. Inspired by this, we formulate an age-optimal redundancy allocation problem and derive the explicit expression of D^{*} for advantageous retransmissions. Besides, to further increase the timeliness of the system, we propose a fast incremental redundancy hybrid ARQ protocol (fast IR-HARQ), where successive decoding and feedback operations are omitted based on channel estimation. Considering the shadowed Rician fading channel and finite blocklength regime, we derive expressions of the average age for the standard IR-HARQ and fast IR-HARQ setups. As expected, the proposed fast IR-HARQ scheme reduces the average age significantly compared with the IR-HARQ strategy. Further, we evaluate the influence of different parameters on the age performance of the fast IR-HARQ scheme. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fast IR-HARQ protocol without loss of reliability.}

	abstract = {Cloud radio-access networks (C-RAN) have been proposed as an enabling technology for keeping up with the requirements of next-generation wireless networks. Most existing works on C-RAN study the uplink or the downlink separately. However, designing the uplink and the downlink jointly may bring additional advantages, especially if message source-destination information is taken into account. In this paper, this idea is demonstrated by considering pairwise message exchange between users in a C-RAN. A multi-pair two-way transmission scheme is proposed which targets maximizing the end-to-end sum rate. In the proposed scheme, a lattice-based computation strategy is used, where the baseband processing unit (BBU) pool decodes integer linear combinations of paired users’ codewords instead of decoding linear combinations of individual codewords. The BBU pool then precodes the computed signals, compresses, and forwards them to the remote radio heads (RRHs), which in turn decompress the signals and send them to the users. Finally, each user decodes its desired message using its own message as side information. The achievable rate of this scheme is derived, optimized, and evaluated numerically. Simulation results reveal that significant end-to-end rate improvement can be achieved using the proposed scheme compared to existing schemes.}

In this paper, we investigate whether modern all-digital baseband signal processing architectures can be devised for such regimes, given the difficulty of analog-to-digital conversion for large bandwidths. We propose low-precision quantizer designs and accompanying spatial demultiplexing algorithms, considering 2 \\times 2\nLoS MIMO with QPSK for analytical insight, and 4 \\times 4\nMIMO with QPSK and 16QAM for performance evaluation. Unlike prior work, channel state information is utilized only at the receiver (i.e., transmit precoding is not employed). We investigate quantizers with regular structure whose high-SNR mutual information approaches that of an unquantized system. We prove that amplitude-phase quantization is necessary to attain this benchmark; phase-only quantization falls short. We show that quantizers based on maximizing per-antenna output entropy perform better than standard Minimum Mean Squared Quantization Error (MMSQE) quantization. For spatial demultiplexing with severely quantized observations, we introduce the novel concept of virtual quantization which, combined with linear detection, provides reliable demodulation at significantly reduced complexity compared to maximum likelihood detection.}

	abstract = {Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and future networks face the challenges of spectral, energy and cost efficiency for large-scale machine-type communications. Recently, emerging ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) technology provides a promising paradigm for the development of green Internet of Things (IoT) networks in B5G era. Unlike existing work on AmBC which mostly focuses on physical layer with relatively ideal model, i.e., classic three-nodes model composed of radio frequency (RF), backscatter device (BD) and IoT device, this paper studies the access control strategy, including coefficient design and device association, from the perspective of networking. Assuming whether channel information is available a-priori, we propose online and offline access control strategies respectively. For offline access control strategy, we leverage the difference of two convex functions approximation (DCA) and dual decomposition to transform the non-concave optimization problem into the concave one, and design a distributed access control strategy called DCA-S. Furthermore, for the case that channel information is assumed to be unknown in advance due to the dynamics of primary and backscatter networks, we design a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) access control strategy (CMAB-S). Numerical results show that the proposed DCA-S and CMAB-S can achieve significant performance improvement of the system in both cases of available and unavailable channel information compared with benchmark schemes.}

In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled MEC platform that serves multiple mobile ground users with random movements and task arrivals. We aim to minimize the average weighted energy consumption of all users subject to the average UAV energy consumption and data queue stability constraints. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic optimization, and adopt Lyapunov optimization to convert it into per-slot deterministic problems with fewer optimizing variables. We design two reduced-complexity methods that solve the resource allocation and the UAV movement either in two sequential steps or jointly in one step. Both methods can guarantee to satisfy the average UAV energy and queue stability constraints, meanwhile achieving a tradeoff between the user energy consumption and the length of queue backlog. Simulation results show that the two methods significantly outperform the other benchmark methods including a learning-based method in reducing the energy consumption of ground users. In between, the proposed joint optimization method achieves better performance than the two-stage method at the cost of higher computational complexity.}

Particularly, by using SG tools, we first propose an analytical framework to assess the performance of the considered networks in terms of average signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) ratio, average rate, and mobility-induced time overhead, for scenarios with user mobility. According to the SG-based framework, an EGT-based approach is presented to solve the problem of access mode selection. Specifically, two EGT-based models are considered, where for each MU its utility function depends on the average SINR and the average rate, respectively, while the time overhead is considered as a penalty term. A distributed algorithm is proposed to reach the evolutionary equilibrium, where the existence and stability of the equilibrium is theoretically analyzed and proved. Moreover, we extend the formulation by considering information delay exchange and evaluate its impact on the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our results reveal that the proposed technique can offer better spectral efficiency and connectivity in heterogeneous sub-6 GHz/mmWave cellular networks with mobility, compared with the conventional access mode selection techniques.}

In reality, the LoS link can be easily and severely blocked due to poor propagation environments such as tall buildings or trees. To this end, we introduce a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which passively reflects signals with programmable reflection coefficients, between the transceivers to enhance the communication quality. Specifically, in this paper we generalize a three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary wideband end-to-end channel model for RIS auxiliary UAV-to-ground mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. By modeling the RIS as a virtual cluster, we study the power delivering capability of RIS as well as the fading characteristic of the proposed channel model. Important channel statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated, and the impact of RIS reflection phase configurations on these statistical properties is studied, which provides guidelines for the practical system design. The agreement between theoretical and simulated as well as measurement results validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model.}

	abstract = {A key challenge for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is that the signals at mmWave band are highly susceptible to blockage. To address this challenge, we introduce intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to increase coverage area and improve communication performance. This paper considers a joint design of hybrid precoders at the base station and the passive precoder at the IRS to maximize the average spectral efficiency in an IRS-assisted mmWave MIMO system by exploiting the mixed timescale channel state information (CSI). Specifically, the hybrid precoders are designed according to the instantaneous CSI of the overall channel, while the IRS reflection coefficient matrix is optimized using the statistical CSI of all links. However, such a design problem is challenging to solve due to the non-convexity and the mixed timescale. This work proposes efficient algorithms to design jointly the hybrid precoders and the IRS reflection coefficient matrix where the update of the IRS reflection coefficient matrix is independent of the hybrid precoders. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. More interestingly, the results also show that adding low-cost reflector elements at the IRS can reduce the number of required high-cost radio frequency chains.}

Our objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of this system by jointly optimizing base station (BS) clustering, user association, sub-carrier assignment, power allocation, and optimal design of the IRS, while satisfying the users’ quality of service requirements. Considering the amplitude and phase shift characteristics, both ideal and non-ideal IRS are investigated. The formulated problem is proved to be NP-hard. By analyzing its structure, we decouple it into the power allocation sub-problem, the BS clustering, UE association, and sub-carrier assignment sub-problem, and the reflection coefficients design sub-problem. For the power allocation sub-problem, we invoke the fractional programming to find the optimal solution. For the reflection coefficients design sub-problem of ideal IRS, the optimal solution is derived with the Lagrangian dual method. Whereas quantization-based method is employed to find the discrete phase shifts for non-ideal IRS. We finally propose a genetic algorithm (GA) to represent the potential solutions of sub-carrier assignment, and combine the other two optimization algorithms as fitness estimator in GA. Numerical results validate the feasibility, fast convergence, and the flexibility of the proposed algorithm.

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems have a huge potential both in terms of data rate and energy efficiency, although channel estimation becomes challenging for a large number of antennas. Using a physical model allows to ease the problem by injecting a priori information based on the physics of propagation. However, such a model rests on simplifying assumptions and requires to know precisely the configuration of the system, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper we present mpNet, an unfolded neural network specifically designed for massive MIMO channel estimation. It is trained online in an unsupervised way. Moreover, mpNet is computationally efficient and automatically adapts its depth to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method we propose adds flexibility to physical channel models by allowing a base station (BS) to automatically correct its channel estimation algorithm based on incoming data, without the need for a separate offline training phase. It is applied to realistic millimeter wave channels and shows great performance, achieving a channel estimation error almost as low as one would get with a perfectly calibrated system. It also allows incident detection and automatic correction, making the BS resilient and able to automatically adapt to changes in its environment.}

	abstract = {Computation offloading is indispensable for mobile edge computing (MEC). It uses edge resources to enable intensive computations and save energy for resource-constrained devices. Existing works generally impose strong assumptions on radio channels and network queue sizes. However, practical MEC systems are subject to various uncertainties rendering these assumptions impractical. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient computation offloading problem by relaxing those common assumptions and considering intrinsic uncertainties in the network. Specifically, we minimize the worst-case expected energy consumption of a local device when executing a time-critical application modeled as a directed acyclic graph. We employ the extreme value theory to bound the occurrence probability of uncertain events. To solve the formulated problem, we develop an\nϵ\n-bounded approximation algorithm based on column generation. The proposed algorithm can efficiently identify a feasible solution that is less than\n(1+ϵ)\nof the optimal one. We implement the proposed scheme on an Android smartphone and conduct extensive experiments using a real-world application. Experiment results corroborate that it will lead to lower energy consumption for the client device by considering the intrinsic uncertainties during computation offloading. The proposed computation offloading scheme also significantly outperforms other schemes in terms of energy saving.}

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the enabling of massive connectivity in a multi-cluster network. In order to tackle significant amount of interference imposed by inter- and intra-cluster users, we consider a frequency-hopping (FH) system where an improved quasi-orthogonal hopping pattern, called optimal strong no-hit-zone FH sequence (SNHZ-FHS) set, is adopted in each cluster. We propose a flexible construction of SNHZ-FHS sets and derive their Hamming correlation values at different access delays. Since the maximum number of supportable users under traditional FH networks is strictly limited by the number of frequency slots, we investigate the design of a novel class of adaptive array beam-forming (BF) receiver in which SNHZ-FHS patterns (i.e., SNHZ-FH/BF) are reused over asynchronous multi-cluster uplink channels. Extensive numerical comparisons show that our proposed SNHZ-FH/BF system provides an effective means for attaining higher user capacity as well as remarkable capability of interference suppression.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a multiuser physical layer secure transmission scheme for millimeter-wave communication. We use Kronecker decomposition to design the common transmit vector to synthesize the desired symbols for multiple legitimate receivers in the proposed scheme. Specifically, the algorithm converts the design of common transmit weight for multiuser into the design of sub-weight vectors having the Vandermonde structure. By using Kronecker decomposition, the sub-weight vectors are decomposed into Kronecker factors and designed. To eliminate the message sending towards the undesired directions while guaranteeing the quality of transmission in the target directions, we separate the Kronecker factors into two parts by using the property of the Kronecker product. The first part (the interference cancellation factor) cancels the interference between legitimate users; the second part (the signal enhancement factor) achieves signal enhancement. For a given information symbol, multiple solutions of transmit weight are obtained. By utilizing this time-varying transmit weight, we realize the secure transmission for multiuser. In addition, the proposed algorithm has no restrictions on modulation, and it also has analytical solutions with low computational complexities. Simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm under various situations.}

	abstract = {We investigate a multi-device ultra-reliable low-latency communication system with heterogeneous traffic and finite block length over temporally-correlated fading channels. In light of the challenging demand for accurate channel estimation with limited pilot in a short frame, two frame structures, which respectively adopt independent pilots and shared pilot, are investigated. Block lengths and pilot lengths are jointly optimized for the two frame structures, through instantaneous channel state information (CSI) based dynamic optimization and statistical CSI based static optimization, to strike the tradeoffs among performance, complexity and signaling overhead. The proposed joint optimization algorithms significantly outperform the existing approaches that solely optimize block lengths or pilot lengths. The dynamic optimization algorithms achieve near-optimal performance at dramatic complexity reduction over exhaustive search, and maintain robustness against traffic heterogeneity. Also, the static optimization algorithms are conducted offline, while still outperforming the previous instantaneous CSI based dynamic optimization approaches. It is demonstrated that the independent-pilot frame structure with dynamic optimization is preferable in the scenario with high traffic heterogeneity or high mobility, and that the shared-pilot frame structure with static optimization presents a comparable performance to the former in the case of low mobility, incurring negligible complexity and signaling overhead.}

	abstract = {Configuring precoders and combiners is a major challenge to deploy practical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems with large antenna arrays. Most prior work addresses the problem focusing on a total transmit power constraint. In practical transmitters, however, power amplifiers must operate within their linear range, so that a power constraint applies to each one of the input signals to these devices. Therefore, precoder and combiner designs should incorporate per-antenna or per-radio frequency (RF) chain transmit power constraints. We focus on such problem for frequency-selective channels with multicarrier modulation, and assuming hybrid analog/digital architectures based on fully connected analog blocks implemented with finite-resolution phase shifters. We first derive an all-digital solution which aims to maximize spectral efficiency. Then, we develop hybrid precoders and combiners by approximately matching the corresponding all-digital matrices while still enforcing the power constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed all-digital design performs close to the upper bound given by the standard waterfilling-based solution with a total power constraint. Additionally, the hybrid designs exhibit a moderate loss even when low-resolution phase shifters are considered.}

	abstract = {Beam alignment – the process of finding an optimal directional beam pair – is a challenging procedure crucial to millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems. We propose a novel beam alignment method that learns a site-specific probing codebook and uses the probing codebook measurements to predict the optimal narrow beam. An end-to-end neural network (NN) architecture is designed to jointly learn the probing codebook and the beam predictor. The learned codebook consists of site-specific probing beams that can capture particular characteristics of the propagation environment. The proposed method relies on beam sweeping of the learned probing codebook, does not require additional context information, and is compatible with the beam sweeping-based beam alignment framework in 5G. Using realistic ray-tracing datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high beam alignment accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while significantly – by roughly a factor of 3 in our setting – reducing the beam sweeping complexity and latency.}

	abstract = {Performance analysis of the Bundle Protocol (BP) in Delay/ disruption-Tolerant Networks (DTN) has gained much interest. The analytic work of the average operation time (AOT) in BP, for different channel conditions and system parameters, though critical to understanding performance and designing system, is still incomplete. Existing results, such as the average file delivery time (AFDT), provide reasonably close estimates in some cases but exhibit large discrepancies in other cases. In this paper, we provide a holistic probabilistic analysis of the BP process, particularly in the number of error bundles and the position of the last error bundle in each and the last rounds of transmission. We provide, for the first time, an exact solution for the AOT of the BP process. The derivation works for both symmetric and asymmetric channels and is in general for any given maximum number of transmissions rounds. When the unlimited number of transmission rounds is considered, AOT becomes AFDT. The results are further utilized to select the optimal bundle size that gives the minimum file delivery time. Validation via simulations and comparison with existing work are also provided.}

	abstract = {Because of discrepant deteriorations of the intended receiver and the unintended receiver, artificial noise (AN) can be invoked in conjunction with the precoder to wireless transmissions for enhancing the secrecy rate (SR) performance as long as we elaborately frame them. This paper studies a secure transmission strategy by jointly designing the precoder and AN beamformer at the relay network, where a passive eavesdropper and finite-alphabet inputs are taken into account. We propose a pair of solutions for low-order modulation and high-order modulation, respectively. To solve the first optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm with the aid of the invoked cut-off rate. Interestingly, we find that the phase of an optimum precoder for maximizing the SR has a correlation to both the channels spanning from the transmitter to the relays and spanning from the relays to the legitimate receiver. Furthermore, we reveal that the AN beamformer vector has at most one non-zero component, which only locates at the position corresponding to the minimum element of the channel between the relays and the intended receiver. According to these findings, the SR maximization problem over the two vectors is simplified as one only related to a pair of scalars. As for the high-order modulation, a new solution is further proposed for circumventing the predicament that the computational complexity exponentially increases as the size of the adopted modulation increases, where we not only eliminate two-layer summation over the legitimate symbols but also conceive a concave maximization SR problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of the SR performance.}

Unlike most channel estimation algorithms, where spatially spread antenna arrays are deployed, our algorithm is designed for a spatial col-located tripole antenna. A third-order tensor model is firstly established for the multipath polarization-space-time channel. This tensor is subsequently solved by exploiting low-rank decomposition techniques. After that, a closed-form solution of 2-D angles, 2-D polarizations, and multipath delay estimates for each multipath ray are derived. The proposed algorithm requires no computation for iterative searching and parameter pairing, thus offering an advantage in time-sensitive applications.

	abstract = {To achieve the service-oriented features of the 5G, network slicing aims to create logical virtual networks where multiple services are provided on a common physical infrastructure. The performance of network slicing depends on the intelligent management of multi-dimensional resources, which are exactly what multi-access edge computing (MEC) provides. This paper proposes joint optimization of communication, computing and caching (3C) resources in multi-access edge network slicing. The optimization objective of the two-level resource allocation problem is to maximize the utility obtained by mobile virtual network operators while ensuring the quality of service (QoS). The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is employed which enables the resource allocation scheme to intelligently adapt to the dynamic environment. Specifically, we propose a novel DRL approach named twin-actor deep deterministic policy gradient (twin-actor DDPG). Since the action space is continuous, the DDPG is adopted where the actor generates the deterministic policy while the critic evaluates the policy and guides the actor to obtain the optimal policy. A novel twin-actor structure is put forward to replace the actor of the DDPG, thus the slice-level action and user-level action can be generated respectively. The convergence and effectiveness of the proposed DRL based algorithm is are verified by numerical simulation.}

	abstract = {The concept of hierarchical federated edge learning (H-FEEL) has been recently proposed as an enhancement of federated learning model. Such a system generally consists of three entities, i.e., the server, helpers, and clients, in which each helper collects the trained gradients from clients nearby, aggregates them, and sends the result to the server for global model update. Due to limited communication resources, only a portion of helpers can be scheduled to upload their aggregated gradients in each round of the model training. And that necessitates a well-designed scheme for the joint helper scheduling and communication resources allocation. In this paper, we develop a training algorithm for the H-FEEL system which involves local gradient computing, weighted gradient uploading, and machine learning model updating phases. By characterizing these phases mathematically and analyzing one-round convergence bound of the training algorithm, we formulate an optimization problem to achieve the scheduling and resource allocation scheme. The problem simultaneously captures the uncertainty of the wireless channel and the importance of the weighted gradient. To solve the problem, we first transform it into an equivalent problem and then decompose the transformed problem into two subproblems: bit and sub-channel allocation and helper scheduling , which are mixed integer nonlinear programming and continuous nonlinear problems, respectively. For the first subproblem, we obtain an optimal solution of exponential complexity and a suboptimal solution that has polynomial complexity. For the second subproblem, we obtain a closed-form optimal solution in a special case and a suboptimal solution in the general case. The efficacy of our scheme is amply demonstrated via simulations and the analytical framework is shown to provide valuable design insights for the practical implementation of the H-FEEL system.}

However, efficient user association and spectrum allocation are still challenging in mmWave-enabled UAV networks considering that the network state is dynamic and the status information of each UAV is incomplete. In this paper, we investigate a joint UAV association and spectrum allocation problem under a hybrid mmWave sharing paradigm, where PC packets are transmitted over both licensed and pooled bands in a shared manner to achieve high throughput and CNPC packets are transmitted over licensed band in an exclusive manner to guarantee high reliability. To this end, we introduce a strategic form game that can characterize network stochastic states and individual partial observations to reformulate the problem, and then propose a counterfactual regret minimization scheme to achieve its correlated equilibrium (CE). Benefited from the updating mechanism on random observation-action pairs, the designed scheme can converge to the corresponding CE solutions for the two types of packets with partial observation. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networking has been an indispensable and promising concept for extending the Internet coverage of future space-air-ground integrated networks to oceanic and remote airspace. However, the topology dynamics of the LEO Satellite Network (LEO-SN) for network state perception (Li et al. , 2019) and the intermittent nature of the Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) for multipath routing discovery (Wang et al. , 2019, Jiang et al. , 2019) both induce new complicated challenges to multipath traffic scheduling for the sake of improving the utility of the LEO-SN facility (Song et al. , 2014, Zhang et al. , 2018, and Yang et al. , 2020). Motivated by these challenges, this paper aims to develop an AI aided intelligent multipath traffic scheduling approach for bolstering autonomous and efficient communications of LEO-SN. To achieve this, we formulate the multipath traffic scheduling problem into a pheromone incentivized Markov Decision Process (MDP) by considering ant routing protocol and adapting pheromone to LEO-SN. Employing enhanced pheromone characterizing network state, we propose ant-inspired multipath routing discovery, which is capable of promptly discovering routing paths available in the dynamic topology. To improve the utility of these discovered routing paths, we employ deep deterministic policy gradient into the pheromone-incentivized MDP-based scheduling problem to derive an intelligent multipath traffic scheduling strategy. The experimental results are further presented to show the achievable performance improvement.}

	abstract = {In the wireless communication system, the pilot is essential for channel estimation. This paper study the pilot design of the 1-bit massive multi-input multi-output system with the flat Rayleigh fading channel. This paper aims to design the pilot matrix minimizing the estimation error of the Bussgang linear minimum mean squared error (BLMMSE) channel estimator, of which the estimation error is given by a closed-form formula. An approximate BLMMSE channel estimation error is derived in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The lower bound of the approximate channel estimation error for all possible pilot matrices is derived. The analysis shows that the pilot matrix with pairwise orthogonal and equal-norm row vectors and equal-norm column vectors is optimal in terms of approximate channel estimation error. The hypersphere-based steepest descent (HSD) algorithm is proposed to design the pilot matrix by optimizing the performance of the BLMMSE estimator. The numerical results show that the proposed HSD algorithm has a noticeable improvement in channel estimation compared with the DFT pilot and the random pilot. The HSD algorithm is also valid for the near maximum likelihood estimator and SNR mismatch.}

	abstract = {Semantic segmentation is a process of partitioning an image into segments for recognizing regions of humans and objects, which can be widely applied in scenarios such as healthcare and safety monitoring. To avoid privacy violation, using radio frequency (RF) signals instead of photos for semantic segmentation has gained increasing attention. However, traditional human and object recognition by using RF signals is a passive signal collection and analysis process without changing the radio environment. The recognition accuracy is restricted significantly by unwanted multi-path fading, and/or the limited number of independent channels between RF transceivers. This paper introduces MetaSketch, a novel RF-sensing system that performs semantic recognition and segmentation for humans and objects by making the radio environment reconfigurable. A metamaterial-based reconfigurable intelligent surface is incorporated to diversify the information carried by RF signals. Using compressive sensing techniques, MetaSketch reconstructs a point cloud consisting of the reflection coefficients of humans and objects at different spatial points, and recognizes the semantic meaning of the points by using symmetric multilayer perceptron groups. Our evaluation results show that MetaSketch is capable of generating favorable radio environments, extracting exact point clouds, and labeling the semantic meaning of the points with an average error rate of less than 1% in an indoor space.}

	abstract = {The communication systems for Poisson channels require long pilot for channel estimation and may result in large percentage of overhead due to the signal-dependent noise of Poisson-distributed signal, i.e., both signal part and noise part experience random processes. In this paper, both blind and semi-blind channel estimation methods are studied to shorten the overhead and increase the transmission efficiency for Poisson channels. First, fractionally spaced equalizers are proposed based on modified constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and subspace (SS). Second, a data-aided iterative channel estimation (ICE) is designed and analyzed in terms of its asymptotic unbiasedness and convergence. The proposed methods are evaluated based on both a constant channel scenario and a varying channel scenario. Numerical simulation results show that the modified CMA has the worst bit-error rate performance but requires the lowest computational complexity. Besides, both SS based channel estimation and ICE have negligible overhead and comparable bit-error rate performances with respect to the conventional periodic pilot based channel estimation having 50% overhead.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we address dynamic network selection problems of mobile users in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled wireless network. In particular, the users dynamically select different service providers (SPs) and network services over time. The network services are composed of adjustable resources of IRS and transmit power. To formulate the SP and network service selection, we adopt an evolutionary game in which the users are able to adapt their network selections depending on the utilities that they achieve. For this, the replicator dynamics is used to model the service selection adaptation of the users. To allow the users to take their past service experiences into account their decisions, we further adopt an enhanced version of the evolutionary game, namely fractional evolutionary game, to study the SP and network service selection. The fractional evolutionary game incorporates the memory effect that captures the users’ memory on their decisions. We theoretically prove that both the game approaches have a unique equilibrium. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed game approaches. In particular, we have reveal some important finding, for instance, with the memory effect, the users can achieve the utility higher than that without the memory effect.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is promising for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications due to the potential in enhancing the spectral efficiency. However, the conventional fully digital precoding architectures might lead to high implementation complexity and energy consumption. In this paper, hybrid analog/digital precoding solutions are developed for the downlink operation in LEO massive MIMO satellite communications, by exploiting the slow-varying statistical channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. First, we formulate the hybrid precoder design as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by considering both the continuous and discrete phase shift networks for implementing the analog precoder. The cases of both the fully and the partially connected architectures are considered. Since the EE optimization problem is nonconvex, it is in general difficult to solve. To make the EE maximization problem tractable, we apply a closed-form tight upper bound to approximate the ergodic rate. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm to obtain the fully digital precoders. Based on which, we further develop two different efficient algorithmic solutions to compute the hybrid precoders for the fully and the partially connected architectures, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve significant EE performance gains over the existing baselines, especially when the discrete phase shift network is employed for analog precoding.}

Additionally, the real-time communications have strict requirements in terms of time. In order to solve this well-known issue, in this work, we combine the automatic feature extraction and learning ability of recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for designing a modulation recognition model for underwater acoustic signals. The proposed model is based on deep hybrid neural networks called recurrent and convolutional neural network (R&CNN). As compared with the traditional modulation recognition techniques, this method achieves higher recognition accuracy without manual feature extraction. The experimental results show that the validation accuracy of the proposed R&CNN’s on the Trestle data set is 98.21%. Similarly, the validation accuracy of the proposed R&CNN’s on the South China Sea data set is 99.38%. The average recognition time is 7.164ms. As compared with the conventional deep learning methods, the proposed R&CNN not only has a higher recognition accuracy, but also greatly reduces the recognition time.}

To reduce the mean decoding error probability in time-varying network environments, this work designs a reliable learning algorithm for providing a long-term resource allocation, where the reward feedback is based on the instantaneous network performance. With the aid of the proposed algorithm, this paper addresses three main challenges of the reliable resource sharing in NOMA-URLLC networks: 1) user clustering; 2) Instantaneous feedback system; and 3) Optimal resource allocation. All of these designs interact with the considered communication environment. Lastly, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with conventional Q-learning and SARSA Q-learning algorithms. The simulation outcomes show that: 1) Compared with the traditional Q learning algorithms, the proposed solution is able to converge within 200 episodes for providing as low as\n10\n−2\nlong-term mean error; 2) NOMA assisted URLLC outperforms traditional OMA systems in terms of decoding error probabilities; and 3) The proposed feedback system is efficient for the long-term learning process.}

Benefiting from the programmability and tunability of metamaterials, the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) inlaid with numerous metamaterial radiation elements shows its great potential to achieve such a bold vision. By leveraging the holographic principle, the RHS serves as an ultra-thin and lightweight antenna integrated with the transceiver to generate desirable directional beams with low hardware cost and power consumption. In this paper, we consider a downlink RHS-aided multi-user communication system where a base station (BS) equipped with an RHS transmits signals to users. We propose an RHS-based hybrid beamforming scheme where the digital beamforming and the holographic beamforming are performed at the BS and RHS, respectively, together with the receive combining at each user. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem for RHS-based hybrid beamforming and decompose it into three sub-problems. A joint sum-rate maximization algorithm is then developed to solve the sub-problems in an alternating manner. Simulation results show that based on the proposed RHS-aided hybrid beamforming scheme, a moderate-sized RHS is enough to achieve a satisfactory sum-rate, which is also higher than a same-sized phased array can achieve.}

In this paper, we derive the exact achievable rate of the DCO-OFDM system with finite-alphabet inputs for the first time. Furthermore, we investigate SE maximization problems of the DCO-OFDM system subject to both electrical and optical power constraints. By exploiting the relationship between the mutual information and the minimum mean-squared error, we propose a multi-level mercury-water-filling power allocation scheme to achieve the maximum SE. Moreover, the EE maximization problems of the DCO-OFDM system are studied, and the Dinkelbach-type power allocation scheme is developed for the maximum EE. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed theories and power allocation schemes.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) promises to fulfill the fast-growing connectivities in future Internet of Things (IoT) using abundant multiple-access signatures. While explicitly notifying the utilized NOMA signatures causes large signaling cost, blind signature classification naturally becomes a low-cost option. To accomplish signature classification for NOMA, we study both likelihood- and feature-based methods. A likelihood-based method is firstly proposed and showed to be optimal in the asymptotic limit of the observations, despite high computational complexity. While feature-based classification methods promise low complexity, efficient features are non-trivial to be manually designed. To this end, we resort to artificial intelligence (AI) for deep learning-based automatic feature extraction. Specifically, our proposed deep neural network for signature classification, namely DeepClassifier, establishes on the insights gained from the likelihood-based method, which contains two stages to respectively deal with a single observation and aggregate the classification results of an observation sequence. The first stage utilizes an iterative structure where each layer employs a memory-extended network to explicitly exploit the knowledge of signature pool. The second stage incorporates the straight-through channels within a deep recurrent structure to avoid information loss of previous observations. Experiments show that DeepClassifier approaches the optimal likelihood-based method with a reduction of 90% complexity.}

	abstract = {In the coming 6G communications, the internet of things (IoT) will be a fundamental enabler for ubiquitous environment perception, which requires the IoT sensors to consume near-zero power and have the lowest cost. For this purpose, the IoT sensors are expected to perform simultaneous sensing and transmission, so that energy and hardware costs due to signal modulation can be saved. In this paper, we propose the concept of meta-IoT, i.e., the IoT with sensors composed of specially designed meta-materials, which can achieve simultaneous sensing and transmission without supplied power. The basic idea of meta-IoT sensors is that the signal reflection on the sensors is sensitive to environmental conditions, which can be captured by a wireless receiver. In order to optimize the sensing systems with meta-IoT sensors, we establish the mathematical model of meta-IoT sensors’ sensing and transmission and then jointly optimize the sensors’ structure and the environment estimation at the receiver. We design and implement a practical meta-IoT sensing system for monitoring temperature and humidity levels. Simulation results show that the proposed technique can obtain the optimal sensor structure, and the experimental results verify that the designed meta-IoT sensing system achieves low measurement errors.}

In this work, we consider the distributed reduced-rank beam coordination over an array network, equipped with a collection of potentially massive arrays interconnected via a certain topology. We develop a diffusion reduced-rank beam coordination algorithm along with an inherently adaptive combination scheme based on the combination matrix for beam coordination, leveraging the joint iterative alternating optimization methodology. We propose two efficient adaptive implementations with parametric matrix combination schemes, which could further enhance the robustness of the distributed reduced-rank beam coordination algorithm against the spatial variations of the signal and noise powers. The proposed distributed reduced-rank beam coordination algorithm could not only remarkably speed the initial convergence in comparison with its full-rank counterparts under the small-sample conditions, but also achieve comparable steady-state performance with sufficiently large sample size. The tracking capability could also be enhanced with the proposed algorithm as a by-product. Illustrative simulations validate the efficiency of the proposed reduced-rank beam coordination algorithm.}

In this paper, we focus on the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio for the cache-enabled networks where the locations of the base stations are modeled as a Poisson point process. With the application of the random caching and the random discontinuous transmission schemes, we derive the moments of the conditional successful transmission probability, the exact meta distribution and its beta approximation by utilizing stochastic geometry. The closed-form expressions of the mean and variance of the local delay (i.e., the jitter) are also derived. We then consider the maximization of the mean successful transmission probability and the minimization of the average system transmission delay by jointly optimizing the caching probability and the BS active probability. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed optimization schemes over the existing caching strategies and reveal the impacts of the key network parameters on the cache-enabled networks in terms of successful transmission probability, successful transmission probability variance, meta distribution, mean local delay and jitter.}

	abstract = {The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) converges the rapidly developing ground, aerial and satellite communication networks to provide users with efficient and personalized services through the multi-layer network architecture. The complex structure, inconsistent communication protocol, and incompatible equipment significantly affect the information transmission efficiency in SAGINs. The application of Software Defined Network (SDN) technology promotes global deployment of the SAGIN resources. Aiming at the information transmission bottleneck between controller and switch nodes in the software-defined SAGINs, a dynamic handover transmission control scheme based on the queuing game model is proposed. Considering long transmission delay links in the SAGINs, the traditional queuing game model is improved to reduce the number of information interactions. The users’ service value are defined as the random distribution to describe the various requirements in the network. In addition, the relationship between the social welfare and the arrival rate of the transmission control system is discussed under two modes of observable and unobservable controller queues. Through theoretical analysis and calculation, the unique handover arrival rate is obtained to make the social welfare equal in the two modes. When the arrival rate is less than the handover threshold, the controller queue is set to unobservable mode, and otherwise to observable mode. Then, the system can operate in an optimal way to obtain the maximum benefit. At last, numerical and system simulation verify the effectiveness of the scheme.}

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) implements mobile edge computing (MEC) services as software appliances, and allows resources to be adaptively allocated to accommodate demand variations. Scalability and network cost (including operational cost and response latency) are key challenges. This paper presents a new game-theoretic approach to minimizing the network cost, where access points (APs) select MEC servers and routes in a decentralized manner, and unloaded routers and links are deactivated for cost saving. The key idea is that we interpret the minimization of network cost as a mixed game with a non-monotonic cost function capturing both the operational cost and response latency. We prove that the game is conditionally an ordinary potential game and converges to\nα\n-approximate equilibriums. A closed-form expression is derived for the convergence delay. Another important aspect is that we integrate Stackelberg routing into the proposed mixed game to avoid inefficient equilibriums (with high cost or latency). We prove that the mixed game can converge faster to better equilibriums under linear response latency models. Extensive simulations corroborate the new game-theoretic approach can significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of efficiency, convergence, and scalability.}

By artificially imposing structures on the UE-RRH connectivity, we model the network by a partially-connected interference network, so that the pilot assignment problem can be cast as a topological interference management problem with multiple groupcast messages. Building upon such connection, we formulate the topological pilot assignment (TPA) problem in two different ways with respect to whether or not the to-be-estimated channel connectivity pattern is known a priori . When it is known, we formulate the TPA problem as a low-rank matrix completion problem that can be solved by a simple alternating projection algorithm. Otherwise, we formulate it as a sequential maximum weight induced matching problem that can be solved by either a mixed integer linear program or a simple yet efficient greedy algorithm. With respect to two different formulations of the TPA problem, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms under the cell-free massive MIMO setting.}

Even though proximity sensing information can be easily monitored with pervasive smartphones, it is almost impossible to remotely monitor this information in a harsh location where it is not easy to access the Internet. With our overlay mesh network, each node should decide to either forward the packet or continue with their own activity when receiving the packet forwarding request, so as to minimize the end-to-end packet delivery latency but maximize the utilization of underlying infrastructures. Reinforcement learning (RL) is employed to train each node to make the above decision. Despite extensive upfront training, there is a high possibility that each node might still encounter an unseen state owing to the network dynamics. However, our novel Q-learning is able to deal with above challenges by constructing a Q-table during online learning, and then use the Q-table as input data for offline training. The experimental results indicate the substantial performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison to the existing Q-learning methods.}

	abstract = {In the intelligent communication field, deep learning (DL) has attracted much attention due to its strong fitting ability and data-driven learning capability. Compared with the typical DL feedforward network structures, an enhancement structure with direct data feedback have been studied and proved to have better performance than the feedfoward networks. However, due to the above simple feedback methods lack sufficient analysis and learning ability on the feedback data, it is inadequate to deal with more complicated nonlinear systems and therefore the performance is limited for further improvement. In this paper, a novel multi-agent feedback enabled neural network (MAFENN) framework is proposed, consisting of three fully cooperative intelligent agents, which make the framework have stronger feedback learning capabilities and more intelligence on feature abstraction, denoising or generation, etc. Furthermore, the MAFENN frame work is theoretically formulated into a three-player Feedback Stackelberg game, and the game is proved to converge to the Feedback Stackelberg equilibrium. The design of MAFENN framework and algorithm are dedicated to enhance the learning capability of the feedfoward DL networks or their variations with the simple data feedback. To verify the MAFENN framework’s feasibility in wireless communications, a multi-agent MAFENN based equalizer (MAFENN-E) is developed for wireless fading channels with inter-symbol interference (ISI). Experimental results show that when the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme is adopted, the SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of the traditional equalizers by about 2 dB in linear channels. When in nonlinear channels, the SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of either traditional or DL based equalizers more significantly, which shows the effectiveness and robustness of our proposal in the complex channel environment.}

As the distance-based relay selection leads to spatial correlation between cooperative transmission distances in a cluster, we first derive a general joint probability distribution function of cooperative transmission distances based on \\psi -order statistics. Then, the transmission success probability of the stochastic clustered cooperative systems with decode-and-forward (DF) scheme is derived. In order to reduce computational complexity, we offer an approximate expression of the transmission success probability. Furthermore, we provide an asymptotic transmission success probability in the interference-limited scenario, when the number of candidate relays in a cluster is sufficiently large. Besides, the performance analysis framework is extended into the clustered cooperative systems with finite relay distribution regions. Taking the cluster member distributions of Thomas cluster process (TCP) and Matérn cluster process (MCP) as examples, we verify our theoretical analysis via Monte-Carlo simulations. With the theoretical results, the optimization of relay selection parameter is also demonstrated.}

	abstract = {Cooperative radio localization and navigation systems can be used in scenarios where the reception of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals is not possible or impaired. While the benefit of cooperation has been highlighted by many papers, calibration is not widely considered, but equally important in practice. Utilizing the signal propagation time requires group delay or ranging bias calibration and estimating the directions-of-arrival (DoAs) requires antenna response calibration. Often, calibration parameters are determined only once before operation. However, the calibration parameters are influenced by e.g. changing temperatures of radio frequency (RF) components or changing surroundings of antennas. To cope with that, we derive a cooperative simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC) algorithm based on Bayesian filtering, which estimates antenna responses and ranging biases simultaneously with positions and orientations. By simulations, we show that the calibration parameters can be estimated during operation without additional sensors. We further proof practical applicability of SLAC by evaluating measurement data from robotic rovers. With SLAC, both ranging and DoAs estimation performance is improved, resulting in better position and orientation estimation accuracy. SLAC is thus able to provide reliable calibration and to mitigate model mismatch. Finally, we discuss open research questions and possible extensions of SLAC.}

	abstract = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) within UAV-assisted free-space optical (FSO) communication systems can efficiently accommodate massive connections and provide highly reliable and seamless communications. In this work, we investigate the performance of a UAV-assisted, asymmetric, dual-hop radio frequency (RF)/FSO system with the amplified-and-forward relay protocol for the SAGIN. Specifically, the shadowed Rician fading is utilized in this study to characterize the shadowing effect on the RF signal for the satellite-to-UAV link. Meanwhile, the atmospheric turbulence effect on the optical signal for the UAV-to-terrestrial user link is modeled by the Málaga distribution fading, in view of the pointing error impairments. For comparison, the heterodyne detection technique is employed, as well as the intensity modulation with direct detection technique, in improving performance of the relay system. Thus, we derive the closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, probability density function, the moment generating function, and particularly, the moments of the end-to-end RF/FSO system, in terms of Meijer’s G-function. Utilizing these derived formulae, the precise closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the average bit error rate (BER) with various modulation schemes, and the ergodic capacity are given. In specific, the tight asymptotic results for the outage probability and the average BER at the high SNR regions are derived using the asymptotic expansion of Meijer’s G-function. Furthermore, closed-form expressions are presented for the case that the FSO link experiences Gamma-Gamma distribution by changing some specific parameters. Finally, extensive numerical results validate the theoretical results with the Monte-Carlo simulation.}

The two novel channel estimation techniques proposed in the paper, single-path approximated channel (SPAC) and selective emphasis on rank-one matrices (SEROM), have low training overhead to enable practical IRS-empowered SU-MIMO systems. SPAC is mainly based on parameter estimation by approximating IRS-related channels as dominant single-path channels. SEROM exploits IRS phase shifts as well as training signals for channel estimation and easily adjusts its training overhead. A closed-form solution for IRS phase shift design is also developed to maximize spectral efficiency where the solution only requires basic linear operations. Numerical results show that SPAC and SEROM combined with the proposed IRS phase shift design achieve high spectral efficiency even with low training overhead compared to existing methods.}

Building on the so-called theory of teams , we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal TMMSE precoding, in the form of an infinite dimensional linear system of equations. These optimality conditions are further specialized to cell-free massive MIMO networks, and explicitly solved for two important examples, i.e., the classical case of local CSIT and the case of unidirectional CSIT sharing along a serial fronthaul. The latter case is relevant, e.g., for the recently proposed radio stripe concept and the related advances on sequential processing exploiting serial connections. In both cases, our optimal design outperforms the heuristic methods that are known from the previous literature. Duality arguments and numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed team theoretical approach in terms of ergodic achievable rates under a sum-power constraint.}

We use the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, and show that the large arrays used in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications enable accurate localization in the array near-field, even at the narrow bandwidths typically encountered at low carrier frequencies. We validate our findings experimentally with a massive MIMO testbed operating at 3.5 GHz carrier frequency and 18 MHz OFDM bandwidth in an indoor environment. We consider a single moving cylinder, and demonstrate a median accuracy of (3.4, 5.6) cm in (\nx\n,\ny\n) in the near-field. We show that the accuracy is maintained with only a single subcarrier, and that the resolution increases with an order of magnitude when combining all antennas, effectively surpassing the 16.67 m bistatic range resolution set by the OFDM waveform. We use a radar symbol duration of\n71.88 μ\ns at an effective transmission period of 2.5 ms, which indicates that the radar and communication systems can be implemented in time-division with a capacity loss of only 2.9%. Our results suggest that near-field radar sensing can be integrated into future massive MIMO systems operating at low carrier frequencies and narrow bandwidths.}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is seen as a potential access option for fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication (Wang et al. , 2014) and (Ayyash et al. , 2016) and beyond 5G (Strinati et al. , 2019). A reliable VLC system benefits from an accurate estimate of the receiver’s position and orientation. In many cases, the orientation of the receiver is estimated with an external orientation estimation device. However, these devices generally suffer from drift and misalignment, causing an uncertainty in the orientation presented to the receiver. Hence, the external device can only provide a probability distribution of the orientation to the position estimator, which can be used as prior information for the position estimation. Since the orientation of a receiver greatly affects the performance of a visible light system, the orientation uncertainty will degrade the performance of standard positioning algorithms, implying it should be taken into account when designing a robust positioning algorithm. In this paper, we design an received signal strength (RSS)-based hybrid position and orientation estimation algorithm using the hybrid maximum likelihood (ML)/maximum a posteriori (MAP) (HyMM) principle for a multiple LEDs - multiple photodiodes (PDs) (MLMP) system to take into account the presence of prior information on the orientation. The proposed HyMM estimator is compared with three existing estimators, i.e., the simultaneous position and orientation (SPO) estimator, the misspecified maximum likelihood (MML) estimator and the first-order-approximation-based positioning algorithm, subject to the orientation uncertainty. Further, in order to analytically assess the performance of the proposed estimator, the theoretical lower bound on the mean squared error (MSE), i.e. the hybrid Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) for HyMM is derived. Computer simulations show an asymptotic tightness between the performance of the estimator and its associated theoretical lower bound.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel physical beam sharing system to use few radio-frequency (RF) chains to support more users. The concept of beam sharing is to design a beam pattern to simultaneously benefit all users. In this proposed system, every user can receive a number of data streams equal to the number of RF chains at the base station (BS) and achieve full multiplexing gain. A special design example is that the BS can support multiple users simultaneously even with only one RF chain. As a result, the computational and hardware costs of the BS can be significantly reduced due to the decreased RF chains in deploying a dense communications network. We first derive beamforming designs for this proposed system in a MISO channel with one data stream. Then, the results are further extended to MIMO channels with multiple data streams. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes with the derived solutions outperform conventional systems in several interested parameter settings, and have advantages in terms of fairness and complexity compared with NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) systems. Moreover, we also implemented 28 GHz hardware platforms with an\n8×8\nantenna array to verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed schemes as well as measure the resulting beam patterns. The over-the-air (OTA) testings validate the concept of the proposed physical beam sharing and show that it outperforms conventional physical beamforming schemes.}

	abstract = {In a 5G integrated backhaul and access (IAB) network, an IAB-donor and multiple IAB-nodes form a multi-hop wireless backhaul network. When a terminal is connected to an IAB-node, the traffic flows generated by the terminal can be backhauled to the IAB-donor. Due to the mobility of terminals, access links are error-prone and cause difficulty in ensuring end-to-end quality of service (QoS) of traffic flows. To improve access link reliability, multi-connectivity is considered in IAB, i.e., a terminal is connected to multiple IAB-nodes. However, to ensure end-to-end QoS, multi-connectivity must be considered together with multi-hop backhauling. Thus, an effective-capacity based resource allocation (eReal) scheme is developed to establish end-to-end multi-connectivity. The objective of the scheme is to guarantee end-to-end QoS and ensure outage probability is below the given threshold. Since traffic flows are classified into the guaranteed bit rate (GBR) and the non-GBR types, the scheme is formulated as two joint route selection and resource allocation problems to provide differentiated services with minimum resource consumption. Since both problems are NP-hard, they are solved using column generation. Performance results show that eReal serves various traffic flows with over 95% QoS guarantees and also significantly outperforms existing schemes.}

The design of efficient and high-performance multi-user detection (MUD) scheme is a challenging issue of GF-NOMA, especially when the number of active users is unknown and relatively high. This paper adopts Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) approaches to solve the MUD problem of GF-NOMA in MTC. The MUD problem within a certain access slot is formulated as a Single Measurement Vector (SMV) model and efficiently solved via SBL-based methods. To further improve the MUD performance, we set up a Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) model and develop block SBL-based MUD methods, by exploiting the temporal correlation of user activity over successive access slots. Then to extend the usage of the aforementioned algorithms to the scenarios with relatively high, or quasi-sparse, user activity, we propose novel SBL-based MUD algorithms via post sparse error recovery methodology, for both the SMV and MMV problem models. Simulation results show that the proposed SBL-based MUD algorithms achieve substantial performance gain over traditional ones, especially when the number of active users is unknown and relatively high.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been increasingly considered in mobile edge computing (MEC), assisting smart terminals (STs) in offloading computationally-intense tasks to base stations (BSs). This paper presents a new IRS-assisted MEC framework, which jointly optimizes the local CPU frequencies of the STs, the receive beamformers of the BS, the ST offloading schedules, and the IRS phase configuration, to minimize the energy consumption of the STs. To this end, we reveal that the optimal CPU frequency is time-invariant for each ST. Under flat-fading channels, the IRS phases and the receive beamformers of the BS can be then decoupled from the offloading schedules. Based on this structure, we develop an alternating optimization to solve the IRS phase configuration and the receive beamformers, and then exploit the Lagrange duality method to solve the offloading schedules. We prove that the overall algorithm is guaranteed to compute a stationary point solution for the problem of interest with a low complexity. Under frequency-selective channels, we also develop a new alternating optimization algorithm to minimize the energy consumption, where manifold optimization is leveraged to effectively solve the IRS phase shifts. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms are superior to existing techniques in terms of energy efficiency under both flat-fading and frequency-selective channels.}

In this paper we address the task of making shadowing predictions for transceiver locations, without the need of measurements for those locations. A spatial loss field estimate is produced from measurements for a given set of transceiver locations, and used as an input to predict the shadowing at another set of transceiver locations. Moreover, new weighting functions are proposed and developed from channel parameter estimates of the propagation paths.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the fundamental power allocation problem in cell-free massive mutiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems which aims at maximizing the total energy efficiency (EE) under a sum power constraint at each access point (AP) and a quality-of-service (QoS) constraint at each user. Existing solutions for this optimization problem are based on solving a sequence of second-order cone programs (SOCPs), whose computational complexity scales dramatically with the network size. Therefore, they are not implementable for practical large-scale cell-free massive MIMO systems. To tackle this issue, we propose an iterative power control algorithm based on the frame work of an accelerated projected gradient (APG) method. In particular, each iteration of the proposed method is done by simple closed-form expressions, where a penalty method is applied to bring constraints into the objective in the form of penalty functions. Finally, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is analytically proved and numerically compared to the known solution based on SOCP. Simulations results demonstrate that our proposed power control algorithm can achieve the same EE as the existing SOCPs-based method, but more importantly, its run time is much lower (one to two orders of magnitude reduction in run time, compared to the SOCPs-based approaches).}

In this paper, we investigate two aspects of the NIF space-time user scheduling in a multi-cell mmWave network with multi-RF-chain base stations. Firstly, given that each user has a requirement on the number of space-time resource elements, we study the NIF user scheduling problem to minimize the unfulfilled user requirements, so that the space-time resources can be utilized most efficiently and meanwhile all strong interferences are avoided. A near-optimal scheduling algorithm is proposed with performance close to the lower bound of unfulfilled requirements. Furthermore, we study the joint NIF user scheduling and power allocation problem to minimize the total transmit power under the constraint of rate requirements. Based on our proposed NIF scheduling, an energy-efficient joint scheduling and power allocation scheme is designed with limited channel state information, which outperforms the existing independent set based schemes, and has near-optimal performance as well.}

First, we briefly review the vector quantization (VQ) approach and related single user throughput-optimal formulations for AP placement. Then, we investigate the small-cell case with multiple users and expose the limitations of mean squared error based VQ for solving this problem. While the Lloyd algorithm from the VQ approach is found not to strictly solve the small-cell case, based on the tractability and quality of the resulting AP placement, we deem it suitable as a simple and appropriate framework to solve more complicated problems. Accordingly, to minimize ICI and consequently enhance achievable throughput, we design two Lloyd-type algorithms, namely the Interference Lloyd algorithm and the Inter-AP Lloyd algorithm, both of which incorporate ICI in their distortion functions. Simulation results show that both of the proposed algorithms provide superior 95%-likely rate over the traditional Lloyd algorithm and the Inter-AP Lloyd algorithm yields a significant increase of up to 36.34% in achievable rate over the Lloyd algorithm.}

Due to the sporadic user activity in mMTC, joint user identification and channel estimation (JUICE) is a main challenge. This paper addresses the JUICE in single-cell mMTC with single-antenna users and a multi-antenna base station (BS) under spatially correlated fading channels. In particular, by leveraging the sporadic user activity, we solve the JUICE in a multi measurement vector compressed sensing (CS) framework under two different cases, with and without the knowledge of prior channel distribution information (CDI) at the BS. First, for the case without prior information, we formulate the JUICE as an iterative reweighted\nℓ\n2,1\n-norm minimization problem. Second, when the CDI is known to the BS, we exploit the available information and formulate the JUICE from a Bayesian estimation perspective as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem. For both JUICE formulations, we derive efficient iterative solutions based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The numerical experiments show that the proposed solutions achieve higher channel estimation quality and activity detection accuracy with shorter pilot sequences compared to existing algorithms.}

In particular, a UE connects either directly to its serving terrestrial BS by an access link or connects first to its serving UAV which is then wirelessly backhauled to a terrestrial BS (joint access and backhaul). We consider realistic antenna radiation patterns for both BSs and UAVs using practical models developed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). We assume a probabilistic channel model for the air-to-ground transmission, which incorporates both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links. Assuming the max-power association policy, we study the performance of the network in both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we analyze the joint distribution of distance and zenith angle of the closest (and serving) UAV to the origin in a 3D setting. Further, we identify and extensively study key mathematical constructs as the building blocks of characterizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution. Using these results, we obtain exact mathematical expressions for the coverage probability in both AF and DF relaying protocols. Furthermore, considering the fact that backhaul links could be quite weak because of the downtilted antennas at the BSs, we propose and analyze the addition of a directional uptilted antenna at the BS that is solely used for backhaul purposes. The superiority of having directional antennas with wirelessly backhauled UAVs is further demonstrated via simulation.}

	abstract = {Increasing the deployment density of small base stations (SBS) is a key method designed to satisfy high data traffic in 5th generation mobile network (5G). However, a large number of SBSs in such ultra-dense network (UDN) may cause ping-pong handovers (HOs), accompanied by increased delay and HO failure. In addition, because of the separation of control and data signaling in 5G, the HO procedure must be performed in both layers. In this paper, we introduce an SDN-based intelligent dynamic HO parameter optimization strategy to minimize both HO failures and ping-pong HOs together. The goal of the proposed strategy is to reduce the HO failure rate and redundant HO (i.e. ping-pong HO) while enabling user equipment (UE) to make full use of the benefits of dense deployment of BSs. Simulation results present that the method proposed in this paper effectively suppresses the ping-pong effect and keeps it at a low level in all of the investigated scenes. In addition, compared with the other algorithms, the HO failure rate is significantly reduced and the throughput of UE is greatly increased, especially in the case of high BS density. Therefore, the benefits of intensive BS deployment are retained.}

	abstract = {Elevating base stations (BSs) in the air, forming what are called aerial platforms (APs), has recently been treated as a promising solution to the problems of coverage, deployment and cost savings in mobile networks. Unlike terrestrial transmission with fixed BSs, AP-assisted air-to-ground (A2G) communications require joint optimization of the transmit parameters and AP service position, which is challenging due to the unknown propagation environment in the overall flying area. In this paper, a novel binary channel feature map (CFM) concept is proposed to grant the AP knowledge of the global propagation environment. With the assistance of the binary CFM, a unified A2G information and energy delivery framework is proposed, which includes three modules, i.e., a transmit optimization and user satisfaction evaluation module, an offline AP position planning module and an online AP position adjustment module. These modules operate coordinately to jointly perform beamforming matrix optimization for information delivery, transmit covariance optimization for energy delivery, and three-dimension AP service position planning and real-time adjustment. The simulation results reveal that the proposed framework can achieve higher user satisfaction level and lower outage probability, and can result in great savings of battery power or fuel in the AP when compared with reference schemes.}

	abstract = {We study the joint user association and resource allocation problem in both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) for full-duplex heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), wherein base stations (BSs) are densely deployed with reusable subchannels and highly variable transmit powers. To reap the benefits of BS densification, decoupled multiple-association (DMA) is considered, which enables each user equipment (UE) to associate with multiple BSs for UL and DL in a decoupled manner. Furthermore, in order to provide the best service, appropriate holistic subchannel and power allocation are jointly studied and an optimization problem is formulated. However, it is challenging to solve the joint problem due to its combinatorial nature. To this end, we formulate a novel distributed four-sided matching game in which the UEs, BSs, subchannels, and power levels are ranked based on designed preference metrics for optimal matching. To obtain the solution, a low-complexity algorithm is developed. The convergence of the algorithm to a stable matching is proved and the worst-case complexity is analyzed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of the UEs’ sum-rate in UL and DL, respectively. The superiority of DMA is also investigated by comparisons.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel wireless architecture, mounted on a high-altitude aerial platform, which is enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). By installing RIS on the aerial platform, rich line-of-sight and full-area coverage can be achieved, thereby, overcoming the limitations of the conventional terrestrial RIS. We consider a scenario where a sudden increase in traffic in an urban area triggers authorities to rapidly deploy unmanned-aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) to serve the ground users. In this scenario, since the direct backhaul link from the ground source can be blocked due to several obstacles from the urban area, we propose reflecting the backhaul signal using aerial-RIS so that it successfully reaches the UAV-BSs. We jointly optimize the placement and array-partition strategies of aerial-RIS and the phases of RIS elements, which leads to an increase in energy-efficiency of every UAV-BS. We show that the complexity of our algorithm can be bounded by the quadratic order, thus implying high computational efficiency. We verify the performance of the proposed algorithm via extensive numerical evaluations and show that our method achieves an outstanding performance in terms of energy-efficiency compared to benchmark schemes.}

In this context, the base station reconstructs the full channel state information in the downlink frequency range based on limited downlink channel state information feedback from the mobile terminal. The channel state information recovery is based on a convolutional neural network which is trained exclusively on collected channel state samples acquired in the uplink frequency domain. No acquisition of training samples in the downlink frequency range is required at all. Finally, after a detailed presentation and analysis of the proposed technique and its performance, the “reciprocity of distribution” assumption of the convolutional neural network that is central to the proposed approach is validated with an analysis based on the maximum mean discrepancy metric.}

As a revolutionizing technology, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) offers an ability to reconfigure the wireless environment dynamically and passively, which is considered beneficial to improve the performance of VLC. This paper devotes to investigating the effect of VLC IRS and putting forward a joint resource management method for an instantaneous IRS-aided VLC system. To this end, the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS channel gains are first discussed under the point source assumption, after which the system model is established and the optimization problem is formulated. Then, the frozen variable algorithm and minorization-maximization algorithm are proposed to iteratively maximize the overall spectral efficiency (SE), and detailed discussions on the weak/severe interference cases and computational complexity analysis are carried out. Moreover, numerical results are provided to show the improvement of SE and the effects of the proposed algorithms, which offers beneficial insights on joint resource management of IRS-aided VLC.}

However, the corresponding performance under physical models has not been explored; in particular it remains unclear whether link-level power control and scheduling can improve the asymptotic performance. This paper thus investigates the throughput-outage scaling laws of cache-aided single-hop D2D networks considering a general physical channel model. By considering the networks with and without the equal-throughput assumption, we analyze the corresponding outer bounds and provide the achievable performance analysis. Results show that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, using link-level power control and scheduling cannot improve the scaling laws. On the other hand, when the equal-throughput assumption is not considered, we show that the proposed double time-slot framework with appropriate link-level power control and scheduling can significantly improve the throughput-outage scaling laws, where the fundamental concept is to first distinguish links according to their communication distances, and then enhance the throughput for links with small communication distances.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth in mobile data traffic, ultra-dense network (UDN) where a large number of small cells are densely deployed on top of macro cells has received a great deal of attention in recent years. While UDN offers a number of benefits, an upsurge of energy consumption in UDN due to the intensive deployment of small cells has now become a major bottleneck in achieving the primary goals viz., 100-fold increase in the throughput in 5G+ and 6G. In recent years, an approach to reduce the energy consumption of base stations (BSs) by selectively turning off the lightly-loaded BSs, referred to as the sleep mode technique, has been suggested. However, determining an appropriate active/sleep modes of BSs is a difficult task due to the huge computational overhead and inefficiency caused by the frequent BS mode conversion. An aim of this paper is to propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to achieve a reduction of energy consumption in UDN. Key ingredient of the proposed scheme is to use decision selection network to reduce the size of action space. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the energy consumption of UDN while ensuring the rate requirement of network.}

	abstract = {Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying relays is becoming an indispensable strategy to assist terrestrial cellular networks to enhance coverage. One challenging problem for UAV-integrated cellular networks is how to design their deployment and association schemes to provide on-demand coverage with minimum network power consumption. In this paper, the uplink transmission in a UAV-assisted cellular network is studied with the objective of minimizing the transmit power consumption of users and UAVs through designing proper UAV deployment and association schemes. To avoid the computational complexity caused by the estimation of instantaneous position of users, we investigate UAV deployment and association schemes based on the statistical user position. By discretizing the space where UAV can be located, we build a centralized multi-agent\nQ\n-learning algorithm, with which multiple UAVs update their positions in a joint manner. In the training process of\nQ\n-learning algorithm, a reward function is built based on the optimal association scheme and its corresponding power consumption. By adopting the optimal transport theory, the existence of the unique optimal association scheme for given statistical user distribution and UAVs’ state is proved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs considerably outperform the similar existing algorithms. Comparisons with the benchmark scheme show that the proposed scheme can bring about 85% energy efficiency improvement under the same simulation setups.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as an attractive solution by executing computation-intensive services at a powerful edge server instead of mobiles. Two types of data are necessary to this end. One is user-specific data acquired from mobiles, called computation offloading (CO). The other is service-specific data downloaded from a central cloud, called service caching (SC). It is noteworthy that CO and SC decisions are coupled when each user’s service preference (SP) is personalized. Specifically, noting that the optimal SC is to cache services likely to be requested more frequently, the resultant SC tends to be biased to the SP of the user whose offloading rate is high. On the other hand, such an SC decision causes longer computing latency of users with a relatively low offloading rate, which ultimately limits a CO decision for agile MEC services. This work tackles this issue from a sum-utility maximization perspective under radio-resource and computation-latency constraints. The average computation latency is first derived in closed-form by modeling a computation as a stochastic process following a hyper-exponential distribution. Based on it, we first consider the case for homogeneous SP where CO and SC decisions are decoupled. Thus, SC can be deterministically controlled using the homogeneous SP, while CO decision is independently determined, lying between water-filling and channel-inversion allocations. Next, we design a joint CO-and-SC policy for heterogeneous SP. CO and SC decisions are iteratively optimized with the other fixed by leveraging the homogeneous SP’s result. The optimal stopping rules are derived, guaranteeing the sum-utility enhancement. The proposed algorithm’s effectiveness is verified by simulations that the proposed CO-and-SC design for heterogenous SP always outperforms that for homogeneous SP.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel design named security-oriented polar coding (SOPC) is proposed to enhance the physical layer security (PLS), where the active pattern of frozen bits in a transmission is determined by random channel gain of the legitimate link. Since the channel gain value is not exchanged between the legitimate transmitter and the desired receiver, eavesdroppers cannot ascertain the frozen bit pattern engaged in the legitimate polar coding. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, eavesdroppers are unable to appropriately decode the confidential information delivered over the legitimate link. As the SNR increases, eavesdroppers may have chance to sort out the correct frozen bit pattern through a brute-force search. However, this chance is significantly reduced by our SOPC. We design the SOPC for both single-input-single-output single-antenna eavesdropper (SISOSE) and multiple-input-multiple-output multi-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels. Its PLS functioning is assessed in terms of the error rate difference between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Illustrative simulation results substantiate that the SOPC design guarantees degraded decoding performance at eavesdroppers, for both SISOSE and MIMOME channels, even in the presence of a powerful eavesdropper possessing infinite computational resources.}

Spatial non-stationarities and visibility regions (VRs) appear across the XL-MIMO array, since its large dimension is of the same order of the distances to the user-equipments (UEs). Due to the increased density of UEs in typical applications of XL-MIMO systems and the scarcity of pilots, the design of random access (RA) protocols and scheduling algorithms become challenging. In this paper, we propose a joint RA and scheduling protocol, namely non-overlapping VR XL-MIMO (NOVR-XL) RA protocol, which takes advantage of the different VRs of the UEs for improving RA performance, besides of seeking UEs with non-overlapping VRs to be scheduled in the same payload data pilot (PDP) resource. Our results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves significant gains in terms of sum-rate compared with traditional RA schemes, as well as reducing access latency and improving connectivity performance as a whole.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has recently become a prevailing technique to alleviate the intensive computation burden in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the limited device battery capacity and stringent spectrum resource significantly restrict the data processing performance of MEC-enabled IoT networks. To address the two performance limitations, we consider in this paper an MEC-enabled IoT system with a wireless device (WD) replenishing its battery by means of energy harvesting (EH) and opportunistically accessing the licensed spectrum of an overlaid primary communication link to offload its sensing data to an MEC server (MS) for edge processing. Under time-varying fading channel, random energy arrivals, and stochastic ON-OFF state of the primary link, we aim to design an online algorithm to jointly control the cognitive data sensing rate and processing method (i.e., local and edge processing) without knowing future system information. In particular, we aim to maximize the long-term average sensing rate of the WD subject to quality of service (QoS) requirement of primary link, average power constraint of MS and data queue stability of both MS and WD. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic optimization and propose an online algorithm named PLySE that applies the perturbed Lyapunov optimization technique to decompose the original problem into per-slot deterministic optimization problems. For each per-slot problem, we derive the closed-form optimal solution of data sensing and processing control to facilitate low-complexity real-time implementation. Interestingly, our analysis finds that the optimal solution exhibits an threshold-based structure related to the current energy state, secondary queueing backlogs and primary link activity. Simulation results collaborate with our analysis and demonstrate more than 46.7% data sensing rate improvement of the proposed PLySE over representative benchmark methods.}

It can be applied in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to further improve SE and user connectivity. However, the interference caused by spectrum sharing and the utilization of non-orthogonal resources can downgrade the achievable performance. In order to tackle this issue, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is exploited in a downlink multiple-input-single-output (MISO) CRN with NOMA. To realize a desirable tradeoff between SE and EE, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework is formulated under both the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). An iterative block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm is exploited to optimize the beamforming design and IRS reflection coefficients iteratively under the perfect CSI case. A safe approximation and the \\mathcal {S}\n-procedure are used to address the non-convex infinite inequality constraints of the problem under the imperfect CSI case. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a better balance between SE and EE than baseline schemes. Moreover, it is shown that both SE and EE of the proposed algorithm under the imperfect CSI can be significantly improved by exploiting IRS.}

First, we propose an analytical model of the effect of N\n-bit analog-to-digital converter (A/D) quantization noise on channel capacity quasi-upper limit of the desired signal at the base station of the IBFD systems. We derive averaged and peak powers of input signal to N\n-bit A/D and quantization noise power of N\n-bit A/D to formulate uplink (UL) channel capacity quasi-upper limit. Numerical analysis results by the proposed analytical model show that the UL channel capacity quasi-upper limit degrades by 16% and 80% in the 12- and 8-bit A/D, respectively. Second, we propose digital signal-processing (DSP)-assisted dual- and quad-A/Ds to reduce the quantization noise effect in IBFD systems. When A/D resolution bit is 8-bit, the proposed DSP-assisted dual- and quad-A/Ds improve the UL channel capacity quasi-upper limit by up to 92.3 and 192%, respectively, compared to conventional A/D for peak-to-average power ratio condition of 15 dB and analog self-interference (SI) cancellation capability of 30 dB. The proposed dual- and quad-A/Ds can reduce the burden on the analog SI cancellation circuitry by 6 and 12 dB, respectively.}

	abstract = {We consider the extra degree of freedom offered by the rotation of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) plane and investigate its potential in improving the performance of RIS-assisted wireless communication systems. By considering radiation pattern modeling at all involved nodes, we first derive the composite channel gain and present a closed-form upper bound for the system ergodic capacity over cascade Rician fading channels. Then, we reconstruct the composite channel gain by taking the rotations at the RIS plane, transmit antenna, and receive antenna into account, and extract the optimal rotation angles after investigating their impacts on the capacity. Moreover, we present a location-dependent expression of the ergodic capacity and investigate the RIS deployment strategy, i.e. the joint rotation adjustment and location selection. Finally, simulation results verify the accuracy of the theoretical analyses and deployment strategy. Although the RIS location has a big impact on the performance, our results showcase that the RIS rotation plays a more important role. In other words, we can obtain a considerable improvement by properly rotating the RIS rather than moving it over a wide area. For instance, we can achieve more than 200% performance improvement through rotating the RIS by 42.14°, while an 150% improvement is obtained by shifting the RIS over 400 meters.}

	abstract = {The application of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) over orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is envisioned to provide high-data-rate wireless transmission in high-mobility environments. However, in these communication scenarios, the multiple-dimensional interference, which can generate from space, delay and Doppler domains, challenges the channel equalization and symbol detection at the MIMO-OTFS receiver. To tackle this issue, we propose a time-space domain channel equalizer, relying on the mathematical least squares minimum residual algorithm, to remove the channel distortion on data symbols. The proposed channel equalizer adopts a recursion method to achieve symbol estimates, which can realize fast convergence by leveraging the sparsity of MIMO-OTFS channel matrix. Instead of directly remapping the equalized OTFS symbols into data bits, we develop an enhanced data detection (EDD) scheme to iteratively demodulate the superposed multi-antenna signal. The EDD can not only realize the linear-complexity interference cancellation, but also efficiently reap the spatial and multi-path diversities of MIMO-OTFS channel. The simulations show the proposed channel equalization and EDD algorithms enable the MIMO-OTFS receiver to robustly demodulate multi-stream 256-ary quadrature amplitude modulation symbols, under a maximum velocity of 550 km/h at 5.9 GHz carrier frequency.}

	abstract = {Networks of randomly distributed nodes appear in various fields, including forestry and wireless communications, and can often be modeled, using stochastic geometry theory, as Poisson point processs (PPPs). In these contexts, estimation of nodes density is important for monitoring and optimizing the network. Originally, this problem has been addressed in forestry where the trees are the nodes and, assuming these are distributed according to an infinite two-dimensional homogeneous PPP, the spatial density can be estimated by measuring the distances from one reference tree to its neighbors. However, in many other scenarios, nodes could result invisible with some probability, for example depending on distance. In this paper, we derive the Cramér-Rao bounds and new estimators for the node spatial density, taking into account a limited capability in sensing neighbors. As an example, we provide estimators of the spatial density of transmitting devices in wireless networks with links affected by thermal noise, path loss, and shadowing.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider user selection and downlink precoding for an over-loaded single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode, where the base station is equipped with a dual-polarized uniform planar array (DP-UPA) and serves a large number of single-antenna users. Due to the absence of uplink-downlink channel reciprocity and the high-dimensionality of channel matrices, it is extremely challenging to design downlink precoders using closed-loop channel probing and feedback with limited spectrum resource. To address these issues, a novel methodology – active channel sparsification (ACS) – has been proposed recently in the literature for uniform linear array (ULA) to design sparsifying precoders, which substantially reduces channel feedback overhead. Pushing forward this line of research, we aim to facilitate the potential deployment of ACS in practical FDD massive MIMO systems, by extending it from ULA to DP-UPA with explicit user selection and making the current ACS implementation simplified. To this end, by leveraging Toeplitz matrix theory, we start with the spectral properties of channel covariance matrices from the lens of their matrix-valued spectral density function. Inspired by these properties, we extend the original ACS using scalar-weight bipartite graph representation to the matrix-weight counterpart. Building upon such matrix-weight bipartite graph representation, we propose a multi-dimensional ACS (MD-ACS) method, which is a generalization of original ACS formulation and is more suitable for DP-UPA antenna configurations. The nonlinear integer program formulation of MD-ACS can be classified as a generalized multi-assignment problem (GMAP), for which we propose a simple yet efficient greedy algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed MD-ACS with greedy algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods based on the QuaDRiGa channel models.}

In this paper, we investigate the use of multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques to enable licensed spectrum sharing. Specifically, we present a fair spectrum sharing system between two MNOs in multi-cell multi-user MIMO networks. We impose fairness by ensuring that each MNO receives spectrum in proportion to the amount it contributes. We formulate a constrained optimization problem to determine resource allocation and user scheduling across two MNOs. Since the problem is non-convex, we develop an algorithm to provide an effective solution through fractional programming and block coordinate descent. Our numerical results illustrate that the proposed spectrum sharing scheme can achieve up to 60 % improvement in terms of the average user rate among the two operators while ensuring that neither MNO is exploited for participating in the sharing mechanism. This improvement is in relation to the baseline of each MNO using multi-user MIMO communications on its own. In addition, most users, especially cell-center users close to the BSs, take advantage of our proposed spectrum sharing framework.}

For satisfying the minimum rate requirement for cellular user and the reliability requirement for D2D user, we attempt to maximize the cellular user’s throughput whilst ensuring a chance constraint for D2D. Then, a robust resource allocation framework is proposed for solving the highly intractable chance constraint, where the CSI uncertainties are represented as a deterministic set and the reliability requirement is enforced to hold for any CSI within it. Then, a symmetrical-geometry-based learning approach is developed to model the uncertain CSI into polytope, ellipsoidal and box. After that, the chance constraint under these uncertainty sets is transformed into computation convenient convex constraints. To overcome the conservatism of symmetrical-geometry-based approach, we develop a support vector clustering (SVC)-based approach to model uncertain CSI as a compact convex uncertainty set. Based on that, the chance constraint is converted into a linear convex set. Then, we develop a bisection search-based power allocation algorithm for solving the resource allocation in D2D underlaying cellular network with the obtained convex constraints. Finally, we conduct the simulation to compare the proposed robust optimization approaches with the non-robust one.}

We formulate a joint optimization of link selection, resource allocation, and user association, aiming to maximize the sum logarithmic rate of all UEs. The formulated problem is solved by decomposing it into two levels of subproblems. The lower-level subproblem is link selection and resource allocation with a given user association, which is solved by a three-stage process. In the first stage, we establish the D2D relaying architecture by assuming that all UEs are served via D2D relaying. Based on the relaying architecture, we derive the optimal resource allocation in the second stage. Finally, an adaptive link selection algorithm is proposed in the third stage to determine the set of UEs that switch from D2D relaying to multi-beam reflection. The high-level subproblem is user association, for which we solve it with a dual decomposition-based approach. Simulation results indicate that compared to benchmark schemes, the average data rate achieved by the proposed scheme is significantly higher than the benchmark schemes and is close to an upper bound. Besides, the proposed scheme achieves a good tradeoff between system performance and fairness.}

Two types of localizers are developed from the perspectives of Bayesian inference and convex optimization. When the orientation angles are known, the positioning problem is resolved by a phase-only generalized approximate message passing (POG-AMP) algorithm with importance sampling mechanism. From the perspective of convex optimization, the positioning problem under\n2π/π\n-periodic AOAs is converted as a least square (LS) problem and then resolved by the gradient-descent/projected gradient-descent method named as Type-I LS localizer. When the orientations are unknown, expectation-maximization (EM) mechanism is introduced into the POG-AMP localizer, where node positions and orientations are alternatively updated through exchanging their statistical confidences. Type-II LS localizer is constructed by alternatively executing Type-I LS and a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator of orientation. Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) are derived for the proposed localizers. Simulation results validate that the proposed AMP-type and LS-type localizers outperform existing localizers, AMP-type localizers successfully handle nonlinear quantization losses, and EM-framework and ML estimator handle unknown orientation problem. AMP-type localizers outperform LS-type ones, and can approach to the CRLBs even under high noise contaminations.}

	abstract = {Blockage is a substantial problem at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, much more so than sub-6 GHz. Blockage events caused by objects such as cars and humans occur quickly and have substantial attenuation; typical attenuations in this work range from 11 to 22 dB, with a maximum of 32 dB. This problem is overcome with spatial diversity. During blockage events, mmWave transceivers can beamform towards an unblocked path. In this paper we explore this idea in depth: if the primary path is blocked, which alternate paths will be available? To answer this question, we have built a measurement system that uses 60 GHz phased arrays to rapidly obtain spatially resolved measurements of the channel. Scans are repeated every 3.2 ms, allowing us to observe blockage events that occur on the different paths in the channel. The design of this system is presented, and a description is given of three human-body blockage measurement campaigns. Paths are assigned states of blocked/unblocked, and each measurement is expressed as a time series of states which specify the status of each path. The evolution between states is described with a Markov model, and the measurement results are used to derive transition probabilities between states.}

In the delivery phase, the weighted graph based coded delivery scheme is conducted based on homogeneous cached contents, which can induce considerable multicast opportunities. By integrating the above two schemes, a joint MDS codes and weighted graph based coded caching policy is proposed to minimize the fronthaul load.

This paper considers a precoding optimization problem for maximizing EE in quantized downlink massive MIMO systems. To this end, we jointly optimize an active antenna set, precoding vectors, and allocated power; yet acquiring such joint optimal solution is challenging. To resolve this challenge, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power optimization problems. For precoding direction, we characterize the first-order optimality condition, which entails the effects of quantization distortion and antenna selection. We cast the derived condition as a functional eigenvalue problem, wherein finding the principal eigenvector attains the best local optimal point. To this end, we propose generalized power iteration based algorithm. To optimize precoding power for given precoding direction, we adopt a gradient descent algorithm for the EE maximization. Alternating these two methods, our algorithm identifies a joint solution of the active antenna set, the precoding direction, and allocated power. In simulations, the proposed methods provide considerable performance gains. Our results suggest that a few-bit DACs are sufficient for achieving high EE in massive MIMO systems.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has the potential to significantly enhance the network secure transmission performance by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. However, due to the passive nature of eavesdroppers and the cascaded channel brought by the RIS, the eavesdroppers’ channel state information is imperfect at the base station. Under channel uncertainty, the optimal phase-shift, power allocation, and transmission rate design for massive antennas and reflecting elements secure transmission are challenging to solve due to the outage probabilistic constraint with coupled variables. To fill this gap, this paper formulates a problem of energy-efficient secure transmission design with the probabilistic outage constraint. By leveraging the exponential distribution property of the received signal power, the stochastic resource allocation is equivalently transformed into a deterministic one, and the secure energy efficiency maximization problem can be iteratively solved via low complexity first-order algorithms under the alternating maximization (AM) framework. However, due to the nonsmooth problem, the convergence of the objective function value and nature of the converged solution under AM iteration are uncertain. Therefore, the convergence properties with respect to the objective function value and sequence of solutions are further established. Simulation results corroborate the convergence results of the first-order algorithms and show that the proposed algorithm achieves identical performance to the conventional method but saves at least two orders of magnitude in computation time. Moreover, the resultant RIS aided secure transmission significantly improves the energy efficiency compared to baseline schemes of random phase-shift, fixed phase-shift, and RIS ignoring CSI uncertainty.}

	abstract = {We analyze a Cognitive Radio-based Internet-of-Things (CR-IoT) network employing Microwave Power Transfer (MPT) method for energy-harvesting, targeted for smart city applications. In our model, multiple IoT sensors, operated by an IoT operator, coexist with a Primary Network Provider (PNP), where the IoT sensors opportunistically exploit the spectrum holes in the PNP’s licensed band. We develop an Imbedded Markov Chain based approach to analyze this system. During PNP’s inactivity periods, the Accesss Points (APs) under the IoT operator have to judiciously use PNP’s licensed band for data collection from the IoT sensors and charging them via the MPT method. Our analysis finds the balance between these activities while maintaining the Quality-of-Service and preventing energy deficit in the IoT sensors. We characterize PNP’s activity using any distribution, rather than exponential distribution used in literature, making our framework more accurate. We also consider the possibility of interruptions in the IoT operator’s activity due to PNP’s transmission, which has been overlooked in the literature. Extensive simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis. Our analysis can identify the values of system parameters that makes the system sustainable. We have also shown how to extend our model to accommodate multiple PNPs in the same CR-IoT network.}

	abstract = {Edge computing, which provides computation services at the edge of networks, has become a promising method to meet the massive computation demands of Internet of Things (IoT). To make full use of resources, a computation offloading scheme is needed in edge computing system. In this work, we propose an event-driven computation offloading scheme for the first time. Compared with the existing time-driven schemes, the proposed scheme has a smaller implementation complexity in some scenarios with computation-intensive task computing. In the proposed scheme, the priority of different tasks is jointly considered. To decide the optimal offloading action of the scheme, we formulate the offloading problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). Then, a model-based method is proposed to derive the optimal offloading policy under fully explored system by addressing the challengs of modeling. On the other hand, considering partially explored system, we propose an online double deep Q-network algorithm, which can deal with the poor scalability of the standard Q-learning algorithm, to derive the optimal offloading policy. In addition, we also introduce some tricks to accelerate the learning procedure. The simulation results show the superior performance of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Compared with the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), simultaneous transmitting and reflecting intelligent omini-surfaces (STAR-IOSs) are able to achieve 360° coverage “smart radio environments”. By splitting the energy or altering the active number of STAR-IOS elements, STAR-IOSs provide high flexibility of successive interference cancellation (SIC) orders for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Based on the aforementioned advantages, this paper investigates a STAR-IOS-aided downlink NOMA network with randomly deployed users. We first propose three tractable channel models for different application scenarios, namely the central limit model, the curve fitting model, and the M-fold convolution model. More specifically, the central limit model fits the scenarios with large-size STAR-IOSs while the curve fitting model is extended to evaluate multi-cell networks. However, these two models cannot obtain accurate diversity orders. Hence, we figure out the M-fold convolution model to derive accurate diversity orders. We consider three protocols for STAR-IOSs, namely, the energy splitting (ES) protocol, the time switching (TS) protocol, and the mode switching (MS) protocol. Based on the ES protocol, we derive closed-form analytical expressions of outage probabilities for the paired NOMA users by the central limit model and the curve fitting model. Based on three STAR-IOS protocols, we derive the diversity gains of NOMA users by the M-fold convolution model. The analytical results reveal that the diversity gain of NOMA users is equal to the active number of STAR-IOS elements. Numerical results indicate that 1) in high signal-to-noise ratio regions, the central limit model performs as an upper bound of the simulation results, while a lower bound is obtained by the curve fitting model; 2) the TS protocol has the best performance but requesting more time blocks than other protocols; 3) the ES protocol outperforms the MS protocol as the ES protocol has higher diversity gains.}

We first provide an asymptotic analysis of the existing selective relaying scheme that simultaneously activates the strongest source-relay (S-R) and relay-destination (R-D) optical links. We then propose an improvement of this scheme and highlight on its advantages by deriving closed-form accurate expressions for the asymptotic values of the outage probability (OP) and average packet delay (APD). The theoretical evaluation and numerical analysis demonstrate the capability of the improved scheme in enhancing the diversity order with finite buffer sizes unlike the selective relaying scheme that achieves diversity gains only with infinite-size buffers entailing infinite delays. The OP performance is significantly enhanced for all network topologies whether the relays are closer to S, closer to D or placed at the same distance from S and D. On the other hand, the reaped APD gains depend on the positions of the relays.}

	abstract = {Imagine a MIMO communication system that fully exploits the propagation characteristics offered by an electromagnetic channel and ultimately approaches the limits imposed by wireless communications. This is the concept of Holographic MIMO communications. Accurate and tractable channel modeling is critical to understanding its full potential. Classical stochastic models used by communications theorists are derived under the electromagnetic far-field assumption, i.e. planar wave approximation over the array. However, such assumption breaks down when electromagnetically large (compared to the wavelength) antenna arrays are considered. In this paper, we start from the first principles of wave propagation and provide a Fourier plane-wave series expansion of the channel response, which fully captures the essence of electromagnetic propagation in arbitrary scattering and is also valid in the (radiative) near-field. The expansion is based on the Fourier spectral representation and has an intuitive physical interpretation, as it statistically describes the angular coupling between source and receiver. When discretized uniformly, it leads to a low-rank semi-unitarily equivalent approximation of the electromagnetic channel in the angular domain. The developed channel model is used to compute the ergodic capacity of a point-to-point Holographic MIMO system with different degrees of channel state information.}

Despite its practical relevance, this condition, known as coherence diversity , has not been studied in the relay channel. This paper studies the performance of MIMO relays and proposes efficient transmission strategies under coherence diversity. Since coherence times have a prominent impact on channel training, we do not assume channel state is available to the decoder for free; all channel training resources are accounted for in the calculations. A product superposition technique is employed at the source which allows a more efficient usage of degrees of freedom when the relay and the destination have different training requirements. Varying configurations of coherence times are studied. The interesting case where the different link coherence intervals are not a multiple of each other, and therefore the coherence intervals do not align, is studied. Relay scheduling is combined with the product superposition to obtain further gains in degrees of freedom. The impact of coherence diversity is further studied in the presence of multiple parallel relays.}

First, by exploiting the correlation of the channel frequency responses across the OFDM subcarriers, we propose a block-wise linear channel model. Specifically, the continuous OFDM subcarriers are divided into several sub-blocks and a linear function with only two variables (mean and slope) is used to approximate the frequency-selective channel in each sub-block. This significantly reduces the number of variables to be determined in channel estimation, and the sub-block number can be adjusted to reliably compensate the channel frequency-selectivity. Second, we formulate the joint active device detection and channel estimation in the block-wise linear system as a Bayesian inference problem. By exploiting the block-sparsity of the channel matrix, we propose an efficient turbo message passing algorithm to solve the Bayesian inference problem. We then develop the state evolution to predict the performance of the turbo message passing algorithm. We further incorporate machine learning approaches into turbo message passing to learn unknown model parameters. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

As the optimization problem with devices’ quality-of-service (QoS) constraints is non-convex and NP-hard, we model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). Considering the fact that the network is highly complex with large state and action spaces, a multi-agent dueling deep-Q network-based algorithm combined with distributed coordinated learning is proposed to effectively learn the optimized intelligent resource management policy, where the algorithm adopts dueling deep network to learn the action-value distribution by estimating both the state-value and action advantage functions. Under the distributed coordinated learning manner and dueling architecture, the learning algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimized policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed coordinated learning algorithm outperforms other existing learning algorithms in terms of learning efficiency, network data rate, and QoS satisfaction probability.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing can effectively reduce service latency and improve service quality by offloading computation-intensive tasks to the edges of wireless networks. Due to the characteristic of flexible deployment, wide coverage and reliable wireless communication, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been employed as assisted edge clouds (ECs) for large-scale sparely-distributed user equipment. Considering the limited computation and energy capacities of UAVs, a collaborative mobile edge computing system with multiple UAVs and multiple ECs is investigated in this paper. The task offloading issue is addressed to minimize the sum of execution delays and energy consumptions by jointly designing the trajectories, computation task allocation, and communication resource management of UAVs. Moreover, to solve the above non-convex optimization problem, a Markov decision process is formulated for the multi-UAV assisted mobile edge computing system. To obtain the joint strategy of trajectory design, task allocation, and power management, a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is investigated. Considering the high-dimensional continuous action space, the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is exploited. The evaluation results demonstrate that our multi-UAV multi-EC task offloading method can achieve better performance compared with the other optimization approaches.}

	abstract = {The conventional federated learning (FL) framework usually assumes synchronous reception and fusion of all the local models at the central aggregator and synchronous updating and training of the global model at all the agents as well. However, in a wireless network, due to limited radio resource, inevitable transmission failures and heterogeneous computing capacity, it is very hard to realize strict synchronization among all the involved user equipments (UEs). In this paper, we propose a novel asynchronous FL framework, which well adapts to the heterogeneity of users, communication environments and learning tasks, by considering both the possible delays in training and uploading the local models and the resultant staleness among the received models that has heavy impact on the global model fusion. A novel centralized fusion algorithm is designed to determine the fusion weight during the global update, which aims to make full use of the fresh information contained in the uploaded local models while avoiding the biased convergence by enforcing the impact of each UE’s local dataset to be proportional to its sample share. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed asynchronous FL framework can achieve fast and smooth convergence and enhance the training efficiency significantly.}

We propose a new waveform design algorithm for reducing peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in OFDM-based RadCom systems. We consider a flexible and generic RadCom structure in which a number of non-contiguous sub-bands for data transmission are located within a large contiguous spectrum band for radar detection/sensing. New RadCom waveforms with low PAPR are obtained by carrying out optimization over those subcarriers which are complementary to the communication bands. As an application of the majorization-minimization (MM) optimization method, our major contribution is an\nl\n-norm cyclic algorithm which is capable of efficiently reducing the maximum PAPR of RadCom waveforms. We show by numerical simulation results that significant performance enhancements can be achieved compared to OFDM RadCom waveforms from legacy approaches.}

However, the wireless channels between the radar and the targets are passively adopted by traditional radars, which limits the performance of target detection. To address this issue, we propose to use the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to improve the detection accuracy of radar systems due to its capability to customize channel conditions by adjusting its phase shifts, which is referred to as MetaRadar. In such a system, it is challenging to jointly optimize both radar waveforms and RIS phase shifts in order to improve the multi-target detection performance. To tackle this challenge, we design a waveform and phase shift optimization (WPSO) algorithm to effectively solve the multi-target detection problem, and also analyze the performance of the proposed MetaRadar scheme theoretically. Simulation results show that the detection performance of the MetaRadar scheme is significantly better than that of the traditional radar schemes.}

We show that a standard training-based scheme for the noncoherent IC is outperformed by one of these schemes in several regimes: our results demonstrate that in the very weak interference regime, the TIN scheme is the best; in the strong interference regime, the TDM scheme and the noncoherent rate-splitting scheme give better performance; in other cases either of the TIN, TDM or noncoherent rate-splitting scheme could be preferred.

In this paper, we consider an intelligent omni-surface (IOS) which can provide services for users on both sides by enabling simultaneous signal reflection and transmission. Specifically, we propose an IOS aided indoor communication system where an IOS is embedded in a wall between two independent access points (APs) to suppress inter-cell interference. Due to the independence of the APs, we design a distributed hybrid beamforming scheme consisting of digital beamforming at APs and IOS-based analog beamforming to maximize the sum rate without any exchange of channel state information (CSI) between APs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system performs very close to an optimal centralized scheme, and has a better sum rate performance compared to existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers a promising technique to fulfil the high data demand and connectivity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 5G communications because it owns valuable and unknown spectrum resources. Using massive antennas with recently introduced drone-enabled aerial computing platforms, named unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can cast high energy consumption if fully-digital precoding is employed at the UAVs. Using hybrid precoding at a UAV can reduce hardware complexity and energy consumption but is challenging with a need for joint optimization of three precoding matrices at the UAV (sixth-order polynomial objective function). In this paper, we propose to decompose the original UAV hybrid precoding challenge into three subproblems and develop a coordinated descent optimization (CDO) algorithm to solve the three problems recursively. In addition, the convergence and complexity of this new technique are analyzed. Numerical studies indicate the improved effectiveness of the proposed solution over existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising 6G technology that can improve wireless communication capacity in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner, by adjusting a large number of passive reflectors to appropriately change the signal propagation. In this study, we identified the achievable rate region of a two-hop interference channel with distributed multiple IRS relays. To do so, we formulated a non-convex problem that characterizes the rate-profile, and found its solution using successive convex approximation (SCA). We then proposed an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and alternating optimization (AO) based distributed and low-complex IRS control that maximizes the achievable sum-rate, and proved its convergence and optimality. We then compared the proposed IRS control with semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-, random phase-, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based IRS controls, and optimal amplify-and-forward (AF)-, interference neutralization (IN)-, and decode-and-forward (DF) based relaying schemes. We demonstrated that the proposed control with multiple IRS elements outperforms the benchmark controls in terms of the achievable rate region, achievable sum-rate, and energy efficiency under same power budget. We also confirmed that the discrete phase approximation of the proposed control provides near-optimal performance with fewer bits, and the proposed control is robust under imperfect CSI condition. The proposed controls can be efficiently applied to large-scale multi-pair multihop device-to-device and machine-type device communications in the interference-limited or low-powered dense networks of 5G and 6G environments.}

	abstract = {Integrating terrestrial networks with burgeoning high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) will be a disruptive challenge for beyond-5G systems provisioning large-scale three-dimensional connectivity. Here, we study the problem of forwarding packets between terrestrial terminals and backhaul through multi-HAPS relaying. Considering the limited wireless backhaul, which is the practical constraint of HAPS relaying, dual-hop mixed radiofrequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) networks are investigated, where backhaul-to-relay and relay-to-user communications employ FSO and RF links, respectively. To maximize the end-to-end network throughput, including downlink and uplink rate, we formulate the optimization problem for variables; the association between aerial and terrestrial terminals, transmit power, and deployment of multiple HAPSs, respectively. We tackle this problem using an iterative algorithm with proposed surrogate functions to efficiently obtain the locally optimal solution. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed optimal method achieves up to 11.3% spectral efficiency compared to the conventional heuristic method. Furthermore, we answer three questions; 1) what the wireless backhaul requirements are, 2) how the number of HAPSs and terrestrial terminals impact the network, and 3) what if a certain user terminal has a particular demand on data rate.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency wireless energy transfer (WET) is a promising solution for powering autonomous Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. In this work, we leverage energy beamforming for powering multiple user equipments (UEs) with stringent energy harvesting (EH) demands in an indoor distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output system. Based on semi-definite programming, successive convex approximation (SCA), and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) techniques, we derive optimal and sub-optimal precoders aimed at minimizing the radio stripes’ transmit power while exploiting information of the power transfer efficiency of the EH circuits at the UEs. Moreover, we propose an analytical framework to assess and control the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation exposure in the considered indoor scenario. Numerical results show that i) the EMF radiation exposure can be more easily controlled at higher frequencies at the cost of a higher transmit power consumption, ii) training is not a very critical factor for the considered indoor system, iii) MRT/SCA-based precoders are particularly appealing when serving a small number of UEs, thus, especially suitable for implementation in a time domain multiple access (TDMA) scheduling framework, and iv) TDMA is more efficient than spatial domain multiple access (SDMA) when serving a relatively small number of UEs. Results suggest that additional boosting performance strategies are needed to increase the overall system efficiency, thus making the technology viable in practice.}

The task offloading from the user to the server is operated under a truncated Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) process, i.e., we consider finite retransmission attempts. Both the HARQ type-I and type-II schemes are studied. For each scheme, we first characterize the total error probability and the total energy cost, while the impact of finite blocklength (FBL) on the stochastic retransmission behavior is considered. Following the characterizations, we are interested in optimal frameworks for each considered HARQ type, where the number of potential retransmission attempts is optimized together with the duration of each transmission, while the CPU frequency at the edge node is adjusted via voltage scaling. The objective is to minimize the total energy cost with error probability threshold. We show that the resulting stochastic optimization problems can be solved by means of convex optimization. We furthermore demonstrate that sharp minima exist among the energy consumption, underlying the importance of near-optimal parameter choice in the studied scenarios. Our results underline the importance of trading off communication and computational characteristics in delay-critical MEC setups with FBL codes.}

By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave channels, the optimization of the sensing matrices (corresponding to training beams) is formulated according to the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Under the condition of infinite-resolution PSs, we propose relevant algorithms to construct the sensing matrix, where the theory of convex optimization and the gradient descent in Riemannian manifold is used to design the digital and analog part, respectively. Furthermore, a block-wise alternating hybrid analog-digital algorithm is proposed to tackle the design of training beams with low-resolution PSs, where the performance degeneration caused by non-convex constant modulus and discrete phase constraints is effectively compensated to some extent thanks to the iterations among blocks. Finally, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based estimator is adopted for achieving an effective recovery of the sparse mmWave channel. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of proposed algorithms compared with some existing schemes.}

This has motivated research into a new metric called Age of Information (AoI). This paper contributes to this effort by proposing to minimize the maximum average AoI (min-max AoI) in a multi-hop IoT network comprising of solar-powered Power Beacons (PBs). It outlines a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that jointly optimizes: (i) the beamforming vector used by PBs to charge devices, and (ii) routing, which determines how samples from devices are forwarded to a sink node, and (iii) the sampling time of sources. It also presents two protocols: Centralized Linear Relaxation (CLR) and Distributed Path Selection (DPS), respectively. CLR is run by the sink to determine the transmit power of PBs and the path of each source using two Linear Programs (LPs). On the other hand, DPS is a distributed approach whereby PBs and sources make their own decisions using local information. Our simulation results show that min-max AoI increases with the number of sources, but reduces with increasing number of PBs. The number of paths available to a source, the number of frames, and solar panel size have limited impact on performance. The min-max AoI of CLR and DPS is\n1.60×\nand\n1.95×\nhigher than that of MILP.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising technology to enable artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, where distributed mobile devices collaboratively train a shared AI model under the coordination of an edge server. To significantly improve the communication efficiency of FL, over-the-air computation allows a large number of mobile devices to concurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property of wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model aggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among all devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a relay-assisted cooperative FL scheme to effectively address the straggler issue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively assist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The nature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints that are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems. Moreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the optimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an alternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay operation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in a single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller error than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and the relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical insights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL. Extensive numerical results show that our design achieves faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art schemes.}

Each BS employs artificial-noise (AN)-aided multi-user linear beamforming with limited channel state information feedback. Based on the stochastic geometry theory, we first derive an analytical expression of a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) of the typical LU without assuming asymptotes for any system parameter. We then develop a tight closed-form approximation on the optimal number of feedback bits to maximize a lower bound on the per-user net ESR, which takes into consideration the cost of uplink spectral efficiency for limited feedback. Moreover, the power allocation coefficient between message-bearing signals and AN can be optimized by using a bisection search method. Our main finding is that, the optimum number of feedback bits scales linearly with the path-loss exponent and the number of antennas, and scales logarithmically with the channel coherence time. The derived analytical results can also provide system-level insights into the ESR performance of the multi-antenna random cellular networks with limited feedback and the optimal system design. Numerical results are also presented to verify the obtained results.}

The RC-Struct exploits the temporal structure of the MIMO-OFDM signals through reservoir computing (RC). A binary classifier leverages the repetitive constellation structure in the system to perform multi-class detection. The incorporation of RC allows the RC-Struct to be learned in a purely online fashion with extremely limited pilot symbols in each OFDM subframe. The binary classifier enables the efficient utilization of the precious online training symbols and allows an easy extension to high-order modulations without a substantial increase in complexity. Experiments show that the introduced RC-Struct outperforms both the conventional model-based symbol detection approaches and the state-of-the-art learning-based strategies in terms of bit error rate (BER). The advantages of RC-Struct over existing methods become more significant when rank and link adaptation are adopted. The introduced RC-Struct sheds light on combining communication domain knowledge and learning-based receive processing for 5G/5G-Advanced and Beyond.}

This duality facilitates an ALOHA protocol avoiding preamble overhead. The frame structure, named Quasi-Cyclic Short Packet (QCSP), is based on the association of a Cyclic Code Shift Keying (CCSK) modulation and a non-binary error control code. The detection/correction algorithm of the QCSP system is presented, its performance is theoretically derived and discussed for different parameters. A QCSP frame can be transmitted and received correctly with an error probability of\n10\n−4\n, distanced by 1.2 dB from Polyanskiy’s bound (an estimated Shannon’s limit for small packet size) at −11 dB of SNR for a payload of 360 bits. Compared to a classical preamble-based frame using a modern binary error control code, the size of a QCSP frame is reduced by 23%. Moreover, detecting a QCSP frame requires a lower complexity than detecting a longer classical preamble.}

	abstract = {Wireless powered sensor networks (WPSNs) have evolved as a promising paradigm for energy-efficient communications. Recently, the proliferation of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has further been envisioned as a cost-effective solution for improving wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency. In this paper, from the practical perspective of balancing the network sustainability and reliability, we consider a RIS-enhanced partially WPSN that composed of wireless-powered energy receivers (ERs) and battery-powered information receivers (IRs). Assuming the partially WPSN operates in time division multiple access (TDMA) mode, the joint optimization of covariance matrices, downlink/uplink (DL/UL) time allocation and RIS reflecting coefficients are investigated under the minimum DL rate constraint among all IRs for maximizing the achievable UL sum rate. Specifically, the single-IR single-ER (SISE) case is first studied based on the assumption of separate DL/UL RIS reflecting coefficients, in which an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed with semi-closed-form optimal solutions. In order to reduce the hardware overhead and signal processing complexity, we also investigate the case of identical DL/UL RIS reflecting coefficients, in which an iterative optimization algorithm is developed to tackle the coupled DL/UL transmissions. Then, we extend our work to the multiple-IRs multiple-ERs (MIME) case, where both the optimization problems corresponding to separate and identical DL/UL RIS reflecting schemes become more challenging to solve. To circumvent this intractability, we propose a successive convex relaxation (SCA) based alternating optimization algorithm and a low-complexity two-step algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superior UL sum rate performance of our proposed algorithms over the adopted benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Computational offloading, as an effective way to extend the capability of resource-limited edge devices in Internet of Things (IoT), is considered as a promising emerging paradigm for coping with delay-sensitive services. However, on one hand, applications commonly include several subtasks with dependent relations and on the other hand, the dynamic changes in network environments make offloading decision-making become a coupling and complex NP-hard problem, difficult to address. This paper proposes an intelligent Computational Offloading scheme for Dependent IoT Application ( CODIA ), which decouples the performance enhancement problem into two processes: scheduling and offloading. First, a prioritized scheduling strategy is designed and its complexity is analyzed. Then, an offloading algorithm with offline training and online deployment is introduced. Due to the temporal continuity between subtasks, the dependency relation is transformed into a transition of device state, and the overhead for the whole application is considered to be the long-term benefit. CODIA leverages an Actor-Critic-based solution, where the IoT devices are able to deploy intelligent models and dynamically adjust the offloading strategy to achieve low latency, while controlling energy consumption. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the robustness and efficiency of the proposed solution in terms of convergence, latency, and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {We study security solutions for dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) systems, which detect the radar target and communicate with downlink cellular users in millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless networks simultaneously. Uniquely for such scenarios, the radar target is regarded as a potential eavesdropper which might surveil the information sent from the base station (BS) to communication users (CUs), that is carried by the radar probing signal. Transmit waveform and receive beamforming are jointly designed to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radar under the security and power budget constraints. We apply a Directional Modulation (DM) approach to exploit constructive interference (CI), where the known multiuser interference (MUI) can be exploited as a source of useful signal. Moreover, to further deteriorate the eavesdropping signal at the radar target, we utilize destructive interference (DI) by pushing the received symbols at the target towards the destructive region of the signal constellation. Our numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design showing a secure transmission with enhanced performance against benchmark DFRC techniques.}

	abstract = {Extra large MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems are subject to spatial non-stationarity forming visibility regions (VRs), which leads to a sub-array-wise sparse structure of the channel matrix. When XL-MIMO systems operate in grant-free access mode, in which only a fraction of the potential users are active during a given time slot, it follows that the channel matrix possesses a doubly-sparse and user-specific structure such that the activity of each user and each sub-array can be jointly modeled by a nested Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. This article considers the joint activity and channel estimation (JACE) problem in XL-MIMO systems subject to this so-defined spatial non-stationarity, tackling this challenging inference problem. Our main contributions are 1) to introduce the novel Bernoulli-Gaussian model to simultaneously capture the aforementioned two distinct structured sparsities, and 2) a new bilinear Bayesian inference algorithm capable of jointly estimating the associated channel coefficients, user activity patterns, sub-array activity patterns (\na.k.a\n. spatial non-stationarity), boosted by expectation maximization (EM)-based auto-parameterization. In addition, to shed light on a realistic modeling of VRs, we also introduce a Matérn-cluster point process (MCPP)-based approach to imitate the clustered activity pattern due to spatial non-stationarity. The efficacy of the proposed bilinear JACE algorithm is confirmed by numerical simulations, which show that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SotA) but also can reach the performance of a genie-aided scheme over wide signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) ranges, in both uniformly-random and MCPP-based sub-array activity scenarios.}

	abstract = {Benefiting from tens of GHz of bandwidth, terahertz (THz) communication has become a promising technology for future 6G network. To deal with the serious propagation loss of THz signals, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with hybrid precoding is utilized to generate directional beams with high array gains. However, the standard hybrid precoding architecture based on frequency-independent phase-shifters cannot cope with the beam split effect in THz massive MIMO caused by the large bandwidth and the large number of antennas, where the beams split into different physical directions at different frequencies. The beam split effect will result in a serious array gain loss across the entire bandwidth, which has not been well investigated in THz massive MIMO. In this paper, we first quantify the seriousness of the beam split effect in THz massive MIMO by analyzing the array gain loss it causes. Then, we propose a new precoding architecture called delay-phase precoding (DPP) to mitigate this effect. Specifically, the proposed DPP introduces a time delay network composed of a small number of time delay elements between radio-frequency chains and phase-shifters in the standard hybrid precoding architecture. Unlike frequency-independent phase shifts, the time delay network introduced in the DPP can realize frequency-dependent phase shifts, which can be designed to generate frequency-dependent beams towards the target physical direction across the entire bandwidth. Due to the joint control of delay and phase, the proposed DPP can alleviate the array gain loss caused by the beam split effect. Furthermore, we propose a hardware structure by using true-time-delayers to realize frequency-dependent phase shifts for realizing the concept of DPP. A corresponding precoding algorithm is proposed to realize the precoding design. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the proposed DPP can mitigate the beam split effect and achieve near-optimal rate with higher energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {End-to-end autoencoder (AE) learning has the potential of exceeding the performance of human-engineered transceivers and encoding schemes, without a priori knowledge of communication-theoretic principles. In this work, we aim to understand to what extent and for which scenarios this claim holds true when comparing with fair benchmarks. Our particular focus is on memoryless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user (MU) systems. Four case studies are considered: two point-to-point (closed-loop and open-loop MIMO) and two MU scenarios (MIMO broadcast and interference channels). For the point-to-point scenarios, we explain some of the performance gains observed in prior work through the selection of improved baseline schemes that include geometric shaping as well as bit and power allocation. For the MIMO broadcast channel, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel AE method with centralized learning and decentralized execution. Interestingly, the learned scheme performs close to nonlinear vector-perturbation precoding and significantly outperforms conventional zero-forcing. Lastly, we highlight potential pitfalls when interpreting learned communication schemes. In particular, we show that the AE for the considered interference channel learns to avoid interference, albeit in a rotated reference frame. After de-rotating the learned signal constellation of each user, the resulting scheme corresponds to conventional time sharing with geometric shaping.}

	abstract = {Fault-Prone Mobile Edge Cloud (FP-MEC) is a new type of distributed network composed of mobile edge computing and network function virtualization, where virtual network services can be provided in the form of service function chains (SFCs) that are a sequence of virtual network functions (VNFs) on-demand deployed on resource-limited edge servers. FP-MEC has a characteristic that the fault probability of each VNF is dynamic and fluctuates with time and workloads, making SFCs temporarily unreliable. To increase the reliabilities, redundant Backup VNFs (BVNFs) need to be deployed near the VNFs and activated when they experience faults. Different mobile users would request different SFCs with reliability and service time demands to process their data. However, workloads of VNFs are dynamic and unpredictable in FP-MEC due to random arrival of user requests. How to optimally deploy VNFs and corresponding BVNFs on a set of edge servers to form expected SFCs that have higher reliabilities than user demand values, meanwhile throughput of receiving requests is maximized while receiving cost is minimized in real-time, is a challenging problem. The receiving cost is composed of deployment cost of instantiating VNFs and BVNFs, and communication cost of routing data among users, VNFs and BVNFs. In this paper, the long-term provisioning problem is first formulated as an integer linear program and proved to be NP-hard. Then, it is discretized into a sequence of one-slot optimization problems to handle practical time-varying fault probability, where a set of SFC requests are given at each time slot, and receiving or rejecting decisions are executed immediately without any future information. Finally, an online approximation scheme with a constant approximation ratio is proposed to solve the one-slot problems in polynomial time. Theoretical analyses and experiments based on real network topology of CERNET in China demonstrate that the scheme is promising compared to existing works.}

	abstract = {As an effective security mechanism, trust models have been proposed to estimate the reliability of the individual nodes in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) during adverse attacks. However, existing trust models neglect the relative importance of the different nodes within the network topology. Further, few trust models study the effects of defective recommendation trust filtering. In this work, we propose an adaptive trust model based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model for UASNs, which we term LTrust. The LTrust is composed of two stages: trust data collection and trust evaluation. In the first stage, the characteristics of the network topology are leveraged towards evaluating direct trust evidence, by aggregating the communication trust and environment trust metrics; a defective recommendation filtering method is designed for broadcasting accurate trust recommendations among the nodes. In the second stage, an adaptive trust model is designed based on the LSTM model, to identify anomalous nodes by evaluating their trust value. The LTrust model has been tested under both hybrid attack and single-mode attack scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the LTrust achieves effective performance, as compared to other approaches proposed in the literature, in terms of trust value, accuracy and error rate.}

	abstract = {Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) show a revolutionary potential for wireless communications. In this paper, a single IRS is used to achieve distributed multi-user beamforming and interference-free transmission. We first establish the IRS assisted multi-user system model and formulate an optimization problem called multi-user linearly constrained minimum variance (MU-LCMV) beamformer, under the criterion of minimizing the overall received signal power subject to a certain level of power response (e.g., unit power response) at desired signal directions and arbitrary low power response (e.g., zero power response) at the interference directions. A closed-form amplitude-unconstrained phase-continuous (AUPC) solution is derived first, then an amplitude-constrained phase-continuous (ACPC) solution is obtained by using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Given the solutions, the IRS beam pattern shows that to achieve multi-user ( N\npairs of transceivers, N > 1\n) transmission through a single surface, up to N-1\nredundant beams are generated, significantly affecting power efficiency. The directions of the redundant beams are mathematically derived. The effect of mutual coupling on IRS is also analyzed to show the characteristic of side lobes. Simulation results verify the existence and accuracy of the redundant beam directions. This work can potentially enhance state-of-the-art wireless communication systems ranging from transceiver design, system and architecture design, network deployment and self-organizing-network operations.}

Recently, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been proposed as an innovative technology that can significantly improve the performance of mmWave communication systems through the use of low-cost passive reflecting elements. In this paper, we study IRS-aided mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming architectures. We first exploit the sparse-scattering structure and large dimension of mmWave channels to develop the joint design of IRS reflection matrix and hybrid beamformer for narrowband MIMO systems. Then, we generalize the proposed joint design to broadband MIMO systems with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation by leveraging the angular sparsity of frequency-selective mmWave channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint designs can significantly enhance the spectral efficiency of the systems of interest and achieve superior performance over the existing designs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a covert Internet of Things (IoT) system. Compared with conventional IoT systems that apply cryptography and information-theoretic secrecy approaches to secure the transmission, our considered IoT system adopts the covertness technique and intends to hide the legitimate transmission from the observant adversaries. In the IoT system, the IoT devices randomly transmit the collected data to their associated IoT gateways (GWs). In the meantime, the adversaries attempt to detect the existence of legitimate transmission based on their received signal power and launch hostile attacks accordingly. To avoid being detected by the adversaries, the IoT system applies uplink power control to achieve covert legitimate transmission. Moreover, to distort the observation of the adversaries so as to mislead their decisions, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-assisted covert communication design, where the AN is transmitted by in-band full-duplex (IBFD) IoT GWs as a jamming operation. We formulate a Stackelberg game to study the interaction between the adversaries and the legitimate entities including the IoT GWs and IoT devices, where the legitimate entities, as the leaders, decide on the powers of legitimate and AN transmissions at the upper level and the adversaries, as the followers, aim to minimize their detection errors at the lower level. Thereafter, considering the large scale of IoT system, we further cast the Stackelberg game into a mean-field Stackelberg game and incorporate the stochastic geometry and statistical channel model to capture the location heterogeneity and channel dynamics among and of the system entities, respectively. In the performance evaluation, we verify the practicability of the mean-field Stackelberg game. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AN in improving the transmission covertness.}

	abstract = {This paper develops a novel framework to defeat a super-reactive jammer, one of the most difficult jamming attacks to deal with in practice. Specifically, the jammer has an unlimited power budget and is equipped with the self-interference suppression capability to simultaneously attack and listen to the transmitter’s activities. Consequently, dealing with super-reactive jammers is very challenging. Thus, we introduce a smart deception mechanism to attract the jammer to continuously attack the channel and then leverage jamming signals to transmit data based on the ambient backscatter communication technology. To detect the backscattered signals, the maximum likelihood detector can be adopted. However, this method is notorious for its high computational complexity and requires the model of the current propagation environment as well as channel state information. Hence, we propose a deep learning-based detector that can dynamically adapt to any channels and noise distributions. With a Long Short-Term Memory network, our detector can learn the received signals’ dependencies to achieve a performance close to that of the optimal maximum likelihood detector. Through simulation and theoretical results, we demonstrate that with our approaches, the more power the jammer uses to attack the channel, the better bit error rate performance the transmitter can achieve.}

We study four uplink implementations, from fully centralized processing to fully distributed processing, and derive their achievable spectral efficiency (SE) expressions with minimum mean-squared error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) detectors and arbitrary combining schemes. Furthermore, the global and local MMSE combining schemes are derived based on full and local channel state information (CSI) obtained under pilot contamination, which can maximize the achievable SE for the fully centralized and distributed implementation, respectively. We study a two-layer decoding implementation with an arbitrary combining scheme in the first layer and optimal large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) in the second layer. Besides, we compute novel closed-form SE expressions for the two-layer decoding implementation with maximum ratio (MR) combining. In the numerical results, we compare the SE performance for different implementation levels, combining schemes, and channel models. It is important to note that increasing the number of antennas per UE may degrade the SE performance.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes an off-grid channel estimation scheme for orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) systems adopting the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. To avoid channel spreading caused by the fractional delay and Doppler shifts and to fully exploit the channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, we estimate the original DD domain channel response rather than the effective DD domain channel response as commonly adopted in the literature. OTFS channel estimation is firstly formulated as a one-dimensional (1D) off-grid sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem based on a virtual sampling grid defined in the DD space, where the on-grid and off-grid components of the delay and Doppler shifts are separated for estimation. In particular, the on-grid components of the delay and Doppler shifts are jointly determined by the entry indices with significant values in the recovered sparse vector. Then, the corresponding off-grid components are modeled as hyper-parameters in the proposed SBL framework, which can be estimated via the expectation-maximization method. To strike a balance between channel estimation performance and computational complexity, we further propose a two-dimensional (2D) off-grid SSR problem via decoupling the delay and Doppler shift estimations. In our developed 1D and 2D off-grid SBL-based channel estimation algorithms, the hyper-parameters are updated alternatively for computing the conditional posterior distribution of channels, which can be exploited to reconstruct the effective DD domain channel. Compared with the 1D method, the proposed 2D method enjoys a much lower computational complexity while only suffers a slight performance degradation. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed channel estimation schemes over state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {The problem of single-group multicast beamforming (SMBF) is well-known NP-hard. It motivates the pursuit of computationally efficient near-optimal solutions. Due to multicasting, the multicast group is bottlenecked by the user(s) with the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This paper provides an in-depth interpretation of the SMBF problem from the multicasting point of view and proposes to solve it in two steps: i) select the bottlenecking users by a machine learning approach based on determinantal point process (DPP), and ii) design the beamformer for the selected users. The DPP model jointly considers the magnitudes and directions of users’ channel vectors, and thus enables an efficient selection of the bottlenecking users. Moreover, for a specific channel model, the DPP model is only associated with network size and each takes a one-off training cost, thus can be used as a codebook. The proposed DPP-based subset selection is incorporated adaptively into two fast beamforming algorithms, i.e., the QR decomposition algorithm and the successive beamforming (SB) algorithm. They specifically design the beamformers for the selected users by leveraging channel orthogonalization therein. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed QR-DPP and SB-DPP algorithms in terms of the performance-complexity compromise and their robustness to different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Renewable energy source (RES)-powered base stations have received tremendous research interest in recent years because they can expand network coverage without building a power grid. This paper proposes a novel user association (UA), resource allocation (RA), and dynamic power control (PC) scheme to maximize the \\alpha\n-fairness in RES-assisted small cell networks. The \\alpha\n-fairness is a general notion that flexibly adjusts the balance between the throughput, proportional fairness, and max-min fairness according to \\alpha\n. Nevertheless, none of the existing studies has proposed UA, RA, and PC to maximize the \\alpha\n-fairness due to its NP-hardness. Furthermore, fixed-policy-based PC designs cannot consider time-varying environments (e.g., energy harvesting models and wireless channels) of the RES-assisted networks. We first provide a Lagrangian duality-based algorithm to solve the UA and RA problem for a fixed PC. Next, we propose a dynamic PC scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that chooses the best PC considering the time-varying environments. However, because the UA and RA algorithm executed in each step of the dynamic PC requires a long computation time, we aim to accelerate the computation of the UA and RA with DRL. Inspired by the Lagrangian duality, we design a DRL-based UA and RA with a low-dimensional continuous variable by relaxing the UA variable, the cardinality of which increases exponentially with the number of base stations and users. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a 100 times shorter computation time than the optimization-based schemes by computing only two neural networks. In particular, although there have been numerous studies on the proportional fairness maximization, the proposed scheme outperforms the optimization-based schemes in the throughput, proportional fairness, and max-min fairness metrics.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel distributed beamforming framework for UAVs, called SABRE, wherein airborne transmitters synchronize their operations for data communication with target receivers. SABRE chooses the best-suited subset of transmitters that maximizes user-defined QoS, considering relative distances from receivers, traffic characteristics, cumulative SNR desired at the receiver, and individual SNR estimated for each link. This paper makes three main contributions: (i) It shows how to achieve distributed beamforming in challenging, aerial hovering conditions by accurately synchronizing start-times and eliminating relative clock offsets. (ii) It proposes an algorithm with polynomial complexity that groups transmitters and chooses the receiver, maximizing the number of satisfied receivers in each round. (iii) It experimentally validates the concept of aerial beamforming in a testbed composed of four DJI-M100 UAVs in realistic outdoor environments. We follow this up with at-scale emulation involving beamforming with multiple candidate UAV transmitters in Colosseum, the world’s largest RF emulator. SABRE keeps the overall network frame error rate below 10% with a probability of 0.95 and manifests a 40% improvement in meeting user QoS thresholds over classical resource allocation methods. From a community viewpoint, the beamforming code, UAV interfacing designs, and the Colosseum container will be released publicly, allowing further independent investigations.}

	abstract = {Large antenna arrays and high-frequency bands are two key features of future wireless communication systems. The combination of large-scale antennas with high transmission frequencies often results in the communicating devices operating in the near-field (Fresnel) region. In this paper, we study the potential of beam focusing, feasible in near-field operation, in facilitating high-rate multi-user downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. As the ability to achieve beam focusing is dictated by the transmit antenna, we study near-field signalling considering different antenna structures, including fully-digital architectures, hybrid phase shifter-based precoders, and the emerging dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) architecture for massive MIMO arrays. We first provide a mathematical model to characterize near-field wireless channels as well as the transmission pattern for the considered antenna architectures. Then, we formulate the beam focusing problem for the goal of maximizing the achievable sum-rate in multi-user networks. We propose efficient solutions based on the sum-rate maximization task for fully-digital, (phase shifters based-) hybrid and DMA architectures. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed beam focusing scheme for both single- and multi-user scenarios. In particular, the designed focused beams provide a new degree of freedom to mitigate interference in both angle and distance domains, which is not achievable using conventional far-field beam steering, allowing reliable communications for uses even residing at the same angular direction.}

	abstract = {The adoption of abundant millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum offers higher capacity for short-range connectivity in various Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-centric communications scenarios. In contrast to the conventional cellular paradigm, where the coordination of connected nodes is highly centralized, the distributed deployments, such as those operating over unlicensed frequency bands, maintain robust interactions in the absence of central control. These agile decentralized systems are being naturally created by dynamic UAV swarms that form a temporary 3D structure without reliance on remote management or pre-established network infrastructures. While much effort has been invested in the performance assessment of distributed, directional, and 3D systems individually, a combination of these three angles allows capturing more realistic UAV swarm scenarios and produces a novel research perspective. This work addresses one of the fundamental challenges in mmWave-based 3D networks– directional deafness– which is known to adversely affect the overall system performance. Particularly, we develop a mathematical framework by taking into account the peculiarities of 3D directional and distributed deployments. We provide a holistic analytical assessment of directional deafness and propose several powerful approximations that capture realistic antenna patterns.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new scheme for blind distributed spectrum sensing (DSS), where multiple distributed cognitive radios (CRs) and a fusion center (FC) collaboratively detect the availability of a frequency band of interest under communications constraints without knowledge on the channels, signal power, or noise power. By following the energy detection and homogeneity test concepts, in the proposed scheme, the CRs make local binary decisions based on relative comparison of the total energy in a sampling window, particularly, whether a CR has the maximum total energy. With independent channels, the use of the maximum function generates desirable discrepancy among the CR decisions when the frequency band is in use. The introduction of the window size enables the balancing between communications costs and the performance. Closed-form results on the distribution of the CR decisions are obtained for Gaussian noises and signals. Further, asymptotic analytical expressions are derived on the detection performance of the proposed scheme for both the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and\nχ\n2\n-test at the FC. Simulation results are shown which validate the theoretical results and show the advantage of the proposed scheme to others.}

The proposed DUPB algorithm applies the neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) technique to solve the user scheduling subproblem, in which a stochastic user scheduling policy is learned by deep neural networks with attention mechanism. Curriculum learning with deep deterministic policy gradient (CL-DDPG) is used in the proposed DUPB algorithm to jointly optimize the phase shift control and beamforming vectors. The knowledge on the hidden convexity of the joint problem is exploited to facilitate the policy learning in CL-DDPG. Simulation results show that, with the maximum aggregate throughput as the objective, the proposed DUPB algorithm achieves an aggregate throughput that is higher than the alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms. Moreover, the throughput fairness among the users is improved when proportional fairness is used as the objective.

We further consider the SINR balancing beamforming design scheme by maximizing the minimum SINR among all users to enhance the fairness among users, in which the transmit and reflective beamforming vectors are optimized in an alternating manner. The transmit beamforming vectors are optimized by the second-order-cone programming (SOCP) based on bisection method and the reflective beamforming vector is updated based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results show that the two proposed algorithms considerably outperform the benchmark zero-forcing (ZF) scheme. Moreover, the AO algorithm based on SCA has good communication performance than the other two schemes. And the AO algorithm based on bisection search guarantees the fairness for all users.}

	abstract = {Many wireless networks, including 5G NR (New Radio) and future beyond 5G cellular systems, are expected to operate on multiple frequency bands. This paper considers the band assignment (BA) problem in dual-band systems, where the basestation (BS) chooses one of the two available frequency bands (centimeter-wave and millimeter-wave bands) to communicate with the user equipment (UE). While the millimeter-wave band might offer higher data rate, there is a significant probability of outage during which the communication should be carried on the (more reliable) centimeter-wave band. With mobility, the BA can be perceived as a sequential problem, where the BS uses previously observed information to predict the best band for a future time step. We formulate the BA as a binary classification problem and propose supervised Machine Learning (ML) solutions. We study the problem when both the BS and the UE use (i) omnidirectional antennas and (ii) both use directional antennas. In the omnidirectional case, we derive analytical benchmark solutions based on the Gaussian Process (GP) assumption for the inter-band shadow fading. In the directional case, where the labeling is shown to be complex, we propose an efficient labeling approach based on the Viterbi Algorithm (VA). We compare the performances for two channel models: (i) a stochastic channel and (ii) a ray-tracing based channel.}

	abstract = {Concatenating the state-of-the-art codes at moderate rates with repetition codes has emerged as a practical solution deployed in various standards for ultra-low-power devices such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In this paper, we propose a novel concatenation mechanism for such applications which need to operate at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In the proposed scheme, the outer code is a hybrid polar code constructed in two stages, one with a binary kernel and another also with a binary kernel but applied over a binary extension field. The inner code is a non-binary multiplicative repetition code. This particular structure inherits low-complexity decoding structures of polar codes while enabling concatenation with an inner non-binary multiplicative repetition scheme. The decoding for the proposed scheme is done using cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid non-binary repeated polar code provides performance gain compared to a polar-repetition scheme with comparable decoding complexity.}

	abstract = {Recently, Energy Harvesting-supported Device-to-Device (EH-D2D) communication receives extensive concerns due to its excellent properties in Energy Efficiency (EE), offloading capability, etc. Researches on EH-D2D mainly focus on resource allocation schemes of available energy. With the popularity of mobile devices and applications, content sharing becomes anytime, anywhere. Multicast is the foundation to realize the content sharing and can reduce transmission consumption because of multi-user service feature. Thus, Mutlicast can further improve EE of EH-D2D in communication mode rather than in resource allocation. However, the heterogeneity and imbalance of available energy, content requests and social ties on the user side will bring great challenges to the deployment of EH-D2D Multicast (EH-D2MD) communication. This paper aims at EE optimization and establishes a two-layer cluster formation model, which solves grouping, cluster head selection and power control jointly. When facing the non-convex of the sum of fractional functions and the product of binary variables, this paper specifically designs a two-step Convex Approximation Algorithm (CDA). CDA skillfully transforms the modeled non-convex Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem into a convex MINLP one, which is easier to solve. Simulation results reveal that CDA can obtain the joint cluster formation results with approximate optimal EE and lower complexity.}

	abstract = {We investigate and elaborate upon a folklore in wireless communication systems that, when the nonlinearity at a transmitter is sufficiently weak so that the resulting spectral leakage is at a sufficiently low level, the capacity of the channel (including the transmitter) should be sufficiently close to the ideal channel capacity without transmitter nonlinearity. The context for this study is that effective predistortion techniques have been widely applied to linearize the transmitter nonlinearity in modern wireless communication systems, so as to render the electromagnetic radiation pattern to satisfy stringent spectral regrowth requirements. Based on the quasi-memoryless/memory polynomial model for the transmitter nonlinearity, via an information-theoretic approach, our study affirmatively validates the folklore, and more importantly, characterizes a quantitative relationship between the spectral leakage level and the capacity loss. Specifically, we prove that as the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) asymptotically vanishes, the capacity loss is upper bounded by a term that is proportional to the ACPR. We also establish a converse result, and further extend our results to spatial beamforming.}

	abstract = {Considering multi-user downlink ultra-high reliability and low latency communications (URLLC), this paper employs the artificial noise (AN) technique to establish a secure and covert broadcast communication paradigm for the first time. Specifically, a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) broadcasts the confidential information to multiple legitimate users in the presence of a multi-antenna malicious warden (Willie) and a multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve). It is well known that AN is an effective technique for securing the physical layer security (PLS) of signal transmissions. Nevertheless, AN emission also exposes the signal transmission and decreases the signal covertness. Taking into account the impact of short-packet URLLC transmissions, we investigate the joint optimization of the precoder and AN to maximize the secrecy rate under the covertness constraint. Although the considered problem is nonconvex, we propose a branch-reduce-and-bound (BRB)-based algorithm to solve it optimally. However, the nested-loop structure of the BRB-based algorithm incurs a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between the performance and computational complexity, we also propose a low-complexity penalty successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm, whose performance approaches that of the optimal BRB-based algorithm, particularly in the low to medium transmit power regime. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed optimization algorithms compared with various benchmark algorithms and unveil the importance of exploiting AN for secrecy provisioning.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the computation offloading problem in a high mobility internet of vehicles (IoVs) environment, aiming to guarantee latency, energy consumption, and payment cost requirements. Both moving and parked vehicles are utilized as fog nodes. Vehicles in high mobility environments need collaborative interactions in a decentralized manner for better network performances, where agent action space grows exponentially with the number of vehicles. The vehicular mobility introduces additional dynamicity in the network, and the learning agent requires a joint cooperative behavior for establishing convergence. The traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based offloading in IoV ignores other agent’s actions during the training process as an independent learner, which makes a lack of robustness against the high mobility environment. To overcome it, we develop a cooperative three-layer, more generic decentralized vehicle-assisted multi-access edge computing (VMEC) network, where vehicles in associated RSU and neighbor RSUs are in the bottom fog layer, MEC servers are in the middle cloudlet layer, and cloud in the top layer. Then multi-agent DRL-based Hungarian algorithm (MADRLHA) in the bipartite graph maximum matching problem is applied to solve dynamic task offloading in VMEC. Extensive experimental results and comprehensive comparisons are conducted to illustrate the superiority of our proposed method.}

This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in a STAR-RIS-assisted multi-carrier communication networks. To maximize the system sum-rate, a joint optimization problem comprising of the channel assignment, power allocation, and transmission and reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) is first formulated. To solve this challenging problem, we first propose a channel assignment scheme utilizing matching theory and then invoke the alternating optimization-based method to optimize the resource allocation policy and beamforming vectors iteratively. Furthermore, the sum-rate maximization problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with flexible decoding orders is investigated. To efficiently solve it, we first propose a location-based matching algorithm to determine the sub-channel assignment, where a transmitted user and a reflected user are grouped on a sub-channel. Based on this transmission-and-reflection sub-channel assignment strategy, a three-step approach is proposed, which involves the optimization of decoding orders, beamforming-coefficient vectors, and power allocation, by employing semidefinite programming, convex upper bound approximation, and geometry programming, respectively. Numerical results unveil that: 1) For OMA, a general design that includes the same-side user-pairing for channel assignment is preferable, whereas for NOMA, the proposed transmission-and-reflection scheme can achieve comparable performance to the exhaustive search-based algorithm. 2) The STAR-RIS-aided NOMA network significantly outperforms networks employing conventional RISs and OMA.}

In this paper, for a cell-free massive MIMO system, we have proposed a generalized superimposed pilot (GSP) scheme, where the available number of pilots are equal to the coherence time slots, and the transmitting data symbols are spread over the coherence time with the help of simple precoding. Further, in order to keep the system scalable, a low complexity and distributed time processing approach is employed, and the corresponding rate components are analyzed. It is shown that with careful design of precoding matrix and number of data symbols, the GSP symbols can provide much better channel estimation and data detection performance, as compared to the regular pilot scheme and the conventional superimposed scheme. These results have been verified via simulations. It is also inferred that centralized processing in cell free system improves the data detection performance than localized processing. Iterative data detection at the central node also improves the MSE of data estimates. The pilot contamination effect, is significantly reduced due to availability of larger number of pilots, as compared to regular pilots transmission.}

We focus on a computation power consumption model based on CMOS devices and a communication power consumption model involving multiple antenna transceivers against mutual interference. We present a joint optimization problem for workload scheduling and power allocation for achieving maximum computational speed under total power constraint. We simplify the joint optimization into two sub-problems. For workload scheduling as an integer programming sub-problem, we relax the integer constraint and establish the equivalence between relaxed and original problems. For the power allocation sub-problem, we maximize a difference of convex functions by utilizing the concave-convex procedure. We prove our proposed algorithm to converge to a stationary point of the original program. Simulation results confirm the efficiency and near-optimal performance of our proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) massive MIMO has been a formidable challenge. In this paper, we address this problem with a novel CSI feedback framework enabled by the partial reciprocity of uplink and downlink channels in the wideband regime. We first derive the closed-form expression of the rank of the wideband massive MIMO channel covariance matrix for a given angle-delay distribution. A low-rankness property is identified, which generalizes the well-known result of the narrow-band uniform linear array setting. Then we propose a partial channel reciprocity (PCR) codebook, inspired by the low-rankness behavior and the fact that the uplink and downlink channels have similar angle-delay distributions. Compared to the latest codebook in 5G, the proposed PCR codebook scheme achieves higher performance, lower complexity at the user side, and requires less feedback. We derive the feedback overhead necessary to achieve asymptotically error-free CSI feedback. Two low-complexity alternatives are also proposed to further reduce the complexity at the base station side. Simulations with the practical 3GPP channel model show the significant gains over the latest 5G codebook, which prove that our proposed methods are practical solutions for 5G and beyond.}

	abstract = {To boost the performance of wireless communication networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aided communications have drawn dramatically attention due to their flexibility in establishing the line of sight (LoS) communications. However, with the blockage in the complex urban environment, and due to the movement of UAVs and mobile users, the directional paths can be occasionally blocked by trees and high-rise buildings. Intelligent reflection surfaces (IRSs) that can reflect signals to generate virtual LoS paths are capable of providing stable communications and serving wider coverage. This is the first paper that exploits a three-dimensional geometry dynamic channel model in IRS- assisted UAV-enabled communication system. Moreover, we develop a novel deep learning based channel tracking algorithm consisting of two modules: channel pre-estimation and channel tracking. A deep neural network with off-line training is designed for denoising in the pre-estimation module. Moreover, for channel tracking, a stacked bi-directional long short term memory (Stacked Bi-LSTM) is developed based on a framework that can trace back historical time sequence together with bidirectional structure over multiple stacked layers. Simulations have shown that the proposed channel tracking algorithm requires fewer epochs to convergence compared to benchmark algorithms. It also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is superior to different benchmarks with small pilot overheads and comparable computation complexity.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is a novel framework that processes modulation symbols via a time-independent channel characterized by the delay-Doppler domain. The conventional waveform, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), requires tracking frequency selective fading channels over the time, whereas OTFS benefits from full time-frequency diversity by leveraging appropriate equalization techniques. In this paper, we consider a neural network-based supervised learning framework for OTFS equalization. Learning of the introduced neural network is conducted in each OTFS frame fulfilling an online learning framework: the training and testing datasets are within the same OTFS-frame over the air. Utilizing reservoir computing, a special recurrent neural network, the resulting one-shot online learning is sufficiently flexible to cope with channel variations among different OTFS frames (e.g., due to the link/rank adaptation and user scheduling in cellular networks). The proposed method does not require explicit channel state information (CSI) and simulation results demonstrate a lower bit error rate (BER) than conventional equalization methods in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime under large Doppler spreads. When compared with its neural network-based counterparts for OFDM, the introduced approach for OTFS will lead to a better tradeoff between the processing complexity and the equalization performance.}

This paper addresses an AoI-aware spectrum sharing (AgeS) problem in IWNs, where multiple device-to-device (D2D) links opportunistically access the spectrum to satisfy their AoI constraints while maximizing primal links’ throughput. Particularly, we orchestrate the access of D2D links in a distributed manner. Since distributed scheduling results in incomplete observation, D2D links share the spectrum with uncertainty on the transmission environment. Therefore, we propose a distributed scheduling scheme, called D-age, to deal with the transmission uncertainty in the AgeS problem, where an adaptation of actor-critic method is adopted with AoI constraints tackled in the dual domain. To address the non-stationary environment and multi-agent credit assignment issue, cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach is developed, where multiple local actors are designed to guide D2D links to make real-time decisions via distributed scheduling policies, which are evaluated by an edge-assisted global critic with action-aware advantage functions. Integrated with graph attention networks (GATs), the critic selectively learns contextual information by assigning different importances to neighboring links, which enables the evaluation of scheduling policies in a scalable and computation-efficient manner. Theoretical guarantee of the time-averaged AoI constraints is provided and the effectiveness of D-age in terms of both AoI violation ratio and the capacity of primal links is demonstrated by simulation.}

This paper addresses the achievable rate improvement for the downlink NOMA system, in the context of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), by means of the improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) technique. We investigate a basic scenario where the strong user transmits the conventional proper data, while the weak user adopts an improper signaling scheme. The users’ data rates are first formulated in terms of the impropriety degree of the IGS, under residual interference introduced by the imperfect SIC. In this way, analytical expressions for the best improper transmission can be characterized by jointly optimizing the user’s power and the impropriety degree, where their sufficient and necessary conditions are provided. When the strong user transmits with its maximum power, the IGS scheme always increases the achievable rate of the strong user while the weak user may also benefit. When the weak user transmits with its maximum power, such a scheme enables us optimize the achievable rate of the strong user under various levels of channel-to-noise ratios (CNR) and imperfect SIC. Finally, when both the users are imposed by quality of service (QoS) constraints, a Q-learning based solution is proposed to maximize their sum rate. Simulations on the downlink NOMA system support the analysis.}

In addition, the proposed FPDN is useful in practice because it is robust to noise and achieves a high FPD performance without any prior assumption on the number of total incoming multipath, which is required for conventional signal processing-based FPD techniques. We compare the performance of the proposed FPDN to that of diverse conventional techniques, such as techniques based on narrow correlator, super-resolution, and some widely used CNNs such as VGGNet, ResNet, and U-Net, through simulations and field tests. As demonstrated, the proposed FPDN outperforms all of the compared FPD techniques in terms of the computational cost and accuracy for wide range of carrier-to-noise (C/N 0 ) ratios.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of enhancing the quality of virtual reality (VR) services is studied for an indoor terahertz (THz)/visible light communication (VLC) wireless network. In the studied model, small base stations (SBSs) transmit high-quality VR images to VR users over THz bands and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) provide accurate indoor positioning services for them using VLC. Here, VR users move in real time and their movement patterns change over time according to their applications, where both THz and VLC links can be blocked by the bodies of VR users. To control the energy consumption of the studied THz/VLC wireless VR network, VLC access points (VAPs) must be selectively turned on so as to ensure accurate and extensive positioning for VR users. Based on the user positions, each SBS must generate corresponding VR images and establish THz links without body blockage to transmit the VR content. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the average number of successfully served VR users by selecting the appropriate VAPs to be turned on and controlling the user association with SBSs. To solve this problem, a policy gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that adopts a meta-learning approach is proposed. The proposed meta policy gradient (MPG) algorithm enables the trained policy to quickly adapt to new user movement patterns. In order to solve the problem of maximizing the average number of successfully served users for VR scenarios with large numbers of users, a low-complexity dual method based MPG algorithm (D-MPG) with a low complexity is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to a baseline trust region policy optimization algorithm (TRPO), the proposed MPG and D-MPG algorithms yield up to 26.8% and 21.9% improvement in the average number of successfully served users as well as 81.2% and 87.5% gains in the convergence speed, respectively.}

	abstract = {Wirelessly powered backscatter communications (WPBC) is an emerging technology for providing continuous energy and ultra-low power communications. Despite some progress in WPBC systems, resource allocation for multiple devices towards secure backscatter communications (BC) and efficient-energy harvesting (EH) requests a deep-insight investigation. In this paper, we consider a WPBC system in which a full-duplex access point (AP) transmits multi-sinewave signals to power backscatter devices (BDs) and injects artificial noise (AN) to secure their backscatter transmissions. To maximize the minimum harvested energy and ensure fairness and security of all BDs, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering the backscatter time, power splitting ratio between multi-sinewave and AN, and signal power allocation. For a single-BD system, we characterize the achievable secrecy rate-energy region with a non-linear energy harvester and propose two algorithms to solve an energy maximization problem. We then analyze the effect of multi-sinewave and AN signals on BD’s secrecy rate and harvested energy through simulations and proof-of-concept experiments. For a multi-BD system, we propose an iterative algorithm by leveraging block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) techniques to solve the non-convex problem of fair resource allocation and show its convergence and complexity. Numerical results show the proposed algorithm achieves optimal and equitable harvested energy for all BDs with satisfying the security constraint.}

	abstract = {Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is a key enabler for ultrareliable communications. This paper optimizes transmit power for the initial transmission and the subsequent retransmissions of HARQ with either incremental redundancy or Chase combining, aiming to minimize the expected energy consumption given the target outage probability and the target latency. The main challenge is due to the fact that the outage probability is a complicated function of the power variables which are nested in successive convolutions. The existing works mostly use a classic upper bound to approximate the outage probability by assuming unbounded transmit power, then convert the original problem to a geometric programming (GP) problem. In contrast, we propose a novel and much tighter upper bound by taking the practical power limit into consideration. The new bound and the resulting new GP method are further extended to a broader group of channel models with various fading, multiple antennas, and multiple receivers. As shown in simulations, the GP method based on the new bound significantly outperforms the existing strategies that either fix transmit power or optimize power by the classic bounding technique.}

	abstract = {Space-air-ocean integrated networks (SAOINs), composed of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), have been advocated to provide seamless, high-rate, and reliable wireless transmission services for USVs. However, due to the restrictions of limited resources (e.g., spectrum bandwidth, transmission power, etc.), diverse demands of USVs, and selfishness of both UAVs and LEOs, there comes a significant challenge to provision high-quality wireless data rate for USVs to achieve their satisfied quality of experience (QoE). To this end, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical on-demand wireless data rate provisioning scheme to provide ubiquitous transmission services for USVs. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical wireless data rate provisioning framework. The LEO satellite with an extensive wireless coverage is utilized to provide LEO satellite-to-UAV (L2U) data rate for UAVs with a certain L2U data rate price. Each UAV is employed to provide UAV-to-USV (U2U) data rate for covered multiple USVs with a certain U2U data rate price. We then propose a modified three-stage Stackelberg game to model the wireless data rate assignments among LEO satellites, UAVs, and USVs, where the time-varying data rate demands of USVs are considered to formulate the utility maximization problem. Afterwards, the backward induction approach is leveraged to attain the Stackelberg equilibrium as the solution of the formulated problem, where the closed-form expressions on the optimal strategies of both USVs and UAVs under different data rate budgets are obtained by the nonlinear programming method. Besides, an accelerated conjugate gradient descent (ACGD) based iteration algorithm is also designed to obtain the optimal strategies of the LEO satellites on the L2U data rate prices. At last, extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the utilities of USVs, as compared to other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {To provide effective wireless connectivity, the use of aerial vehicles has been proposed as a promising solution in a wide variety of applications. In some of these applications, however, to achieve desirable performance, knowing the location of users may be a necessity. One promising approach for solving the problem of obtaining user locations is through the locations of some nodes (called anchors) and measuring the distance between connected nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose prominent techniques to improve the performance of the localization using multiple moving aerial anchors (MAA). In using MAAs as anchor nodes, the anchor nodes in our scenario have movement capability. This provides us with more flexibility to enhance the accuracy of the localization with taking into consideration the power consumption of MAAs. In fact, we propose an MAA placement method by which each user can be connected to at least one MAA while MAAs communicate with as small as possible power consumption. Then, we propose a path planning for MAAs by which distances between users and MAAs can be measured in order to estimate the locations of users. Our simulation results show that our proposed localization scheme can provide highly accurate location estimations.}

	abstract = {In this work, hierarchical federated learning (HFL) over wireless multi-cell networks is proposed for large-scale model training while preserving data privacy. However, the imbalanced data distribution has a significant impact on the convergence rate and learning accuracy. In addition, a large learning latency is incurred due to the traffic load imbalance among base stations (BSs) and limited wireless resources. To cope with these challenges, we first provide an analysis of the model error and learning latency in wireless HFL. Then, joint user association and wireless resource allocation algorithms are investigated under independent identically distributed (IID) and non-IID training data, respectively. For the IID case, a learning latency aware strategy is designed to minimize the learning latency by optimizing user association and wireless resource allocation, where a mobile device selects the BS with the maximal uplink channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For the non-IID case, the total data distribution distance and learning latency are jointly minimized to achieve the optimal user association and resource allocation. The results show that both data distribution and uplink channel SNR should be taken into consideration for user association in the non-IID case. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by the simulations.}

	abstract = {As revolutionary technologies that can actively change the communication link signal, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have emerged as reliable, economical and convenient wireless communication solutions for a variety of practical scenarios. Therefore, this paper focuses on an IRS empowered UAV downlink communication network, where the dynamic UAV establishes a cascade link via IRS to provide signal enhancement services for multiple users. Considering constraints of transmit power, flight speed and area at the UAV and the reflecting constraints at the IRS, the block coordinate descent (BCD) method based on resource allocation, reflecting design and trajectory optimization is adopted to maximize the sum-rate of all users. The proposed problem is converted by using quadratic transformation and Lagrangian dual transformation. Then applying for the approximate linear method and Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM) to optimize the transmit power of UAV and phase shift of IRS respectively. Since additional reflection propagation paths by IRS, the complexity of the channel model makes the trajectory design difficult. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a UAV trajectory optimization method based on enhanced reinforcement learning with the fixed initial location and destination. In the end, the convergence of the proposed scheme is effectively verified by simulations. Moreover, abundant simulation comparisons between the proposed scheme and other benchmark schemes demonstrate the validity and high performance gains of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {The rapid technological advances of cellular technologies will revolutionize network automation in industrial internet of things (IIoT). In this paper, we investigate the two-timescale resource allocation problem in IIoT networks with hybrid energy supply, where temporal variations of energy harvesting (EH), electricity price, channel state, and data arrival exhibit different granularity. The formulated problem consists of energy management at a large timescale, as well as rate control, channel selection, and power allocation at a small timescale. To address this challenge, we develop an online solution to guarantee bounded performance deviation with only causal information. Specifically, Lyapunov optimization is leveraged to transform the long-term stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term deterministic optimization problems. Then, a low-complexity rate control algorithm is developed based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which accelerates the convergence speed via the decomposition-coordination approach. Next, the joint channel selection and power allocation problem is transformed into a one-to-many matching problem, and solved by the proposed price-based matching with quota restriction. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified through simulations under various system configurations.}

Taking advantage of UAV’s adjustable mobility, a UAV navigation approach is formulated to achieve the aforementioned optimization goal. Conventional offline optimization techniques suffer from inefficiency in accomplishing the formulated UAV navigation task due to the practical consideration of local building distribution and directional antenna radiation pattern. Alternatively, after mapping the navigation task into a Markov decision process (MDP), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided solution is proposed to help the UAV find the optimal flying direction within each time slot, and thus the designed trajectory towards the destination can be generated. To help the DRL agent commit a better trade-off between sampling priority and diversity, a novel quantum-inspired experience replay (QiER) framework is proposed, via relating experienced transition’s importance to its associated quantum bit (qubit) and applying Grover iteration based amplitude amplification technique. Compared to several representative DRL-related and non-learning baselines, the effectiveness and supremacy of the proposed DRL-QiER solution are demonstrated and validated in numerical results.}

	abstract = {Differential spatial modulation (DSM) is a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless transmission technique that achieves additional data bit transmission by utilizing antenna activation indexes. Combined with amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) constellations, the spectrum efficiency of DSM system can be further improved. However, the theoretically optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection suffers from a high complexity that grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas (TAs). Besides, the imperfect channel state information in fast fading channels leads to a severe deterioration of the detection performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel transmission scheme named reordered amplitude phase shift keying aided differential spatial modulation (RAPSK-DSM) and its low-complexity decision-feedback differential detection (DFDD) based detection algorithm. The proposed RAPSK-DSM scheme provides a better solution for addressing the error propagation problem and its detector utilizes the preceding channel gain vectors from previous detection results to mitigate the performance loss caused by time-selective channel fading. Furthermore, by decomposing and pre-computing the detection process, the complexity of proposed detector is effectively reduced due to the avoidance of redundant computations. Numerical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed RAPSK-DSM system is able to achieve substantial bit error rate (BER) performance improvement under fast fading channel conditions at the expense of low complexity.}

	abstract = {The enormous data distributed at the network edge and ubiquitous connectivity have led to the emergence of the new paradigm of distributed machine learning and large-scale data analytics. Distributed principal component analysis (PCA) concerns finding a low-dimensional subspace that contains the most important information of high-dimensional data distributed over the network edge. The subspace is useful for distributed data compression and feature extraction. This work advocates the application of over-the-air federated learning to efficient implementation of distributed PCA in a wireless network under a data-privacy constraint, termed AirPCA. The design features the exploitation of the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel to realize over-the-air aggregation of local subspace updates computed and simultaneously transmitted by devices to a server, thereby reducing the multi-access latency. The original drawback of this class of techniques, namely channel-noise perturbation to uncoded analog modulated signals, is turned into a mechanism for escaping from saddle points during stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the AirPCA algorithm. As a result, the convergence of the AirPCA algorithm is accelerated. To materialize the idea, descent speeds in different types of descent regions are analyzed mathematically using martingale theory by accounting for wireless propagation and techniques including broadband transmission, over-the-air aggregation, channel fading and noise. The results reveal the accelerating effect of noise in saddle regions and the opposite effect in other types of regions. The insight and results are applied to designing an online scheme for adapting receive signal power to the type of current descent region. Specifically, the scheme amplifies the noise effect in saddle regions by reducing signal power and applies the power savings to suppressing the effect in other regions. From experiments using real datasets, such power control is found to accelerate convergence while achieving the same convergence accuracy as in the ideal case of centralized PCA.}

	abstract = {Beam-based wireless power transfer and Fog/edge computing are promising dual technologies for realizing wireless powered Fog computing networks to support the upcoming B5G/6G IoT applications, which require latency-aware and intensive computing, with a limited energy supply. In such systems, IoT devices can either offload their computing tasks to the proximal Fog nodes or execute local computing with replenishing energy from the dedicated beamforming. However, effective integration of these techniques is still challenging, where two new issues arise: energy-aware task offloading and signal interferences from spillovers of wireless beamforming. In this paper, we observe that the beam-ripple phenomenon, which takes advantage of beamformer defects to transfer energy to IoT devices, is the key to jointly addressing these two issues. Different from traditional SWIPT technology, as in our approach the stream is not separately divided into data/energy streams, but target IoT devices can potentially harvest the whole stream. Inspired by this phenomenon, we treat the collaborative energy beamforming and edge computing design as a strongly \\mathcal {NP}\n-hard optimization problem. The proposed solution is an iterative algorithm to cascadingly integrate a polynomial-time \\left({1 - \\frac {1}{e}}\\right)\n-approximation algorithm, which achieves the theoretical upper bound in approximation ratio unless \\mathcal {P} = \\mathcal {NP}\n, and an optimal dynamic programming algorithm. The numerical results show that the energy minimization goal among IoT devices can achieve, and the developed harvest-when-interfered protocol is practical in the wireless powered Fog computing networks.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses high-resolution vehicle positioning and tracking. In recent work, it was shown that a fleet of independent but neighboring vehicles can cooperate for the task of localization by capitalizing on the existence of common surrounding reflectors, using the concept of Team Channel-SLAM. This approach exploits an initial (e.g. GPS-based) vehicle position information and allows subsequent tracking of vehicles by exploiting the shared nature of virtual transmitters associated to the reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we show that the localization can be greatly enhanced by joint sensing and mapping of reflecting surfaces. To this end, we propose a combined approach coined Team Channel-SLAM Evolution (TCSE) which exploits the intertwined relation between (i) the position of virtual transmitters, (ii) the shape of reflecting surfaces, and (iii) the paths described by the radio propagation rays, in order to achieve high-resolution vehicle localization. Overall, TCSE yields a complete picture of the trajectories followed by dominant paths together with a mapping of reflecting surfaces. While joint localization and mapping is a well researched topic within robotics using inputs such as radar and vision, this paper is first to demonstrate such an approach within mobile networking framework based on radio data.}

	abstract = {In order to unlock the full advantages of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in the downlink, the base station (BS) must leverage information about the downlink fading channels. However, in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, full channel reciprocity does not hold, and acquiring information about the downlink channels generally requires downlink pilot transmission followed by uplink feedback. Prior work proposed to design pilot transmission, feedback, and channel state information (CSI) estimation, or directly downlink beamforming, via deep learning in an end-to-end manner. While previous work only used downlink pilots in a single slot, in this work, we introduce an enhanced end-to-end design that leverages partial uplink-downlink reciprocity and temporal correlation of the fading processes by utilizing jointly downlink and uplink pilots across multiple time slots. The proposed method is based on a novel deep learning architecture – HyperRNN – that combines hypernetworks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to optimize the transfer of long-term invariant channel features from uplink to downlink. Simulation results demonstrate that the HyperRNN achieves a lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance in terms of channel estimation, and that it attains a larger achievable sum-rate when applied to multi-user beamforming, as compared to the state of the art.}

	abstract = {Earth observation systems play important roles in many critical applications. The rapid increase of the number of satellites and their sensing capability, however, makes it challenging to send the massive amount of observed data back to the Earth. One promising direction to enhance the earth observation throughput is to use inter-satellite communication. Towards this, we identify two key design factors: 1) the capability to support on-demand scheduling of inter-satellite communication; and 2) the capability to co-optimize the scheduling of observation and transmission missions. For both, rigorous study is needed to determine whether they provide sufficient throughput gain to justify their additional complexity. Our work formulates a generic earth observation and transmission problem to study the maximum network throughput under different settings. By succinctly modeling the different constraints using a generalized time-varying graph representation, we can efficiently find the optimal scheduling solutions. We conduct an extensive study, which shows that using 40 relay satellites from the “starlink” constellation can increase the throughput of 10 sensing satellites from the “Gaofen” constellation by more than 400%. In particular, on-demand scheduling under heavy load and co-optimization of observation/transmission under light but time-critical load can improve the throughput by more than 180% and 100%, respectively.}

	abstract = {A communication enabled indoor intelligent robots (IRs) service framework is proposed, where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is adopted to enable highly reliable communications. In cooperation with the ultramodern indoor channel model recently proposed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Lego modeling method is proposed, which can deterministically describe the indoor layout and channel state in order to construct the radio map. The investigated radio map is invoked as a virtual environment to train the reinforcement learning agent, which can save training time and hardware costs. Build on the proposed communication model, motions of IRs who need to reach designated mission destinations and their corresponding down-link power allocation policy are jointly optimized to maximize the mission efficiency and communication reliability of IRs. In an effort to solve this optimization problem, a novel reinforcement learning approach named deep transfer deterministic policy gradient (DT-DPG) algorithm is proposed. Our simulation results demonstrate in the following: 1) with the aid of NOMA techniques, the communication reliability of IRs is effectively improved; 2) radio map is qualified to be a virtual training environment, and its statistical channel state information improves training efficiency by about 30%; 3) proposed DT-DPG algorithm is superior to the conventional deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm in terms of optimization performance, training time, and anti-local optimum ability.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) systems have emerged as a green communication technology to enable massive self-sustainable wireless networks by leveraging Radio Frequency (RF) Energy Harvesting (EH) capability. A Full-duplex Ambient Backscatter Communication (FAmBC) network with a Full-duplex Access Point (AP), a dedicated Legacy User (LU), and several Backscatter Devices (BDs) is considered in this study. The AP with two antennas transfers downlink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) information and energy to the dedicated LU and several BDs, respectively, while receiving uplink backscattered information from BDs at the same time. One of the key aims in AmBC networks is to ensure fairness among BDs. To address this, we propose the Multi-objective Lexicographical Optimization Problem (MLOP), which aims to maximize the minimum BD’s throughput while enhancing overall BDs’ throughput, subject to the AP’s subcarrier power, BDs’ reflection coefficients, and backscatter time allocation. Owe to the MLOP is non-convex, we propose Difference Convex Algorithm (DCA) using Exterior Penalty Function Method (EPFM)—an inventive non-convex optimization method— to reach the optimal solution. The most critical advantage of applying this proposed approach is finding the globally optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed method supported by theoretical analysis confirms its superiority compared to some of the investigated suboptimal algorithms with the same computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In symbiotic radio (SR), a secondary transmitter (STx) transmits messages by modulating its information over the radio frequency (RF) signals received from a primary transmitter (PTx), and in return, the secondary transmission provides multipath gain to the primary transmission. In this paper, we are interested in the fundamental mutualistic mechanism between the primary and secondary transmissions, which describes the condition through which the two systems can benefit each other. Since the symbol period ratio\nK\nbetween secondary and primary transmissions is an important system parameter that affects the mutualistic symbiosis, we first derive the theoretical performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) for both primary and secondary transmissions for arbitrary\nK\nby using QPSK modulation scheme at the PTx and BPSK modulation scheme at the STx as an example setup. Then we the obtain closed-form expressions for the condition on\nK\nto enable mutualistic symbiosis in SR, which is not related to the specific channel realizations but determined by the average strengths of the direct and backscatter links when the number of receiving antennas is large. Meanwhile, we analyze the average BER performance and the diversity orders for both transmissions in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Extensive simulations and numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the interrelationship between the primary and secondary transmissions.}

Specifically, we consider a three-phase operation protocol for data uploading, edge computing, and result downloading, where the frequency-division multiple access is implemented to accommodate communications of multiple sensors/actuators. Under this setup, we minimize the end-to-end (E2E) latency of the sensing-communication-computation-actuation loop by properly designing the user association and resource allocation policy, subject to the communication and computation resource constraints. The formulated problem, however, is a mixed-integer non-linear program that is difficult to be solved. Despite this fact, we obtain the optimal solution via using the brute-force search for user association, and convex optimization for resource allocation under given user associations. Next, to reduce the computation complexity from the brute-force search, we propose an alternative algorithm, where the user association and resource allocation are optimized iteratively in an alternating manner, via concave-convex procedure and convex optimization, respectively. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed designs significantly reduce the E2E latency, compared with conventional separate designs.}

In the present work, we propose a generalized combinatorial representation and an associated low-complexity list-based detection algorithm that works for any non-full or full diversity multidimensional codebook. The algorithm includes three options of lists offering different complexity-performance trade-offs. One of the lists has random size and is guaranteed to contain the ML point, while the other two lists have fixed or limited size. Some analytical results are presented for the list sizes. The algorithm also includes a smart search to find the most probable codebook point in the list. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm yields optimal or close-to-optimum performance with a noteworthy detection complexity reduction. Therefore, its adoption can be of practical interest, especially in applications where powerful error-correcting codes are not supported.}

The highly directional mm-Wave channel allows the system to perform user/beam scheduling rather than pure user scheduling during the precoding process.

	abstract = {For massive multiple-input multiple-output systems operating in frequency-division duplex mode, downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition will incur large overhead. This overhead is substantially reduced when sparse channel estimation techniques are employed, owing to the channel sparsity in the angular domain. When a sparse channel estimation method is implemented, the measurement matrix, which is related to the pilot matrix, is essential to the channel estimation performance. Existing sparse channel estimation schemes widely adopt random measurement matrices, which have been criticized for their suboptimal reconstruction performance. This paper proposes novel data-driven solutions to design the measurement matrix. Model-based autoencoders are customized to optimize the measurement matrix by unfolding the classical basis pursuit algorithm. The obtained data-driven measurement matrices are applied to existing sparse reconstruction algorithms, leading to flexible hybrid data-driven implementations for sparse channel estimation. Numerical results show that the proposed data-driven measurement matrices can achieve more accurate reconstructions and use fewer measurements than the existing random matrices, thereby leading to a higher achievable rate for CSI acquisition. Moreover, compared with existing pure deep learning-based sparse reconstruction methods, the proposed hybrid data-driven scheme, which uses the novel data-driven measurement matrices with conventional sparse reconstruction algorithms, can achieve higher reconstruction accuracy.}

Signal subspace separation among UEs is, in fact, rarely realized in practice and is generally beyond the control of the network designer (as it is dictated by the physical scattering environment). In this context, we propose a novel statistical beamforming technique, referred to as MIMO covariance shaping , that exploits multiple antennas at the UEs and leverages the realistic non-Kronecker structure of massive MIMO channels to target a suitable shaping of the channel statistics performed at the UE-side. To optimize the covariance shaping strategies, we propose a low-complexity block coordinate descent algorithm that is proved to converge to a limit point of the original nonconvex problem. For the two-UE case, this is shown to converge to a stationary point of the original problem. Numerical results illustrate the sum-rate performance gains of the proposed method with respect to spatial multiplexing in scenarios where the spatial selectivity of the base station is not sufficient to separate closely spaced UEs.}

It inherits the dynamic mechanism of RC and processes the forward path and loss optimization of the NN using tensor as the underlying data format. Multi-Mode RC exhibits less complexity compared to conventional RC structures (e.g. single-mode RC), and offers comparable generalization performance to its single-mode counterpart. Furthermore, we introduce an alternating least square-based learning algorithm as well as the associated theoretical analysis for Multi-Mode RC. The result can be utilized to guide the configuration of NN parameters to sufficiently circumvent over-fitting issues. As a key application, we consider the symbol detection task in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems with massive MIMO employed at the base stations (BSs). Thanks to the tensor structure of massive MIMO-OFDM signals, our online learning-based symbol detection method generalizes well in terms of bit error rate even using a limited online training set. Evaluation results suggest that the Multi-Mode RC-based learning framework can efficiently and effectively combat practical constraints of wireless systems (i.e. channel state information (CSI) errors and hardware non-linearity) to enable robust and adaptive communications over the air.}

	abstract = {The accelerated convergence of digital and real-world lifestyles has imposed unprecedented demands on today’s wireless network architectures, as it is highly desirable for such architectures to support wireless devices everywhere with high capacity and minimal signaling overhead. Conventional architectures, such as cellular architectures, are not able to satisfy these requirements simultaneously, and are thus no longer suitable for the future era. In this paper, we propose a capacity-centric (C2) architecture for future wireless networking. It is designed based on the principles of maximizing the number of non-overlapping clusters with the average cluster capacity guaranteed to be higher than a certain threshold, and thus provides a flexible way to balance the capacity requirement against the signaling overhead. Our analytical results reveal that C2 has superior generality, wherein both the cellular and the fully coordinated architectures can be viewed as its extreme cases. Simulation results show that the average capacity of C2 is at least three times higher compared to that of the cellular architecture. More importantly, different from the widely adopted conventional wisdom that base-station distributions dominate architecture designs, we find that the C2 architecture is not over-reliant on base-station distributions, and instead the user-side information plays a vital role and cannot be ignored.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study to employ geographic information to address the blockage problem of air-to-ground links between UAV and terrestrial nodes. In particular, a UAV relay is deployed to establish communication links from a ground base station to multiple ground users. To improve communication capacity, we first model the blockage effect caused by buildings according to the three-dimensional (3-D) geographic information. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum capacity among users by jointly optimizing the 3-D position and power allocation of the UAV relay, under the constraints of link capacity, maximum transmit power, and blockage. To solve this complex non-convex problem, a two-loop optimization framework is developed based on Lagrangian relaxation. The outer-loop aims to obtain proper Lagrangian multipliers to ensure the solution of the Lagrangian problem converge to the tightest upper bound on the original problem. The inner-loop solves the Lagrangian problem by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, where UAV 3-D positioning and power allocation are alternately optimized in each iteration. Simulation results confirm that the proposed solution significantly outperforms three benchmark schemes and achieves a performance close to the upper bound on the UAV relay system.}

	abstract = {With the emerging unlicensed spectrum sharing and Machine-to-Machine communications, the coexistence performance of multiple devices with different access schemes operating at the same unlicensed bands has received significant research interests. As the two most representative random-access schemes, Aloha and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) both found wide applications in unlicensed bands. Yet most of the studies have focused on the coexistence of CSMA-based networks, leaving the coexistence of Aloha-based and CSMA-based networks largely unexplored. The challenge originates from the lack of a coexistence model of slotted Aloha and CSMA. In this paper, the throughput performance of coexisting Aloha and CSMA networks is characterized and optimized by extending a unified analytical framework proposed for random-access networks. The analysis shows that different from the single-network case where the maximum throughput of CSMA is much higher thanks to carrier sensing, when Aloha and CSMA coexist, Aloha would significantly outperform CSMA if each network optimizes its own throughput performance without cooperation, leading to poor throughput performance for CSMA and severe unfairness. To achieve fair coexistence, inter-network cooperation is crucial. The optimal transmission probabilities of Aloha and CSMA for maximizing the total network throughput under a given throughput ratio are further derived, and applied to coexisting LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks to optimize their coexistence performance.}

	abstract = {Belief propagation (BP) is a popular message passing algorithm for distributed cooperative localization. However, due to the nonlinearity of measurement functions, BP implementation has no closed-form expression and requires message approximations. While nonparametric BP can be used, it suffers from a high computational complexity, thus being impractical in energy-constrained networks. In this paper, a parametric Bayesian method with Gaussian BP implementation is proposed for distributed cooperative localization. With linearization of the Euclidean norm in ranging measurements, the joint posterior distribution of agents’ locations is successively approximated with a sequence of high-dimensional Gaussian distributions. At each iteration of the successive Gaussian approximation, vector-valued Gaussian BP is further adopted to compute the marginal distributions of agents’ locations in a distributed way. It is proved by the principle of majorization-minimization that the proposed successive Gaussian approximation is guaranteed to converge, and the sequence of the estimated agents’ locations converges to a stationary point of the objective function of the maximum a posteriori estimation. Furthermore, although cooperative localization involves loopy network topologies, in which convergence property of Gaussian BP is generally unknown, it is proved in this paper that vector-valued Gaussian BP converges, making the proposed parametric BP-based method being the first one achieving convergence guarantee. Compared to the nonparametric BP counterpart, the proposed method has a much lower computational complexity and communication overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a superior performance in localization accuracy compared to existing cooperative localization methods.}

	abstract = {Video analytics demand intensive computation resources, which means long processing delay when running on mobile devices. Although offloading computation to the cloud can partially solve the problem, transferring videos to the cloud introduces high transmission delay. With mobile edge computing, computation can be offloaded to the nearby edge servers to reduce the delay. However, the computation resources of the edge servers are usually limited and highly dynamic, and then server selection should be adaptive in order to improve the performance of video analytics. Also, frame resolution should be selected to achieve a better tradeoff between accuracy and frame processing rate. In this paper, we study the server resource-aware offloading problem for video analytics, where the goal is to maximize the utility which is a weighted function of accuracy and frame processing rate. The major challenge to solve this problem is the lack of server and network knowledge and the dynamic system environment. To overcome these challenges, we formulate the problem as a contextual Multi-armed Bandit problem, and propose a Bayesian Optimization based online learning algorithm to gradually learn the server status and the optimal solution, and make it adaptable for time-varying environments. Both theoretical analysis and evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm.}

By utilizing CS, a receiver could sense the state of channels with sub-Nyquist analog to digital converters when signals are sparse. Traditional CS methods struggle with non-sparse signals due to their intrinsic sparsity assumption. Therefore, we propose using deep learning (DL) to solve the vector support recovery problem with channels’ high occupancy. The simulation results show that the proposed CS framework powered by DL can perform better than a traditional CS analytical benchmark, both in high and low channel occupation regions. We also observe that the ML can work under a lower sampling rate than traditional CS methods. To process data sampled with high channel numbers, a divide and conquer tactic is implemented.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have drawn considerable attention due to their ability to direct electromagnetic waves into desirable directions. Although RISs share some similarities with relays, the two have fundamental differences impacting their performance. To harness the benefits of both, we propose a downlink system wherein a relay and an RIS improve performance in terms of energy-efficiency. Using singular value decomposition (SVD), semidefinite programming (SDP), and function approximations, we propose different solutions for optimizing the beamforming matrices at the base-station (BS), the relay, and the phase shifts at the RIS to minimize the total power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The problem is solved when the relay operates in half-duplex and full-duplex modes and when the reflecting elements have continuous and discrete phase shifts. Simulation results compare the performance of the system with and without the RIS or the relay, under different optimization solutions. The results show that the system with full-duplex relay and RIS outperforms the other scenarios, and the contribution of full-duplex relay is higher than that of the RIS. However, an RIS outperforms a half-duplex relay when the required QoS is high. The results also show that increasing the number of reflecting elements improves the performance better in the presence of a relay than in its absence.}

	abstract = {We consider uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication. The transmit (Tx) side of the envisaged system consists of several single-antenna users or/and several multiple-antenna users. At the receive side, a multiple-antenna access point employs compressive sensing techniques to estimate the channel impulse response from the preamble portion of the observed packets. The traditional approach is that of orthogonal pilot allocation: during a short training period, each OFDM subcarrier is assigned exclusively to a single Tx antenna. In this case, the channel state information can conveniently be acquired on a per Tx antenna basis. To the best of our knowledge, all related research imposes that all Tx antennas are allocated the same amount of pilots (which must then be tailored for the most extreme channel conditions). However, in the considered system, Tx antennas may experience totally different channel conditions. Under these circumstances, the use of a fixed number of pilots per Tx antenna results in a lot of unnecessary overhead. To tackle this problem, our work addresses the design of efficient algorithms for adaptive orthogonal pilot allocation. The following design principles are applied: orthogonal pilot allocation, constant-modulus modulation, minimum measurement matrix mutual coherence optimization, and the condition that the number of pilot subcarriers allocated to each Tx antenna is adjusted to the channel conditions experienced by that Tx antenna. The paper tackles the problem of determining the optimal number of pilot subcarriers as well as the optimal positions of the pilots. To facilitate adaptive operation, we propose a reduced-complexity method to determine the optimal pilot positions. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated by means of computer simulations, using both theoretical channel models and results from our own channel measurement campaign.}

The proposal targets a learning-based intelligent SAS where opportunistic allocation of any available bandwidth is done after meeting the SLA requirements. Such an opportunistic allocation is particularly beneficial for nomadic users with varying QoS requirements. The opportunistic allocation is carried out with the help of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction. The proposal allows the users of the integrated network to decide the payment they want to make in order to opportunistically avail bandwidth. Learning automata is used for the users to intelligently converge to the optimal payment value based on the network load.

In this paper, a novel adaptive coded spatial modulation scheme with probabilistic shaping (PS) is proposed to approach the capacity of the spatial modulation (SM) in visible light communication (VLC) channels with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD). In the proposed scheme, spatial and constellation symbols are probabilistically shaped depending on the user’s location inside the room and the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). Moreover, we optimize the channel coding rate to maximize further the achievable rate of the proposed scheme for a given OSNR. Finally, we propose an algorithm to compute the capacity-achieving distribution of the proposed scheme with unipolar\nM\n-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signaling. The proposed scheme outperforms uniform and an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based scheme in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and/or frame error rate (FER). For example, for 8-PAM signaling with\nN=8\ntransmit antennas, the proposed scheme operates within 0.2 dB from the unipolar\nM\n-PAM SM VLC channel signaling capacity and outperforms the uniform and OFDM based schemes in terms of FER by at least 1.1 dB and 1.3 dB at a normalized data rate of 1.33 bits per channel use per sub-carrier (b/cu/sc), respectively.}

	abstract = {Integrated terrestrial-satellite networks (ITSNs) are the promising trends of future networks. However, there exist great challenges when performing video multicast in ITSNs due to the strong heterogeneity of users in comprehensive satellite coverage and the inter-system complex co-channel interference. To overcome these, we make the first attempt to propose an efficient cooperative robust video multicast (CRVM-ITSN) framework in ITSNs. The basic idea is to leverage the non-orthogonal multiple access technique in the cooperative transmission of ITSNs to achieve high-efficiency robust video multicast. The desired robust multicast performance realizes that the recovered video quality can adapt to diverse channel conditions of users. In CRVM-ITSN, to achieve the optimal cooperative transmission performance, power allocation and chunk scheduling of video data are jointly formulated as a distortion minimization problem, which is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming problem. To solve it, we design a provably convergent optimal algorithm by converting it to be convex. Besides, based on the theorem on optimal chunks selection of satellite cooperative transmission, a low-complexity chunk grouping algorithm is proposed to accelerate the optimal algorithm. Simulation results have demonstrated the superiority of proposed CRVM-ITSN against existing reference schemes, achieving about 4.1dB more gains in the recovered video quality.}

In this paper, a novel three dimensional (3D) space-time-frequency non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed for indoor VLC channels. The proposed VLC GBSM can capture unique indoor VLC channel characteristics such as the space-time-frequency non-stationarity caused by large light-emitting diode (LED) arrays in indoor scenarios, long travelling paths, and large bandwidths of visible light waves, respectively. In addition, the proposed model can support special radiation patterns of LEDs, 3D translational and rotational motions of the optical receiver (Rx), and can be applied to angle diversity receivers (ADRs). Key channel properties are simulated and analyzed, including the space-time-frequency correlation function (STFCF), received power, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, and path loss (PL). Simulation results verify the space-time-frequency non-stationarity in indoor VLC channels. In addition, the influence of light source radiation patterns, receiver rotations, and ADRs on channel characteristics have been investigated. Finally, the accuracy and practicality of the proposed model are validated by comparing the simulation result of channel 3dB bandwidth with the existing measurement data. The proposed channel model will play a supporting role in the design of future 6G VLC systems.}

	abstract = {Digital beamforming (DBF) with full Radio-Frequency (RF) complexity requires a separate RF chain per transmit antenna, which is not only difficult to realize for large-scale MIMO systems but also vulnerable to hardware imperfection. In this paper, we show that DBF architectures don’t necessarily require the number of RF chains to be the same as the number of transmit antennas. We propose a low RF-complexity transmit DBF architecture that enables to use a small number of RF chains to serve a large number of transmit antennas. In our architecture, the transmit antennas are divided into groups. All antennas in the same group share the same RF chain in a time-multiplexed manner to preserve the signal from baseband till the antenna aperture. A novel antenna grouping algorithm is proposed to dynamically group the transmit antennas in a way that each antenna group forms a close-to-rank-one channel matrix with the receive antennas. Under ideal hardware conditions, we show that our DBF architecture can achieve nearly the same performance as that of the conventional full RF-complexity DBF in terms of bandwidth and spectral efficiency. However, when hardware imperfection is considered, our architecture outperforms full RF-complexity DBF in both spectral and energy efficiency because it is more robust to inter RF-chain cross-talk effects due to the reduction on the number of required RF chains.}

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) estimation is one of the key techniques for improving the performance of wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, the fifth generation wireless communication systems require higher accuracy and lower latency for CSI estimation. In this paper, the methods of noise modeling and online learning are combined to improve the accuracy and reduce the latency. The complex noise environment (considering noise and interference together) is modeled as a specific mixture of Gaussian (MoG) distribution because of its widely approximation capability to any continuous distribution. The MoG CSI estimation (MoG-CE) model and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm are introduced as one of the baseline methods. Further, the parameters of the model can be updated in real time based on the prior knowledge of historical information. Therefore, the online MoG CSI estimation (O-MoG-CE) model and online MoG dynamic CSI estimation (O-MoG-D-CE) model are proposed for time-invariant and time-varying CSI estimations, respectively. The above models can not only self-adapt to various complex communication scenarios robustly but also achieve online and dynamic CSI estimation to improve the accuracy and reduce the latency significantly. In addition, the proposed models can be formulated as standard maximum a posteriori estimations and efficient online expectation maximization (OEM) algorithms are applied for the estimations in a pure machine learning fashion. Comparing with baseline methods, the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of the accuracy, latency and computation consumption.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a wireless multihop device-to-device (D2D) based mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where the destination wireless device (WD) is scheduled to compute nomographic functions. Under the MapReduce framework and motivated by reducing communication resource overhead, we propose a new multi-level over-the-air (OTA) aggregation scheme for the destination WD to collect the individual partially aggregated intermediate values (IVAs) for reduction from multiple source WDs in the data shuffling phase. For OTA aggregation per level, the source WDs employ a truncated channel-inverse structure multiplied by their individual transmit coefficients in transmission over the same time-frequency resource blocks, and the destination WD finally uses a receive filtering factor to construct the aggregated IVA. Under this setup, we develop a unified transceiver design framework that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the aggregated IVA at the destination WD subject to the source WDs’ individual power constraints, by jointly optimizing the individual transmit coefficients of the source WDs and the receive filtering factor of the destination WD. The formulated power-constrained MSE minimization problem is non-convex. First, based on the primal decomposition method, we derive the closed-form solution under the special case of a common transmit coefficient. This shows that the common transmit coefficient of the source WDs is determined by the minimal transmit power budget among them. Next, for the general case, we transform the original problem into a quadratic fractional programming problem, and then develop a low-complexity algorithm to obtain the (near-) optimal solution by leveraging Dinkelbach’s algorithm along with the Gaussian randomization method. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed multi-level OTA aggregation scheme over various existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Device-edge co-inference opens up new possibilities for resource-constrained wireless devices (WDs) to execute deep neural network (DNN)-based applications with heavy computation workloads. In particular, the WD executes the first few layers of the DNN and sends the intermediate features to the edge server that processes the remaining layers of the DNN. By adapting the model splitting decision, there exists a tradeoff between local computation cost and communication overhead. In practice, the DNN model is re-trained and updated periodically at the edge server. Once the DNN parameters are regenerated, part of the updated model must be placed at the WD to facilitate on-device inference. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of the model placement and online model splitting decisions to minimize the energy-and-time cost of device-edge co-inference in presence of wireless channel fading. The problem is challenging because the model placement and model splitting decisions are strongly coupled, while involving two different time scales. We first tackle online model splitting by formulating an optimal stopping problem, where the finite horizon of the problem is determined by the model placement decision. In addition to deriving the optimal model splitting rule based on backward induction, we further investigate a simple one-stage look-ahead rule, for which we are able to obtain analytical expressions of the model splitting decision. The analysis is useful for us to efficiently optimize the model placement decision in a larger time scale. In particular, we obtain a closed-form model placement solution for the fully-connected multilayer perceptron with equal neurons. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the joint optimal model placement and splitting with various DNN structures.}

In addition, even the base station sites can be shared by the operators. We describe important challenges in using traditional CS in this setting and propose enhanced CS protocols to address these challenges. Using stochastic geometry, we develop a general framework for downlink coverage probability analysis of our shared mmWave network in the presence of CS and derive the downlink coverage probability expressions for several CS protocols. Our work is the first to investigate and analyze (using stochastic geometry) CS for mmWave networks with spectrum and BS sites shared among non-coordinating operators. We evaluate the downlink coverage probability of our shared mmWave network using simulations as well as numerical examples based on our analysis. Our evaluations show that our proposed approach leads to an improvement in coverage probability, compared to the coverage probability with no CS, for higher values of signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). Interestingly, our evaluations also reveal that for lower values of SINR, not using any CS is the best strategy in terms of the downlink coverage probability.}

Under dynamic channel conditions with moving transmitter/receiver, the number of MPCs, the MPC dispersion parameters, and the number of false alarm contributions are unknown and time-varying. We develop a Bayesian model for sequential detection and estimation of MPC dispersion parameters, and represent it by a factor graph enabling the use of BP for efficient computation of the marginal posterior distributions. At each time step, a snapshot-based parametric channel estimator provides parameter estimates of a set of MPCs which are used as noisy measurements by the proposed BP-based algorithm. It performs joint probabilistic data association, and estimation of the time-varying MPC parameters and the mean number of false alarm measurements, by means of the sum-product algorithm rules. The algorithm also exploits amplitude information enabling the reliable detection of “weak” MPCs with very low component signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The performance of the proposed algorithm compares well to state-of-the-art algorithms for high SNR MPCs, but it significantly outperforms them for medium or low SNR MPCs. Results using real radio measurements demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in realistic and challenging scenarios.}

We also provide a low complexity version, suitable for practical scenarios.

In GSMG-HCNs, both renewable and grid energy power the base stations. Unlike existing works, we consider the cost of both renewable and grid energy and formulate the power line loss process caused by ES into our model. To solve the proposed problem, we transform it into a real-time issue by the Lyapunov technique. The proposed Cost-Aware Online Resource Management (CAORM) algorithm decouples the real-time issue into two sub-problems, one of which is linear and the other is addressed based on the successive convex approximation approach. We theoretically prove the asymptotic optimality of the CAORM algorithm and a tradeoff between the average total energy cost and the average queue length. Simulation results reveal that the CAORM algorithm outperforms benchmarks in reducing total energy cost and can make appropriate decisions according to different unit costs of renewable energy. Besides, the designed distance-related ES loss rate can help obtain better solutions with lower ES losses.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a cascade blockage model for analyzing the vision that a user has of a wireless network. This model, inspired by the classical multiplicative cascade models, has a radial structure meant to analyze blockages seen by the receiver at the origin in different angular sectors. The main novelty is that it is based on the geometry of obstacles and takes the joint blockage phenomenon into account. We show on a couple of simple instances that the Laplace transforms of total interference satisfies a functional equation that can be solved efficiently by an iterative scheme. This is used to analyze the coverage probability of the receiver and the effect of blockage correlation and penetration loss in both dense and sparse blockage environments. Furthermore, this model is used to investigate the effect of blockage correlation on user beamforming techniques. Another functional equation and its associated iterative algorithm are proposed to derive the coverage performance of the best beam selection in this context. In addition, the conditional coverage probability is also derived to evaluate the effect of beam switching. The results not only show that beam selection is quite efficient for multi-beam terminals, but also show how the correlation brought by blockages can be leveraged to accelerate beam sweeping and pairing.}

	abstract = {Implementing federated learning (FL) algorithms in wireless networks has garnered a wide range of attention. However, few works have considered the impact of user mobility on the learning performance. To fill this research gap, we develop a theoretical model to characterize the hierarchical federated learning (HFL) algorithm in wireless networks where the mobile users may roam across edge access points (APs), leading to incompletion of inconsistent FL training. We provide the convergence analysis of conventional HFL with user mobility. Our analysis proves that the learning performance of conventional HFL deteriorates drastically with highly-mobile users. And such a decline in the learning performance will be exacerbated with small number of participants and large data distribution divergences among users’ local data. To circumvent these issues, we propose a mobility-aware cluster federated learning (MACFL) algorithm by redesigning the access mechanism, local update rule, and model aggregation scheme. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the learning performance of conventional HFL, a cluster federated learning (CFL) with simple averaging, and our proposed MACFL. The results show that our MACFL can enhance the learning performance, especially for three different cases: (\ni\n) the case of users with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, (\nii\n) the case of users with high mobility, and (\niii\n) the case with a small number of users.}

	abstract = {The potential of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) is investigated as a promising technique for enhancing the energy efficiency of wireless networks. Specifically, the IRS enables passive beamsteering by employing many low-cost individually controllable reflect elements. The resulting change of the channel state, however, not only increases the signal quality but also the interference at the users. To counteract this negative side effect, we employ rate splitting (RS), which inherently is able to mitigate the impact of interference. We facilitate practical implementation by considering a Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) at the cost of finite fronthaul-link capacities, which necessitate the allocation of sensible user-centric clusters to ensure energy-efficient transmissions. Dynamic methods for RS and the user clustering are proposed to account for the interdependencies of the individual techniques. Numerical results show that the dynamic RS method establishes synergistic benefits between RS and the IRS. Additionally, the dynamic user clustering and the IRS cooperate synergistically, reflected by increased individual gains for the dynamic clustering. Interestingly, with an increasing fronthaul capacity, the gain of the dynamic user clustering decreases, while the gain of the dynamic RS method increases. Around the resulting intersection, both methods affect the system concurrently, improving the energy efficiency drastically.}

Specifically, the channel gains from the transmitters to the receivers are available only through their mean and covariance rather than complete distributions. Our goal is to maximize the energy efficiency among all transmitter-receiver pairs while guaranteeing their capacity requirements. For this problem, we employ chance-constrained programming (CCP), which allows occasional violation of target capacity threshold as long as the probability of such violation is below a small tolerable constant (risk level). We propose a solution based on a novel reformulation technique that converts the original CCP into a deterministic optimization problem without relaxation errors. Then the deterministic optimization problem is approximated into a Geometric Program (GP) based on tight polynomial approximations, which can be solved optimally. We prove that our proposed solution achieves near-optimal performance with polynomial time complexity.}

In this work, optical IRS-aided dual-hop mixed FSO and RF system is first proposed for cloud radio access network (C-RAN). Specifically, polar codes are introduced to combat turbulence and building sway induced fading in FSO link, and transmit beamforming (TBF) technique is designed to achieve optimal data-rate for RF link. Supposing that the IRS-aided FSO link is subject to exponentiated Weibull distribution with geometric and misalignment loss, whereas the RF link experiences the Fisher-Snedecor\nF\ncomposite fading, the analytical closed-form outage probability expression is derived in terms of Meijer G and Lauricella multivariate hypergeometric functions with decode-and-forward strategy. Exact closed-form average bit error rate expressions are obtained when the relay of C-RAN adopts single antenna and multiantenna beamforming techniques. On the basis of moment generating function of end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, the ergodic capacity is obtained in terms of univariate and multivariate Fox H-functions over independent but not identically distributed Fisher-Snedecor\nF\nfading channels. The correctness of the analytical results is verified through Monte-Carlo simulations. We further provide an asymptotic analysis and discuss the achievable diversity orders.}

	abstract = {Spectral efficiency improvement is a key focus in most wireless communication systems and achieved by various means such as using large antenna arrays and/or advanced modulation schemes and signal formats. This work proposes to further improve spectral efficiency through combining non-orthogonal spectrally efficient frequency division multiplexing (SEFDM) systems with index modulation (IM), which can efficiently make use of the indices of activated subcarriers as communication information. Recent research has verified that IM may be used with SEFDM to alleviate inter-carrier interference (ICI) and improve error performance. This work proposes new SEFDM signal formats based on novel activation pattern designs, which limit the locations of activated subcarriers and enable a variable number of activated subcarriers in each SEFDM subblock. SEFDM-IM system designs are developed by jointly considering activation patterns, modulation schemes and signal waveform formats, with a set of solutions evaluated under different spectral efficiency scenarios. Detailed modelling of coded systems and simulation studies reveal that the proposed designs not only lead to better bit error rate (BER) but also lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and reduced computational complexity relative to other reported index-modulated systems.}

	abstract = {In this work, we study a full-duplex (FD) cloud radio access network (C-RAN) from the aspects of infrastructure sharing and information secrecy, where the central unit utilizes FD remote radio units (RU)s belonging to the same operator, i.e., the trusted RUs, as well as the RUs belonging to other operators or private owners, i.e., the untrusted RUs. Furthermore, the communication takes place in the presence of untrusted external receivers, i.e., eavesdropper nodes. The communicated uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) waveforms are quantized in order to comply with the limited capacity of the fronthaul links. In order to provide information secrecy, we propose a novel utilization of the quantization noise shaping in the DL, such that it is simultaneously used to comply with the limited capacity of the fronthaul links, as well as to degrade decoding capability of the individual eavesdropper and the untrusted RUs for both the UL and DL communications. In this regard, expressions describing the achievable secrecy rates are obtained. An optimization problem for jointly designing the DL and UL quantization and precoding strategies are then formulated, with the purpose of maximizing the overall system weighted sum secrecy rate. Due to the intractability of the formulated problem, an iterative solution is proposed, following the successive inner approximation and semi-definite relaxation frameworks, with convergence to a stationary point. Numerical evaluations indicate a promising gain of the proposed approaches for providing information secrecy against the untrusted infrastructure nodes and/or external eavesdroppers in the context of FD C-RAN communications.}

	abstract = {Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a popular distributed learning framework that allows privacy-preserving collaborative model training via periodic learning-updates communication between edge devices and server. Due to the constrained bandwidth, only a subset of devices can be selected to upload their updates at each training iteration. This has led to an active research area in FEEL studying the optimal device scheduling policy for communication time minimization. However, owing to the difficulty in quantifying the exact communication time, prior work in this area can only tackle the problem partially and indirectly by minimizing either the iteration rounds or per-round latency, while the total communication time is determined by both metrics. To close this research gap, we make the first attempt in this paper to formulate and solve the communication time minimization problem. We first derive a tight bound to approximate the remaining communication time through cross-disciplinary effort that combines the learning theory for convergence rate analysis and communication theory for per-round latency analysis. Building on the novel analytical result, an optimized probabilistic device scheduling policy is derived in closed-form by solving the approximate communication time minimization problem. It is found that the optimized policy gradually turns its priority from suppressing the remaining communication rounds to reducing per-round latency as the training process evolves. Extensive experiments based on real-world dataset and a use case on collaborative 3D objective detection in autonomous driving are provided to verify the superiority of the proposed policy over three benchmark policies based on the indirect solution approaches.}

	abstract = {In wireless networks, the optimization problems generally have complex constraints and are usually solved via utilizing the traditional optimization methods that have high computational complexity and need to be executed repeatedly with the change of network environments. In this paper, to overcome these shortcomings, an unsupervised deep unrolling framework based on projection gradient descent (PGD), i.e., unrolled PGD network (UPGDNet), is designed to solve a family of constrained optimization problems. The set of constraints is divided into two categories according to the coupling relations among optimization variables and the convexity of constraints. One category of constraints includes convex constraints with decoupling among optimization variables, and the other category of constraints includes non-convex or convex constraints with coupling among optimization variables. Then, the first category of constraints is directly projected onto the feasible region, while the second category of constraints is projected onto the feasible region using a neural network. Finally, an unrolled sum rate maximization network (USRMNet) is designed based on UPGDNet to solve the weighted SR maximization problem for the multiuser ultra-reliable low latency communication system. Numerical results show that USRMNet has a comparable performance with low computational complexity and an acceptable generalization ability in terms of the user distribution.}

A synchronous transmission is triggered when multiple devices report an event simultaneously, or by a common wake-up call. In this paper, we focus on synchronous transmissions and propose a multicast triggered\ns\nynchronous\nt\nransmission protocol, abbreviated as MURIST, which enables contention based and coordinated data transmissions among distributed devices in order to reduce transmissions latency and energy consumption. Furthermore, we develop a novel analytical model based on an absorbing Markov chain to evaluate the performance of MURIST in a network cluster. Unlike existing models that are merely targeted at the behavior of a single device, the novelty of our model resides in a generic framework to assess the behavior of a cluster of devices for synchronous data transmissions. Based on the analytical model, we obtain closed-form expressions for the distributions of successful and discarded transmissions, number of collisions, and delay, as well as for energy consumption. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the accuracy of the analytical model and evaluate the performance of our scheme versus that of two other schemes.}

To address key challenges of enabling FL over a wireless fog-cloud system (e.g., non-i.i.d. data, users’ heterogeneity), we first propose an efficient FL algorithm based on Federated Averaging (called\nFedFog\n) to perform the local aggregation of gradient parameters at fog servers and global training update at the cloud. Next, we employ\nFedFog\nin wireless fog-cloud systems by investigating a novel network-aware FL optimization problem that strikes the balance between the global loss and completion time. An iterative algorithm is then developed to obtain a precise measurement of the system performance, which helps design an efficient stopping criteria to output an appropriate number of global rounds. To mitigate the straggler effect, we propose a flexible user aggregation strategy that trains fast users first to obtain a certain level of accuracy before allowing slow users to join the global training updates. Extensive numerical results using several real-world FL tasks are provided to verify the theoretical convergence of\nFedFog\n. We also show that the proposed co-design of FL and communication is essential to substantially improve resource utilization while achieving comparable accuracy of the learning model.}

Without loss of generality, we adopt the maximum eigenvalue detection approach, and propose a corresponding analytical framework based on random matrix theory, to evaluate the detection probability in the asymptotic regime. Besides, the RIS is configured with only the statistical channel state information to avoid realtime channel estimation. With the statistical configuration, the asymptotic distributions of the equivalent channel gains are derived. Then, we provide the theoretical predictions about the number of reflecting elements required to achieve a detection probability close to 1. Finally, we present the Monte-Carlo simulation results to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed asymptotic analytical framework for the detection probability and the validity of the theoretical predictions about the number of REs required to achieve a detection probability close to 1. Moreover, the simulation results show that the proposed RIS-enhanced spectrum sensing system can substantially improve the detection performance.}

Although envisioned as practical realizations of mMIMO systems, DMAs represent a new paradigm in the design of signal processing techniques (such as beamforming) due to the constraints inherent to their physical implementation, for which no complete models are available yet. In this work, we propose a complete and electromagnetic-compliant narrowband communication model for a generic DMA based system. Specifically, the model accounts for: i) the wave propagation and reflections throughout the waveguides that feed the antenna elements, ii) the mutual coupling both through the air and the waveguides, and iii) the insertion losses. Also, we integrate the electromagnetic model in the conventional digital communication model, providing a complete and useful framework to design and characterize the performance of these systems. Finally, the accuracy of the model is verified through full-wave simulations.}

	abstract = {Weight reduction and low power consumption are key requirements in the next generation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. Employing modulating retro-reflector (MRR)-based free space optical (FSO) technology is an innovative technique for UAV-to-ground communication in order to reduce the payload weight and power consumption of UAVs which leads to increased maneuverability and flight time of UAV. In this paper, we consider an MRR-based FSO system for UAV-to-ground communication. We will show that the performance of the considered system is very sensitive to tracking errors. Therefore, to assess the benefits of MRR-based UAV deployment for FSO communications, the MRR-based UAV FSO channel is characterized by taking into account tracking system errors along with UAV’s orientation fluctuations, link length, UAV’s height, optical beam divergence angle, effective area of MRR, atmospheric turbulence and optical channel loss in the double-pass channels. To enable effective performance analysis, tractable and closed-form expressions are derived for probability density function of end-to-end signal to noise ratio, outage probability and bit error rate of the considered system under both weak-to-moderate and moderate-to-strong atmospheric turbulence conditions. The accuracy of the analytical expressions is verified by extensive simulations. Analytical results are then used to study the relationship between the optimal system design and tracking system errors.}

	abstract = {For the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), the existing joint design algorithms of channel training and data transmission are not applicable due to the stringent reliability requirement and limited blocklength. To address this issue, we develop a low-complexity joint design framework for MISO communication based on the finite blocklength code (FBC). Specifically, an approximate bound of the packet error probability (PEP) is first derived and validated by practical modulation and coding schemes. It reveals the inherent tension between reliability, latency, and information bit number. Then, we formulate the joint design into a nonconvex optimization problem with the objective to maximize the information bit number. By exploiting the monotonicity of the PEP approximate bound, we provide closed-form solutions of power and blocklength allocation. Thereby, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to support the URLLC services aiming at the information bit number maximization. Furthermore, we investigate the joint designs to optimize the reliability, latency, and total energy, respectively, to fully meet the diverse demands of URLLC services. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the proposed joint designs. The results show the outage capacity-based design severely underestimates the required wireless resources.}

	abstract = {This work addresses the issue of interference generated by co-channel users in downlink multi-antenna multicarrier systems with frequency-packed faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. The resulting interference stems from an aggressive strategy for enhancing the throughput via frequency reuse across different users and the squeezing of signals in the time-frequency plane beyond the Nyquist limit. The spectral efficiency is proved to be increasing with the frequency packing and FTN acceleration factors. The lower bound for the FTN sampling period that guarantees information losslesness is derived as a function of the transmitting-filter roll-off factor, the frequency-packing factor, and the number of subcarriers. Space-time-frequency symbol-level precoders (SLPs) that trade off constructive and destructive interblock interference (IBI) at the single-antenna user terminals are proposed. Redundant elements are added as guard interval to cope with vestigial destructive IBI effects. The proposals can handle channels with delay spread longer than the multicarrier-symbol duration. The receiver architecture is simple, for it does not require digital multicarrier demodulation. Simulations indicate that the proposed SLP outperforms zero-forcing precoding and achieves a target balance between spectral and energy efficiencies by controlling the amount of added redundancy from zero (full IBI) to half (destructive IBI-free) the group delay of the equivalent channel.}

However, since the performance region of ISCC has a higher dimension than those of traditional wireless networks, existing schedulers typically fail to simultaneously meet the heterogeneous requests in ISCC. In this work, we propose a novel wireless scheduling architecture to explore the coordination gains of sensing, communication, and computation from a perspective of joint optimization. Specifically, we first construct an implementation framework of ISCC by combining the mobile edge computing paradigm with the integrated sensing and communication technology, where the inherent tradeoff between sensing, communication, and computation performance is characterized. Next, a joint device association and subchannel assignment problem is formulated to capture the network externalities induced by resource competition among mobile devices with multi-functional requirements. Due to its intractability, we then reformulate it in the matching theoretical manner. To obtain a mutually satisfactory solution under externalities, an iterative matching algorithm is developed by introducing pairwise stability and proved to be convergent and stable. The extensive simulations elucidate the significant superiority of our proposed scheme over those externality-unaware wireless schedulers.}

	abstract = {We demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency selective surface filters in wireless communications at low terahertz (THz) frequencies. Full-wave simulations of pass-band filters designed at 270 GHz and 330 GHz are compared with measurements over 220–360 GHz, showing remarkable agreement. The filter spectral response is used to analytically model a THz filter-based wireless channel for modulated signals. In particular, numerical results and measurements for an OOK modulated signal are in good agreement for both free-space and filtered transmission at 14 Gb/s. In both cases, bit error rates (BER) as low as 10-10 are measured. This result demonstrates that the filters marginally affect the BER with respect to free-space, interference-free transmission, whereas interfering signals are strongly rejected. This result is demonstrated through a systematic evaluation of the BER in presence of an interfering signal with different carriers and amplitudes. Results confirm a strong filter rejection to interference carriers close to the filter central frequency. Conversely, without the filters the BER performance is fully compromised. Finally, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that the constellation diagram for 104 Gb/s QAM-16 communication is not significantly affected by the filter. The investigated filters may provide a robust approach towards efficient spectrum management for future 6G wireless applications.}

	abstract = {With innovative applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks in various areas, their demands on broad bandwidth, large capacity and low latency become prominent. The combination of millimeter wave, directional antenna and time division multiple access techniques, which enables concurrent transmissions, is promising to deal with it. In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem in UAV ad hoc networks. Specifically, the slot assignment, antenna boresight and transmit power are jointly optimized to promote the network capacity. First, we formulate the optimization problem as the maximization of the fairness-weighted network capacity, subject to the constraint on priority guarantee. Then, because the formulated problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard, two algorithms called dual-based iterative search algorithm (DISA) and sequential exhausted allocation algorithm (SEAA) are respectively proposed to efficiently solve it with acceptable complexity. DISA slacks the MINLP into a continuous-variable optimization problem and solves it with the Lagrangian dual method in an iterative manner. As a heuristic method, SEAA schedules links sequentially, i.e., from high-priority to low-priority ones. Numerical results demonstrate that both DISA and SEAA can efficiently allocate resources for UAVs, while guaranteeing the fairness and priority of links.}

	abstract = {Automatic modulation classification (AMC) identifies a received signal’s modulation scheme without prior knowledge of the intercepted signal, which enables significant applications in both the military and civilian domains. Inspired by the great success of deep learning (DL), lots of neural networks are introduced into AMC. To further improve classification performance, various complementary cues including in-phase/quadrature (I/Q), amplitude/phase (A/P), constellation, and other formats are used together to enhance the discrimination of the DL model, where only outputs of the last layer are used. In this paper, we find that different layers’ outputs in the DL model are also complementary to each other. As a result, a hierarchical classification head based convolutional gated deep neural network (HCGDNN) is proposed by utilizing different layers’ output, which only uses the I/Q cue. The proposed HCGDNN consists of three groups of convolutional neural networks (CNN) blocks, two groups of bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and a hierarchical classification head. Compared to the long short-term memory (LSTM), the BiGRU has a smaller computational complexity and also releases the gradient dispersion and explosion in the training phase. With the help of the hierarchical classification head, three groups of modulation predictions are made for a received I/Q signal. After that, a novel nonlinear optimization fusion method is derived to generate fusion weights to fuse different groups, then a final classification decision is made. Compared to AMC methods using various cues, the proposed HCGDNN only uses I/Q cue and has low computational overhead. Numerical results suggest that the newly developed HCGDNN achieves superior performance on the public benchmark.To help other researchers, the source code will be uploaded to the github as long as the paper is published.}

	abstract = {Existing works concluded that coherent transmission outperforms non-coherent transmission in the downlink of cell-free systems when the fronthaul links have unlimited capacity. Since the capacity of the fronthaul links of cell-free networks is typically limited, in this paper we ask the question whether this conclusion holds under more realistic assumptions on the fronthaul capacity. To answer this question, we study and compare the performance of these transmission strategies by formulating novel energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems for both strategies, where we explicitly consider realistic fronthaul capacity and power consumption constraints. Despite the non-convexity of these problems, we derive closed-form equations to find suboptimal solutions of both problems using a unified framework that combines successive convex approximation and the Dinkelbach algorithm. Numerical results show that the performance of coherent transmission is severely impacted by limited fronthaul capacities, power consumption on the fronthaul links, user-centric cluster size and the number of antennas at the access points, such that in many cases non-coherent transmission achieves higher EE than coherent transmission. Based on these results, we provide deployment guidelines on when to use coherent or non-coherent transmission to maximize the EE of cell-free systems with limited fronthauls.}

Predicting the SINR with good accuracy ensures proper planning and optimization of radio coverage and good estimation of end-user throughput. In this paper, SINR is predicted at any user location based on UE geo-located measurements, using the Kriging technique and assuming that the received signals from serving and interfering cells undergo shadowing fading. Unlike previous works where only the prediction of the received powers is studied, the current functionality also considers the prediction error on the received signals. We consider both spatial correlation of shadowing signals for each cell and also inter-cell correlation and we propose a new model to generate multiple links shadowing signals for the downlink of cellular networks. For validation, we perform Monte-Carlo network simulations in which the shadowing samples are generated based on the proposed model. Results show a good prediction accuracy of the SINR at a new location resulting in a good estimation of the end-user perceived average data rate.}

An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the WPT time and the placement for the UAV, and the allocation of the UAV’s transmit power between different NOMA user pairs and within each pair. To efficiently solve this nonconvex problem, we decompose the problem into three subproblems using block coordinate descent. For the subproblem of intra-pair power allocation within each NOMA user pair, we construct a supermodular game with confirmed convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Given the intra-pair power allocation, successive convex approximation is applied to convexify and solve the subproblem of WPT time allocation and inter-pair power allocation between the user pairs. Finally, we solve the subproblem of UAV placement by using the Lagrange multiplier method. Simulations show that our approach can substantially outperform its alternatives that do not use NOMA and WPT techniques or that do not optimize the UAV location.}

The proposed system performs blind beam alignment using deep reinforcement learning on a multiple-base station cellular environment with multiple mobile users. We present a novel neural network architecture that can handle a mix of both continuous and discrete actions and use policy gradient methods to train the model.

	abstract = {To provide reliable transmissions with low-latency requirements, we focus on Finite-Blocklength Coding (FBC) in Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). However, ensuring the reliability and latency of FBC has remained an open issue in URLLC. In this paper, we develop a queue-aware FBC scheme under random arrivals. With the awareness of queue length, we employ variable-length coding to jointly encode packets, through which we obtain a benefit on reliability. Meanwhile, we optimize latency under a cross-layer approach, in which two classes of variable-length codes are investigated with resources allocated in the frequency and time domains, respectively. To obtain an optimal reliability-latency tradeoff under variable-length FBC, we first present the reliability and latency performance for single links based on a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Providing reliability with a power allocation, we then obtain the optimal tradeoff by a Linear Programming (LP) problem, in which the probability of violation of the constraints on queue length and the number of transmitted packets is minimized under average constraints on resources. Moreover, we show an optimal threshold-based policy under Bernoulli arrivals. We finally consider some extensions of the optimal tradeoff for multi-user downlinks as well as single links with retransmission.}

	abstract = {mmWave communication requires accurate and continuous beam steering to overcome the severe propagation loss and user mobility. In this paper, we leverage a self-supervised deep learning approach to exploit sub-6 GHz channels and propose a novel method to predict beamforming vectors in the mmWave band for a single access point– user link. This complex channel-beam mapping is learned via data issued from the DeepMIMO dataset. We then compare our proposed method with existing supervised deep learning and classic reinforcement learning methods. Our simulations show that choosing an appropriate beam steering method depends on the target application and is a tradeoff between data rate and computational complexity. We also investigate tuning the size of our neural network depending on the number of transmit and receive antennas at the access point. Finally, we extend our method to the case of multiple links and introduce a federated learning (FL) approach to efficiently predict their mmWave beams by sharing only the weights of the locally trained neural networks (and not the local data). We investigate both synchronous and asynchronous FL methods. Our numerical simulations show the high potential of our approach, especially when the local available data is scarce or imperfect.}

Unlike the existing MMSE design that relies on 1-bit resolution, the proposed approach employs uniform phase quantization and the bounding step in the branch-and-bound method is different in terms of considering the most restrictive relaxation of the nonconvex problem, which is then utilized for a suboptimal design also. We also propose robust MMSE designs where we exploit second order statistics of a channel state information mismatch. Moreover, unlike prior studies, we propose three different soft detection methods and an iterative detection and decoding scheme that allow the utilization of channel coding in conjunction with low-resolution precoding. Besides an exact approach for computing the extrinsic information, we propose two approximations with reduced computational complexity. Numerical simulations show that utilizing the MMSE criterion instead of the established maximum-minimum distance to the decision threshold yields a lower bit-error-rate in many scenarios. Furthermore, when using the MMSE criterion, a smaller number of bound evaluations in the branch-and-bound method is required for low and medium SNR. Finally, results based on an LDPC block code indicate that the proposed receive processing schemes yield a lower bit-error-rate compared to the conventional design.}

The realistic hardware impairment, for instance the non-ideal power amplifier, is taken into account of the system modeling and topology optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply GA in optimizing the hardware-impaired multi-user cell-free mMIMO. Although the demonstrated numerical analysis is for indoor scenario, the proposed approach is transferable for generic scenarios. In GA, the base station (BS) antennas’ placement is encoded with an adjusted binary matrix representation, which is straightforward for the subsequent genetic operations. The explored candidates by GA can evolve beyond the parents, where the fitness of individuals is evaluated dynamically via a ray tracer radio channel simulator. Compared to the traditional GA, our proposed GA can find better solutions with a faster convergence speed. The algorithm provides near-optimal results in experiments, applicable to generic environment with multiple mobile users and different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios.}

Considering potential benefits of beam hopping (BH) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), we exploit the time-domain flexibility in multi-beam satellite systems by optimizing BH design, and enhance the power-domain flexibility via NOMA. In this paper, we investigate the synergy and mutual influence of beam hopping and NOMA. We jointly optimize power allocation, beam scheduling, and terminal-timeslot assignment to minimize the gap between requested traffic demand and offered capacity. In the solution development, we formally prove the NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Next, we develop a bounding scheme to tightly gauge the global optimum and propose a suboptimal algorithm to enable efficient resource assignment. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of combining NOMA and BH, and validate the superiority of the proposed BH-NOMA schemes over benchmarks.}

In the implementation, all variables in each vector can be solved analytically and in parallel; and third, in order to solve the penalty-sharing distributively, we improve the proposed PS-ADMM algorithm to a distributed one, named DPS-ADMM.

	abstract = {In order to fully exploit the advantages of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO), it is critical for the transmitter to accurately acquire the channel state information (CSI). Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed for CSI compression and feedback to the transmitter. Although most existing DL-based methods consider the CSI matrix as an image, structural features of the CSI image are rarely exploited in neural network design. As such, we propose a model of self-information that dynamically measures the amount of information contained in each patch of a CSI image from the perspective of structural features. Then, by applying the self-information model, we propose a model-and-data-driven network for CSI compression and feedback, namely IdasNet. The IdasNet includes the design of a module of self-information deletion and selection (IDAS), an encoder of informative feature compression (IFC), and a decoder of informative feature recovery (IFR). In particular, the model-driven module of IDAS pre-compresses the CSI image by removing informative redundancy in terms of the self-information. The encoder of IFC then conducts feature compression to the pre-compressed CSI image and generates a feature codeword which contains two components, i.e., codeword values and position indices of the codeword values. Subsequently, the IFR decoder decouples the codeword values as well as position indices to recover the CSI image. Experimental results verify that the proposed IdasNet noticeably outperforms existing DL-based networks under various compression ratios while it has the number of network parameters reduced by orders-of-magnitude compared with various existing methods.}

	abstract = {This paper considers an adversarial scenario between a legitimate eavesdropper and a suspicious communication pair. All three nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. The eavesdropper, which operates in a full-duplex model, aims to wiretap the dubious communication pair via proactive jamming. On the other hand, the suspicious transmitter, which can send artificial noise (AN) to disturb the wiretap channel, aims to guarantee secrecy. More specifically, the eavesdropper adjusts jamming power to enhance the wiretap rate, while the suspicious transmitter jointly adapts the transmit power and noise power against the eavesdropping. Considering the partial observation and complicated interactions between the eavesdropper and the suspicious pair in unknown system dynamics, we model the problem as an imperfect-information stochastic game. To approach the Nash equilibrium solution of the eavesdropping game, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, termed neural fictitious self-play with soft actor-critic (NFSP-SAC), by combining the fictitious self-play (FSP) with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, SAC. The introduction of SAC enables FSP to handle the problems with continuous and high dimension observation and action space. The simulation results demonstrate that the power allocation policies learned by our method empirically converge to a Nash equilibrium, while the compared reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from severe fluctuations during the learning process.}

	abstract = {Vector quantization is a viable solution to the problem as to full utilization of randomness provided by statistically dependent channel measurements in secret key extraction from randomly fluctuating channels. By aiming at atmospheric optical wireless channels, new vector quantization schemes based on sample grouping (SG) are proposed by using different ways, specifically, the\nK-dimensional\ntree (KDT) partition and random placement, to separate samples of the dimension-reduced channel coefficient vector into a given number of groups, with each containing equal number of samples. Use of the KDT partition leads to both the basic KDT-partition-based quantization (B-KDTPQ) and improved KDT-partition-based quantization (I-KDTPQ) schemes. On the other hand, utilization of the random placement brings forth the random equisized grouping based quantization (REGQ) scheme. Performance evaluation shows that, due to use of quantization symbol modification, the I-KDTPQ scheme always has lower quantization symbol disagreement rate (QSDR) than the B-KDTPQ scheme; compared with the I-KDTPQ scheme, the REGQ scheme has more flexibility in accommodating itself to various conditions of channel coefficient fluctuations and noise levels.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of beam alignment in a cell-free massive MIMO deployment with multiple access points (APs) and multiple user equipments (UEs) simultaneously operating in the same millimeter wave frequency band. Assuming the availability of a control channel at sub-6 GHz frequencies, a protocol is developed that permits estimating, for each UE, the strongest propagation path from each of the surrounding APs, and to perform user-centric association between the UEs and the APs. Estimation of the strongest paths from nearby APs is realized at the UE in a one-phase procedure, during which all the APs simultaneously transmit on pseudo-randomly selected channels with pseudo-random transmit beamformers. An algorithm for orthogonal channels assignment to the APs is also proposed, with the aim of minimizing the mutual interference between APs that transmit on the same channels. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated both in terms of probability of correct detection of the directions of arrival and of departure associated to the strongest beam from nearby APs, and in terms of downlink and uplink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Numerical results show that the proposed approach is effective and capable of efficiently realizing beam alignment in a multi-UE multi-AP wireless scenario.}

	abstract = {Management of narrow directional beams is critical for mm-wave communication systems. Translational or rotational motion of the user can cause misalignment of transmit and receive beams with the base station losing track of the mobile. Reacquiring the user can take about one second in 5G New Radio systems and significantly impair performance of applications, besides being energy intensive. It is therefore important to manage beams to continually maintain high received signal strength and prevent outages. It is also important to be able to recover from sudden but transient blockage caused by a hand or face interposed in the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path. This work presents a beam management protocol called BeamSurfer that is targeted to the use case of users walking indoors near a base station. It is designed to be minimalistic, employing only in-band information, and not requiring knowledge such as location or orientation of the mobile device or any additional sensors. Evaluations under pedestrian mobility show that 96% of the time it employs beams that are within 3 dB of what an omniscient Oracle would have chosen as the pair of optimal transmit-receive LoS beams. It also recovers from transient LoS blockage by continuing to maintain control packet communication over a pre-selected reflected path that preserves time-synchronization with the base station, which allows it to rapidly recover to the LoS link as soon as it is unblocked.}

	abstract = {Network slicing is a promising technique for wireless service providers to support enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services in a shared radio access network (RAN) infrastructure. In this paper, we apply numerology, mini-slot based transmission, and punctured scheduling techniques to support eMBB and URLLC network slices. For efficient allocation of radio resources (e.g., physical resource blocks, transmit power) to the users, we formulate RAN slicing problem as a multi-timescale problem. To solve this problem and address the dynamics of the traffic, we propose a hierarchical deep learning framework. Specifically, in each long time slot, the service provider employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to determine the slice configuration parameters. The eMBB and URLLC schedulers use their own attention-based deep neural network (DNN) algorithm to allocate radio resources to their corresponding users in each short and mini time slot, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can achieve a higher aggregate throughput and a higher service level agreement (SLA) satisfaction ratio compared to some other RAN slicing approaches, including the resource proportional placement algorithm, decomposition and relaxation based resource allocation algorithm, and distributed bandwidth optimization algorithm.}

	abstract = {We formulate and investigate the problem of distributed channel rendezvous in collision-prone wireless networks. Existing researches on this topic are mainly devoted to designing channel hopping sequences, each pair of which can overlap on a common channel within bounded delay. However, this overlap-based canonical rendezvous design does not take into account channel collision, which may render existing rendezvous algorithms fail to achieve bounded delay in collision-prone environment. Motivated by this observation, we formulate and investigate the collision-aware channel rendezvous problem in a generic scenario, where a collision occurs if more than\nC\npackets overlap in time on a same channel. Our generic formulation allows to model both the baseline single packet reception model with\nC=1\nand the more sophisticated multiple packet reception model with\nC>1\n. We further abstract the collision-aware rendezvous problem as the problem of constructing a robust rendezvous system. We establish the theoretical limit of the problem, guided by which we design a collision-resilient distributed rendezvous algorithm with truly bounded rendezvous delay. We then demonstrate the performance of our rendezvous algorithm both analytically and numerically.}

We investigate the design of precoders and combiners for an FD millimeter wave point-to-point bidirectional link, where dense antenna arrays provide an opportunity for SI suppression via beamforming cancellation. In practice the precoders and combiners are usually implemented in a hybrid digital/analog fashion with a reduced number of radio frequency (RF) chains, and it becomes necessary to overcome a number of limitations imposed by this structure. We focus on a hybrid architecture with a phase shifter-based fully-connected analog stage, assuming finite-resolution phase shifters. To avoid analog-to-digital converter saturation at the receiver, the proposed design aims at cancelling SI at the analog combiner output. Although accurate SI suppression is difficult with low-resolution phase shifters, our design is able to provide reasonable performance, significantly improving upon previous approaches, and allowing to efficiently exploit the availability of RF chains to partially compensate for coarse phase quantization effects.}

A joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the system transmit power. The formulated optimization problem is prohibitively complicated, especially when the number of users is large. Alternatively, a two-step user clustering and power control algorithm is proposed. First, a K-means-based algorithm is proposed for user clustering, where both channel gain and channel correlation among users are taken into account for the distance measurement to reduce the intra- and inter-cluster interference. Then, a semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS) algorithm is designed, with which the optimal cluster number and cluster centers can be dynamically obtained. Further, the closed-form expression of the optimal intra-cluster power control is derived, and the resulting inter-cluster power control problem is solved by designing an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed K-means-based iterative power control scheme outperforms other reference methods, and can approach the optimal performance in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency at a much lower computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Edge intelligence, a new paradigm to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) applications by leveraging computing resources on the network edge, can be used to improve intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to physical limitations and energy-supply constraints, the computing powers of edge equipment are usually limited. High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can be considered to be a promising extension of edge computing. HAPS is deployed in the stratosphere to provide wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. It is suitable to coordinate terrestrial resources and store the fundamental data associated with ITS-based applications. In this work, three computing layers, i.e., vehicles, terrestrial network edges, and HAPS, are integrated to build a computation framework for ITS, where the HAPS data library stores the fundamental data needed for the applications. In addition, the caching technique is introduced for network edges to store some of the fundamental data from the HAPS so that large transmission delays can be reduced. We aim to minimize the delay of the system by optimizing computation offloading and caching decisions as well as bandwidth and computing resource allocations. The simulation results highlight the benefits of HAPS computing for mitigating delays and the significance of caching at network edges.}

The randomization in the waveform, which is achieved by using permutations of the sequence of frequency tones, is utilized for data transmission. A new signaling scheme is proposed in which the mapping between incoming data and waveforms is performed based on an efficient combinatorial transform called the Lehmer code. Considering the optimum maximum likelihood detection, the union bound and the nearest neighbour approximation on the communication block error probability is derived for communication in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The results are further extended to incorporate the Rician fading channel model, of which the Rayleigh fading channel is presented as a special case. Furthermore, an efficient communication receiver implementation is discussed based on the Hungarian algorithm which achieves optimum performance with much less operational complexity when compared to an exhaustive search. From the radar perspective, two key analytical tools, namely, the ambiguity function and the Fisher information matrix are derived. Furthermore, accurate approximations to the Cramer-Rao lower bounds on the delay and Doppler estimation errors are derived based on which the range and velocity estimation accuracy of the waveform is analysed.}

	abstract = {Distributed machine learning has been extensively employed in wireless systems, which can leverage abundant data distributed over massive devices to collaboratively train a high-quality global model. The research efforts of recent works have focused on improving performance (e.g., communication efficiency, energy efficiency, and scalability) of centralized architectures, which include a number of distributed devices and a server. However, centralized architectures may cause congestion at the central node, which is not applicable under some circumstances. To tackle this issue, we introduce a decentralized edge learning framework over wireless networks via unreliable device-to-device (D2D) links and improve its learning performance. The unreliable transmission caused by the channel uncertainty has a negative effect on model convergence. To enhance the performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the overall model deviation under a given latency requirement by jointly optimizing the broadcast data rate and bandwidth allocation. Then, the optimal solution of broadcast data rate is derived and an algorithm for obtaining the optimal bandwidth allocation is developed. Besides, we also propose a decentralized edge learning protocol without a central server and provide the convergence analysis. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposed algorithm compared against the baseline algorithm.}

Resonant beams generated by spatially separated laser resonators (SSLR) have many advantages, including high power, self-aligned mobility, and intrinsic safety. It has been proposed as the carrier of wireless charging and communication. Using resonant beams, mobile electronic devices can be remotely charged and supported with high-rate data transfer. In this paper, we propose a mobile optical SWIPT system based on asymmetric SSLR and present the system optimization procedure. We also determine the boundary of the charging power and communication rate, and discuss the trade-off between power transfer and information transfer. Numerical results show that both the charging power and the communication rate of the optimized asymmetric system are much higher than those of the symmetric system in the previous work.}

	abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) represents an efficient low power solution for the Internet of Things. Specifically, LoRa defines a physical layer technology, while access control and network issues are handled by the LoRaWAN protocol. Channel access is essentially unslotted ALOHA, so LoRaWAN performance suffer from packet collision events. Such problem becomes more penalizing in dense network scenarios, where the large number of devices simultaneously connected makes the collision probability significantly grow. The largest part of solutions proposed to overcome LoRaWAN inefficiency is oriented to collision avoidance. Differently, we firstly present an algorithm for mitigating the interference among superposing LoRa signals, allowing collided packets to be detected anyway. Then, we propose a novel combining mechanism, implemented at the LoRaWAN network server, that exploits the information carried by the same packet, but received by different gateways, to achieve a more robust decoding. Hence, packet detection is reliably performed even in the presence of interference, thus reducing the need of retransmission and providing energy saving for end devices. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed solutions allow the end users to transmit exploiting low spreading factors, thus reducing the channel use that will be fundamental when dealing with larger scale network scenarios.}

	abstract = {We introduce a phase hopping scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in which the phases of the individual RIS elements are randomly varied with each transmitted symbol. This effectively converts slow fading into fast fading. We show how this can be leveraged to significantly improve the outage performance especially for small outage probabilities without channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and RIS. Furthermore, the same result can be accomplished even if only two possible phase values are available. Since we do not require perfect CSI at the transmitter or RIS, the proposed scheme has no additional communication overhead for adjusting the phases. This enables robust ultra-reliable communications with a reduced effort for channel estimation.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising mean to enhance wireless transmission. The effective reflected paths provided by RIS are able to alleviate the susceptibility to blockage effects, especially in high-frequency band communications, where signals experience severe path loss and high directivity. This paper is concerned with an RIS-assisted system over the millimeter wave (mmWave) channel characterized by sparse propagation paths. A base station tries to connect with the desired user through an RIS, while the undesired user can also receive the signal transmitted from BS unavoidably, which is treated as the interference signal. All terminals are assumed to be equipped with a single antenna for the sake of simplicity. The paper aims to propose an appropriate design of the phase shifts of each element at the RIS so as to maximize the received signal power transmitted from the base station (BS) at the desired user, while nulling the received interference signal power at the undesired user. The proposed reflecting design relies on the decomposition of the reflecting beamforming vectors and all channel path vectors into Kronecker product of factors being uni-modulus vectors. By exploiting characteristics of Kronecker mixed products, different factors of the reflecting are designed for either nulling the interference signal at the undesired user, or coherently combining data paths at the desired user. Furthermore, a channel estimation strategy is proposed to enable the proposed reflecting beamforming design. The magnitude, azimuth, and elevation arrival and departure angles of desired and undesired paths are estimated by an efficient 2-dimension (2-D) line spectrum optimization technique based on the atomic norm minimization (ANM) framework. The performance of the reflecting designs and channel estimation scheme is analyzed and demonstrated by simulation results.}

Index modulation is motivated by reducing the transmitter hardware complexity and has attracted significant research attention in the past decade. In practice, knowing the spectral efficiency or capacity is essential for setting the parameters of modulation and coding for index modulation, but approximations and bounds thus far have not been accurate enough for that purpose. We calculate close lower and upper bounds for the spectral efficiency of index modulation. Our lower and upper bounds meet at high-SNR when the number of receive antennas is greater than or equal to the number of transmit antennas, thus the high-SNR capacity of index modulation in these cases has been fully characterized. A catalog of results is provided for spatial modulation, generalized spatial modulation, time and frequency index modulation. Extensive simulations illustrate the usefulness and accuracy of our results. For example, for spatial modulation with\n4×2\nantennas at 8 bits/s/Hz, our results are 2dB tighter than the best available bounds in the literature.}

	abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence together with the powerful computation capabilities of the advanced edge servers make it possible to deploy learning tasks at the wireless network edge, which is dubbed as edge intelligence (EI). The communication bottleneck between the data resource and the server results in deteriorated learning performance as well as tremendous energy consumption. To tackle this challenge, we explore a new paradigm called learning-and-energy-efficient (LEE) EI, which simultaneously maximizes the learning accuracies and energy efficiencies of multiple tasks via data partition and rate control. Mathematically, this results in a multi-objective optimization problem. Moreover, the continuously varying communication rates introduce infinite variables, which further complicates the problem. To solve this complex problem, we consider the case with infinite server buffer capacity and one-shot data arrival at sensor. First, the number of variables is reduced to a finite level by exploiting the optimality of constant-rate transmission in each epoch. Second, the optimal solution of the multi-objective problem is found by applying the stratified sequencing or merging of objectives. By assuming higher priority of learning efficiency in stratified sequencing, the optimal data partition is derived in closed form by the Lagrange method, while the optimal rate control is proved to have the structure of directional water filling (DWF), based on which a string-pulling (SP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the numerical values. The DWF structure of rate control is also proved to be optimal in merging of objectives, which combines different objectives in a weighted manner. By exploiting the optimal rate changing properties, the SP algorithm is further extended to tackle the more challenging cases with limited server buffer capacity or bursty data arrival at sensor. The performance of the proposed joint data partition and rate control design is examined by extensive experiments based on public datasets.}

Based on the theory of Poisson-Delaunay triangulation, the probability density functions (PDF) of the Euclidean distance between the access points of the Poisson-Delaunay triangular cell and typical devices are derived. By using the theory of stochastic geometry and the obtained PDFs, the closed-form expressions of the wireless power coverage probability are obtained for three typical locations of the devices. As the wireless power coverage probability expressions involve the extended generalized multivariate MeijerG function (EGMMGF), a new implementation enabling numerical calculation of the EGMMGF is also proposed. The impacts of the main network parameters on the performance of the proposed framework are analyzed. In particular, comparative results show the significant gains that can be achieved in the wireless power coverage when multiple access points participate in the wireless power transfer or when the density of the network’s access points is increased, as compared to the non-cooperative scheme.}

In this scenario, a two-tier task scheduling scheme and an uplink and downlink power allocation factor are jointly optimized to reduce the data processing delay and improve fairness among different users, which is in nature a hard problem due to a series of non-convex constraints. To make the problem tractable, the problem is transformed into a smooth non-convex problem with the introduction of auxiliary variables and then decoupled into two subproblems based on the data transmission and processing procedure. Thereafter, different methods such as Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Block Successive Upperbound Minimization (BSUM) are employed to reconstruct several upper-bound convex optimization subproblems. Besides, a fast 0–1 binary offloading scheme is proposed based on the original algorithm. Finally, the simulation results depict the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detail, and the scalability of the system is also examined.}

The proposed successive null-space (SNS) precoding utilizes linear combinations of the null-space basis vectors of the successively augmented MIMO channel matrices of the users as precoding vectors to adjust the inter-user-interference experienced by the receivers. We formulate a non-convex weighted sum rate optimization problem for the precoding vectors and the associated power allocation for the proposed SNS-based MIMO-rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme. We obtain a suboptimal solution for this problem via successive convex approximation. Moreover, we study the robustness of the proposed precoding scheme to imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station via derivative-based sensitivity analysis.

In this paper, we propose a monocular resonant beam-based ICP (RB-ICP) design for simultaneously realizing high-rate data transfer and high-accuracy localization while keeping the features as intrinsic safety. Utilizing the high-efficiency transmission channel of resonant beam system and the frequency-doubled beam design, we introduce the communication model without the echo interference issue. Then, we propose a distance estimation model using the phase-shift method with frequency-quadrupled beam design. Next, the angle of arrival estimation can be conducted relying on the energy-concentrated and self-alignment features of resonant beam. The simulation methods including centroid algorithm and signal conversion simulation in a photosensor along with the noise analysis are presented. In numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the positioning error can be less than 1cm and the achievable spectral efficiency can reach 16bit/s/Hz over 2m distance in 15° field of view (FoV). This proposed system enables simultaneous high-rate data transfer and high-accuracy receiver positioning for the applications such as augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR).}

We aim to maximize the achievable spectral efficiency by separately designing the passive beamforming and active precoding (combining) through a decoupling strategy to reduce computational complexity. We propose two algorithms for passive beamforming design, which are followed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective channel matrix to generate the active precoding and combining matrices at the bases station (BS) and user equipment (UE), respectively. The first algorithm employs the SVD of the BS-IRS and the IRS-UE channel matrices to generate the unitary matrices. These matrices are used to develop the optimization problem, which is solved via a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)-based algorithm, yielding a passive beamforming vector. In the second algorithm, we propose a greedy-search (GS)-based method to select the array response vectors and their corresponding path gains of the mmWave channels between the BS (IRS) and IRS (UE) required to formulate the optimization problem, which is also solved via the RCG-based algorithm, resulting in a passive beamforming vector.

	abstract = {Wireless communications are increasingly vulnerable to simultaneous jamming and eavesdropping attacks due to the inherent broadcast nature of wireless channels. With this focus, due to the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in substantially saving power consumption and boosting information security, this paper is the first work to investigate the effect of the RIS-assisted wireless transmitter in improving both the spectrum efficiency and the security of multi-user cellular network. Specifically, with the imperfect angular channel state information (CSI), we aim to address the worst-case sum rate maximization problem by jointly designing the receive decoder at the users, both the digital precoder and the artificial noise (AN) at the base station (BS), and the analog precoder at the RIS, while meeting the minimum achievable rate constraint, the maximum wiretap rate requirement, and the maximum power constraint. To address the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we first propose an alternative optimization (AO) method to obtain an efficient solution. In particular, a heuristic scheme is proposed to convert the imperfect angular CSI into a robust one and facilitate the developing a closed-form solution to the receive decoder. Then, after reformulating the original problem into a tractable one by exploiting the majorization-minimization (MM) method, the digital precoder and AN can be addressed by the quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), and the RIS-aided analog precoder is solved by the proposed price mechanism-based Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO). To further reduce the computational complexity of the proposed AO method and gain more insights, we develop a low-complexity monotonic optimization algorithm combined with the dual method (MO-dual) to identify the closed-form solution. Numerical simulations using realistic RIS and communication models demonstrate the superiority and validity of our proposed schemes over the existing benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Recently, the intelligent omni-surface (IOS) has been proposed as a novel instance of metasurface to achieve full-dimensional communications by jointly engineering its reflective and refractive properties. However, optimal beamforming scheme for the IOS is hard to obtain due to the difficulty in acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI). To address this issue, in this paper, we consider an IOS aided system where the beamforming scheme is designed via beam training with codebooks at the base station (BS), the IOS, and users. Given that the refractive/reflective signals are closely related to both incident signals from the BS and phase shifts of IOS elements, the codebooks at the BS and the IOS are designed jointly. Based on the joint BS-IOS codebook, a multi-lobe beam training mechanism is proposed to perform beam training for multiple users simultaneously, thereby reducing the training overhead. The training/feedback overhead of the proposed beam training and the impact of the codebook size are then analyzed theoretically. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum rate than the state-of-the-art beam training schemes and performs close to the perfect CSI case.}

	abstract = {This paper considers channel-unaware two-way relay networks (TWRNs) with a single-antenna decode-and-forward (DF) relay. These networks typically rely on differential signalling which results in error propagation and error floors. To overcome this drawback, we develop a novel differential signalling scheme, which, in contrast with existing ones, does not cause detection errors to propagate from one block to the next. We obtain a union bound on the block error rate (BLER), which shows that the proposed differential method exhibits superior performance to existing schemes, eliminates error floors and results in a BLER that decays as the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the proposed scheme removes the unitarity restriction on the transmitted symbols in conventional differential signalling. Therefore, non-unitary symbols can be used in the differential signalling which provides more degrees of design freedom and better performance. Our numerical results confirm our analytical findings.}

	abstract = {In this work, we study a downlink multi-user network, where a single access point (AP) is supposed to accomplish data transmissions to all users under low latency constraints. To more effectively cope with the multiple access demand, we consider a hybrid strategy for the multi-user downlink service in finite blocklength (FBL) regime, which combines broadcasting with time-division multiple access (TDMA). In the hybrid strategy, the users are first clustered into different groups. Different groups are served in a TDMA manner with dedicated time slots, while users within each group are served together via a broadcasting signal from the AP. By taking into account the fairness of transmission reliability among all users, we formulate a problem minimizing the maximum error probability among users via jointly determining the user grouping and allocating blocklength among all groups. To address the complicated non-convex problem, we first characterize the optimal blocklength allocation under each given grouping decision, which leads to an optimal closed-form allocation solution via solving an equation system. Based on the characterized features, we are enabled to efficiently distill out the optimal grouping from all possible groupings, which forms the efficient optimal solution for the optimal joint design. Afterwards, aiming at a complexity reduction, we further propose a low-complexity iterative solution, in which the grouping is iteratively improved via the introduced operations until a convergence to a suboptimum. Finally, via simulations, we validate the proposed solutions and reveal the close optimality of the iterative solution. In addition, the hybrid strategy has shown a significant reliability advantage in comparison to pure broadcasting or TDMA, and this performance advantage becomes further enlarged in case of more users.}

	abstract = {By combining information communication technology with power grid, the smart grid-oriented Power Internet of Things (PIoT) has become a critical technology to guarantee the safe and reliable power grid operation and improve system energy efficiency. Nevertheless, PIoT devices have only limited communication and computing resources since they are mostly deployed in remote areas that may be out of service coverage of existing terrestrial 5G networks. To overcome the resource limitation, we leverage Air-Ground Integrated C-NOMA Heterogeneous PIoT Networks (PAGIC HetNets), and study the core challenges in PAGIC HetNets. As PIoT devices are normally powered by battery, we aim at minimizing the energy consumption of PIoT devices and thoroughly investigate the problem of task offloading and resource allocation with minimal energy consumption. This problem belongs to a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) with extra difficulty that the long-term queuing delay and short-term constraints are coupled. To tackle the difficulty, we use Lyapunov optimization to transform this hard problem into three subproblems. The first subproblem is task splitting and local computing resource assignment at the PAGIC user side, which we solve with the Lagrangian multiplier method. The second subproblem is queue-aware channel reusing, and matching theory is adopted to solve it. The third subproblem is optimizing the aerial server resource allocation, for which we propose a greedy-based solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach can obtain excellent performance in terms of energy consumption, spectrum efficiency, task backlog, and queuing delay with lower complexity compared with several benchmark methods.}

In particular, we design a new space-time block code (STBC)-based scalable QSM scheme combining high SE with maximum diversity and optimum coding gains. Deriving a closed-form expression for the optimum SE, we show that scaling the size\nT\nwith\nn\nT\nnot only is required to achieve SE optimality, but also results in further gains in bit error rate (BER) performance. Building on the latter optimal parameterization, a fully optimized scalable QSM (OS-QSM) transmitter design is then obtained by introducing a new dispersion matrix index selection algorithm that ensures even utilization of spatial-temporal resources. Finally, a new greedy boxed iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (GB-ISTA) QSM receiver is proposed, which exploits the inherent sparsity of QSM signals and while detecting spatially and digitally modulated bits in a greedy fashion. The resulting low complexity of the new receiver, which is linear on\nn\nT\n, enables the utilization of OS-QSM in systems of previously prohibitive dimensions.}

	abstract = {Network function virtualization is a key enabling technology in future wireless networks for flexible and efficient sharing of network resources. Due to the increasing heterogeneity of network resource providers, a blockchain-based distributed architecture is a promising solution to enable reliable and transparent virtualized network function (VNF) management. However, since on-chain storage and computation are costive, it becomes a challenging task to achieve efficient VNF management with blockchain. In this paper, we first introduce a consortium blockchain for collaborative VNF management among network resource providers. Then, we propose an authenticated VNF dictionary that can be stored as a succinct authenticator on blockchain to support rich VNF query functionalities and efficient verifications of query results. Moreover, we design a dictionary pruning strategy to securely generate a compact authenticator for a given query, which reduces unnecessary memory accesses of the original dictionary when VNF queries are represented as arithmetic circuits. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with a consortium blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate that our pruning strategy is efficient for both on-chain and off-chain VNF management.}

One effective solution is to switch wireless devices into sleep mode to save power. This paper considers the power control in an IoT network via jointly activating IoT sensors and designing their transmit beamforming. Besides, inspired by the great potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in energy saving, we additionally introduce RIS to further lower the sensors’ power consumption. The considered problem is highly challenging due to its combinatorial nature, the highly non-convex quality-of-service (QoS) constraint and the hardware restrictions from the RIS. By exploiting the cutting-the-edge majorization minimization (MM) and the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) frameworks, we have successfully developed highly efficient solutions to tackle this problem. Our proposed solutions can achieve nearly identical performance with that of the exhaustive search but with a much lower complexity. Besides, as revealed by the numerical experiments, our proposed sensor activation scheme can switch off a large portion of sensors under mild QoS requirements, which significantly reduces power expenditure. Moreover, the deployment of RIS can bring an additional 45% – 70% power saving compared to the no-RIS case.}

By combining array and spatial signal-processing techniques, highly directional beams can be formed with high beamforming gain to achieve sufficient link budget. In this way, fine selection of codewords for analog beamforming is essential to ensure the uplink rate, which may increase the latency of establishing a reliable communication link, especially for mobile millimeter-wave communication systems. In order to guarantee the reliability of communication, adaptive data-driven beam tracking is proposed to find the suitable beamformer/combiner pair to achieve the given signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios constraint. Unlike the model-based approach, the proposed approach is dependent only on the real-time measurement data based on a dynamic linearization representation of a time-varying pseudo-gradient parameter estimation procedure. Numerical analyses show that the proposed beam tracking algorithm can achieve good tracking performance with lower training overhead compared with traditional schemes.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed learning paradigm, in which a global model at a server learns private data of clients without data shared among clients or the server. In this paper, we consider FL over a noisy fading multiple access channel (MAC) via over-the-air computation (AirComp). Benefiting from waveform-superposition propriety of wireless signals, AirComp is able to achieve fast aggregations in FL and improve spectral efficiency. However, most of the schemes exploiting AirComp require intensive channel estimations as the demands from precoders, which results in considerable communication overheads. For this reason, we propose two novel FL schemes with statistical channel state information (FL-SCSI-A and FL-SCSI-B) to reduce the efforts required by channel estimations. In FL-SCSI-A, precoders adjust phases of transmitted signals with phases of instant channel state information (CSI), and scale transmitted signal powers based on statistical CSI. The precoder design has the following two advantages. First, phases of instant CSI can be easier to estimate than complete instant CSI. Second, since clients only need to estimate phases of their own instant CSI (instead of CSI of all clients), with channel reciprocity, this can be easily achieved by letting the server broadcast pilots to all clients. The server in FL-SCSI-A is also efficient. It only needs to estimate the sum of channel gains of all clients, which can be easily achieved by letting clients transmit pilots simultaneously. To further reduce the communication overhead, FL-SCSI-B is proposed. The precoders in FL-SCSI-B are similar to FL-SCSI-A, while the server does not require any knowledge of instant CSI, which reduces the demands of channel estimations. For both schemes, we prove that the distortion caused by the noisy fading MAC is bounded, and the convergences of the learning processes are guaranteed for strongly smooth losses with heterogeneous data assumptions. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes perform better than benchmark schemes while reducing efforts required by channel estimation.}

The problem of jointly optimizing user association, muting and power-bandwidth allocation is formulated for NOMA-enabled C-RANs. To solve the mixed integer programming problem, the joint problem is decomposed into two subproblems as 1) user association and muting 2) power-bandwidth allocation optimization. To deal with the first subproblem, we propose a centralized and heuristic algorithm to obtain a feasible solution to the remote radio head (RRH) muting problem for given bandwidth and transmit power. The second subproblem is then reformulated for tractibility purpose and a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to bandwidth and power allocation subject to users data rate constraints. Moreover, for given user association and muting states, the near optimal power allocation is derived in a closed-form expression. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-enabled C-RAN outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based C-RANs in terms of total achievable rate, interference mitigation and can achieve significant fairness improvement.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) based reflection modulation (RM) has been considered as a promising information delivery mechanism, and has the potential to realize passive information transfer of a RIS without consuming any additional radio frequency chain and time/frequency/energy resource. The existing on-off RM (ORM) schemes are based on manipulating the “on/off” states of RIS reflection elements, which may lead to the degradation of RIS reflection efficiency. This paper proposes a frequency RM (FRM) method for RIS-aided OFDM systems. The FRM-OFDM scheme modulates the frequency of the incident electromagnetic waves, and the RIS information is embedded in the frequency-hopping states of RIS elements. Unlike the ORM-OFDM scheme, the FRM-OFDM scheme can achieve higher reflection efficiency, since the latter does not turn off any reflection element in RM. We show that, for the RIS phase shift optimization, the multiplicative multiple access channel in the FRM-OFDM system can be converted to an equivalent RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output channel. Then, we propose an alternating optimization AO) algorithm for sum rate maximization of the FRM-OFDM system. A low-complexity recursive AO algorithm is further developed to avoid direct channel matrix inversion in the AO algorithm with negligible performance degradation. In addition, we design a bilinear message passing (BMP) algorithm for the bilinear recovery of both the user symbols and the RIS data. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of the designed optimization algorithms for system optimization and the BMP algorithm for signal detection, as well as the superiority of the proposed FRM-OFDM scheme over the existing ORM-OFDM scheme and the RIS-aided OFDM system.}

However, accurately characterizing the underwater optical channel for various underwater conditions is still a challenging task due to light absorption and scattering, which may limit further research on UWOC. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework of the underwater optical channel impulse response (CIR) generator, named the UCIRG framework, based on the generative adversarial network. Unlike the classical Monte Carlo approach, which is a numerical simulation method taking a long time to calculate, the UCIRG framework can generate a large number of CIRs extremely close to the actual underwater optical CIRs in a short time based on limited underwater optical CIRs as training data. Besides, traditional approximation methods for underwater optical channels usually have limitations on underwater conditions, lacking generality and flexibility, hence a generalized algorithm for UCIRG is also investigated, which is valid for various underwater conditions and can further reduce training time. Moreover, the multi-carrier autoencoder based UWOC system is adopted to evaluate the performance of the trained UCIRG, and the simulation results prove that the CIRs generated by the UCIRG are extremely similar to the actual CIRs.}

The new formulations are based on the fact that the FTR fading distribution can be described, for arbitrary\nm\n, as an underlying Rician Shadowed (RS) distribution with continuously varying parameter\nK\nr\n(ratio of specular to diffuse power components), while for the special case of\nm\nbeing an integer, it is demonstrated that the FTR fading model can be described in terms of a finite number of underlying squared Nakagami-\nm\ndistributions. It is shown that any performance metric that is computed by averaging over the probability density function (PDF) of the FTR fading model can be expressed in terms of a finite-range integral over the corresponding performance metric for the simpler RS (for arbitrary\nm\n) or Nakagami-\nm\n(for integer\nm\n) fading models, for which many results are available in closed-form. New expressions for some Laplace-domain statistics of interest are also obtained; these are used to analyze the outage probability of FTR fading under co-channel interference, as well as to obtain closed-form expressions for the main statistics of a composite wireless channel model encompassing FTR fading and shadowing.}

The proposed generative model has a two-stage structure that first predicts the link state (line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight, or outage), and subsequently feeds this state into a conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) that generates the path losses, delays, and angles of arrival and departure for all the propagation paths. The methodology is demonstrated for\n28 GHz\nair-to-ground channels between UAVs and a cellular system in representative urban environments, with training datasets produced through ray tracing. The demonstration extends to both standard base stations (installed at street level and downtilted) as well as dedicated base stations (mounted on rooftops and uptilted). The proposed approach is able to capture complex statistical relations in the data and it significantly outperforms standard 3GPP models, even after refitting the parameters of those models to the data.}

	abstract = {It is witnessed that blockchain technology has been widely studied in Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to its decentralized tamper-resistance. Meanwhile, satellite-based IoT (S-IoT) becomes popular and has been regarded as a potential solution of the scalability due to its ubiquitous coverage inherited from satellites. Nevertheless, the large-scale blockchain network enabled S-IoT (BNS-IoT) would be limited by timely performing consensus. In this paper, we propose an age-critical blockchain sharding (ABS) scheme with the metric of information timeliness, i.e., age of information (AoI) to realize timely consensus in BNS-IoT. Specifically, we propose a forking-waiting-retransmission (FR) mechanism for the ABS scheme to deal with forking events, and realize a secure consensus. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions of average AoI (AAoI), throughput and security performance of the FR mechanism in ABS scheme, respectively, and compare with the\nn\n-block confirmation and select the longest-chain (\nn\n-LC) mechanism. Simulation results show that our ABS scheme can realize the linear expansion of throughput with the increasing number of shards, and our FR mechanism can greatly improve the security by sacrificing minor AAoI compared with the\nn\n-LC mechanism. Furthermore, our ABS scheme can outperform the conventional random sharding (RS) scheme in terms of AAoI and throughout.}

We first utilize binomial point processes (BPPs) to model the locations of UAVs in a finite area as a single-swarm UAV network and allow for arbitrary user locations. Then, we define multi-BPPs and extend our model to multi-swarm UAV networks. We consider an open-access strategy, where users access the closest UAV in all swarms, and derive the distance distributions of serving and interfering UAVs. Moreover, a three-dimensional (3D) blockage model and a 3D sectorized antenna model are introduced to completely depict the characteristics of air-to-ground channel in mmWave band. Based on the distance distributions and the Laplace transform of interference, coverage probabilities in considered networks are derived. Our results reveal that, there exists optimal height and density of UAV swarms that maximize the coverage probability. When densely deployed, the interference from inter-swarm cannot be negligible in the multi-swarm UAV network.}

	abstract = {Although signal distortion-based peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction is a feasible candidate for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to meet standard/regulatory requirements, the error vector magnitude (EVM) stemming from the PAPR reduction has a deleterious impact on the performance of high data-rate achieving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Moreover, these systems must constrain the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) to comply with regulatory requirements. Several recent works have investigated the mitigation of the EVM seen at the receivers by capitalizing on the excess spatial dimensions inherent in the large-scale MIMO that assume the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) with spatially uncorrelated wireless channels. Unfortunately, practical systems operate with erroneous CSI and spatially correlated channels. Additionally, most standards support user-specific/CSI-aware beamformed and cell-specific/non-CSI-aware broadcasting channels. Hence, we formulate a robust EVM mitigation problem under channel uncertainty with nonconvex PAPR and ACLR constraints catering to beamforming/broadcasting. To solve this formidable problem, we develop an efficient scheme using our recently proposed three-operator alternating direction method of multipliers (TOP-ADMM) algorithm and benchmark it against two three-operator algorithms previously presented for machine learning purposes. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm under imperfect CSI and spatially correlated channels.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive MIMO systems have promising data rate and coverage gains. These systems, however, typically rely on fiber based fronthaul for the communication between the central processing unit and the distributed access points (APs), which increases the infrastructure cost and installation complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two architectures for cell-free massive MIMO systems based on wireless fronthaul that is operating at a higher-band compared to the access links. These dual-band architectures ensure high data rate fronthaul while reducing the infrastructure cost and enhancing the deployment flexibility and adaptability. To investigate the achievable data rates with the proposed architectures, we formulate the end-to-end data rate optimization problem accounting for the various practical aspects of the fronthaul and access links. Then, we develop a low-complexity yet efficient joint beamforming and resource allocation solution for the proposed architectures based on user-centric AP grouping. With this solution, we show that the proposed architectures can achieve comparable data rates to those obtained with optical fiber-based fronthaul under realistic assumptions on the fronthaul bandwidth, hardware constraints, and deployment scenarios. This highlights a promising path for realizing the cell-free massive MIMO gains in practice while reducing the infrastructure and deployment overhead.}

The wireless full-duplex (FD) technique focuses on improving the spectrum efficiency and raising the system throughput. In this paper, the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links are deployed in an FD cellular network. However, the resource allocation and power control become challenging, due to the excess self-interference (SI) at the FD base station (BS) and the interference from the V2I uplink to downlink sharing the same resource block (RB). A Dual Graph Coloring-based Interference Management (DGCIM) scheme is proposed to solve the tricky problem. The DGCIM scheme includes a GrouPing Graph Coloring with Recursive Largest First (GPGC-RLF) algorithm and a GreedY Graph Coloring (GYGC) algorithm. The simulation results illustrate the guarantee of the stringent reliability and latency constraint for V2V links. The Jain’s index of the V2I link, nearly two times that of a half-duplex (HD) scheme, further verifies the validity of the DGCIM scheme.}

	abstract = {Medium access control (MAC) plays a crucial role in ensuring proper operation in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, existing solutions cannot meet the strict requirements of high throughput and low latency in high-density scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol to meet such demands for VANETs. The roadside unit (RSU) pattern and the dual-transceiver manner are adopted to assign channel resources for all packets. The striking features of our approach are twofold: the time slot allocation based on global vehicle information and the consideration of different delay requirements of different applications. First, we design a time slot exchange mechanism, which avoids any transmission conflict between two adjacent RSUs, to reduce channel resource waste. Then, we design a packet weight allocation mechanism, by which the packets of any network edge area are assigned higher priorities to further reduce channel resource waste. Moreover, we devise a packet quality evaluation mechanism, by which our multi-objective problem is transformed into a single-objective problem. In addition, we devise a greedy branch-and-bound algorithm to address the multiple-knapsack problem, which is transformed into a single-knapsack problem. Extensive simulation results show the advantages of our approach in terms of throughput and latency.}

	abstract = {Impairments baseband model in-phase and quadrature-phase Imbalance (IQI) and Residual hardware impairments (RHI) are two key factors degrading the performance of wireless communication systems (WCSs), particularly when high-frequency bands are employed, as in 5G systems and beyond. The impact of either IQI or RHI on the performance of various WCSs has been investigated exclusively in a separate way. To fill this gap, in this paper, the joint effect of both IQI and RHI on the performance of a WCS subject to Hyper Fox’s H-fading (HFHF) channel, is investigated. Such a fading model generalizes most, if not all, of well-known fading and turbulence models. To this end, closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP), Average channel capacity (ACC) under constant power with optimum rate adaptation (ORA) policy, and average symbol error probability (ASEP) for both coherent and non-coherent modulation schemes are derived. Specifically, all the analytical expressions are derived for three different scenarios: (i) ideal Tx and Rx impaired, (ii) Tx impaired and ideal Rx, and (iii) both Tx and Rx are impaired. Further, asymptotic expressions for OP, ACC under ORA policy, and ASEP are obtained, based on which, insightful discussions on the IQI and RHI impacts are made. \\alpha -\\mu\nand Málaga \\mathcal {M}\nturbulence with pointing error distribution models have been considered as particular cases of the HFHF distribution. The analytical derivations, endorsed by simulation results, demonstrate that the RF impairments’ effects should be seriously taken into account in the design of next-generation wireless technologies.}

Channel estimation is a critical task when it comes to the control of a large RIS when having a channel with a large number of multipath components. In this paper, we derive Bayesian channel estimators for two RIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations: i) the short-term RIS configuration based on the instantaneous channel estimates; ii) the long-term RIS configuration based on the channel statistics. The proposed methods exploit spatial correlation characteristics at both the base station and the planar RISs, and other statistical characteristics of multi-specular fading in a mobile environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic for phase-shift selection at the RISs is developed. A computationally efficient fixed-point algorithm, which solves the max-min fairness power control optimally, is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed uplink RIS-aided framework improves the spectral efficiency of the cell-edge mobile user equipments substantially in comparison to a conventional single-cell massive MIMO system. The impact of several channel effects are studied to gain insight about when the channel estimation, i.e., the short-term configuration, is preferable in comparison to the long-term RIS configuration to boost the spectral efficiency.}

We consider a practical setting where (i) the IRS reflection coefficients are configured by adjusting tunable elements embedded in the meta-atoms, (ii) the IRS reflection coefficients are affected by the incident angles of the incoming signals, (iii) the IRS is deployed in multi-path, time-varying channels, and (iv) the feedback link from the base station to the IRS has a low data rate. Conventional optimization-based IRS control protocols, which rely on channel estimation and conveying the optimized variables to the IRS, are not applicable in this setting due to the difficulty of channel estimation and the low feedback rate. Therefore, we develop a novel adaptive codebook-based limited feedback protocol where only a codeword index is transferred to the IRS. We propose two solutions for adaptive codebook design, random adjacency (RA) and deep neural network policy-based IRS control (DPIC), both of which only require the end-to-end compound channels. We further develop several augmented schemes based on RA and DPIC. Numerical evaluations show that the data rate and average data rate over one coherence time are improved substantially by our schemes.}

Such dynamic space-terrestrial topologies impose an exponential increase in the degrees of freedom in network management. In this paper, we address two practical issues for an over-loaded LEO-terrestrial system. The first challenge is how to efficiently schedule resources to serve a massive number of connected users, such that more data and users can be delivered/served. The second challenge is how to make the algorithmic solution more resilient in adapting to dynamic wireless environments. We first propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm to provide an offline benchmark. To adapt to unforeseen variations, we propose an enhanced meta-critic learning algorithm (EMCL), where a hybrid neural network for parameterization and the Wolpertinger policy for action mapping are designed in EMCL. The results demonstrate EMCL’s effectiveness and fast-response capabilities in over-loaded systems and in adapting to dynamic environments compare to previous actor-critic and meta-learning methods.}

	abstract = {The joint source channel coding (JSCC) system is sensitive to the changing channel characteristics, because the optimally designed source-channel code pair always needs to be redesigned when the transmission environment is updated. A solution is to seek a common code pair for variable channels. Channel model 3 (CM3) is a variable on-body channel following the Weibull distribution, which is analyzed in four conditions due to varying shape factors, namely with exponential, Rayleigh, log-normal and normal distributions. The JSCC system is considered in this paper based on double protograph low-density parity-check (DP-LDPC) code pair over the variable CM3 channel. Firstly, four DP-LDPC code pairs are searched by the conventional differential evolution (DE) algorithm with four distributions of the Weibull model, respectively. However, these four code pairs only present good bit-error ratio performance in their own distribution, and have error floors in the other three. To resolve the problem, an artificial intelligence method based on principle component analysis (PCA) algorithm is designed to extract the common code pair. It is demonstrated that the common code pair performs well in noise-varying and practical-parameter transmissions. Instead of four DE code pairs, the designed one PCA code pair provides a strong technical support to low-complexity manufacturing such as eHealthcare.}

	abstract = {Increasing concerns on intelligent spectrum sensing call for efficient training and inference technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) framework, dubbed federated spectrum learning (FSL), which exploits the benefits of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and overcomes the unfavorable impact of deep fading channels. Distinguishingly, we endow conventional RISs with spectrum learning capabilities by leveraging a fully-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model at each RIS controller, thereby helping the base station to cooperatively infer the users who request to participate in FL at the beginning of each training iteration. To fully exploit the potential of FL and RISs, we address three technical challenges: RISs phase shifts configuration, user-RIS association, and wireless bandwidth allocation. The resulting joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user-RIS association design is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the system utility while considering the impact of FL prediction accuracy. In this context, the accuracy of FL prediction interplays with the performance of resource optimization. In particular, if the accuracy of the trained CNN model deteriorates, the performance of resource allocation worsens. The proposed FSL framework is tested by using real radio frequency (RF) traces and numerical results demonstrate its advantages in terms of spectrum prediction accuracy and system utility: a better CNN prediction accuracy and FL system utility can be achieved with a larger number of RISs and reflecting elements.}

	abstract = {A novel class of fast Multi-Modulus algorithms (fastMMA) for Blind Source Separation (BSS) and deconvolution are presented in this work. These are obtained through a fast fixed-point optimization rule used to minimize the Multi-Modulus (MM) criterion. Here, two BSS versions are provided to separate the sources either by finding the separation matrix at once or by separating a single source each time using a fast deflation technique. Further, the latter method is extended to cover systems of convolutive nature. Interestingly, these algorithms are implicitly shown to belong to the fixed step-size gradient descent family, henceforth, an algebraic variable step-size is proposed to make these algorithms converge even much faster. Apart from being computationally and performance-wise attractive, the new algorithms are free of any user-defined parameters.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is believed to deliver unrepresented spectral efficiency gains for 5G and beyond. However, a practical challenge arises during its commercial deployment, which is known as the “curse of mobility”. The performance of massive MIMO drops alarmingly when the velocity level of user increases. In this paper, we tackle the problem in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO with a novel Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition framework. A joint angle-delay-Doppler (JADD) wideband precoder is proposed for channel training. Our idea consists in the exploitation of the partial channel reciprocity of FDD and the angle-delay-Doppler channel structure. More precisely, the base station (BS) estimates the angle-delay-Doppler information of the UL channel based on UL pilots using Matrix Pencil (MP) method. It then computes the wideband JADD precoders according to the extracted parameters. Afterwards, the user estimates and feeds back some scalar coefficients for the BS to reconstruct the predicted DL channel. Asymptotic analysis shows that the CSI prediction error converges to zero when the number of BS antennas and the bandwidth increases. Numerical results with industrial channel model demonstrate that our framework can well adapt to high speed (350 km/h), large CSI delay (10 ms) and channel sample noise.}

	abstract = {Enabled by Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) in a WiFi-cellular heterogeneous network, the tasks of mobile terminals (MTs) can be offloaded via the cellular network to the MEC servers or cloud server, or via the WiFi network to alleviate transmission congestion of the cellular network. The MEC also enables service caching to cache the programs/libraries/databases of the tasks to avoid repeated input data uploading. Existing research works lack joint optimization on the task offloading and service caching for MEC in the WiFi-cellular heterogeneous network. In this paper, a novel resource management scheme for joint task offloading and service caching is proposed to maximize the energy consumption benefits of all the MTs covered by a WiFi-cellular heterogeneous network while guaranteeing the task processing delay tolerance of each MT. We consider the constraints on limited computing and storage resources of the MEC servers equipped on the cellular base station and the WiFi access point, and we also consider cellular channel allocation for the task offloading. We design an iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization technique to solve the proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming problem efficiently. Extensive simulations are conducted in multiple scenarios by varying different crucial parameters. The numerical results demonstrate that our scheme can largely improve the system performance in all the scenarios, and energy consumption reduction optimized by our scheme is 16.24%-43.09% higher than those by the comparative works.}

	abstract = {Demonstrated Spectral Efficiency (SE) gain by In Band Full Duplex (IBFD) makes it an attractive radio technology. Owing to inherent complexities in IBFD, Hybrid IBFD Cellular Network (HICN) is opted in practice because it limits IBFD capability only to Base Station and continues with legacy Half Duplex (HD) User Equipments (UEs). Since sharing frequencies within UE groups maximizes sum-SE in a HICN, we formulate a grouped UEs maximization problem for achieving maximum frequency sharing. Unlike heuristic search methods developed in literature, in this paper, we build a mathematical framework for UE grouping. Three grouping algorithms are analytically derived in closed-forms with varying performance and time complexity trade-offs. The optimal algorithm provides benchmarking on these performance measures. Using structural advantages of a HICN, we derive reduced search-optimal algorithm that reduces time complexity while guaranteeing optimal grouping, whereas near-optimal algorithm achieves close-to-optimal grouping with substantially reduced time complexity for real-time cellular systems. We further introduce the concept of ineligible UEs, which uniformly reduces time complexity of all three algorithms without impacting their grouping performance. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed near-optimal algorithm achieved a median sum-SE of 93.5% of theoretically doubling maximum over legacy HD systems, thus emerging as a prospective solution.}

	abstract = {Wireless multiplayer interactive virtual reality (VR) game has the high computing workload of VR and unpredictable interaction among players, which brings severe challenges to the design of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we propose a wireless multiplayer interactive VR game transmission framework based on mobile edge computing (MEC) that is able to model the interaction among players and compute the post-processing procedures at the MEC server or the mobile VR device. In the framework, the absolute delay of each player is used to avoid VR vertigo and the inter-player delay among players is used to model the fairness of the interactive game. Aiming to minimize the average inter-player delay, we optimize the computing resource allocation of the MEC server, the wireless bandwidth allocation and the post-processing decision policy subject to the constraints of the absolute delay requirements, the local energy limits of players, the total bandwidth limit and the computing resources limit. To tackle the non-convex problem efficiently, we design an iterative algorithm based on the NESTT-G algorithm which iteratively optimizes the truncated first-order Taylor approximation of the objective. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm can reduce the average inter-player delay significantly with lower complexity, and also reveal the impact of different parameters and the channel state conditions on the post-processing decision and edge resource allocation.}

It exploits the proximity of the D2D pairs and improves the overall network’s latency, capacity, and spectral efficiency by sharing/reusing the existing cellular resources. However, due to the frequency-sharing/reusing, the security of the device users (DUs) and the cellular users (CUs) becomes vulnerable. This paper presents a novel physical-layer security (PLS) scheme for the underlay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) D2D communications in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The proposed new PLS scheme can significantly reduce the information leakage for both CUs and DUs by adopting a null steering scheme at the transmitter. A signal alignment technique is also employed to eradicate the stringent requirement of a larger number of transmitter antennas than that of the receiver antennas. A generalized nonlinear optimization problem has been formulated to improve the PLS performance for MIMO-D2D communications. A closed-form and generalized analytical expression of the secrecy outage probability for CUs and DUs is derived over the imperfect Nakagami- m\nand Norton fading channels. Theoretical and simulation results of our proposed new PLS scheme have shown significant improvement in the secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability for both CUs and DUs in comparison with the existing methods.}

Load balancing at all base stations (BSs) imposes explicit constraints that makes the actions of all user equipment (UEs) co-dependent, a challenging twist to reinforcement learning. We propose a central load balancer to guarantee load balancing at all BSs for every learning step. We consider two association vectors: one for leaning update, and one best-to-date for data transmission, allowing UEs to engage in best-result data transmission while effectively participating in a background learning process indefinitely. For dynamic networks, we introduce a measurement model capturing rapid channel variations and user mobility. To minimize handover rate, we also differentiate between the handover cost for transmission and that for learning, and introduce a learning handover cost decreasing with sojourn time. The proposed algorithms can be implemented online as they require no offline training and can effectively adapt to network dynamics. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit fast learning convergence and outperform 3GPP handover by achieving an order of magnitude lower handover rate at a significantly higher network sum-rate, reaching within 94-97% of the near-optimal worst connection swapping benchmark algorithm.}

To suppress the strong Self-Interference (SI) signal due to simultaneous transmission and reception in FD MIMO systems, we propose a joint design of Analog and Digital (A/D) cancellation as well as transmit and receive beamforming capitalizing on baseband Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal modeling. Considering practical transmitter impairments, we present a multi-tap wideband analog canceller architecture whose number of taps does not scale with the number of transceiver antennas and multipath SI components. We also propose a novel adaptive digital cancellation based on truncated singular value decomposition that reduces the residual SI signal estimation parameters. To maximize the FD sum rate, a joint optimization framework is presented for A/D cancellation and digital beamforming. Finally, our extensive waveform simulation results demonstrate that the proposed wideband FD MIMO design exhibits higher SI cancellation capability with reduced complexity compared to existing cancellation techniques, resulting in improved achievable rate performance.}

In an anechoic chamber, we measure the self-interference power between the input of a transmitting phased array and the output of a colocated receiving phased array, each of which is electronically steered across a number of directions in azimuth and elevation. These self-interference power measurements shed light on the potential for a full-duplex communication system to successfully receive a desired signal while transmitting in-band. Our nearly 6.5 million measurements illustrate that more self-interference tends to be coupled when the transmitting and receiving phased arrays steer their beams toward one another but that slight shifts in steering direction (on the order of one degree) can lead to significant fluctuations in self-interference power. We analyze these measurements to characterize the spatial variability of self-interference to better quantify and statistically model this sensitivity. Our analyses and statistical results can be useful references when developing and evaluating mmWave full-duplex systems and motivate a variety of future topics including beam selection, beamforming codebook design, and self-interference channel modeling.}

The traditional two-dimensional models are no longer sufficient to capture the three-dimensional (3D) features of dense HetNets. On the other hand, deploying multiple antennas on BSs is a promising approach to improve network capacity. In this paper, we propose a 3D model for a K\n-tier HetNet with multi-antenna BSs, where different tiers share the same frequency band but may differ in BS height, BS density, number of antennas per BS, BS transmit power, association bias, and path loss exponent. We analytically derive the per-tier association probability under both the strongest received signal and the closest BS cell-association strategies. Based on that, we derive the expressions for the downlink ergodic rate, area spectral efficiency (ASE) and energy efficiency. The numerical results reveal that in the presence of macrocell BSs, for low to medium small-cell BS (SBS) densities, the closest BS cell-association strategy leads to low ergodic rate, ASE and energy efficiency regardless of the SBS height; while at very high SBS densities, under both cell-association strategies, SBSs should be deployed at the same height as UE to achieve high ergodic rate, ASE and energy efficiency. Moreover, we find that for a given SBS height, there exists an optimal combination of SBS density and number of antennas per SBS that maximizes the system energy efficiency.}

Most existing works are limited to either the case of identical multi-channel or independent sources. In this paper, we study this problem under the identical and non-identical multi-channel, as well as the correlated sources setting. This correlation defines the case when updating a source’s AoI; others correlated to this one will also reveal partial information. To tackle this AoI-based minimization problem, we formulate it as a correlated restless multi-armed bandit (CRMAB) problem. By decoupling the CRMAB problem into N\nindependent single-armed bandit problems, we derive the closed-form expressions of the generalized Whittle index (GWI) and the generalized partial Whittle index (GPWI) under the identical channel and the non-identical channel settings, respectively. Then, we put forth the GWI-based and GPWI-based scheduling policies to solve this AoI-based minimization problem. In addition, we provide two lower numerical performance bounds for the proposed policies by solving the relaxed Lagrange problem of the decoupled CRMAB. Numerical results show that the proposed policies can achieve these lower bounds and outperform the state-of-the-art scheduling policies. Compared with the case of independent sources, the performance of the proposed policies in the case of correlated sources improves significantly, especially in high-density networks.}

However, existing works use simplistic network representations that cannot properly encode the topological difference. They are often limited to fixed topology, and the performance is degraded because the learning target does not get sufficient information since the topological information is not well captured.To address this, we leverage the graphical neural network techniques and propose a two-stage topology-aware deep learning (TADL) framework, which trains a graph embedding unit and a link usage prediction module jointly to discover links likely to be used in optimal scheduling. By properly encoding the network structure, it makes input data with varying topology possible, and also provides more informative clues for the learning target.Important techniques are developed to ensure learning efficiency. The performance is evaluated on canonical multi-hop flow problems with diverse network structures, sizes and realistic deployment scenarios. It achieves close-to-optimum solution quality with a significant reduction in computation time without retraining.}

	abstract = {We present two model-based neural network architectures purposed for sporadic user detection and channel estimation in massive machine-type communications. In the scenario under consideration, a base station assigns the users a set of pilot sequences that is linearly dependent, but because user activity is sporadic the detection/estimation problem is amenable to sparse recovery algorithms. Further, we consider a millimeter-wave wireless channel, so that the channel vectors are sparse in a known dictionary. We apply the deep unfolding framework to design custom neural network layers by unrolling two iterative optimization algorithms: (1) linearized alternating direction method of multipliers, which we apply to a constrained convex problem, and (2) vector approximate message passing featuring a novel denoiser based on the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. The networks thus inherit domain knowledge as encapsulated by the signal model, and suitable operations as informed by the algorithms—in the same spirit as convolutional networks that exploit structure inherent in images and audio, except grounded in optimization and statistics. The networks, trained on synthetic data generated from the block-fading millimeter-wave multiple access channel model, offer improved complexity and accuracy relative to their iterative counterparts, and are potentially a boon to cell-free MIMO systems.}

Considering the dynamic change and randomness of the topology of the C-V2X network, we model the roadways, the V2X nodes on each roadway, and the BSs by a Poisson line process, a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), and a 2D PPP, respectively. We propose two uplink association schemes for a typical vehicle, namely, the smallest-distance association (SDA) scheme and the largest-power association (LPA) scheme, and we establish a tractable analytical framework to comprehensively assess the security performance of the uplink transmission, by leveraging the stochastic geometry theory. Specifically, for each association scheme, we first obtain new expressions for the association probability of the typical vehicle, and then derive the overall connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability by calculating the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference power. Numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analysis, and we also provide interesting insights into how the security performance is influenced by various system parameters, including the densities of V2X nodes and BSs. Moreover, we show that the LPA scheme outperforms the SDA scheme in terms of secrecy throughput.}

For the optimal RIS matrix, which maximizes the SNR, we derive an exact closed form expression for the mean SNR and an approximation for the SNR variance leading to an accurate gamma approximation to the distribution of the SNR.

We also present favourable and unfavourable channel scenarios which provide insight into the sort of environments that improve or degrade the mean SNR.

	abstract = {In virtualized radio access network (vRAN), the base station (BS) functions are decomposed into virtualized components that can be hosted at the centralized unit or distributed units through functional splits. Such flexibility has many benefits; however, it also requires solving the problem of finding the optimal splits of functions of the BSs in such a way that minimizes the total network cost. The underlying vRAN system is complex and precise modelling of it is not trivial. Formulating the functional split problem to minimize the cost results in a combinatorial problem that is provably NP-hard, and solving it is computationally expensive. In this paper, a constrained deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed to solve the problem with minimal assumptions about the underlying system. Since in deep RL, the action selection is the outcome of inference of a neural network, it can be done in real-time while training to update the neural networks can be done in the background. However, since the problem is combinatorial, even for a small number of functions, the action space of the RL problem becomes large. Therefore, to deal with such a large action space, a chain rule-based stochastic policy is exploited in which a long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based sequence-to-sequence model is applied to estimate the policy that is selecting the functional split actions. However, the utilized policy is still limited to an unconstrained problem, and each split decision is bounded by vRAN’s constraint requirements. Hence, a constrained policy gradient method is leveraged to train and guide the policy toward constraint satisfaction. Further, a search strategy by greedy decoding or temperature sampling is utilized to improve the optimality performance at the test time. Simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution using synthetic and real network datasets. Our numerical results show that the proposed RL solution architecture successfully learns to make optimal functional split decisions with the accuracy of the solution is up to 0.05% of the optimality gap. Moreover, our solution can achieve considerable cost savings compared to C-RAN or D-RAN systems and a faster computational time than the optimal baseline.}

	abstract = {Beamforming with high dimensional antenna arrays provides the gain needed to enable high bandwidth communication in the sub-terahertz (THz) band. The resulting narrow beams, however, come at the cost of increased sensitivity to beam alignment errors. A potential remedy to this problem is to introduce a form a macrodiversity through non-coherent joint transmission (NC-JT). We employ a stochastic geometry framework to analyze the performance of a THz network employing user-centric base station clustering and NC-JT. We derive semi-closed form lower bounds for the coverage probability and ergodic capacity experienced by a typical user in the network. Our model includes THz networks without joint transmission as a special case. Overall, our analysis indicates that joint transmission from a few base stations improves coverage and capacity by mitigating the impact of beam misalignment. Moreover, in certain settings, NC-JT is a more efficient usage a network access points compared to the non-cooperative case, and reduces the sensitivity of coverage and capacity to the choice of user beamwidth.}

	abstract = {Ground-based positioning systems (GBPSs), such as cellular networks and pseudolites, can provide high-precision positioning services through carrier phase positioning (CPP). Most existing methods are based on having accurate coordinates of all transmitters (TXs). In some applications, however, it could be too expensive and time-consuming to measure the coordinates of all TXs accurately, and requiring precise manual measurements severely degrades the flexibility of GBPSs. In this paper, we propose a carrier phase based autonomous coordinate evolution (CPACE) method for GBPSs, which uses the observations of multiple users to continuously improve the accuracy of TX coordinates. We first propose a Batch CPACE (B-CPACE) method and analyze its theoretical advantages over traditional single-point positioning (SPP). In the case of a large number of users, to avoid heavy burden on data transmission and calculation, we propose two distributed CPACE (D-CPACE) methods which have the same asymptotic performance with B-CPACE. Our numerical simulations prove that both B-CPACE and D-CPACE have better accuracy than SPP and reach the Cramer-Rao lower bounds. A real-world experiment shows that the proposed method can achieve centimeter-level accuracy.}

	abstract = {Energy-efficiency (EE) is a critical metric within wireless optimization. Power control over fading channels is considered as a promising EE-improving technique, but requires optimization of a series of fractional functional optimization problems which are hard to handle by existing optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel EE power control method with unsupervised learning. Firstly, the original fractional problems are decomposed into sub-problems by Dinkelbach and quadratic transformations. Then, these sub-problems are reformulated into unconstrained forms through Lagrange dual formulation. Furthermore, unsupervised primal-dual learning method is applied to handle these unconstrained problems with strong duality. Finally, The unsupervised primal-dual learning is implemented by the deep neural network (DNN) with low computational complexity. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a number of typical wireless optimizing scenarios. It is shown that compared to conventional algorithms our method achieves better performance in cognitive radio networks, interference networks, and OFDM networks.}

	abstract = {Despite its advantages of flexility and low-cost networking, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications face various attacks such as eavesdropping. Existing studies on secure UAV communications assume fixed-location eavesdroppers and rarely consider interactions between legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. In this paper, we investigate eavesdropping and anti-eavesdropping interaction between a UAV-enabled eavesdropper (UAV-E) and a UAV-enabled base station (UAV-BS) in a downlink wiretap system. The UAV-E aims to wiretap downlink signals by adaptively adjusting its trajectory while the UAV-BS aims to maximize secrecy-sum-rate with minimum power consumption by jointly optimizing user scheduling, power control, and trajectory. Dynamic differential equations are formulated to characterize motions of UAVs, following which a zero-sum differential game is formulated to model the “pursuit-evasion” interaction between the UAV-BS and the UAV-E. Definition and existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) are provided. To obtain the NE, Pontryagins minimum principle is leveraged to solve the trajectory design problem. Further, Gauss-Seidel-like implicit finite-difference method is leveraged to obtain saddle-point strategies at NE. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed game model. It is revealed that the differential game can well-characterize the strategy interactions between UAVs. Moreover, results show that the initial positions and weights of UAVs, the energy consumption factor, and the user scheduling have key impacts on motion interactions between the UAV-BS and the UAV-E and further on UAV-BS’s power control.}

	abstract = {Robustness against noise is critical for modulation recognition (MR) approaches deployed in real-world communication systems. In MR systems, a corrupted signal is normally enhanced using low-level signal enhancement (SE) before signal classification (SC). Many existing approaches address signal distortion problems by compartmentalizing SE from SC. While those approaches allow for efficient development, they also dictate compartmentalized performance metrics, without feedback from the SC module. For example, SE modules are designed using perceptual signal quality metrics but not with SC in mind. To improve the effectiveness of SE on MR, this paper proposes a joint learning framework consisting of three cascaded modules: dual-channel spectrum fusion, SE, and SC. Instead of separately processing SE and SC, these three modules are integrated into one framework and jointly trained with a single recognition loss. In contrast to estimating clean signals, the SE module in the proposed joint learning framework is trained to predict a ratio mask and find important time-frequency bins for the SC module. We integrate a multistage attention mechanism into the framework to further increase the robustness. The multistage attention mechanism is deployed to strengthen the recognition-related features learned from context information in channel, time, and frequency domains. We evaluate the recognition performance of the proposed framework and its modules on two benchmark datasets: RadioML2016.10a and RadioML2016.10b. The experiment results show that the proposed joint learning framework outperforms the separate learning framework. Moreover, comparisons are performed with several existing learning-based MR methods in the literature. The proposed joint learning framework leads to significant performance improvement, especially for modulated signals corrupted by channel noise.}

A typical SSP system consists of geographically distributed spectrum sensors which can be compromised to submit fake spectrum-sensing reports. In this paper, we propose SpecKriging, a new spatial-interpolation technique based on Inductive Graph Neural Network Kriging (IGNNK) for secure CSS. In SpecKriging, we first pretrain a graphical neural network (GNN) model with the historical sensing records of a few trusted anchor sensors. During system runtime, we use the trained model to evaluate the trustworthiness of non-anchor sensors’ data and also use them along with anchor sensors’ new data to retrain the model. SpecKriging outputs trustworthy sensor reports for spectrum-occupancy detection. To the best of our knowledge, SpecKriging is the first work that explores GNNs for trustworthy CSS and also incorporates the hardware heterogeneity of spectrum sensors. Extensive experiments confirm the high efficacy and efficiency of SpecKriging for trustworthy spectrum-occupancy detection even when malicious spectrum sensors constitute the majority.}

	abstract = {The conventional design of wireless communication systems typically relies on established mathematical models that capture the characteristics of different communication modules. Unfortunately, such design cannot be easily and directly applied to future wireless networks, which will be characterized by large-scale ultra-dense networks whose design complexity scales exponentially with the network size. Furthermore, such networks will vary dynamically in a significant way, which makes it intractable to develop comprehensive analytical models. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have emerged as potential alternatives for designing complex and dynamic wireless systems. However, existing learning-based methods have limited capabilities to scale with the problem size and to generalize with varying network settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable and generalizable neural calibration framework for future wireless system design, where a neural network is adopted to calibrate the input of conventional model-based algorithms. Specifically, the backbone of a traditional time-efficient algorithm is integrated with deep neural networks to achieve a high computational efficiency, while enjoying enhanced performance. The permutation equivariance property, carried out by the topological structure of wireless systems, is furthermore utilized to develop a generalizable neural network architecture. The proposed neural calibration framework is applied to solve challenging resource management problems in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Simulation results will show that the proposed neural calibration approach enjoys significantly improved scalability and generalization compared with the existing learning-based methods.}

Particularly, the co-channel interference induced by the spectrum sharing between satellite and terrestrial networks and the inter-beam interference due to frequency reuse among satellite multi-beam serve as the green interference to assist the symbiotic secure transmission, where the secure transmissions of both satellite and terrestrial links are guaranteed simultaneously. Specifically, to realize the symbiotic security, we formulate a problem to maximize the sum secrecy rate of satellite users by cooperatively beamforming optimizing and a constraint of secrecy rate of each terrestrial user is guaranteed. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and intractable, the Taylor expansion and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) are adopted to further reformulate this problem, and the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is designed to solve it. Finally, the tightness of the relaxation is proved. In addition, numerical results verify the efficiency of our proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has recently become one of the hottest focuses in wireless edge networks with the ever-increasing computing capability of user equipment (UE). In FL, UEs train local machine learning models and transmit them to an aggregator, where a global model is formed and then sent back to UEs. In wireless networks, local training and model transmission can be unsuccessful due to constrained computing resources, wireless channel impairments, bandwidth limitations, etc., which degrades FL performance in model accuracy and/or training time. Moreover, we need to quantify the benefits and cost of deploying edge intelligence, as model training and transmission consume certain amount of resources. Therefore, it is imperative to deeply understand the relationship between FL performance and multiple-dimensional resources. In this paper, we construct an analytical model to investigate the relationship between the FL model accuracy and consumed resources in FL empowered wireless edge networks. Based on the analytical model, we explicitly quantify the model accuracy, available computing resources and communication resources. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our theoretical modeling and analysis, and demonstrate the trade-off between the communication and computing resources for achieving a certain model accuracy.}

	abstract = {The unprecedented growth in wireless Internet-of-Things and WiFi devices has renewed interest in mechanisms for efficient spectrum reuse. Existing schemes require some level of primary-secondary coordination, cross-channel state estimation and tracking, or activity detection– which complicate implementation. For low-power short-range secondary communication, the main impediment is strong and time-varying (e.g., intermittent) interference from the primary system. This paper proposes a practical underlay scheme that permits reliable secondary communication in this regime. The secondary transmitter merely has to send its signal twice, at very low power - a few dBs above the noise floor, but far below the primary’s interference. Exploiting the repetition structure, reliable and computationally efficient recovery of the secondary signal is possible via canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Experiments using a software radio testbed reveal that, for a secondary user with only two receive antennas, reliable detection of the secondary signal is possible for signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in the range of −20 to −40 dB. The approach works with unknown time-varying channels, digital or analog modulation, it is immune to carrier frequency offset, and, as a side-benefit, it provides means for accurate synchronization of the secondary user even at very low SINR.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of providing ultra-reliable and power-efficient virtual reality (VR) experiences for wireless mobile users. To ensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile users and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are exploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the wireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a sequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users’ feeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption constraints on access points (APs) and users’ head-mounted displays (HMDs). The problem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users’ accurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer characteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state network (ESN) learning method to predict users’ tracking information by training fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs. With the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer decision variables and solve a continuous power control problem to criticize the integer decision variables. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the impact of different design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% power-efficient than the benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {A novel framework of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced indoor wireless networks is proposed, where an RIS mounted on the robot is invoked to enable mobility of the RIS and enhance the service quality for mobile users. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are adopted to further increase the spectrum efficiency since RISs are capable of providing NOMA with artificial controlled channel conditions, which can be seen as a beneficial operation condition to obtain NOMA gains. To optimize the sum rate of all users, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is invoked to optimize the deployment and phase shifts of the mobile RIS as well as the power allocation policy. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of agent training for the DDPG agents, a federated learning (FL) concept is adopted to enable multiple agents to simultaneously explore similar environments and exchange experiences. We also proved that with the same random exploring policy, the FL armed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents can theoretically obtain a reward gain comparing to the independent agents. Our simulation results indicate that the mobile RIS scheme can significantly outperform the fixed RIS paradigm, which provides about three times data rate gain compared to the fixed RIS paradigm. Moreover, the NOMA scheme is capable of achieving a gain of 42% in contrast with the OMA scheme in terms of the sum rate. Finally, the multi-cell simulation proved that the FL enhanced DDPG algorithm has a superior convergence rate and optimization performance than the independent training framework.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an integrated data and energy network and D2D communication coexistence (DED2D) system. The DED2D system allows a base station (BS) to transfer data to information-demanded users (IUs) and energy to energy-demanded users (EUs), i.e., using a time-fraction-based information and energy transfer (TFIET) scheme. Furthermore, the DED2D system enables D2D communications to share spectrum with the BS. Therefore, the DED2D system addresses the growth of energy and spectrum demands of the next generation networks. However, the interference caused by the D2D communications and propagation loss of wireless links can significantly degrade the data throughput of IUs. To deal with the issues, we propose to deploy an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the DED2D system. Then, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to optimize the information beamformer for the IUs, energy beamformer for EUs, time fractions of the TFIET, transmit power of D2D transmitters, and reflection coefficients of the IRS to maximize IUs’ worse throughput while satisfying the harvested energy requirement of EUs and D2D rate threshold. The max-min throughput optimization problem is computationally intractable, and we develop an alternating descent algorithm to resolve it with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a rapidly growing technology which can supplement the current radio-frequency (RF) based wireless communication systems. VLC can play a huge part in solving the ever-increasing problem of spectrum scarcity because of the growing availability of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). One of the biggest advantages of VLC over other communication systems is that it can provide illumination and data communication simultaneously without needing any extra deployment. Although it is essential to provide data rate at a blazing speed to all the users nowadays, maintaining a satisfactory level in the distribution of lighting is also important. In this paper, we present a novel approach of using mirrors to enhance the illumination uniformity and throughput of an indoor multi-element VLC system architecture. In this approach, we improve the Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of the system and overall illumination uniformity of the room by redirecting the reflected LED beams on the walls to darker spots with the use of mirrors. We formulate a joint optimization problem focusing on maximization of the SINR while maintaining a reasonable illumination uniformity across the room. We propose a two-stage solution of the optimization problem: design solution and communication solution. In the design optimization, we formulate an equivalent binary linear optimization to achieve the best illumination quality by optimizing the mirror placements and the LEDs’ transmit powers. In the communication problem, however, we aim to improve the throughput of the system using a fair utility metric based on maximizing the minimum user’s data rate. Due to non-convexity of the communication problem, we propose three different heuristic solutions and analyze their performance. We also show that about threefold increase in average illumination and fourfold increase in average throughput can be achieved when the mirror placement is applied which is a significant performance improvement.}

	abstract = {Reciprocity-based time-division duplex (TDD) Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems utilize channel estimates obtained in the uplink to perform precoding in the downlink. However, this method has been criticized of breaking down, in the sense that the channel estimates are not good enough to spatially separate multiple user terminals, at low uplink reference signal signal-to-noise ratios, due to insufficient channel estimation quality. Instead, codebook-based downlink precoding has been advocated for as an alternative solution in order to bypass this problem. We analyze this problem by considering a “grid-of-beams world” with a finite number of possible downlink channel realizations. Assuming that the terminal accurately can detect the downlink channel, we show that in the case where reciprocity holds, carefully designing a mapping between the downlink channel and the uplink reference signals will perform better than both the conventional TDD Massive MIMO and frequency-division duplex (FDD) Massive MIMO approach. We derive elegant metrics for designing this mapping, and further, we propose algorithms that find good sequence mappings.}

	abstract = {With the aim of integrating over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into an on-demand universal framework, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided hybrid network by leveraging the RIS to flexibly adjust the decoding order of heterogeneous data. A new metric of computation rate is defined to measure the performance of AirFL users. Upon this, the objective of this work is to maximize the achievable hybrid rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power, controlling the receive scalar, and designing the reflection coefficients. Since the concurrent transmissions of all computation and communication signals are aided by the discrete phase-shifting elements at the RIS, the formulated problem (P0) is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. To tackle this intractable issue, we decompose the original problem (P0) into a non-convex problem (P1) and a combinatorial problem (P2), which are characterized by the continuous and discrete variables, respectively. For the transceiver design problem (P1), the power allocation subproblem is first solved by difference-of-convex programming, and then the receive control subproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation, where the closed-form expressions of simplified cases are derived to obtain deep insights. For the reflection design problem (P2), a relaxation-then-quantization method is adopted to find a suboptimal solution for striking a trade-off between complexity and performance. Afterwards, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve the non-linear non-convex problem (P0) iteratively. Finally, simulation results reveal that i) the proposed RIS-aided hybrid network can support on-demand communication and computation efficiently, ii) the system performance can be improved by properly selecting the location of the RIS, and iii) the designed algorithms are also applicable to conventional networks with only AirFL or NOMA users.}

However, multiple neural networks with different lengths of feedback overhead are required by time-varying bandwidth resources. The storage space required at the user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) for these models increases linearly with the number of models. In this paper, we propose a DL-based changeable-rate framework with novel quantization scheme to improve the efficiency and feasibility of CSI feedback systems. This framework can reutilize all the network layers to achieve overhead-changeable CSI feedback to optimize the storage efficiency at the UE and the BS sides. Designed quantizer in this framework can avoid the normalization and gradient problems faced by traditional quantization schemes. Specifically, we propose two DL-based changeable-rate CSI feedback networks CH- CsiNetPro and CH- DualNetSph by introducing a feedback overhead control unit. Then, a pluggable quantization block (PQB) is developed to further improve the encoding efficiency of CSI feedback in an end-to-end way. Compared with existing CSI feedback methods, the proposed framework saves the storage space by about 50% with changeable-rate scheme and improves the encoding efficiency with the quantization module.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the random iterative method is introduced to massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for the efficient downlink linear precoding. By adopting the random sampling into the traditional iterative methods, the matrix inversion within the linear precoding schemes can be approximated statistically, which not only achieves a faster exponential convergence with low complexity but also experiences a global convergence without suffering from the various convergence requirements. Specifically, based on the random iterative method, the randomized iterative precoding algorithm (RIPA) is firstly proposed and we show its approximation error decays exponentially and globally along with the number of iterations. Then, with respect to the derived convergence rate, the concept of conditional sampling is introduced, so that further optimization and enhancement are carried out to improve both the convergence and the efficiency of the randomized iterations. After that, based on the equivalent iteration transformation, the modified randomized iterative precoding algorithm (MRIPA) is presented, which achieves a better precoding performance with low-complexity for various scenarios of massive MIMO. Finally, simulation results based on downlink precoding in massive MIMO systems are given to show the system gains of RIPA and MRIPA in terms of performance and complexity.}

	abstract = {Even a wider set of highly critical and latency-sensitive applications with resource needs from the access network and the edge will be supported by the 6G networks. Therefore, the 6G network will deal with diversification of service platforms. Optimizing the resource consumption of network slicing on top of a shared infrastructure will become essential to keep the operating costs on an acceptable level. Each vertical, e.g., eMBBPlus, BigCom, holographic and tactile communications can run on top of network slice with specific KPIs. Different verticals can have contradicting requirements running on top of the same infrastructure. This paper investigates the orchestration of network services within a federated end-to-end network slice, which may span over multiple cloud domains as expected to be a common scenario in 6G deployments. We introduce three optimization solutions that consider two conflicting objectives, the end-to-end delay and service relocation, for orchestrating network slice. While the first solution optimizes the end-to-end delay, the second solution optimizes the service relocation. Meanwhile, the third solution leverages the bargaining game theory for achieving optimal Pareto fair trade-off configuration to optimize both objectives. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions to achieve their main design goals}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unsourced random access (URA) scheme for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks with massive sporadic traffic devices. First of all, this paper proposes a novel joint active device separation (the message recovery of active device) and channel estimation architecture for the RIS-aided URA. Specifically, the RIS passive reflection is optimized before the successful device separation. Then, by associating the data sequences to multiple rank-one tensors and exploiting the angular sparsity of the RIS-BS channel, the detection problem is cast as a high-order coupled tensor decomposition problem without the need of exploiting pilot sequences. However, the inherent coupling among multiple sparse device-RIS channels, together with the unknown number of active devices make the detection problem at hand deviate from the widely-used coupled tensor decomposition format. To overcome this challenge, this paper judiciously devises a probabilistic model that captures both the element-wise sparsity from the angular channel model and the low-rank property due to the sporadic nature of URA. Then, based on such a probabilistic model, a iterative detection algorithm is developed under the framework of sparse variational inference, where each update iteration is obtained in a closed-form and the number of active devices can be automatically estimated for effectively avoiding the overfitting of noise. Extensive simulation results confirm the excellence of the proposed URA algorithm, especially for the case of a large number of reflecting elements for accommodating a significantly large number of devices.}

	abstract = {Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a planar metasurface consisting of a large number of low-cost reflecting elements, has received much attention due to its ability to improve both the spectrum and energy efficiencies by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we propose an RIS phase shift and BS beamforming optimization technique that minimizes the uplink transmit power of the RIS-aided IoT network. Key idea of the proposed scheme, referred to as Riemannian conjugate gradient-based joint optimization (RCG-JO), is to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the BS beamforming vectors using the Riemannian conjugate gradient technique. By exploiting the product Riemannian manifold structure of the sets of unit-modulus phase shifts and unit-norm beamforming vectors, we convert the nonconvex uplink power minimization problem into the unconstrained problem and then find out the optimal solution over the product Riemannian manifold. From the performance analysis and numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed RCG-JO technique achieves 94% reduction of the uplink transmit power over the conventional scheme without RIS.}

	abstract = {This work examines the use of image surveillance UAVs for relay communication between ground users and a remote base station (BS). UAVs take aerial images of the surveillance region and forward them to the BS while serving the uplink transmission demands of ground users. We first consider the single-UAV scenario and jointly determine the UAV’s trajectory, task assignment, user association, and rate allocation by maximizing the sum-log-throughput of the users subject to constraints on the surveillance coverage, image transmission requirements, and relay capacity. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is solved by an inexact block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm where we inherit ideas from the exact penalty method for mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints to relax the integer constraints and the successive convex approximation approach to address the non-convexity of the trajectory optimization problem. Then, we extend the proposed framework to the case with multiple UAVs that are dispatched to cover a wide surveillance region. The UAVs may complete both relay and surveillance tasks more efficiently through cooperation and proper task allocation for UAVs. A similar BCD algorithm is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over several baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) creates a platform to exploit the synergy between two powerful functionalities that have been developing separately. However, the interference management and resource allocation between sensing and communication have not been fully studied. In this paper, we consider the design of perceptive mobile networks (PMNs) by adding sensing capability to current cellular networks. To avoid full-duplex operation, we propose the PMN with distributed target monitoring terminals (TMTs) where passive TMTs are deployed over wireless networks to locate the sensing target (ST). To manage the interference between sensing and communication, we jointly optimize the transmit and receive beamformers towards the communication user equipment (UEs) and the ST by alternating-optimization (AO) and prove its convergence. To reduce computation complexity and obtain physical insights, we further investigate the use of linear transceivers, including zero forcing and beam synthesis (B-syn). Our analysis revealed interesting physical insights: 1) instead of forming dedicated sensing signals, it is more efficient to redesign the communication signals for both communication and sensing purposes and “leak” communication energy for sensing; 2) the amount of energy leakage from one UE to the ST depends on their relative locations.}

	abstract = {Traditional visible light positioning (VLP) systems estimate receivers’ coordinates based on the assumption that light-emitting diode (LED) coordinates are known accurately, which is not always practical. Even with accurate laser range finders, the structural changes of the buildings due to temperature, humidity, and material aging might affect the LED coordinates unpredictably. Besides, when the number of LEDs increases, it is time-consuming to build a database of LED coordinates. In this paper, we propose a novel system exploiting two optical angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimators to localize the LEDs, and the AOA estimators have fixed relative positions. Each AOA estimator has four photodiodes (PDs) towards different orientations to estimate the incident light direction. Considering the additive noises imposed on the PDs, we derive a closed-form error expression of the LED coordinate estimator. Analytical and simulation results show that the two AOA estimators should be set symmetrically with respect to the room center to reduce the error of the LED coordinates database. Moreover, an experimental platform is built with two fixed AOA estimators and one moving LED in order to verify the approach. The measured average localization error is 4.46 cm and the time of one localization is about 23.4 ms.}

	abstract = {We consider a full-duplex (FD)-enabled multi-user two-way communication system with adaptive amplify-and-forward (AF)/decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol. All the users are assumed to be mobile and to have FD abilities. The effect of mobility, which results in time-selective fading, is modeled using a first-order autoregressive (AR1) process. The fading channel-based approach characterizes the residual self-interference (RSI) at the FD relay, user nodes and is modeled as a Rician distributed random variable. This paper constitutes the most critical use case of 5G, i.e., ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC), which adopts short-packets finite blocklength (FB) codes to spin out into the mission-critical applications where strict latency and reliability requirements are highly desirable. The outage performance of the system is studied over independent and non-identically distributed complex Gaussian (Rayleigh envelope) channels with imperfect channel state information (CSI) for with and without URLLC use cases. The closed-form expressions for the outage probability and block error rate (BLER) are derived for the absolute channel power-based scheduling scheme considering the different Doppler power spectra models and the effect of co-channel interference (CCI). The expressions for the asymptotic outage probability are also derived. The presented analysis is compared with baseline schemes, e.g., the results derived with adaptive AF/DF relaying are also compared with both AF and DF relaying, and the performance of the FD transmissions is compared to that of half-duplex (HD) transmissions. The impact of node mobility, RSI, FBL, number of user pairs, and imperfect CSI on the system performance is investigated. Moreover, essential insights are obtained related to the performance gain and region of the superiority of the adaptive AF/DF relaying scheme. The derived analytic results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, at high transmit power, the outage performance for the adaptive AF/DF protocol approaches the derived asymptotic floor.}

	abstract = {In dynamic spectrum access (DSA), secondary users (SU) should only be allowed to access a licensed band belonging to incumbent users (IU) when the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of both IUs and SUs can be satisfied at the same time. However, IU’s location and its received interference strength are considered sensitive in many DSA systems which should not be revealed, making it very challenging to optimize the network utility subjected to satisfying the operation and security requirements of SUs and IUs. In this paper, we develop a secure and distributed SU transmit power control algorithm to solve this challenge. Our algorithm achieves optimal SU power control to maximize the sum of SU rates. The SINR-guaranteed coexistence between SUs and IUs are enabled to maintain effective communication, while no information is directly required from IUs. Local measurements of IU signals provided by Environmental sensing capability (ESC) also undergo a security masking process to ensure that IU location cannot be derived from its outputs. Convergence and stability properties of our algorithm and its privacy-protection strength are both theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated through simulations.}

As interleavers are commonly used to improve the reliability on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbol level for long packet transmission, this paper considers the feasibility of applying short-packet bit interleaving to enhance the impulse/burst interference resisting capability on both OFDM symbol and frame level. Using the Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRP) and PC hardware platform, the Packet Error Rate (PER) performance of interleaved coded short-packet transmission with Convolutional Codes (CC), Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, and RS+CC concatenated codes are tested and analyzed. The IEEE 1613 standard is applied for impulse interference generation, and extensive PER tests of CC (1/2)\nand RS (31,21)+\nCC (1/2)\nconcatenated codes are conducted. We prove the effectiveness of bit interleaved coded short-packet transmission in real factory environments with practical experiments. Moreover, we investigate how PER performance depends on the interleavers, codes and impulse interference power and frequency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, reinforcement learning (RL) based end-to-end channel prediction (CP) and beamforming (BF) algorithms are proposed for multi-user downlink system. Different from the previous methods which either require perfect channel state information (CSI), or estimate outdated CSI and set constraints on pilot sequences, the proposed algorithms have no such premised assumptions or constraints. Firstly, RL is considered in channel prediction and the actor-critic aided CP algorithm is proposed at the base station (BS). With the received pilot signals and partial feedback information, the actor network at BS directly outputs the predicted downlink CSI without channel reciprocity. After obtaining the CSI, BS generates the beamforming matrix using zero-forcing (ZF). Secondly, we further develop a deep RL based two-layer architecture for joint CP and BF design. The first layer predicts the downlink CSI with the similar actor network as in the CP algorithm. Then, by importing the outputs of the first layer as inputs, the second layer is the actor-critic based beamforming layer, which can autonomously learn the beamforming policy with the objective of maximizing the transmission sum rate. Since the learning state and action spaces in the considered CP and BF problems are continuous, we employ the actor-critic method to deal with the continuous outputs. Empirical numerical simulations and the complexity analysis verify that the proposed end-to-end algorithms could always converge to stable states under different channel statistics and scenarios, and can beat the existing traditional and learning based benchmarks, in terms of transmission sum rate.}

	abstract = {The use of efficient high-power amplifiers (HPAs) is critical for future millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. HPAs can become highly nonlinear when operated near saturation, distorting the transmission signal. Therefore, the design of efficient solutions to mitigate nonlinear distortion (NLD) is of paramount importance. This article proposes a hybrid multiuser equalizer for the uplink of wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems. The equalizer is designed to mitigate both the multiuser interference (MUI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI), introduced by the multiple access channel, and the NLD, introduced by the user terminals HPA. The digital part of the hybrid equalizer is iterative and computed on a per subcarrier basis, to minimize the mean squared error between the transmitted and detected data. In the iterative processing, a feedback loop estimates and removes the distortion. The analog part is frequency-flat and its design assumes that the digital part efficiently removes the MUI, ISI and NLD. Performance results show a huge gain of the proposed hybrid nonlinear equalizer, when compared with linear ones. The nonlinear effects are almost completely removed, without significant error propagation effects, allowing a more efficient operation of the HPAs.}

An IoT device can randomly choose any of the multiplexing bands to transmit its packet. Due to hardware constraints, a base station (BS) is able to listen to only one multiplexing band. Our main objective is to maximize the packet decoding probability (PDP) by optimizing the placement of the BSs and frequency assignment of BSs to multiplexing bands. We develop two online approaches that adapt to the environment based on the statistics of (un)successful packets at the BSs. The first approach is based on a predefined model of the environment, while the second approach is measurement-based model-free approach, which is applicable to any environment. The benefit of the model-based approach is a lower training complexity, at the risk of a poor fit in a model-incompatible environment. The simulation results show that our proposed approaches to band assignment and BS placement offer significant improvement in PDP over baseline random approaches and perform closely to the theoretical upper bound.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is introduced to assist an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for serving multiple ground users. We aim to minimize the average total system energy consumption by jointly designing the resource allocation strategy, the three dimensional (3D) trajectory of the UAV, as well as the phase control at the IRS. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the maximum tolerable outage probability constraint and the individual minimum data rate requirement. To circumvent the intractability of the design problem due to the altitude-dependent Rician fading in UAV-to-user links, we adopt the deep neural network (DNN) approach to accurately approximate the corresponding effective channel gains, which facilitates the development of a low-complexity suboptimal iterative algorithm via dividing the formulated problem into two subproblems and address them alternatingly. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an effective solution within a small number of iterations and illustrate some interesting insights: (1) IRS enables a highly flexible UAV’s 3D trajectory design via recycling the dissipated radio signal for improving the achievable system data rate and reducing the flight power consumption of the UAV; (2) IRS provides a rich array gain through passive beamforming in the reflection link, which can substantially reduce the required communication power for guaranteeing the required quality-of-service (QoS); (3) Optimizing the altitude of UAV’s trajectory can effectively exploit the outage-guaranteed effective channel gain to save the total required communication power enabling power-efficient UAV communications; (4) NOMA communications offer higher degrees of freedom (DoF) than that of the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme to minimize the average power consumption via optimizing the UAV’s trajectory.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the application of physical-layer network coding (PNC) to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in which a controller and a robot are out of each other’s transmission range, and they exchange messages with the assistance of a relay. We particularly focus on a scenario where 1) the controller has more information to transmit than the robot; 2) the channel of the controller is stronger than that of the robot, and both users have nearly the same transmit power. To reduce the communication latency, we put forth an asymmetric PNC transmission scheme in which the controller transmits more information than the robot by exploiting its stronger channel gain in the uplink of PNC. However, the current channel-coded PNC requires the two users to transmit the same amount of source information in order to preserve the linearity of the two users’ channel codes at the relay for successful decoding. Therefore, a challenge in the asymmetric PNC transmission scheme is how to construct a channel decoder at the relay, considering that a superimposed symbol at the relay contains different amounts of source information from the controller and robot. To fill this gap, we propose a lattice-based encoding and decoding scheme in which the robot and controller encode and modulate their information in lattices with different lattice construction levels. The network-coded messages are decoded level-by-level in the lattice. Our design is versatile on that the controller and the robot can freely choose their modulation orders based on their channel power, and the design is applicable for arbitrary channel codes, not just for one particular channel code. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed channel-coded asymmetric PNC transmission scheme.}

	abstract = {Radar sensing will be integrated into the 6G communication system to support various applications. In this integrated sensing and communication system, a radar target may also be a communication channel scatterer. In this case, the radar and communication channels exhibit certain joint burst sparsity. We propose a two-stage joint pilot optimization, target detection and channel estimation scheme to exploit such joint burst sparsity and pilot beamforming gain to enhance detection/estimation performance. In Stage 1, the base station (BS) sends downlink pilots (DP) for initial target search, and the user sends uplink pilots (UP) for channel estimation. Then the BS performs joint target detection and channel estimation. In Stage 2, the BS exploits the prior information obtained in Stage 1 to optimize the DP signal to further refine the performance. A Turbo Sparse Bayesian inference algorithm is proposed for joint target detection and channel estimation in both stages. The pilot optimization problem in Stage 2 is a semi-definite programming with rank-1 constraints. By replacing the rank-1 constraint with a tight and smooth approximation, we propose an efficient pilot optimization algorithm based on the majorization-minimization (MM) method. Simulations verify the advantages of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) systems rely on communication in narrow beams for directional and spatial multiplexing gains. A key challenge in realizing these systems is beam tracking, particularly in environments with high mobility and blockage. Additionally, in wide-area mmWave cellular systems, user equipment (UE) devices must often simultaneously track signals from multiple cells, since links to individual cells can be unreliable. Models of the channel dynamics across multiple cells and multiple beams are difficult to derive from first principles. In this work, we propose a fully data-driven approach based on a novel auto-encoder integrated long short term memory (LSTM) network, which predicts multiple beams from multiple cells, one time step in the future. The key innovation is to use an auto-encoder pre-processing step, which reduces the dimensionality of the input– the main challenge in multi-cell, multi-beam tracking. The prediction capability of the proposed network is verified and compared to common baseline predictors as well as popular machine learning (ML) based neural network predictors in realistic system-level simulations using a commercial ray-tracer. We observe that predictions from the proposed network, which utilizes auto-encoders for dimensionality reduction, offers significantly better best beam accuracy and lower beam misalignment loss than common baseline approaches. We also discuss outage prediction and proactive beam switching as applications of the multi-cell multi-beam prediction.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC), whose passive tags transmit information to readers through radio frequency (RF) signals in the air, has attracted much attention due to its promising prospects in green internet of things (IoTs). However, AmBC detection has faced a new challenge at the reader because the received signal is mainly a hybrid signal from direct link and backscatter link, which makes it difficult to detect symbols of the backscatter tag. To address this problem, in this paper, frequency diverse array (FDA) is utilized to transmit time-variant ambient signal, which can separate the two link signals received by the reader. We propose an adaptive dual-threshold detector by employing the time-variant characteristic of FDA RF signal, which is based on the position of the boundary backscatter tag defined. Specifically, the closed form expressions for maximum likelihood (ML) threshold and adaptive thresholds are derived, respectively. Furthermore, the computational complexities are analyzed. Finally, numerical results are presented to show that the proposed adaptive dual-threshold detector achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance than the conventional ML detector.}

In order to achieve a higher level of covertness, we propose a probabilistic accumulate-then-transmit (ATT) protocol, where the transmitter is able to adjust the prior probability conditioned on the available energy being sufficient, i.e., p\n, rather than setting p=1\nas in the traditional ATT protocol to maximize the system throughput. Then, we derive the warden’s minimum detection error probability and characterize the effective covert rate from the transmitter to the receiver to quantify the communication covertness and quality, respectively. The derived analytical results facilitate the joint optimization of the probability p\nand the information transmit power to maximize the communication covertness subject to a quality-of-service (QoS) requirement on communication. We further present the optimal design of a cable-powered covert communication (CP-CC) system as a benchmark for comparison. Our simulation shows that the proposed probabilistic ATT protocol (with a varying p\n) can achieve the covertness upper bound determined by the CP-CC system, while the traditional ATT protocol (with p=1\n) cannot, which confirms the benefits brought by the proposed probabilistic ATT protocol in covert communications.}

	abstract = {The deployment of future intelligent transportation systems is contingent upon seamless and reliable operation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can accurately execute near real-time control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional learning-based controllers, solely trained by each CAV’s local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by large-scale wireless connectivity is proposed for designing the autonomous controller of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in the FL training process and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless fading channels, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for the proposed algorithm to identify how fast the CAVs converge to using the optimal autonomous controller. In particular, the impacts of varying CAV participation in the FL process and diverse CAV data quality on the convergence of the proposed DFP algorithm are explicitly analyzed. Leveraging this analysis, an incentive mechanism based on contract theory is designed to improve the FL convergence speed. Simulation results using real vehicular data traces show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target CAV speed over time and under different traffic scenarios. Moreover, the results show that the proposed DFP algorithm has a much faster convergence compared to popular FL algorithms such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated proximal (FedProx). The results also validate the feasibility of the contract-theoretic incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism can improve the convergence speed of the DFP algorithm by 40% compared to the baselines.}

	abstract = {The application of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) depends on the knowledge of channel state information (CSI), and has been hindered by the heavy overhead of channel training, estimation, and feedback in fast-changing channels. This paper presents a new two-timescale beamforming approach to maximizing the average achievable rate (AAR) of IRS-assisted MIMO systems, where the IRS is configured relatively infrequently based on statistical CSI (S-CSI) and the base station precoder and power allocation are updated frequently based on quickly outdated instantaneous CSI (I-CSI). The key idea is that we first reveal the optimal small-timescale power allocation based on outdated I-CSI yields a water-filling structure. Given the optimal power allocation, a new mini-batch sampling (mbs)-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the large-timescale IRS configuration with reduced channel samples. Another important aspect is that we develop a model-driven PSO algorithm to optimize the IRS configuration, which maximizes a lower bound of the AAR by only using the S-CSI and eliminates the need of channel samples. The model-driven PSO serves as a dependable lower bound for the mbs-PSO. Simulations corroborate the superiority of the new two-timescale beamforming strategy to its alternatives in terms of the AAR and efficiency, with the benefits of the IRS demonstrated.}

Due to their automatic and energy-intensive operations, energy efficiency (EE) becomes very important, but there is a lack of investigation for EE of random access networks, which is the underlying platform for MTC. In this paper, we focus on the EE of random access orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access (OMA and NOMA) networks. We first construct mathematical models of their EE performances. Information-theoretic theories are employed to transform probabilistic decodability into deterministic form for OMA, and along with the unique features of NOMA decoding process, by pivoting around the decodability of a specific packet, we realize the modeling for NOMA. Then, based on the established models, exploiting the nature of random access networks, a complementary geometric programming approach is used for performance optimization. From our investigation, the following results are discovered: (1) NOMA has significant advantage over OMA in EE performance due to its strong data recovery; (2) to maximize the EE performance, devices with higher data rate should transmit more frequently, but with lower transmission power; (3) lower data rates have beneficial effects on EE.}

	abstract = {We consider online coordinated precoding design for downlink wireless network virtualization (WNV) in a multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network with imperfect channel state information (CSI). In our WNV framework, an infrastructure provider (InP) owns each base station that is shared by several service providers (SPs) oblivious of each other. The SPs design their precoders as virtualization demands for user services, while the InP designs the actual precoding solution to meet the service demands from the SPs. Our aim is to minimize the long-term time-averaged expected precoding deviation over MIMO fading channels, subject to both per-cell long-term and short-term transmit power limits. We propose an online coordinated precoding algorithm for virtualization, which provides a fully distributed semi-closed-form precoding solution at each cell, based only on the current imperfect CSI without any CSI exchange across cells. Taking into account the two-fold impact of imperfect CSI on both the InP and the SPs, we show that our proposed algorithm is within an\nO(δ)\ngap from the optimum over any time horizon, where\nδ\nis a CSI inaccuracy indicator. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm under two commonly used precoding techniques in a typical urban micro-cell network environment.}

Herein, the communicating devices, i.e., point transmitter (Tx) and passive receiver (Rx) can also move anomalously with the information-carrying molecule (ICM). In order to incorporate the anomalous diffusion phenomenon, the concept of rescaled-Brownian motion is explored. Two different scenarios, named point-to-point and multi-user MC systems, are considered for the analysis. First, considering the point-to-point scenario, the expressions for the channel impulse response (CIR) incorporating static and mobile Tx and Rx are derived. Further, the expressions for the peak time of CIR and the corresponding peak value are also derived. Furthermore, the point-to-point MC system is exploited in terms of bit-error-rate (BER), minimum BER, maximum mutual information, and throughput. A multi-user MC system is considered in the second scenario, and a molecular division multiple access (MDMA) method is used. The system is analyzed in terms of BER and throughput. Further, the system performance is optimized using two schemes known as min-max fairness for error probability and max-min fairness for throughput. Furthermore, we use best-to-best and best-to-worst assignment strategies to allocate different types of ICMs for each Rx. Subsequently, the optimal allocation for the number of ICMs is obtained when specific ICMs are assigned to all users/receivers for a two-user scenario. All the channel metrics are verified through particle-based and Monte-Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {Hybrid precoding is considered as a promising candidate to balance between the sum rate and the power and cost in the mmWave MIMO systems. However, it still suffers from huge power consumption due to considerable radio frequency links and phase shifters. In this study, an energy-efficient adaptive switching module (ASM) and phase modulation array (PMA) assisted hybrid precoding scheme is proposed, in which ASM is introduced to enhance the energy efficiency while PMA is employed to implement analog precoding to reduce power consumption. The ASM-PMA hybrid precoder design problem related to three matrix variables is formulated. Besides, the joint ASM-PMA hybrid precoder/combiner design at both transmitter and receiver is also investigated. Owing to the tough task of joint optimization of matrix variables, we can divide it into two sub-problems. Correspondingly, alternating optimization hybrid precoding (AOHP) algorithm is suggested to solve the PMA. Then, matching theory and convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms are respectively proposed to seek the optimal ASM. For the CNN based scheme, relaxed adaptive switching CNN (RAS-CNN) is designed to solve the binary integer problem in the offline train stage, while in the online deployment stage, ideal adaptive switching CNN (IAS-CNN) is adopted. Furthermore, CNN accepts estimated channel as input to yield robust precoding performance and lower computational complexity. Simulation results verify that, the proposed hybrid precoding can outperform other schemes in energy efficiency with satisfactory spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {The steady expansion of the number of wireless devices and the ubiquity of the networks give rise to various interesting challenges for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication systems. Particularly, the operators have to handle massive connectivity among Machine Type Devices (MTDs) and increasing demand for eMMB through limited spectrum resources. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been spotlighted as an emerging technology to meet the above-mentioned challenges. In this paper, we consider a densely deployed network in which users are divided into NOMA coalitions. Firstly, we model the power allocation problem as a differential game. Then, we extend the formulated game using a Mean Field Game (MFG) theoretic framework by considering the effect of the collective behavior of devices. Furthermore, we derive a distributed power control algorithm that enables the users to appropriately regulate their transmit power according to brief information received from the BS. Indeed, the analysis of the proposed approach is governed by the two fundamental Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Numerical results are presented to analyze the equilibrium behaviors of the proposed power control algorithm and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the formulated MFG compared to existing works in the literature.}

In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled MEC system serving multiple energy harvesting (EH) devices, where the energy and task data arrive at the users stochastically. Without any future knowledge of task data and energy arrivals, our objective is to design an online algorithm to jointly optimize the UAV energy and task processing rate, meanwhile satisfying the long-term data queue stability. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic programming and propose an online algorithm, named PLOT, based on perturbed Lyapunov optimization technique. In particular, PLOT resolves the coupling effect of sequential control actions, and converts the stochastic problem into per-slot deterministic optimization problem. For each per-slot problem, we design a low-complexity algorithm to solve it. We show that the PLOT algorithm can derive a feasible solution to the original problem and achieve an\n[O(1/V),O(V)]\ntrade-off between the system cost and the data queue length. Simulation results justify our analysis and demonstrate that the PLOT algorithm achieves better performance in terms of system utility and maintains queue stability that is not achieved by other benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technique in future intelligent wireless networks, which enables swift functional computation among distributed wireless devices (WDs) by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels. This paper studies a new hierarchical AirComp network over a large area, in which a set of intermediate relays are exploited to facilitate the massive data aggregation from a large number of WDs. Under this setup, we present a two-phase amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocol. In the first phase, the WDs simultaneously send their data to the relays, while in the second phase, the relays amplify the respectively received signals and concurrently forward them to the fusion center (FC) for aggregation. Our objective is to minimize the computational mean squared error (MSE) at the FC, by jointly optimizing the transmit coefficients of the WDs, the AF coefficients of the relays, and the de-noising factor of the FC, subject to their individual transmit power constraints. First, we consider the centralized design with global channel state information (CSI), in which the inter-relay signals can be exploited beneficially for data aggregation. In this case, we develop an alternating-optimization-based algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to the computational MSE minimization problem. The obtained solution shows that the phase of the transmit coefficient at each WD is opposite to that of the WD-relay-FC channel to ensure the signal phase alignment at the FC, and the transmit power of each WD/relay follows a regularized composite-channel-inversion structure to strike a balance between minimizing the signal-magnitude-misalignment-induced error and the noise-induced error. Next, to reduce the signaling overhead caused by the centralized design, we consider an alternative decentralized design with partial CSI, in which the relays and the FC make their own decisions by only requiring the channel power gain information across different relays. In this case, the relays and FC need to treat the inter-relay signals as harmful interference or noise. Accordingly, we optimize the transmit coefficients of the WDs associated with each relay, and the relay AF coefficients (together with the FC de-noising factor) in an iterative manner, which can be implemented efficiently in a decentralized way. Finally, numerical results show the fast convergence of the proposed centralized and decentralized designs. It is also shown that both designs achieve significant MSE performance gains over benchmark schemes without the joint optimization.}

	abstract = {Today’s growth in the volume of wireless devices coupled with the demand for data-intensive use cases has motivated the deployment of millimeter-wave (mmWave) small-cell networks. Although it is true that mmWave networks can carry a large volume of traffic, highly intermittent connectivity and the challenges related to installing many small-cell base stations (BSs) in urban geometry have impeded its progression into practical networks. To cope with these challenges, we present, in this paper, an approach to the mmWave BS deployment (site planning) problem, based on the minimum-deployment-cost criterion that is subject to user equipment (UE) outage constraints. Unlike the prior works, the proposed model captures the randomness of link blockage and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) statistics in mmWave networks. We formulate the minimum-cost deployment problem as large-scale integer nonlinear programming (INP). To deal with the coupled and combinatorial of the problem, the large-scale INP has approached to devise a suboptimal but efficient algorithm by decomposing it into two subproblems: (i) cell coverage optimization and (ii) minimum subset selection. We provide the solutions to each subproblem as well as theoretical justifications of them. Simulation results that illustrate UE outage guarantees of the proposed BS deployment method are presented. The results reveal that the proposed method uniquely distributes the macro-diversity orders that are distinct from other benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising learning paradigm that can tackle the increasingly prominent isolated data islands problem while keeping users’ data locally with privacy and security guarantees. However, FL could result in task-oriented data traffic flows over wireless networks with limited radio resources. To design communication-efficient FL, most of the existing studies employ the first-order federated optimization approach that has a slow convergence rate. This however results in excessive communication rounds for local model updates between the edge devices and edge server. To address this issue, in this paper, we instead propose a novel over-the-air second-order federated optimization algorithm to simultaneously reduce the communication rounds and enable low-latency global model aggregation. This is achieved by exploiting the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel to implement the distributed second-order optimization algorithm over wireless networks. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is further characterized, which reveals a linear-quadratic convergence rate with an accumulative error term in each iteration. We thus propose a system optimization approach to minimize the accumulated error gap by joint device selection and beamforming design. Numerical results demonstrate the system and communication efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.}

Wireless localization is a promising positioning service provider with the merits of extensive coverage and low cost but degrades in complex multipath propagation environments. This paper proposes a tensor-based algorithmic framework for localization in multipath environments by exploiting sparse spatio-temporal features of the received waveforms. Specifically, we construct low-rank tensors to characterize sparse spatio-temporal features, which can separate coherent multipath signals hinging on the uniqueness of tensor decomposition. Compared with related tensor-based works, our method does not rely on array configurations or signal structures, revealing its potential for broad use in multipath estimation. Position-related parameters are further extracted from tensor decomposition results, where a method based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is developed to retrieve distance information from the carrier part. Simulation results show that our method yields high-accuracy localization performance in complex multipath environments.}

It is the first 6G massive MIMO mmWave UAV channel model that considers the 3D continuously arbitrary trajectory of UAV in practice and models S-T-F non-stationarity of 6G UAV channels. In the proposed model, the calculation of channel impulse response (CIR) is developed, which considers the 3D time-varying accelerations and self-rotations of transceivers and clusters. To further model the S-T-F non-stationarity of UAV channels, a novel UAV-related birth-death (BD) algorithm based on correlated clusters is developed. In the developed algorithm, the impact of typical UAV-related parameters, e.g., the UAV’s moving direction, altitude, and time-varying velocity, on the setting of correlated clusters and the BD process is sufficiently considered. Important channel statistical properties are derived and investigated. Some numerical results and interesting observations are given, which can provide some assistance for the design of 6G massive MIMO mmWave UAV communication systems. Finally, the utility of the proposed model is verified by the close agreement between simulation results and ray-tracing-based results.}

Both Logistic Regression as well as a specifically designed algorithm are used to iteratively and rapidly obtain the equilibrium strategy. The conducted theoretical derivations and Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed approach can secure the IoT network with a limited amount of power and with a number of iterations that is much reduced compared to state-of-the-art techniques.}

	abstract = {Spectrum sharing in a cognitive radio system involves a secondary user updating transmit power for sharing spectrum with a primary user. The deep Q\n-network in the framework of deep reinforcement learning achieves transmit power control by a deep neural network for learning a nonlinear mapping from states to Q\n-values. Since a deep neural network is confronted with noise susceptibility, the deep Q\n-network produces deteriorative network parameters and volatile Q\n-values in the presence of contaminated states. In view of the positive effect of kernel least mean square (KLMS) for signal smoothing, we combine KLMS with the deep Q\n-network for smoothing network-generated outputs. Since an inappropriate step size of KLMS causes under-smoothing or over-smoothing issues, a weighting procedure using past Q\n-values is proposed for cooperating with KLMS. We assess the incremental ratio of the success rate of the smooth deep Q\n-network to that of the deep Q\n-network (RSR) in cognitive radios. Simulations show that RSR has averaged almost over 30% at the early stage of power control. In particular, the maximum RSR reaches almost over 80% or 180% at different scenarios of power control for the primary user. In addition, the smooth deep Q\n-network achieves an improved success rate in comparison with other algorithms.}

	abstract = {This work employs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a jammer to aid a covert communication from a transmitter Alice to a receiver Bob, where the UAV transmits artificial noise (AN) with random power to deliberately create interference to a warden Willie. In the considered system, the UAV’s trajectory is critical to the covert communication performance, since the AN transmitted by the UAV also generates interference to Bob. To maximize the system performance, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV’s trajectory and Alice’s transmit power. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex and is normally solved by a conventional iterative (CI) method, which requires multiple approximations based on Taylor expansions and an initialization on the UAV’s trajectory. In order to eliminate these requirements, this work, for the first time, develops a geometric (GM) method to solve the optimization problem. By analyzing the covertness constraint, the GM method decouples the joint optimization into optimizing the UAV’s trajectory and Alice’s transmit power separately. Our examination shows that the GM method can significantly outperform the CI method in terms of achieving a higher average covert rate and the complexity of the GM method is lower than that of the CI method.}

	abstract = {Wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN) has a wide range of applications in internet of things, where signal estimation is one of the network design objectives. Due to the existence of ambient noises, the recorded audio signals are inevitably corrupted, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which triggers the necessity of signal enhancement. As using all sensor measurements brings a large amount of data transmissions and computational cost, the narrowband sensor selection was proposed to choose an informative subset of sensors to perform noise reduction in the audio context. However, the resulting frequency-dependent selection status has to be switched across frequencies. In order to avoid the complicated switching operations, we consider frequency-invariant sensor selection in this work. We propose to minimize the total power consumption over the WASN by constraining the broadband SNR, which can be solved using broadband semi-definite optimization (BroadOpt) or narrowband voting (NaVo) approaches. In order to further reduce the time complexity, we propose two near-optimal greedy methods, including gradient removal (GradR) and weighted input SNR removal (SnrR). As comparison, we also show a broadband energy removal (EnergyR) method. The greedy methods remove one sensor at each iteration from the complete network until the performance constraint is not satisfied. Numerical results using a simulated large-scale WASN show that the greedy methods can achieve a comparable performance compared to the optimization based counterparts, while the corresponding time complexity is much lower. In general, the sensors around the target source and the fusion center are more likely to be selected.}

Our analysis assumes imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation under scenarios with and without line-of-sight (LoS) link between source and users. We derive exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability, throughput, and an upper bound for the ergodic capacity (EC). To provide further insights, an asymptotic analysis is carried out by considering two power settings at the source. It is also determined the optimal data rate factors of all users that maximize the system throughput. In addition, a deep learning framework (DLF) for EC prediction is designed. Numerical results show that: i) compared to the system without LoS link, the performance of the proposed system with LoS link can significantly improve when the number of reflecting elements at the RIS increases, and ii) the proposed system has superior performance compared to its orthogonal multiple access counterpart. Furthermore, our proposed DLF exhibits the lowest root-mean-square error and low execution-time among other approaches, verifying the effectiveness of this method for future analysis.}

Considering the limited computation capacity of the MEC server and the quality-of-service (QoS) and energy-causality constraints per IoT node, we propose two resource allocation schemes to maximize the total computation bits of all the IoT nodes and the system computation energy efficiency (EE), respectively, by jointly optimizing the computation frequency and time of the MEC server and each IoT node, the transmit power of the PB and each IoT node, and the BackCom power reflection coefficient and the time for energy harvesting (EH), BackCom, and AT of each IoT node. The non-convex computation bits maximization problem is transformed to a convex one by introducing a series of auxiliary variables and proof by contradiction, and then solved by the existing convex tools. The system computation EE maximization is a non-convex nonlinear programming problem. We propose a two-layer iterative algorithm to solve it optimally and devise a reduced-complexity iterative algorithm to solve it sub-optimally by leveraging the block coordinate decent technique. Computer simulations validate the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms and their superior performance over the benchmark schemes in terms of the computation bits or EE.}

It brings challenges to channel estimation due to the gap between the number of RF chains and antennas. To solve this problem, by analyzing and exploiting the unique power distribution (PD) of the beamspace channel (BC) that differs from the general sparse signals, we propose a PD-based estimation scheme for the sparse BC. Specifically, we transform the issue into the direction of arrival (DOA) and complex gain estimation for each multipath component after PD-based support estimation. Meanwhile, we propose a method to reduce error propagation. Besides, we provide a lower bound for the error of the proposed PD-based scheme and explain the parameters that influence the performance. Finally, the numerical simulation results confirm the advantage of the proposed method over the conventional channel estimation ones in terms of accuracy and overhead. Meanwhile, the simulation results also prove the proposed proposition about the lower bound of normalized mean squared error.}

Therefore, in this paper, we develop the energy-efficient cooperative offloading scheme for edge computing-enabled vehicular networks. We first establish a novel cooperative offloading model to multiple RSUs for given batch of moving vehicles, different from existing works that consider single vehicle only or static users. Then, we consider the total energy minimization by optimizing the task splitting ratio, computation resource, and communication resource, which is a challenging non-convex problem, and provide optimal solutions for multi-vehicle case and single-vehicle case, respectively. Furthermore, we extend our proposed scheme to the one for a more realistic scenario (i.e., online scenario), where batches of vehicles sequentially approach the RSUs. Finally, through numerical results, the impact of network parameters on the total energy consumption is analyzed, and we verify that our proposed solution consumes lower energy than baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique that supports high-level connectivity. Through the combination of SCMA and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, MIMO-SCMA schemes are capable of enhancing the overall spectral efficiency. This paper proposes novel MIMO-SCMA designs for both uplink and downlink Rayleigh fading channels. Rather than directly combining the SCMA and spatial multiplexing techniques presented in the previous literature, the proposed designs consider not only the frequency or time diversity, but also simultaneously include space diversity. Codebook design criteria for different transmission scenarios are respectively investigated, and a low-complexity codebook design algorithm is proposed based on the cross-entropy method. In addition, since the new designs suggest a dense factor graph, conventional message-passing algorithm (MPA)-based detectors are less suitable. Consequently, low-complexity MIMO-SCMA codeword detectors based on depth-first and breadth-first tree-search algorithms are respectively investigated. It is shown that the overall designs are able to simultaneously achieve a higher diversity order, enhanced BER results, and lower levels of detection complexity for both uplink and downlink scenarios, when compared to conventional MIMO-SCMA schemes.}

	abstract = {The beamforming technique is applied in 5G NR systems to enhance the receiving signal power, especially for millimeter-wave communications. Beamforming complicates the paging procedure and brings extra overhead to the transmission of paging messages. In order to cover the serving area, the gNB should transmit broadcast control messages via beam sweeping. However, beam sweeping is inefficient for paging operation. In this work, an intelligent directional paging framework is proposed. The proposed beam-based paging list enables the gNB to page UEs flexibly. With the implicit gathering of the UE information, the gNB can make intelligent paging decisions without beam sweeping, decrease the paging resources consumption, and optimize the system paging delay. The proposed Markov chain based analytical model is validated by the simulation results. The results show that the proposed schemes outperform the NR baseline in successful paging rate, delay, and system capacity.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), mission-critical vehicular services such as vehicle platooning, safety alarming, and remote driving play a key role in the future ITS. In order to support these emerging services, low-latency and high reliability transmission should be ensured. In the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G New Radio (NR) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, it is very difficult to meet the latency requirement since group of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols are processed in a form of the resource block. In this paper, we propose a novel low-latency packet transmission scheme for V2X systems, referred to as partial sample transmission (PST). In PST, we map the transmit information into subcarrier positions and then decode it using a small fraction of received samples at the receiver. To perform the efficient decoding, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based PST decoding. From the numerical evaluations on the V2X system, we demonstrate that the proposed PST technique outperforms conventional transmission schemes in terms of the block error rate (BLER) and the signaling latency.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has received substantial attention, given its ability to aggregate massive amounts of data from distributed wireless devices (WDs). However, the computation accuracy at the fusion center (FC) may be severely affected by receiving data corrupted by the poor channel conditions. To mitigate this issue, we consider the employment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in the AirComp system considered for improving the quality of received data, and hence improve the computation accuracy. However, most previous contributions on RIS-assisted AirComp systems only employ a single RIS in the resultant single-RIS-assisted (SRIS-assisted) AirComp systems. We develop this concept further for mitigating the deleterious channel effects by conceiving a double-RIS-assisted (DRIS-assisted) AirComp system, where one of the RISs is located near the WDs and the other in the vicinity of the FC. We theoretically prove that the DRIS-assisted AirComp system outperforms its SRIS-assisted counterpart in terms of the resultant computation mean-squared-error (MSE). Furthermore, we propose a pair of algorithms for jointly optimizing the transmit power at the WDs, the receive beamforming vector at the FC, and the passive beamforming matrices at the RISs for minimizing the computational MSE. Specifically, the transmit power is updated by exploiting the Lagrange duality method, while the receive beamforming vector is optimized by utilizing the first-order optimality condition. Furthermore, a pair of techniques are developed for optimizing the passive beamforming matrices at the RISs based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and penalty-duality-decomposition (PDD), respectively. Both the complexity and the convergence of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided for quantifying the overall performance of the resultant DRIS-assisted AirComp system.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a millimeter wave multiple-input single-output tracking system, where the time-varying angle of departure (AoD) is assumed to change following a discrete state Markov process. Depending on whether the associated AoD transition function is available or not, we propose two different training beam sequence design approaches. Specifically, in the case when the AoD transition function is available, we leverage the maximum a posteriori criterion to estimate the updated AoD in each beam tracking period. Since it is infeasible to derive an explicit expression for the resultant estimation error rate, we turn to its upper bound, which possesses a closed-form expression and is therefore used as the objective function to optimize the training beam sequence. Considering the complicated objective function and the unit modulus constraints imposed by the analog phase shifters, we resort to a particle swarm algorithm to solve the formulated optimization problem. In the case when the AoD transition function is unavailable, we turn to the maximum likelihood criterion for AoD estimation. To cope with the unknown AoD transition function, we reformulate the beam tracking problem as a partially observable Markov decision process problem and develop an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework to obtain an efficient training beam sequence design. Numerical results demonstrate superiorities of the proposed training beam sequence design approaches for both two cases.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth in scale and complexity of mobile applications fosters the development of the coded edge computing paradigm. By exploiting the redundancy in the encoded subtasks, coded edge computing enables collaborative transmission of multiple edge nodes and is promising for distributed computing in wireless fading environments. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, due to challenges arising from the selection of the coding parameters, offloading strategy design for coded edge computing in general fading environments still remains open. With this consideration, the coded offloading problem is studied in this work and a delay-optimal coded offloading scheme is proposed. In particular, when the offloaded tasks are encoded by\n(k,r)\nlinear codes, transmission diversity gains can be obtained by performing edge node selection to mitigate fading. However, the corresponding optimization problem turns out to be a highly non-trivial non-linear mixed-integer programming. To this end, through in-depth analysis based on order statistics, it is found that the average processing delay of the offloaded tasks admits a favorable\nV\n-structure with respect to the coding parameter\nr\n, under arbitrary fading distribution. This key theoretic result allows us to efficiently solve the original problem using monotonic optimization. Simulations are conducted to validate our analysis and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave communication is widely seen as a promising option to increase the capacity of vehicular networks, where it is expected that connected cars will soon need to transmit and receive large amounts of data. Due to harsh propagation conditions, mmWave systems resort to narrow beams to serve their users, and such beams need to be configured according to traffic demand and its spatial distribution, as well as interference. In this work, we address the beam management problem, considering an urban vehicular network composed of gNBs. We first build an accurate, yet tractable, system model and formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the total network data rate while accounting for the stochastic nature of the network scenario. Then we develop a graph-based model capturing the main system characteristics and use it to develop a belief propagation algorithmic framework, called CRAB, that has low complexity and, hence, can effectively cope with large-scale scenarios. We assess the performance of our approach under real-world settings and show that, in comparison to state-of-the-art alternatives, CRAB provides on average a 50% improvement in the amount of data transferred by the single gNBs and up to 30% better user coverage.}

This assumption, although suboptimal in a general multiuser setup, allows for a significant complexity reduction when optimizing the environment and, despite its simplicity, is able to provide high communication rates. We derive a set of asymptotic results providing insight on the system behavior when both the number of antennas at the transmitter and the meta-surfaces area grow large. For the optimization we propose an algorithm based on the Newton-Raphson method and a simpler, yet effective, heuristic approach based on a map associating meta-surfaces and users.

The conventional precoding design involves a two-step process of first estimating the high-dimensional channel, then designing the precoders based on such estimate. This two-step process is, however, not necessarily optimal. This paper shows that by using a learning approach to design the analog sensing and the hybrid downlink precoders directly from the received pilots without the intermediate high-dimensional channel estimation, the overall system performance can be significantly improved. Training a neural network to design the analog and digital precoders simultaneously is, however, difficult. Further, such an approach is not generalizable to systems with different number of users. In this paper, we develop a simplified and generalizable approach that learns the uplink sensing matrix and downlink analog precoder using a deep neural network that decomposes on a per-user basis, then designs the digital precoder based on the estimated low-dimensional equivalent channel. Numerical comparisons show that the proposed methodology results in significantly less training overhead and leads to an architecture that generalizes to various system settings.}

Random access (RA) system of wireless cellular networks, e.g., 5G New Radio (NR), based on S-ALOHA system should cope with ever-growing IoT traffic. This work proposes S-ALOHA system with time offsets (TOs), where one slot consists of K TOs and one packet transmission time. The length of the overall TOs is a fraction of a packet transmission time. In the system users (re)transmit to the boundary of a TO randomly selected. This enables the base station (BS) to inform the users of who transmits the first and the last packets in the slot with collision so that the two users can retransmit successfully in the following two slots respectively. Our throughput analysis compared to simulations shows that adopting even with three and four TOs surpasses the throughput limit of S-ALOHA system without TOs. Additionally, we propose two Bayesian-optimized backoff algorithms for S-ALOHA system with TOs, with which users can apply throughput-optimal (re)transmission probability or uniform backoff window even in unsaturated traffic scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed backoff algorithms can achieve the throughput close to an ideal system and drastically reduce the access delay compared to S-ALOHA system.}

This paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV dispatched to collect data from marine buoys. We aim to minimize the UAV’s energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV’s flight trajectory subject to wind effect. The conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) method can provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered wind effect, while the computational/trajectory complexity both become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose a new cyclical trajectory design framework with tailored initialization algorithm that can handle arbitrary data volume efficiently, as well as a hybrid offline-online (HO2) design that leverages convex stochastic programming (CSP) offline based on wind statistics, and refines the solution by adapting online to real-time wind velocity. Numerical results show that our optimized trajectory can better adapt to various setups with different target data volume and buoys’ topology as well as various wind speed/direction/variance compared with benchmark schemes. In particular, our proposed HO2 design can effectively adapt to random wind variations with feasible and robust online operation, and proactively exploit the wind for further energy savings in both single-buoy and multi-buoy scenarios.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) can provide better error performance than orthogonal frequency division modulation in the high-speed scenario. However, the two-dimensional convolution between the information-bearing symbols and the channel response in the delay-Doppler domain induces high-complexity detection, which hinders the implementation of the OTFS. In this paper, expectation propagation (EP) is introduced in the OTFS system to improve the reliability compared to the message passing approaches. The low-complexity EP detection with a log-linear order is proposed by observing the sparsity and the block quasi-banded matrix structure of the time-domain matrix. The exploitation of the lower-upper factorization for the banded matrix, the forward or the back substitution algorithm for the lower or the upper triangular matrices reduces the complexity of the large-scale matrix inversion involved in the EP detection from a cubic order to a linear order. The error performance of the proposed scheme is further analyzed by utilizing the state evolution and discussed under the different frame sizes. Moreover, the proposed low-complexity detector is then explored together with the likelihood decoder in an iterative manner to further improve the reliability of the proposed receiver. Finally, the better error performance and the lower computational complexity of the proposed receiver are validated by the numerical results.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform based millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO systems are capable of achieving high data rates in high-mobility scenarios. Hence, transceivers are designed for both analog beamforming (AB) and hybrid beamforming (HB), where we commence by deriving the delay-Doppler (DD)-domain input-output relationship considering a delay-Doppler-angular domain channel model. Subsequently, a novel two-stage procedure is developed for transmit beamformer (TBF)/ precoder (TPC) and receiver combiner (RC) design, and for estimating the DD-domain’s equivalent channel state information (CSI). The key feature of the proposed framework is that the RF TBF/ TPC and RC design maximizes the directional beamforming gains. It is also demonstrated that the low-dimensional baseband CSI of the DD-domain becomes sparse for mmWave-AB MIMO OTFS systems, and block-sparse for mmWave-HB MIMO OTFS systems. Subsequently, Bayesian learning (BL) and block-sparse BL (BS-BL) solutions are developed for improved CSI estimation. We also derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bounds (BCRLB) for benchmarking the mean-squared-error (MSE) of the CSI estimates. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the improved efficacy of the proposed transceiver designs and confirm the enhanced CSI estimation performance of the BL-based schemes over other competing sparse signal recovery schemes.}

	abstract = {We investigate the joint uplink-downlink configuration of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for multi-user frequency-division-duplexing (FDD) and time-division-duplexing (TDD) systems. This is motivated in FDD since uplink and downlink transmissions occur simultaneously and hence an IRS must be jointly configured for both transmissions. In TDD, while a joint design is not strictly necessary, it can significantly reduce feedback overhead, power consumption, and configuration periods associated with updating the IRS. To compute the trade-off between uplink and downlink rates achieved by a joint design, a weighted-sum problem is formulated and optimized using a developed block-coordinate descent algorithm. The resulting uplink-downlink trade-off regions are investigated by numerical simulation to gain insights into different scenarios. In all FDD scenarios and some TDD scenarios, the jointly optimized design significantly outperforms the fixed-uplink (fixed-downlink) heuristic of using the IRS configuration optimized for uplink (downlink) to assist downlink (uplink) transmissions. Moreover, the joint design substantially bridges the gap to the individual design upper bound of allowing different IRS configurations in uplink and downlink. Otherwise, in the remaining TDD scenarios, the fixed-uplink and fixed-downlink designs nearly achieve the individual design performance and substantially reduce overhead and/or complexity compared to the optimized joint design and individual design.}

	abstract = {The advanced Internet of Things (IoT) enables more and more interactions between people and machines in the emerging applications, which rely on real-time communication and computing. However, the limited battery capacity and low computing capacity of IoT nodes can hardly support high-performance computing applications. The integration of wireless power transmission (WPT) and mobile edge computing (MEC) is a feasible and promising solution to address the energy shortage and computing capacity limitation of IoT nodes by harvesting radio frequency signal’s energy and offloading the nodes’ computation tasks to edge computing servers (ECSs). In this work, we focus on the wireless powered MEC network with an ECS and multiple edge devices (EDs), and study the joint optimization of WPT duration, transmission time allocation of each ED and partial offloading decision to maximize the sum computation rate. First, we formulate this as a non-convex problem which is hard to solve. Second, to conquer this problem, we decompose the original offloading problem into the sub-problem of optimizing the offloading time allocation among EDs and the proportion of harvested energy allocated for offloading at each ED under a given WPT duration and the top-problem of optimizing the WPT duration. Finally, we design an online DRL-based framework where one DNN together with its exploration strategy and training strategy is adopted to learn the near-optimal WPT duration and an efficient optimal algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problem. Numerical results show that the DRL-based offloading algorithm achieves the near-maximal sum computation rate while greatly reducing the processing time by at least three orders of magnitude compared with using the solver CVX for the sub-problem and the DNN for the top-problem.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a promising way to build programmable wireless transmission environments. Owing to the massive number of controllable reflecting elements on the surface, RIS is capable of providing considerable passive beamforming gains. At present, most related works mainly consider the modeling, design, performance analysis and optimization of single-RIS-assisted systems. Although there are a few of works that investigate multiple RISs individually serving their associated users, the cooperation among multiple RISs is not well considered as yet. To fill the gap, this paper studies a cooperative beamforming design for multi-RIS-assisted communication systems, where multiple RISs are deployed to assist the downlink communications from a base station to its users. To do so, we first model the general channel from the base station to the users for arbitrary number of reflection links. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of all users. Analysis shows that the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and the interactions among the decision variables. To solve it effectively, we first decouple the problem into three disjoint subproblems. Then, by introducing appropriate auxiliary variables, we derive the closed-form expressions for the decision variables and propose a low-complexity cooperative beamforming algorithm. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through comparison with various baseline methods. Furthermore, these results also unveil that, for the sum rate maximization, distributing the reflecting elements among multiple RISs is superior to deploying them at one single RIS.}

The integrity of AirFL is vulnerable due to the obscurity of the local models aggregated over the air. This paper presents a novel framework to balance the accuracy and integrity of AirFL, where multi-antenna devices and base station (BS) are jointly optimized with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The key contributions include a new and non-trivial problem jointly considering the model accuracy and integrity of AirFL, and a new framework that transforms the problem into tractable subproblems. Under perfect channel state information (CSI), the new framework minimizes the aggregated model’s distortion and retains the local models’ recoverability by optimizing the transmit beamformers of the devices, the receive beamformers of the BS, and the RIS configuration in an alternating manner. Under imperfect CSI, the new framework delivers a robust design of the beamformers and RIS configuration to combat non-negligible channel estimation errors. As corroborated experimentally, the novel framework can achieve comparable accuracy to the ideal FL while preserving local model recoverability under perfect CSI, and improve the accuracy when the number of receive antennas is small or moderate under imperfect CSI.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology for enhancing the computation capacities and features of mobile users by offloading complex computation tasks to the edge servers. However, mobility poses great challenges on delivering reliable MEC service required for latency-critical applications. First, mobility management has to tackle the dynamics of both user’s location changes and task arrivals that vary in different timescales. Second, user mobility could induce service migration, leading to reliability loss due to the migration delay. In this paper, we propose a two-timescale mobility management framework by joint control of service migration and transmission power to address the above challenges. Specifically, the service migration operates at a large timescale to support user mobility in the multi-cell network, while the power control is performed at a small timescale for real-time task offloading. Their joint control is formulated as an optimization problem aiming at the long-term mobile energy minimization subject to the reliability requirement of computation offloading. To solve the problem, we propose a Lyapunov-based framework to decompose the problem into different timescales, based on which a low-complexity two-timescale online algorithm is developed by exploiting the problem structure. The proposed online algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimal via theoretical analysis, and is further developed to accommodate the multiuser management. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the energy and reliability performance.}

Employing the semi-blind amplify-and-forward protocol, we derive the cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio. By applying the derived statistics, exact expressions for the outage probability (OP), average bit error rate (BER), and average channel capacity are obtained. In order to attain useful physical insights, asymptotic OP and average BER expressions are also presented. Based on them, the diversity gain is determined, which is shown to depend on channel fading and pointing errors of both links. In addition, by taking into account the hardware impairments, the OP of the non-ideal hardware system is derived. Moreover, the analysis is extended to multi-antenna scenarios and the asymptotic OP is obtained. Finally, illustrative numerical results are plotted and it can be observed that the path loss, channel fading, pointing errors and hardware impairments lead to a considerable degradation in system performance.}

The primary network (PN) consists of a single transmitter-receiver pair, and the secondary network (SN) is an NCC system with N users, M relays, and a single destination. The relays employ decode-and-forward (DF) protocol and use network coding (NC). We study the performance of the SN under two types of power constraints: i) the combined peak interference power constraint on the PN and maximum transmit power constraint at the SN; and ii) the single peak interference power constraint on the PN. For the SN, an exact closed-form expression and an asymptotically tight end-to-end outage probability are derived, and the diversity order and coding gain are quantified. Compared to the existing literature, the proposed CRN NCC has four main distinguishable features: i) it applies to general CRN NCC network settings with an arbitrary number of users and relays; ii) it considers general relay selection mechanism and independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Nakagami-m fading channels; iii) it assumes secondary-to-primary and primary-to-secondary interference links; and iv) it provides a generalization of previous work and includes existing results in the literature as special cases.}

A key challenge for the design of DD plane MC modulation is to investigate whether a realizable pulse orthogonal with respect to the DD plane’s fine resolutions exists or not. To this end, we first indicate that a feasible DD plane MC modulation is essentially a type of staggered multitone modulation. Then, analogous to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, we propose an orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation, and design the corresponding transmit pulse. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed transmit pulse is orthogonal with respect to the DD plane’s resolutions and therefore a realizable DD plane orthogonal pulse does exist. The orthogonality of this particular pulse significantly eases the derivation of the ODDM’s DD domain channel input-output relation, and yields a channel matrix with an elegant block-circulant-like structure. We demonstrate that the ODDM outperforms the OTFS in terms of out-of-band emission and bit error rate, by achieving perfect coupling between the modulated signal and the DD channel.}

However, it poses great challenges to train FL fast enough with limited communication and computing resources of mobile edge devices. Motivated by recent development in ultra fast wireless transmissions and promising advances in artificial intelligence (AI) computing hardware of mobile devices, in this paper, we propose a time efficient FL over future mobile edge devices, called dynamic batch sizes assisted federated learning (DBFL) with convergence guarantee. The DBFL allows batch sizes to increase dynamically during training, which can unleash the computing potential of GPU’s parallelism for on- device training and effectively leverage the fast wireless transmissions (WiFi-6, 5G, 6G, etc.) of mobile edge devices. Furthermore, based on the derived DBFL’s convergence bound, we develop a batch size control scheme to minimize the total time consumption of FL over mobile edge devices, which trade-offs the “talking”, i.e., communication time, and “working”, i.e., computing time, by adjusting the incremental factor appropriately. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed DBFL algorithm and demonstrate that our scheme outperforms existing time efficient FL approaches in terms of the total time consumption in various settings.}

In this context, spectrum slicing of the shared radio resources is a critical task to guarantee the performance of each service. We analyze a downlink communication serving two types of traffic: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Due to the nature of low-latency traffic, the base station knows the channel state information (CSI) of the eMBB users while having statistical CSI for the URLLC users. We study the power minimization problem employing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. Based on this analysis, we propose a lookup table-based approach and a block coordinated descent (BCD) algorithm. We show that the BCD is optimal for the URLLC power allocation. The numerical results show that NOMA leads to lower power consumption than OMA, except when the average channel gain of the URLLC user is very high. For the latter case, the optimal approach depends on the channel condition of the eMBB user. Even when OMA attains the best performance, the gap with NOMA is negligible, showing the capability of NOMA to reduce power consumption in practically every condition.}

However, traditional FL algorithms are based on an event-triggered aggregation, which suffers from stragglers and communication overhead issues. To address these issues, in this paper, we present a time-triggered FL algorithm (TT-Fed) over wireless networks, which is a generalized form of classic synchronous and asynchronous FL. Taking the constrained resource and unreliable nature of wireless communication into account, we jointly study the user selection and bandwidth optimization problem to minimize the FL training loss. To solve this joint optimization problem, we provide a thorough convergence analysis for TT-Fed. Based on the obtained analytical convergence upper bound, the optimization problem is decomposed into tractable sub-problems with respect to each global aggregation round, and finally solved by our proposed online search algorithm. Simulation results show that compared to asynchronous FL (FedAsync) and FL with asynchronous user tiers (FedAT) benchmarks, our proposed TT-Fed algorithm improves the converged test accuracy by up to 12.5% and 5%, respectively, under highly imbalanced and non-IID data, while substantially reducing the communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Optimal MIMO detection is one of the most computationally challenging tasks in wireless systems. We show that new analog computing approaches, such as Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs), are promising candidates for performing near-optimal MIMO detection. We propose a novel regularized Ising formulation for MIMO detection that mitigates a common error floor issue in the naive approach and evolve it into a regularized, Ising-based tree search algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance. By means of numerical simulation using the Rayleigh fading channel model, we show that in principle, a MIMO detector based on a high-speed Ising machine (such as a CIM implementation optimized for latency) would allow a higher transmitter antennas (users)-to-receiver antennas ratio and thus increase the overall throughput of the cell by a factor of two or more for massive MIMO systems. Our methods create an opportunity to operate wireless systems using more aggressive modulation and coding schemes and hence achieve high spectral efficiency: for a 16\\times 16\nMIMO system, we estimate around 2.5\\times\nmore throughput in the mid-SNR regime (≈12 dB) and 2\\times\nmore throughput in the high-SNR regime (>20 dB) as compared to the industry standard, a Minimum-Mean Square Error (MMSE) linear decoder.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a potential technology for 5G beyond and attracted tremendous research attention. However, channel estimation for RIS-aided systems is still a critical challenge due to the excessive amount of parameters in the cascaded channel. The existing compressive sensing (CS)-based RIS estimation schemes only adopt incomplete sparsity, which induces redundant pilot consumption. In this paper, we analyze and exploit the specific triple-structured sparsity of the cascaded channel, i.e., the common column sparsity, structured row sparsity after offset compensation and the common offsets among all users. Furthermore, a novel on-grid Multi-user Triple-Structured-Compressive-Sensing simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (MTSCS-SOMP) algorithm along with an enhanced super-resolution (gridless) generalized iterative reweighted (MTSCS-IR) scheme are successively proposed. The former is practical and can be easily employed with low computational complexity, and the latter is further proposed to handle the severe power leakage problem encountered in mmWave channel estimations. Besides, we extend the sparsity property and algorithms from uniform linear array (ULA) configuration to uniform planar array (UPA), by transforming cascaded channel from matrix to tensor. Simulation results show that our approaches can significantly reduce pilot overhead over 50% and achieve enhanced performance on estimation accuracy.}

	abstract = {Position-aided beam selection methods have been shown to be an effective approach to achieve high beamforming gain while limiting the overhead and latency of initial access in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Most research in the area, however, has focused on vehicular applications, where the orientation of the user terminal (UT) is mostly fixed at each position of the environment. This paper proposes a location- and orientation-based beam selection method to enable context information (CI)-based beam alignment in applications where the UT can take arbitrary orientation at each location. We propose three different network structures, with different amounts of trainable parameters that can be used with different training dataset sizes. A professional 3-dimensional ray tracing tool is used to generate datasets for an IEEE standard indoor scenario. Numerical results show the proposed networks outperform a CI-aided benchmark such as the generalized inverse fingerprinting (GIFP) method as well as hierarchical beam search as a non-CI-based approach. Moreover, compared to the GIFP method, the proposed deep learning-based beam selection shows higher robustness to different line-of-sight blockage probability in the training and test datasets and lower sensitivity to inaccuracies in the position and orientation information.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the information freshness of short-packet communication in wireless networks, where a base station (BS) sends time-sensitive status updates to users via adaptive multiple access technology. To improve the Age of Information (AoI) performance of the network, the BS adaptively switches among non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and cooperative NOMA with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Specifically, the BS carefully decides the appropriate multiple access technology and the corresponding power allocation according to the state of the network to optimize the expected weighted sum of AoI (EWSAoI) of the system. To this end, we first analyze the EWSAoI of these three multiple access technologies and propose an adaptive NOMA/OMA/cooperative-SWIPT-NOMA transmission scheme. In specific, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and develop an optimal policy for the BS to decide whether to use NOMA, OMA or cooperative-SWIPT-NOMA for downlink transmission based on the current state of the network. We further prove the existence of optimal stationary and deterministic policy. Furthermore, to reduce the computation complexity, a suboptimal adaptive policy based on Lyapunov Optimization is also devised, which can achieve near optimal performance according to our simulation results. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed policies, which provide useful insights for practical system designs.}

	abstract = {The present article proposes a novel adaptive algorithm with an optimal diagonal step size matrix for multi-dimensional channel principal component tracking in two dimensional massive multiple-input and multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems. First, we prove that the weighted subspace algorithm globally converges to the stationary stochastic process’ major eigenvectors. Then, using the maximum likelihood criterion, we optimize the weight coefficient matrix and derive the convergent condition for the step size range in order to maintain the algorithm stability. To accelerate the convergence, we initially suggest the diagonal step size matrix for multi-dimensional eigenvector tracking. Simultaneously, an optimal diagonal step size matrix is derived, which not only accelerates the convergence speed distinctively but also improves the tracking of multi-dimensional eigenvectors. Moreover, the transient behavior during the adaptation process is investigated in a straight-forward way and the relationship between the convergence time constant and the eigenvalues of the received signals is uncovered. Finally, simulations reveal that the proposed approach outperforms established algorithms such as Oja ^{\\prime}\\text{s}\n, Delmas and gradient descent algorithms. This approach establishes a sound foundation for tracking channel state information in M-MIMO systems with great mobility.}

In this paper, we design a modified phase diversity algorithm (MPDA)-based wavefront sensor to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of distorted OAM wavefront information. Aiming to further strike a compelling trade-off between AO system complexity and compensation accuracy, we first construct a novel AO system that applies a quickly and electronically controlled focus-tunable lens (FTL). It decontaminates distorted OAM signaling beams while having a low systemic complexity and superior convergence performance. Furthermore, we propose the 3-modified phase diversity algorithm (3-MPDA) AO scheme relying upon a Fourier intensity and two defocused intensities as the prior information, which beneficially balances the compensation effect and the number of defocused intensities and exhibits good noise robustness against charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. In summary, this paper provides new insight for designing AO schemes with high compensation performance in communication links.}

Considering oblique LoS uniform linear arrays, we first derive the rank-deficient and orthogonal conditions for the LoS MIMO channel matrices. With this discovery, the topology of high spatial-resolution on one side of the link is shown with a wide full-rank-channel guarantee interval over distance and direction variations. Additionally, to reduce the implementation costs and power consumption, we propose to use low amplitude-resolution quantizers at the side of high spatial-resolution. With numerical evaluations on systems having few-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), the proposed system design is shown to simultaneously achieve a higher spectrum efficiency and higher energy efficiency compared to a conventional single-stream high-amplitude-resolution over a wide signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) range. Furthermore, we investigate channel equalization under the extreme case of using 1-bit ADCs. After providing a new viewpoint on the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm from constrained Bethe free energy minimization, our simulations on bit-error-rates show that the GAMP algorithm can significantly reduce the performance degradation due to coarse quantization and can significantly outperform the Bussgang decomposition based linear minimum-mean-square-error estimator, especially at high SNRs.}

We derive both the lower and upper bounds on the secrecy capacity in the context of both the symbol- and block-based transmission policies. To enhance the secrecy performance relying on block transmission policy, we propose a low-complexity amplitude scaling (AS) scheme by scaling the amplitudes of different symbols in each block to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. We further provide the upper bound on the optimal secrecy rate achieved by precoding for the sake of validating the effectiveness of the proposed AS scheme. Numerical results suggest that the secrecy performance is severely degraded by inter-symbol interference (ISI) imposed by multipath reflections, which yet can be alleviated by long-block based transmission. Moreover, the proposed AS scheme can enhance the secrecy performance significantly and achieve a secrecy rate very close to the optimal solution.}

The traditional algorithms including the zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm failed to achieve a satisfactory trade-off between complexity and performance. In this paper, leveraging on the power of deep learning, we propose a low-complexity precoding design framework for MU-MIMO systems. The key idea is to transform the MIMO precoding problem into the multiple-input single-output precoding problem, where the optimal precoding structure can be obtained in closed-form. A customized deep neural network is designed to fit the mapping from the channels to the precoding matrix. In addition, the technique of input dimensionality reduction, network pruning, and recovery module compression are used to further improve the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the extension to the practical MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system is studied. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity precoding scheme achieves similar performance as the WMMSE algorithm with very low computational complexity.}

Depending on the availability of the eavesdropping channel state information (CSI), both the full CSI and statistical CSI of the eavesdropper are considered. For the full eavesdropping CSI scenario, we adopt the adaptive-rate wiretap code scheme with the aim of maximizing minimum secrecy capacity subject to the successive interference cancellation decoding order constraints. To proceed, we propose an alternating hybrid beamforming (AHB) algorithm to jointly optimize the receive beamforming, transmit power, and reflection/transmission coefficients. While for the statistical eavesdropping CSI scenario, the constant-rate wiretap code scheme is employed to minimize the maximum secrecy outage probability (SOP) subject to the quality-of-service requirements of legitimate users. Then, we derive the exact SOP expression under the constant-rate coding strategy and develop an extended AHB algorithm for the joint secrecy beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Moreover, some useful guidance about the quantification of phase shift/amplitude and the deployment of STAR-RIS is provided.}

Due to the dense deployment of base stations (BSs) and the complicated associations between BSs and E2E network slices (NSs) in the scenario, the handoff problem faces challenges of the huge system state space and handoff action space and the considerable communication overhead. In this paper, we take these issues into account and consider a distributed E2E NS handoff decision framework in the HetNet. A decentralized Markov decision process (DEC-MDP)-based model is formulated for the distributed E2E NS handoff problem, and the jointly observable and random characteristics of the DEC-MDP are analyzed. To obtain a theoretical performance reference, the original distributed E2E NS handoff problem is simplified, and a Nash equilibrium-based performance bound is given. More practically, the multi-agent double deep Q-network-based distributed handoff (MA-DDQN-DH) algorithm with the centralized training and decentralized executing framework is proposed. Simulation results show that the Nash equilibrium-based performance bound is reasonable, and the proposed MA-DDQN-DH algorithm performs well in the comparison.}

	abstract = {The spectrum scarcity in the radio frequency (RF) communication in indoor environments motivates the integration of an alternative technology like visible light communication (VLC) with the existing RF architecture that results in a hybrid RF/VLC network. While VLC helps offloading the congested RF spectrum by offering capacity-per-area improvements, the resulting heterogeneity and narrow coverage areas of optical base stations (BSs) impose several challenges for user mobility such as unnecessary handovers. To help addressing these challenges, in this paper, we derive the mean and the distribution of sojourn time in RF/VLC hybrid networks. The mathematical analysis conducted in this paper makes use of the tools from stochastic geometry and abstracting the BSs’ locations via two independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs). Since PPP modeling is yet to be well established for RF/VLC hybrid networks, we compare the PPP based analytical results to those obtained for an actual deployment, a Matérn hard-core point process (MHCPP) based deployment, and a deterministic square lattice deployment of VLC luminaries. Furthermore, we utilize the sojourn time distribution to calculate the unnecessary handover probability. Our numerical results show the interplay between the sojourn time and the receiver field of view as a function of BS density and they highlight the cost of BS densification in terms of unnecessary handovers.}
