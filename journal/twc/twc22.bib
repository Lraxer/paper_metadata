	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a powerful distributed machine learning framework where a server aggregates models trained by different clients without accessing their private data. Hierarchical FL, with a client-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, can effectively leverage both the cloud server’s access to many clients’ data and the edge servers’ closeness to the clients to achieve a high communication efficiency. Neural network quantization can further reduce the communication overhead during model uploading. To fully exploit the advantages of hierarchical FL, an accurate convergence analysis with respect to the key system parameters is needed. Unfortunately, existing analysis is loose and does not consider model quantization. In this paper, we derive a tighter convergence bound for hierarchical FL with quantization. The convergence result leads to practical guidelines for important design problems such as the client-edge aggregation and edge-client association strategies. Based on the obtained analytical results, we optimize the two aggregation intervals and show that the client-edge aggregation interval should slowly decay while the edge-cloud aggregation interval needs to adapt to the ratio of the client-edge and edge-cloud propagation delay. Simulation results shall verify the design guidelines and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation strategy.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have attracted substantial attention due to their potential to provide very large bandwidths. Unfortunately, the propagation of millimeter waves suffers from severe path loss and blocking, which limits the coverage of mmWave communication systems. To overcome this, mmWave hotspot empowered two-tier heterogeneous networks are expected to play an important role in the sixth generation (6G) systems. When the deployment of mmWave hotspots is not dense enough, or even sparse, assuring the quality of service (QoS) for mobile users becomes rather challenging. In this paper, we investigate pushing in two-tier heterogeneous networks with mmWave hotspots, in which popular content items are cached by a mobile user when they can be served by a mmWave hotspot. To this end, a unified framework is presented to analyze and optimize the effective throughput of pushing. Based on the effective throughput analysis, pushing policies with different mobility models and/or mmWave hotspot distributions are presented. Both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the substantial caching gain due to user mobility in mmWave hotspot empowered two-tier networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the design of a wireless sensor network (WSN) that aims at monitoring the environment and collecting data periodically. In view of the limited energy and computational capability of the sensor nodes, a mobile edge computing (MEC) server is deployed in the WSN as a data processing unit. The goal of the design is to maintain the freshness of the data, which is characterized by the criterion of the age of information (AoI). Therefore, we analyze the long-term average AoI of the considered network. Then, the energy and time constraints for the WSN are modeled with consideration of transmission and computation. Next, a non-convex average AoI minimization problem is formulated subject to the energy and time constraints by jointly optimizing the sampling rate, computing scheduling, and transmit power. To tackle the challenging problem, the geometric programming and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique are applied to develop an algorithm with convergence guarantee. Moreover, to exhibit the benefits of the MEC server, a joint design is investigated for the WSN without the MEC server. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed SCA-based algorithm and show the impact of the sampling rate on the AoI performance.}

	abstract = {Recently, communications with the aid of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which operates with the aim of enhancing the system communication performance, have aroused extensive researches. Furthermore, the use of RIS for positioning has been considered. Therefore, we focus on a practical structure of indoor positioning assisted by distributed RISs through utilizing their ability to manipulate multipath signals, through the developed quasi-static and dynamic modes. Specifically, in the quasi-static mode, for reducing the implementation cost, the reflection coefficients for each RIS are preset and remain constant. In the dynamic mode, the reflection coefficients can be timely updated with a two-step positioning approach toward more accurate positioning performance. Furthermore, the Cramér-Rao lower bound of the developed positioning scheme is quantified through theoretical analysis. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that RIS has the potential to realize accurate positioning even with a single access point, due to its ability to mark the channel and replace traditional active positioning anchors. Meanwhile, we also show that the developed two-step positioning scheme can achieve considerable performance gain in accurate positioning.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) emerges as an essential part of the upcoming Fifth Generation (5G) and future beyond-5G mobile communication systems. It adds computational power towards the edge of cellular networks, much closer to energy-constrained user devices, and therewith allows the users to offload tasks to the edge computing nodes for low-latency applications with very-limited battery consumption. However, due to the high dynamics of user demand and server load, task congestion may occur at the edge nodes resulting in long queuing delay. Such delays can significantly degrade the quality of experience (QoE) of some latency-sensitive applications, raise the risk of service outage, and cannot be efficiently resolved by conventional queue management solutions. In this article, we study a latency-outage critical scenario, where users intend to limit the risk of latency outage. We propose an impatience-based queuing strategy for such users to intelligently choose between MEC offloading and local computation, allowing them to rationally renege from the task queue. The proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations to be efficient for generic service model, when a perfect queue status information is available. For the practical case where the users obtain only imperfect queue status information, we design an optimal online learning strategy to enable its application in Poisson service scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates task-oriented communication for multi-device cooperative edge inference, where a group of distributed low-end edge devices transmit the extracted features of local samples to a powerful edge server for inference. While cooperative edge inference can overcome the limited sensing capability of a single device, it substantially increases the communication overhead and may incur excessive latency. To enable low-latency cooperative inference, we propose a learning-based communication scheme that optimizes local feature extraction and distributed feature encoding in a task-oriented manner, i.e., to remove data redundancy and transmit information that is essential for the downstream inference task rather than reconstructing the data samples at the edge server. Specifically, we leverage Tishby’s information bottleneck (IB) principle (Tishby et al., 2000) to extract the task-relevant feature at each edge device, and adopt the distributed information bottleneck (DIB) framework of Aguerri and Zaidi, 2021, to formalize a single-letter characterization of the optimal rate-relevance tradeoff for distributed feature encoding. To admit flexible control of the communication overhead, we extend the DIB framework to a distributed deterministic information bottleneck (DDIB) objective that explicitly incorporates the representational costs of the encoded features. As the IB-based objectives are computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional data, we adopt variational approximations to make the optimization problems tractable. To compensate for the potential performance loss due to the variational approximations, we also develop a selective retransmission (SR) mechanism to identify the redundancy in the encoded features among multiple edge devices to attain additional communication overhead reduction. Extensive experiments on multi-view image classification and multi-view object recognition tasks evidence that the proposed task-oriented communication scheme achieves a better rate-relevance tradeoff than existing methods.}

	abstract = {Motivated by unique scattering properties at petahertz frequencies, we present a novel statistical model of fault-tolerant cooperative signal detection for short-range optical petahertz wireless communications, where a single-scattering assumption holds valid. We characterize the received non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal by a fault-tolerant continuous waveform wideband detector with a non-zero failure probability. To better reflect the physical properties of the petahertz communication, both signal-independent and signal-dependent noise sources are considered in characterizing the received signal. The distribution of the received signal is quantified with each scattered path following the Málaga distribution. We leverage the location flexibility of randomly distributed collaborative users, considering each user experiences an independent channel condition. Utilizing the Neyman-Pearson criterion, we develop the binary hypothesis testing problem and subsequently derive the likelihood ratio for the test statistics. Moreover, to quantify the performance, a framework is developed for the average area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for both single user and cooperative scenarios. An optimal decision fusion with a majority rule for fault-tolerant signal detection is applied to exploit the maximum spectrum opportunity. It is found that with the optimal voting rule and for a given target error rate, the network requires fewer collaborative secondary users than the total number of users available in an optical network. However, in the limiting case, it is shown that, as the cost function approaches its minimum or maximum value within its allowable range, the optimal number of collaborative users becomes independent of the failure probabilities. With the realistic assumption of fault-tolerant users, it is found that the false alarm probability increases faster than the detection probability.}

	abstract = {Proactive pushing has emerged as a promising solution to scale the service capacity by utilizing idle spectrum resources when on-demand transmission cannot fully exploit the spectrum resources during off-peak times. How to schedule both pushing and on-demand transmission jointly to meet a higher spectrum efficiency becomes a critical issue. Moreover, efficient and fair spectrum sharing among multiple resource schedulers remains open. In this paper, we introduce virtual network operators (VNOs) as schedulers that pay for consumed bandwidth and jointly schedule pushing and on-demand services. We adopt nonlinear spectrum pricing schemes with a convex and increasing price function enabling each VNO to share spectrum resources appropriately and independently. Considering the revenue from users and the cost for spectrum, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the profit of VNO. A modified value iteration algorithm is applied to solve the MDP with reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, we show the structure of the optimal policy and provide the upper and lower bounds for the optimal performance. We present a low-complexity heuristic policy that can scale in practice with large state spaces and action spaces.}

	abstract = {For implementation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, accurate estimation of downlink channel state information (CSI) is necessary, but full radio channel reciprocity between the uplink and downlink does not exist in that mode. Existing work on estimating downlink CSI in FDD massive MIMO systems has considered such approaches as angle-of-arrival reciprocity, compressive sensing, using second-order channel statistics (particularly the channel covariance matrix (CCM)), and machine learning using deep neural networks (DNNs). Typical DNN-based approaches are unsuitable for this problem because DNNs require large datasets, thousands of training epochs, and are susceptible to environmental variations. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) approach to uplink-to-downlink mapping of both CCMs and CSI. To apply this method, we convert the uplink and downlink CCMs/CSI to images and employ CGAN techniques previously applied to image translation. The normalized mean square error performance of the proposed CGAN is evaluated for several array sizes for both CCM and CSI mapping. For uplink-to-downlink CSI mapping, we also examine the spectral efficiency performance of our CGAN-based method, as well as the impact of pilot reuse; both simulated and measured CSI data are considered. Our results demonstrate performance improvement over existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {Current fifth-generation (5G) networks do not cover maritime areas, causing difficulties in developing maritime Internet of Things (IoT). To tackle this problem, we establish a nearshore network by collaboratively using on-shore terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These TBSs and UAVs form virtual clusters in a user-centric manner. Within each virtual cluster, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted for agilely including various maritime IoT devices, which are sparsely distributed over the vast ocean. The nearshore network also shares the spectrum with marine satellites. In such a NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network, interference among different network segments, different clusters, and different users occurs. We thereby formulate a joint power allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of the network. Different from existing studies, we use large-scale channel state information (CSI) only for optimization to reduce system overhead. The large-scale CSI is obtained by using the position information of maritime IoT devices. The problem is non-convex with intractable non-linear constraints. We tackle these difficulties by adopting max-min optimization, the auxiliary function method, and the successive convex approximation technique. An iterative power allocation algorithm is accordingly proposed, which is shown to be effective for coverage enhancement by simulations. This shows the potential of NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks for maritime on-demand coverage.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave self-backhauled small cells are a key component of next-generation wireless networks. Their dense deployment will increase data rates, reduce latency, and enable efficient data transport between the access and backhaul networks, providing greater flexibility not previously possible with optical fiber. Despite their high potential, operating dense self-backhauled networks optimally is an open challenge, particularly for radio resource management (RRM). This paper presents, RadiOrchestra, a holistic RRM framework that models and optimizes beamforming, rate selection as well as user association and admission control for self-backhauled networks. The framework is designed to account for practical challenges such as hardware limitations of base stations (e.g., computational capacity, discrete rates), the need for adaptability of backhaul links, and the presence of interference. Our framework is formulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is challenging to solve. To approach this problem, we propose three algorithms that provide a trade-off between complexity and optimality. Furthermore, we derive upper and lower bounds to characterize the performance limits of the system. We evaluate the developed strategies in various scenarios, showing the feasibility of deploying practical self-backhauling in future networks.}

The downlink performance of the system is evaluated, with maximum ratio and regularized zero-forcing precoding, under two optimization objectives for power allocation: sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization and proportional fairness. We present iterative centralized algorithms for solving these problems. Aiming at a less computationally complex and also distributed scalable solution, we train a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the same network-wide power allocation. Instead of training our DNN to mimic the actual optimization procedure, we use a heuristic power allocation, based on large-scale fading (LSF) parameters, as the pre-processed input to the DNN. We train the DNN to refine the heuristic scheme, thereby providing higher SE, using only local information at each AP. Another distributed DNN that exploits side information assumed to be available at the central processing unit is designed for improved performance. Further, we develop a clustered DNN model where the LSF parameters of a small number of APs, forming a cluster within a relatively large network, are used to jointly approximate the power coefficients of the cluster.}

	abstract = {Simultaneously transmitting/refracting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has been introduced to achieve full coverage area. This paper investigate the performance of STAR-RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks over Rician fading channels, where the incidence signals sent by base station are reflected and transmitted to the nearby user and distant user, respectively. To evaluate the performance of STAR-RIS-NOMA networks, we derive new approximate expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for a pair of users, in which the imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC) schemes are taken into consideration. Based on the asymptotic expressions, the diversity orders of the nearby user with ipSIC/pSIC and distant user are achieved carefully.The high signal-to-noise ratio slopes of ergodic rates for nearby user with pSIC and distant user are equal to one and zero , respectively. In addition, the system throughput of STAR-RIS-NOMA is discussed in delay-limited and delay-tolerant modes. Simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of the theoretical analyses and demonstrate that: 1) The outage probability of STAR-RIS-NOMA outperforms that of STAR-RIS assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional cooperative communication systems; 2) With the increasing of reflecting elements K and Rician factor \\kappa , the STAR-RIS-NOMA networks are capable of attaining the enhanced performance; and 3) The ergodic rates of STAR-RIS-NOMA are superior to that of STAR-RIS-OMA.}

	abstract = {Modern wireless communication networks are threatened by new generations of radio hackers. These are skilled attackers equipped with low-cost software radios, suitably instrumented so as to monitor, degrade, or even alter the radio signals. The aim of this paper is to devise innovative detection architectures against the most common classes of threats: broadband noise jammers, whose goal is to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, and spoofing/meaconing attacks, which aim to inject false or incorrect information into the receiver. To this end, we resort to the hypothesis testing theory and solve the associated problems by means of the GLRT possibly accounting for penalty terms. The resulting decision schemes represent the main technical novelty of this work. The analysis of their performance focuses on a location security case study for 4G/5G cellular networks. To this end, we leverage measurement models from the cellular localization literature and generate data according to these models. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in comparison with suitable counterparts.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, satellite and aerial platforms are playing an important role in realizing global seamless wireless coverage. In this paper, a cooperative satellite-aerial-terrestrial network (SATN) is considered, in which two kinds of relaying links, satellite and aerial relaying links, are used to assist a group of aerial terminals to forward their information to a remote terrestrial destination (D). Specifically, we model these aerial platforms sharing the same frequency band as a Matérn hard-core point process type-II. Also, a group of aerial jammers at D’s side is modeled as a Poisson point process. To demonstrate the end-to-end (e2e) performance of the two relaying links, the statistical characteristics of the received signal-to-interference are characterized and then a closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) over the uplink from the aerial source to the satellite/the aerial relay, the downlink from the satellite/the aerial relay to D, and the inter-aerial relay link are derived. Numerical results are presented to verify the proposed analysis models and compare the outage performance of the considered cooperative SATN with the two relay links under numerous scenarios.}

	abstract = {A mega-constellation of low-altitude earth orbit (LEO) satellites (SATs) are envisaged to provide a global coverage SAT network in beyond fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems. LEO SAT networks exhibit extremely long link distances of many users under time-varying SAT network topology. This makes existing multiple access protocols, such as random access channel (RACH) based cellular protocol designed for fixed terrestrial network topology, ill-suited. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel contention-based random access solution for LEO SAT networks, dubbed emergent random access channel protocol (eRACH). In stark contrast to existing model-based and standardized protocols, eRACH is a model-free approach that emerges through interaction with the non-stationary network environment, using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Furthermore, by exploiting known SAT orbiting patterns, eRACH does not require central coordination or additional communication across users, while training convergence is stabilized through the regular orbiting patterns. Compared to RACH, we show from various simulations that our proposed eRACH yields 54.6% higher average network throughput with around two times lower average access delay while achieving 0.989 Jain’s fairness index.}

We derive the upper bound of the time-average norm of the gradients to characterize the convergence of AirComp-assisted FL, which reveals the impact of the model aggregation errors accumulated over all communication rounds on convergence. Based on the convergence analysis, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the upper bound to enhance the learning performance, followed by proposing an alternating optimization algorithm to facilitate the transceiver design for AirComp-assisted FL. As the alternating optimization algorithm suffers from high computation complexity, we further develop a knowledge-guided learning algorithm that exploits the structure of the analytic expression of the transmit power to achieve computation-efficient transceiver design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed knowledge-guided learning algorithm achieves a comparable performance as the alternating optimization algorithm, but with a much lower computation complexity. Moreover, both proposed algorithms outperform the baseline methods in terms of convergence speed and test accuracy.}

	abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) can improve deep neural network inference throughput via batch processing, where multiple tasks are concurrently processed. We focus on novel scenarios that the energy-constrained mobile devices offload inference tasks to an edge server with GPU. The inference task is partitioned into sub-tasks for a finer granularity of offloading and scheduling, and the user energy consumption minimization problem under inference latency constraints is investigated. To deal with the coupled offloading and scheduling introduced by concurrent batch processing, we first consider an offline problem with a constant edge inference latency and the same latency constraint. It is proven that optimizing the offloading policy of each user independently and aggregating all the same sub-tasks in one batch is optimal, and thus the independent partitioning and same sub-task aggregating (IP-SSA) algorithm is inspired. Further, the optimal grouping (OG) algorithm is proposed to optimally group tasks when the latency constraints are different. Finally, when future task arrivals cannot be precisely predicted, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent is trained to call OG. Experiments show that IP-SSA reduces up to 94.9% user energy consumption in the offline setting, while DDPG-OG outperforms DDPG-IP-SSA by up to 8.92% in the online setting.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider asynchronous massive connectivity, where massive low-power and low-rate devices with sporadic activity patterns connect to a multi-antenna access point (AP) in an asynchronous manner. Asynchronous transmission minimizes the amount of coordination between the devices and the AP, and thereby simplifies the transmitter design, yet at the cost of a more challenging receiver design. Specifically, asynchronous transmission results in inter-symbol interference (ISI) since the sampling at AP generally cannot match with the symbol intervals of uncoordinated devices. To enable reliable reception, we develop a turbo approximate message passing (TAMP) algorithm that consists of a channel-signal decomposition (CSD) module and a delay learning (DL) module. The CSD carries out sparse matrix factorization to estimate the channels and the ISI corrupted signals of active devices, and the DL is designed to estimate the delay of each active user and resolve the corresponding ISI based on the Bayesian principle. To refine the delay estimation, we further divide the DL module into symbol-level delay learning (SDL) and sub-symbol-level delay learning (sub-SDL) submodules. In particular, the sub-SDL estimates the residue delays (obtained by taking modulo of the symbol interval) and then finely compensates the ISI. Due to the continuity and randomness of time delay, the receive signal constellation consists of lines and curves instead of discrete points, even if the transmit signal constellation is discrete. To reduce the complexity of soft demodulation, we introduce a truncation and projection based approximation method to simplify the related message calculation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TAMP algorithm. Particularly, the TAMP algorithm is able to approach the single-user bound with known user delay.}

Both the satellite and BS operate in the same frequency band. Since rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has recently emerged as a promising strategy for non-orthogonal transmission and robust interference management in multi-antenna wireless networks, we present two RSMA-based STIN schemes, namely the coordinated scheme relying on channel state information (CSI) sharing and the cooperative scheme relying on CSI and data sharing. Our objective is to maximize the minimum fairness rate amongst all SUs and CUs subject to transmit power constraints at the satellite and the BS. A joint beamforming algorithm is proposed to reformulate the original problem into an approximately equivalent convex one, which can be iteratively solved. Moreover, an expectation-based robust joint beamforming algorithm is proposed against the practical environment when the satellite channel phase uncertainties are considered. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed RSMA schemes for STIN and exhibit significant performance gains compared with various baseline strategies.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have been intensively studied for the optimization of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink systems owing to the capability of handling nonconvex formulations. However, the fixed computation structure of existing deep neural networks (DNNs) lacks flexibility with respect to the system size, i.e., the number of antennas or users. This paper develops a bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) framework, a scalable DL solution designed for multi-antenna beamforming optimization. The MU-MISO system is first characterized by a bipartite graph where two disjoint vertex sets, each of which consists of transmit antennas and users, are connected via pairwise edges. These vertex interconnection states are modeled by channel fading coefficients. Thus, a generic beamforming optimization process is interpreted as a computation task over a weighted bipartite graph. This approach partitions the beamforming optimization procedure into multiple suboperations dedicated to individual antenna vertices and user vertices. Separated vertex operations lead to scalable beamforming calculations that are invariant to the system size. The vertex operations are realized by a group of DNN modules that collectively form the BGNN architecture. Identical DNNs are reused at all antennas and users so that the resultant learning structure becomes flexible to the network size. Component DNNs of the BGNN are trained jointly over numerous MU-MISO configurations with randomly varying network sizes. As a result, the trained BGNN can be universally applied to arbitrary MU-MISO systems. Numerical results validate the advantages of the BGNN framework over conventional methods.}

Due to the complexity of NGWNs, several metaheuristics have been proposed to help in these operations. However, a large number of these studies present solutions using only one algorithm or procedure, i.e., the research uses just one metaheuristic to resolve the radio resource allocation problem. This fact tends to lead to a loss of performance because, in this way, there is no considerable variability in the search strategies for better solutions. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework that maximizes the total throughput of an NGWN that implements the multi-carrier cell-less non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-CL-NOMA) architecture. The framework executes this activity using scenario information to feed an ensemble metaheuristic method. The empirical results show that the framework presents better performance than utilizing one metaheuristic individually. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms algorithms applicable in future 6G NOMA scenarios.}

	abstract = {Active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been recently proposed to alleviate the product path loss attenuation inherent in the IRS-aided cascaded channel. In this paper, we study an active IRS-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, an active IRS is deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to convey information and energy simultaneously to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs). Two joint transmit and reflect beamforming optimization problems are investigated with different practical objectives. The first problem maximizes the weighted sum-power harvested by the EUs subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the IUs, while the second problem maximizes the weighted sum-rate of the IUs subject to individual energy harvesting (EH) constraints at the EUs. The optimization problems are non-convex and difficult to solve optimally. To tackle these two problems, we first rigorously prove that dedicated energy beams are not required for their corresponding semidefinite relaxation (SDR) reformulations and the SDR is tight for the first problem, thus greatly simplifying the AP precoding design. Then, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating optimization (AO), SDR, and successive convex approximation (SCA), computationally efficient algorithms are developed to obtain suboptimal solutions of the resulting optimization problems. Simulation results demonstrate that, given the same total system power budget, significant performance gains in terms of operating range of wireless power transfer (WPT), total harvested energy, as well as achievable rate can be obtained by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes (especially the one adopting a passive IRS). Moreover, it is advisable to deploy an active IRS in the proximity of the users for the effective operation of WPT/SWIPT.}

While the first data detection network, B-DetNet, is based on a linearized model obtained from the Bussgang decomposition, the channel estimation network and the second data detection network, FBM-CENet and FBM-DetNet respectively, rely on the original quantized system model. To develop FBM-CENet and FBM-DetNet, the maximum-likelihood channel estimation and data detection problems are reformulated to overcome the indeterminant gradient issue. An important feature of the proposed FBM-CENet structure is that the pilot matrix is integrated into the weight matrices of its channel estimator. Thus, training the proposed FBM-CENet enables a joint optimization of both the channel estimator at the base station and the pilot signal transmitted from the users. Simulation results show significant performance gains in estimation accuracy by the proposed deep learning framework.}

	abstract = {Future wireless communications are largely inclined to deploy massive numbers of antennas at the base stations (BSs) by leveraging cost- and energy-efficient as well as environmentally friendly antenna arrays. The emerging technology of dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) is promising to realize such massive antenna arrays with reduced physical size, hardware cost, and power consumption. The goal of this paper is the optimization of the energy efficiency (EE) performance of DMA-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications. Focusing on the uplink, we propose an algorithmic framework for designing the transmit precoding of each multi-antenna user and the DMA tuning strategy at the BS to maximize the EE performance, considering the availability of either instantaneous or statistical channel state information (CSI). Specifically, the proposed framework is shaped around Dinkelbach’s transform, alternating optimization, and deterministic equivalent methods. In addition, we obtain a closed-form solution to the optimal transmit signal directions for the statistical CSI case, which simplifies the corresponding transmission design for the multiple-antenna case. Our numerical results verify the good convergence behavior of the proposed algorithms, and showcase the considerable EE performance gains of the DMA-assisted massive MIMO transmissions over the baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, physical layer security (PLS) in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based mobile edge computing (MEC) system is investigated, where hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding is considered. Specifically, users intend to complete confidential tasks with the help of the MEC server, while an eavesdropper attempts to intercept the offloaded tasks. By jointly designing computational resource allocation, task assignment, and power allocation, a latency minimization problem is formulated. Based on the interactions between local computing time and MEC processing time, the closed-from solutions of computational resource allocation and task assignment are derived. After that, a strategy selection mechanism is established to select offloading strategies based on the corresponding conditions. Moreover, according to the analysis of hybrid SIC decoding, the conditions of different decoding orders in secure NOMA networks are derived. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning based algorithm is proposed to solve the power allocation problems for NOMA and OMA offloading strategies. This work is extended to a multi-user scenario, in which a matching-based algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated sub-channel assignment problem. Simulation results indicate that: i) the proposed solution can significantly reduce the latency and provide dynamic strategy selection for various scenarios; ii) the NOMA offloading strategy with hybrid SIC decoding can outperform other strategies in the considered system.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a novel uplink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) based multi-user multi-input multi-output symbiotic radio system. It indicates that each RIS, as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device, enhances the primary transmission from a nearby user to the base station (BS), and simultaneously transmits its own information to the BS by backscattering modulation. By embedding environmental sensors on the RISs, the proposed system enables the IoT transmission of locally collected environmental data to the BS while assisting the primary communications from the users to the BS. We consider both the case of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI), and design the active beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming at the RISs jointly to maximize the weighted sum-rate of both the primary and IoT transmissions. For the perfect CSI case, we propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the problem. We also propose another algorithm with a similar framework to reduce the computational complexity. For the imperfect CSI case, an algorithm based on BCD and the online successive convex approximation technique is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves significant performance gain over a number of baseline schemes for both the perfect and imperfect CSI cases. Furthermore, when the channel estimation error is small, the performance loss due to imperfect CSI is insignificant.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study short-packet communications in multi-hop networks with wireless energy transfer, where relay nodes harvest energy from power beacons to transmit short packets to multiple destinations. It is proposed a novel cooperative beamforming relay selection (CRS) scheme which incorporates partial relay selection and distributed multiuser beamforming to achieve a high-reliable transmission in two consecutive hops. A closed-form expression for the average block error rate (BLER) of the CRS scheme is derived, based on which an asymptotic analysis is also carried out. To achieve optimal channel uses allocation, we formulate a fairness end-to-end throughput maximization problem which is generally NP-hard due to the non-concavity of the objective function and mixed-integer constraints. To solve this challenging problem efficiently, we first relax channel uses to be continuous and transform the relaxed problem into an equivalent non-convex one, but with a more tractable form. We then develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm relying on inner approximation framework to convexify non-convex parts that converges to at least a locally optimal solution. Towards real-time settings, we design an efficient deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiscale-accumulation connections to achieve the sub-optimal solution of the relaxed problem via real-time inference processes. Numerical results are presented to verify the analytical derivations and to demonstrate performance improvements of the CRS scheme over the benchmark ones in terms of BLER, reliability, latency, and throughput in various settings. Moreover, the designed CNN provides the lowest root-mean-square error compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches while the CNN-aided optimization framework estimates accurately the optimal channel uses allocation with low execution time.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of power control for a wireless network with an arbitrarily time-varying topology, including the possible addition or removal of nodes. A data-driven design methodology that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) is adopted in order to efficiently parametrize the power control policy mapping the channel state information (CSI) to transmit powers. The specific GNN architecture, known as random edge GNN (REGNN), defines a non-linear graph convolutional filter whose spatial weights are tied to the channel coefficients. While prior work assumed a joint training approach whereby the REGNN-based policy is shared across all topologies, this paper targets adaptation of the power control policy based on limited CSI data regarding the current topology. To this end, we propose a novel modular meta-learning technique that enables the efficient optimization of module assignment. While black-box meta-learning optimizes a general-purpose adaptation procedure via (stochastic) gradient descent, modular meta-learning finds a set of reusable modules that can form components of a solution for any new network topology. Numerical results validate the benefits of meta-learning for power control problems over joint training schemes, and demonstrate the advantages of modular meta-learning when data availability is extremely limited.}

At the first mini-slot of these schemes, each user transmits its signal and receives the transmitted signal of the other user in full-duplex mode, and at the second mini-slot, each user relays the other user’s message with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. At both schemes, to achieve better spectral efficiency, users transmit signals in the non-orthogonal mode in both mini-slots. In C-RSMA, we also apply the rate-splitting method in which the message of each user is divided into two streams. In the proposed detection schemes for C-NOMA and C-RSMA, we apply a combination of maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) and successive-interference-cancellation (SIC). Then, we derive the achievable rates for C-NOMA and C-RSMA, and formulate two optimization problems to maximize the minimum rate of two users by considering the proportional fairness coefficient. We propose two power allocation algorithms based on successive-convex-approximation (SCA) and geometric-programming (GP) to solve these non-convex problems. Next, we derive the asymptotic outage probability of the proposed C-NOMA and C-RSMA schemes, and prove that they achieve diversity order of two. Finally, the above-mentioned performance is confirmed by simulations.}

	abstract = {Network slicing is a key feature of 5G and beyond networks, allowing the deployment of separate logical networks (network slices), sharing a common underlying physical infrastructure, and characterized by distinct descriptors and behaviors. The dynamic allocation of physical network resources among coexisting slices should address a challenging trade-off: to use resources efficiently while assigning each slice sufficient resources to meet its service level agreement (SLA). We consider the allocation of time-frequency resources from a new perspective: to design a control algorithm capable of learning over the operating network, while keeping the SLA violation rate under an acceptable level during the learning process. For this purpose, traditional model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods present several drawbacks: low sample efficiency, extensive exploration of the policy space, and inability to discriminate between conflicting objectives, causing inefficient use of the resources and/or frequent SLA violations during the learning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model-based RL approach built upon a novel modeling strategy that comprises a kernel-based classifier and a self-assessment mechanism. In numerical experiments, our proposal, referred to as kernel-based RL, clearly outperforms state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of SLA fulfillment, resource efficiency, and computational overhead.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable surfaces (RS) have recently emerged as an enabler for smart radio environments where they are used to actively tailor/control the radio propagation (e.g., to support users under adverse channel conditions). If multiple RSs are deployed (e.g., coated on various buildings) to support different groups of users, it is critical to jointly optimize the phase-shifts of all the RSs to mitigate interference amongst them as well as to leverage the secondary reflections amongst them. Motivated by these considerations, this paper considers the uplink transmissions of multiple users that are grouped and supported by multiple RSs to communicate with a multi-antenna base station (BS). We first formulate two optimization problems: the weighted sum-rate maximization and the minimum achievable rate (from all users) maximization. Unlike existing works that considered single user or single RS or multiple RSs without inter-RS reflections, the considered problems require the joint optimization of the phase-shifts of all RS elements and all beamformers at the multi-antenna BS. The two problems turn out to be non-convex and thus are difficult to be solved in general. Moreover, the inter-RS reflections give rise to the coupling of the phase-shifts amongst the RSs, making the optimization problems even more challenging to solve. To tackle them, we design alternating optimization algorithms that provably converge to locally optimal solutions. Simulation results reveal that by effectively mitigating interference and leveraging the secondary reflections amongst the RSs, there is a great benefit of deploying more RSs to support different groups of users so as to achieve a higher rate per user. This gain is even more significant with a larger number of elements per RS. Without properly dealing with the secondary reflections, by contrast, increasing the number of RSs can adversely impact the network throughput, especially for high transmit power.}

	abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is strongly advocated for sixth-generation (6G) networks, as the 6G standard will not be limited to improving broadband services, but will also target the extension of the geographical cellular coverage. In this context, the deployment of UAVs is considered a key solution for seamless connectivity and reliable coverage. That being said, it is important to underline that although UAVs are characterized by their high mobility and their ability to establish line-of-sight (LOS) links, their use is still impeded by several factors such as weather conditions, their limited computing power, and, most importantly, their limited energy. In this work, we are aiming for the novel technology that enables indefinite wireless power transfer for UAVs using laser beams. We propose a novel UAV deployment strategy, based on which we analyze the overall performance of the system in terms of wireless coverage. To this end, we use tractable tools from stochastic geometry to model the complex communication system. We analyze the user’s connectivity profile under different laser charging capabilities and in different type of environments. We show a decrease in the coverage probability by more than 12% in moderate-to-strong turbulence conditions compared to low turbulence conditions. We also show how the connection rate to the aerial network significantly decreases in favor of the terrestrial network for short laser charging ranges. We conclude that laser-powered drones are considered interesting alternatives when placed in LOS with users, in low-to-moderate optical turbulence, and at reasonable ranges from the charging stations.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency-orbital angular momentum (RF-OAM) is a novel approach of multiplexing a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel to achieve high spectrum efficiencies. Since OAM requires precise alignment of the transmit and the receive antennas, the electronic beam steering approach has been proposed for the uniform circular array (UCA)-based OAM communication system to circumvent large performance degradation induced by small antenna misalignment in practical environment. However, in the case of large-angle misalignment, the OAM channel capacity cannot be effectively compensated only by the electronic beam steering. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid mechanical and electronic beam steering scheme, in which mechanical rotating devices controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) signals as the execution unit are utilized to eliminate the large misalignment angle, while electronic beam steering is in charge of the remaining small misalignment angle caused by perturbations. Furthermore, due to the interferometry, the receive signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are not uniform at the elements of the receive UCA. Therefore, a rotatable UCA structure is proposed for the OAM receiver to maximize the channel capacity, in which the simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal rotation angle at first, then the servo system performs mechanical rotation, at last the electronic beam steering is adjusted accordingly. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results validate that the proposed hybrid mechanical and electronic beam steering scheme can effectively eliminate the effect of diverse misalignment errors of any practical OAM channel and maximize the OAM channel capacity.}

The recent proliferation of different frequency bands and standards in wireless communications has allowed large increases in mobility and throughput, but the number of receivers in a device is limited by physical space and power consumption. Software Defined Radio (SDR) is increasingly being explored to reduce the number of analog RF components required. This paper examines the use of direct RF digitization, allowing tunable and concurrent reception of multiple bands with a single RF front-end. Full mathematical models of both Nyquist and subband sampling receivers are presented and used to investigate a quadband LTE receiver, which is modeled in Simulink and implemented in a hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testbed. Individual bands are simulated to have at worst -95dBm sensitivity for 16-QAM with Nyquist sampling and -83dBm with subband sampling. Desensitization of the receivers due to multiband processing is evaluated theoretically and experimentally, showing a maximum of 3dB degradation, which is within the LTE standard for adjacent band interference.}

	abstract = {For intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless communications, channel estimation is essential and usually requires excessive channel training overhead when the number of IRS reflecting elements is large. The acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) becomes more challenging when the channel is not quasi-static due to the mobility of the transmitter and/or receiver. In this work, we study an IRS-aided wireless communication system with a practical channel model that characterizes the time-varying propagation property and propose an innovative two-stage transmission protocol. In the first stage, we send pilot symbols and track the direct/reflected channels based on the received signal, and then data signals are transmitted. In the second stage, instead of sending pilot symbols first, we directly predict the direct/reflected channels and all the time slots are used for data transmission. Based on the proposed transmission protocol, we propose a two-stage channel tracking and prediction (2SCTP) scheme to obtain the direct and reflected channels with low channel training overhead, which is achieved by exploiting the temporal correlation of the time-varying channels. Specifically, we first consider a special case where the IRS-access point (AP) channel is assumed to be static, for which a Kalman filter (KF)-based algorithm and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network are proposed for channel tracking and prediction, respectively. Then, for the more general case where the IRS-AP, user-IRS and user-AP channels are all assumed to be time-varying, we present a generalized KF (GKF)-based channel tracking algorithm, where proper approximations are employed to handle the underlying non-Gaussian random variables. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed transmission protocol and channel tracking/prediction algorithms as compared to existing ones.}

	abstract = {Programmable radio environments parametrized by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are emerging as a new wireless communications paradigm, but currently used channel models for the design and analysis of signal-processing algorithms cannot include fading in a manner that is faithful to the underlying wave physics. To overcome this roadblock, we introduce a physics-based end-to-end model of RIS-parametrized wireless channels with adjustable fading (coined PhysFad) which is based on a first-principles coupled-dipole formalism. PhysFad naturally incorporates the notions of space and causality, dispersion (i.e., frequency selectivity) and the intertwinement of each RIS element’s phase and amplitude response, as well as any arising mutual coupling effects including long-range mesoscopic correlations. The latter are induced by reverberation and yield a highly nonlinear parametrization of wireless channels through RISs, a pivotal property which is to date completely overlooked. PhysFad offers the to-date missing tuning knob for physics-compliant adjustable fading. We thoroughly characterize PhysFad and demonstrate its capabilities for a prototypical problem of RIS-enabled over-the-air channel equalization in rich-scattering wireless communications. We also share a user-friendly version of our code to help the community transition towards physics-based models with adjustable fading.}

	abstract = {First, a family of quadratic displacement operators based on group Fourier Transform has been proposed for joint distribution analysis. Second, considering the quadratic displacement operators, a novel millimeter-wave massive MIMO channel tracking has been proposed in Time-Angle (TA) plane. Due to a poor scattering environment, millimeter-wave communication suffers from an ill-conditioned channel matrix. Computationally effective compressed sensing has been proposed to estimate a few dominant paths. These methods rely on orthogonal pilot signals to estimate the channel reliably. However, applying compressed-sensing solutions to the continuous channel leads to significant pilot overhead. To reduce the pilot overhead, one needs to consider the channel dynamics, particularly the spectral overlap between the channel samples. Considering that channel spectral properties can be represented as a joint time-angle distribution, we propose a novel quadratic displacement operator in TA-plane. Considering group Fourier transform in TA-plane, we show that the subderivative of an angular parameter is the dual group of the original angular signal. For a group transform defined over the finite Abelian group, with respect to the finite-dimensional antenna arrays, the purposed time-angle representation matches the cover space of manifold defined in the virtual channel model recommended by A. Sayeed. In TA-plane, the quadratic displacement operator maps old time-angle coordinate onto a new coordinate by taking to account the local spectral properties of the channel samples. By applying the purposed quadratic displacement operator to the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model, the time evolution operator for directional millimeter-wave channel has been derived. Assuming independently identically distributed multipath contribution, we show that channel Wigner distribution is the direct sum of the cluster-wise Wigner distribution. Accordingly, we have shown that the continuous linear time-variant channel transfer function can be represented as the Hadamard product between Wigner distribution of the channel and Saleh-Valenzuela model. Considering the fact that the density matrix is a Weyl correspondence of Wigner distribution, a union of subspaces method has been employed to construct the density matrix for channels samples with slightly different states. Numerical results have been presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel tracking method.}

	abstract = {Different from traditional reflection-only reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) represent a novel technology, which extends the half-space coverage to full-space coverage by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting incident signals. STAR-RISs provide new degrees-of-freedom (DoF) for manipulating signal propagation. Motivated by the above, a novel STAR-RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) (STAR-RIS-NOMA) system is proposed in this paper. Our objective is to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the decoding order, power allocation coefficients, active beamforming, and transmission and reflection beamforming. However, the formulated problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables. To tackle this challenge, a suboptimal two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed. Specifically, in the inner-layer iteration, for a given decoding order, the power allocation coefficients, active beamforming, transmission and reflection beamforming are optimized alternatingly. For the outer-layer iteration, the decoding order of NOMA users in each cluster is updated with the solutions obtained from the inner-layer iteration. Moreover, an efficient decoding order determination scheme is proposed based on the equivalent-combined channel gains. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed STAR-RIS-NOMA system, aided by our proposed algorithm, outperforms conventional RIS-NOMA and RIS assisted orthogonal multiple access (RIS-OMA) systems.}

	abstract = {Radio maps find numerous applications in wireless communications and mobile robotics tasks, including resource allocation, interference coordination, and mission planning. Although numerous existing techniques construct radio maps from spatially distributed measurements, the locations of such measurements are predetermined beforehand. In contrast, this paper proposes spectrum surveying, where a mobile robot such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects measurements at a set of locations that are actively selected to obtain high-quality map estimates in a short surveying time. This is performed in two steps. First, two novel algorithms, a model-based online Bayesian estimator and a data-driven deep learning algorithm, are devised for updating a map estimate and an uncertainty metric that indicates the informativeness of measurements at each possible location. These algorithms offer complementary benefits and feature constant complexity per measurement. Second, the uncertainty metric is used to plan the trajectory of the UAV to gather measurements at the most informative locations. To overcome the combinatorial complexity of this problem, a dynamic programming approach is proposed to obtain lists of waypoints through areas of large uncertainty in linear time. Numerical experiments conducted on a realistic dataset confirm that the proposed scheme constructs accurate radio maps quickly.}

One essential key to realizing practical FD massive MIMO systems is how to effectively mitigate the self-interference (SI). Conventionally, however, the performance comparison of different SI methods by reflecting the actual channel characteristics was insufficient in the literature. Accordingly, this paper presents a performance analysis of SI cancellation (SIC) methods in FD massive MIMO systems. Analytical and numerical results confirm that, in an imperfect channel-estimation case, the ergodic rates performance of the spatial suppression in the uplink outperforms those of the SI subtraction, due to the correlation between the precoder and the estimation error of the SI channel. In addition, we discuss which method performs better under different given system constraints such as uplink and downlink sum rates, the total transmit power, and the power scaling law.}

Energy-efficient transmission/reception schemes are also regarded as an important component. The polarization domain has attracted substantial attention in this aspect. This paper is the first to propose multi-polarization superposition beamforming (MPS-Beamforming) with cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and cross-polarization ratio (XPR)-aware transmit power allocation utilizing the 5G NR antenna panel structure. The appropriate orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarrier assignment algorithm is also proposed to verify the theoretical schemes via simulations. The detailed theoretical derivation along with comprehensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed novel scheme of MPS-Beamforming is significantly beneficial to the improvement of the performance in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain at the user equipment (UE). For instance, a provided practical wireless channel environment in the simulations exhibits 8 dB SNR gain for 10−4 SER in a deterministic channel, and 4 dB SNR gain for 10−5 SER in abundant statistical channel realizations.}

	abstract = {Driven by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)’s advantages of flexible observation and enhanced communication capability, it is expected to revolutionize the existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and promise a more flexible joint design. Nevertheless, the existing works on ISAC mainly focus on exploring the performance of both functionalities simultaneously during the entire considered period, which may ignore the practical asymmetric sensing and communication requirements. In particular, always forcing sensing along with communication may make it is harder to balance between these two functionalities due to shared spectrum resources and limited transmit power. To address this issue, we propose a new integrated periodic sensing and communication (IPSAC) mechanism for the UAV-enabled ISAC system to provide a more flexible trade-off between two integrated functionalities. Specifically, the system achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, user association, target sensing selection, and transmit beamforming, while meeting the sensing frequency and beam pattern gain requirement for the given targets. Despite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves closely coupled integer variables, we derive the closed-form optimal beamforming vector to dramatically reduce the complexity of beamforming design, and present a tight lower bound of the achievable rate to facilitate UAV trajectory design. Based on the above results, we propose a two-layer penalty-based algorithm to efficiently solve the considered problem. To draw more important insights, the optimal achievable rate and the optimal UAV location are analyzed under a special case of infinity number of antennas. Furthermore, we prove the structural symmetry between the optimal solutions in different ISAC frames without location constraints in our considered UAV-enabled ISAC system. Based on this, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving the problem with location constraints. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and also unveil a more flexible trade-off in ISAC systems over benchmark schemes.}

With limited edge resources, a well-structured neural network and numerous training data are the two main factors that affect the performance of edge machine learning. In this paper, we cooperatively optimize the data collection and the neural architecture to minimize the energy consumption of devices and the error on a specific task. We derive the Rademacher complexity bounds theoretically to evaluate the generalization error of the neural architectures in the search space and then formulate the optimization problem accordingly. Then we develop a scheme to solve the problem that dynamically performs the data collection based on policy gradient reinforcement learning and the parameter-sharing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. By this way, the transmission power of each device can be adjusted based on the data quality assessed by the NAS result in each round to effectively collect data. And with the growing high-quality data, the NAS algorithm can gradually find the optimal architecture for the task.

Specifically, by jointly designing the target detection beamformer and communication beamformer, we aim to maximize the radar detection mutual information (MI) (or the communication rate) subject to the covert constraint, the communication rate constraint (or the radar detection MI constraint), and the total power constraint. For the perfect eavesdropper’s channel state information (CSI) scenario, we transform the covert beamforming design problems into a series of convex subproblems, by exploiting semidefinite relaxation, which can be solved via the bisection search method. Considering the high complexity of iterative optimization, we further propose a single-iterative covert beamformer design scheme based on the zero-forcing criterion. For the imperfect eavesdropper’s CSI scenario, we develop a relaxation and restriction method to tackle the robust covert beamforming design problems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed covert beamforming schemes for perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios.}

In the considered model, UAVs provide terrestrial users with wireless services and illumination simultaneously. Moreover, RISs are utilized to further improve the channel quality between UAVs and users. This joint placement and resource management problem is constructed aiming at acquiring the optimal UAV deployment, RISs phase shift, user and RIS association that satisfies the users’ needs with minimum consumption of the UAVs’ energy. An iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes continuous and binary variables is proposed to solve this mixed-integer programming problem. Specifically, RISs phase shift optimization is solved by phases alignment method and semidefinite program algorithm. Next, the successive convex approximation algorithm is proposed to settle the UAV deployment problem. The user and RIS association variables are relaxed to the continuous ones before adopting the dual method to find the optimal solution. Moreover, a greedy algorithm is proposed as an alternative to RIS association optimization with low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes harvest the superior performance of 34.85% and 32.11% energy consumption reduction over the case without RIS, respectively.}

	abstract = {Resource allocation is investigated for offloading computational-intensive tasks in dual-hop mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The envisioned system has both the cooperative access points (APs) with the computing capability and the MEC servers. A user-device (UD), therefore, first uploads a computing task to the nearest AP, and the AP can either locally process the received task or offload to MEC server. To utilize the radio resource blocks (RRBs) in the APs efficiently, we exploit the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for offloading the tasks from the UDs to the AP(s). In order to investigate the trade-off between latency and energy consumption, this work considers minimizing a weighted-sum that consists of latency and energy consumption, subject to UDs’ rate threshold, tasks’ time-delay, computational frequency scaling, and transmit power allocation constraints. With a joint consideration of all such factors, the problem is NP-hard and its global optimal solution is computationally intractable. A graph-theoretical approach is employed to solve the problem efficiently. Specifically, a novel joint MEC graph-based approach is devised, which solves the scheduling among the UDs, APs, and RRBs, the transmit power control, and the local computational frequency scaling problem(s) jointly. The joint MEC approach achieves near-optimal performance with high computational complexity. To strike a suitable balance between the performance and computational complexity of the resource allocation, a low complexity, yet efficient, pruning graph approach is also devised. The efficiency of the proposed graph-based approaches over several benchmark schemes is verified via extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {Cooperating radios can extend their communication range by adjusting their signals to ensure coherent combining at a destination radio. This technique is called distributed transmit beamforming. Beamforming (BF) relies on the BF radios having frequency synchronized carriers and phases adjusted for coherent combining. Both requirements are typically met by exchanging preambles with the destination. However, since BF aims to increase the received power, the individually transmitted preambles are typically at low SNR and their lengths are constrained by the channel coherence time. These noisy preambles lead to errors in frequency and phase estimation, which result in randomly changing BF gains. To build reliable distributed BF systems, the impact of estimation errors on the BF gains need to be considered in the design. In this work, assuming a destination-led BF protocol and Kalman filter for frequency tracking, we optimize the number of BF radios and the preamble lengths to achieve reliable BF gain. To do that, we characterize the relations between the BF gains distribution, the channel coherence time, and design parameters like the SNR, preamble lengths, and the number of radios. The proposed relations are verified using simulations and via experiments using software-defined radios in a lab and on UAVs.}

	abstract = {Satellite networks are promising to provide ubiquitous and high-capacity global wireless connectivity. Traditionally, satellite networks are modeled by placing satellites on a grid of multiple circular orbit geometries. Such a network model, however, requires intricate system-level simulations to evaluate coverage performance, and analytical understanding of the satellite network is limited. Continuing the success of stochastic geometry in a tractable analysis for terrestrial networks, in this paper, we develop novel models that are tractable for the coverage analysis of satellite networks using stochastic geometry. By modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes on the surfaces of concentric spheres, we characterize analytical expressions for the coverage probability of a typical downlink user as a function of relevant parameters, including path-loss exponent, satellite height, density, and Nakagami fading parameter. Then, we also derive a tight lower bound of the coverage probability in tractable expression while keeping full generality. Leveraging the derived expression, we identify the optimal density of satellites in terms of the height and the path-loss exponent. Our key finding is that the optimal average number of satellites decreases logarithmically with the satellite height to maximize the coverage performance. Simulation results verify the exactness of the derived expressions.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is becoming increasingly popular as a green Internet-of-things technology by enabling ultra-low-power data exchanges among simple tags. The bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the AmBC receivers is hampered by the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which limits either the range or the data rate that can be supported by these systems. Among the alternatives, the solutions provided by a multiantenna receiver enable several practical methods to improve the SINR using array signal processing. In this paper, the optimum multiantenna AmBC receiver for any binary modulated tag signal is presented. Two receivers are derived from the maximum-a-posterior probability criterion for deterministic-unknown and for Gaussian distributed ambient signals. The closed-form cumulative distribution functions are derived for both of the receivers for performance evaluation purposes. It is discussed that these two receivers are equivalent under practical conditions, and the optimum receiver is a generalization of the multiantenna receivers available in the literature. Several implementation details are discussed, and numerical evaluation is provided to validate the development. Therefore, the presented receiver accommodates different tag modulations and achieves the best possible BER performance, which opens up new application possibilities by improving AmBC system flexibility.}

	abstract = {The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm makes our telecommunications networks increasingly congested. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been regarded as a promising solution to offload the overwhelming traffic. Considering the limited spectrums, cognitive radio can be embedded into UAVs to build backhaul links through harvesting idle spectrums. For the cognitive UAV (CUAV) assisted network, how much traffic can be actually offloaded depends on not only the traffic demand but also the spectrum environment. It is necessary to jointly consider both issues and co-design the trajectory and communications for the CUAV to make data collection and data transmission balanced to achieve high offloading efficiency, which, however, is non-trivial because of the heterogeneous and uncertain network environment. In this paper, aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the CUAV-assisted traffic offloading, we jointly design the Trajectory, Time allocation for data collection and data transmission, Band selection, and Transmission power control (\nT\n3\nB\n) considering the heterogeneous environment on traffic demand, energy replenishment, and spectrum availability. Considering the uncertain environmental information, we develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based solution to make the CUAV achieve the best decision autonomously. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-\nT\n3\nB\nstrategy.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal cyclic prefixed filter bank multiple access (CP-FBMA) is a newly proposed waveform with many attractive features. An important aspect is that the design freedom of the filters is released due to removal of the orthogonality constraint, which is exploited in this work to maximize the average weighted sum rate (WSR) based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Since the average rate has no closed-form expression, we asymptotically approximate it to simplify the problem. With the asymptotic rate, a full-band waveform optimization algorithm is proposed, which is based on manifold gradient ascent. Moreover, stop-band energy constraints are added to represent the requirements on the spectrum occupation, and an algorithm combining successive convex approximation (SCA) with consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to cope with the modified problem. Numerical results show that the asymptotic rate can approach the average WSR obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. Besides, the average rate of CP-FBMA can indeed be enlarged through the proposed algorithms.}

We consider a Kronecker product model for the channel correlation with a transmit equicorrelation matrix and a receive correlation matrix which is diagonal. The transmit symbol vector, in which the symbols are taken from two binary constellations \\{0,1\\}\nand \\{1,-r\\}\n(with 0\\leq r < 1\n), is premultiplied by a diagonal precoder matrix with positive precoder parameters. As the average signal-to-noise ratio per diversity branch becomes large, the symbol vector error probability (SVEP) tends to reach saturation. We minimize this saturation value with respect to the precoder parameters and the constellation parameter r\n. It is found from computation that the optimal precoder parameters are approximately in geometric progression for both constellations. By observing the patterns in optimal values obtained from computation, we simplify the optimization problem. This simplification reduces the computational effort required to solve the complex minimization problem without affecting the SVEP significantly. Furthermore, in the case of the constellation \\{1,-r\\}\n, it is found from computation that as the number of transmit antennas increases, the optimal value of r\ndecreases.}

	abstract = {As one of the most popular and attractive frameworks for model training, federated edge learning (FEEL) presents a new paradigm, which avoids direct data transmission by collaboratively training a global learning model across multiple distributed edge devices, thus overcoming the disadvantage of centralized machine learning in resource limitations, delay constraints, and privacy issues. However, due to the heavy cost of communicating gradient among edge devices, sharing the parameters of a large-scale neural network can still be time-intensive. To alleviate this bottleneck, an efficient scheme, called SignSGD has been recently proposed, where the one-bit gradient quantization with majority vote is featured at edge devices. Nevertheless, the performance of one-bit aggregation will inevitably deteriorate due to the undesirable propagation error introduced by wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose in this work a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided one-bit communication optimization scheme under orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) to relieve the negative influence of communication error on the SignSGD-based FEEL. Specifically, a learning convergence analysis is firstly presented to quantitatively characterize the impact of wireless communication error measured by the union bound on pairwise bit error rate (BER) on the performance of SignSGD-based FEEL. Immediately, a unified communication-learning optimization problem is further formulated to jointly optimize the sub-band assignment strategy, the power allocation vector, and the RIS configuration matrix. Numerical experiments show that the proposed design achieves substantial performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {5G communication network has become a major pillar in the evolution of interconnected industrial systems. However, the introduction of 5G network may lead to unknown risks in the systems. To reveal the impact of network threats on 5G-based industrial systems, a 5G network security analysis approach combining formal modeling and attack penetration is proposed. Firstly, the 5G network models based on topology and transmission events are established to cope with diverse and hidden attack routes and behaviors. Then, the attack module is integrated into the network model. With attack penetration to the models, potential vulnerabilities are exploited and quantified based on the hierarchical-topology model, and network reliability is evaluated based on the transmission-event model. The simulation results identify and quantify network vulnerabilities under various attacks, including access authentication failure, destruction of data integrity, illegal control of Network Functions (NFs), and malicious consumption of shared slicing resources. Meanwhile, a more unpredictable outcome is that there is a threshold of access probability, \\alpha\n, to measure the impacts of attacks against the bearer network and core network on reliability. Finally, a practical case about the impact of network security on a 5G-based coupled-tank system is discussed, which further proves the feasibility of our approach.}

The sensors collaborate locally within predefined sensor clusters and fuse their noisy sensor data to reach a common local estimate of the detected event in each cluster. The connectivity of each sensor cluster is intermittent and depends on the available communication opportunities of the sensors to the fusion center. Upon receiving the estimates from all the connected sensor clusters the fusion center fuses the received estimates to make a final determination regarding the occurrence of the event across the deployment area. We refer to this hybrid communication scheme as a cloud-cluster architecture. We propose a method for optimizing the decision rule for each cluster and analyzing the expected detection performance resulting from our hybrid scheme. Our method is tractable and addresses the high computational complexity caused by heterogeneous sensors’ and clusters’ detection quality, heterogeneity in their communication opportunities, and non-convexity of the loss function. Our analysis shows that clustering the sensors provides resilience to noise in the case of low sensor communication probability with the cloud. For larger clusters, a steep improvement in detection performance is possible even for a low communication probability by using our cloud-cluster architecture.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a cost-effective solution to enhance wireless communication performance via passive signal reflection. Existing works on IRS have mainly focused on investigating IRS’s passive beamforming/reflection design to boost the communication rate for users assuming that their channel state information (CSI) is fully or partially known. However, how to exploit IRS to improve the wireless transmission reliability without any CSI, which is typical in high-mobility/delay-sensitive communication scenarios, remains largely open. In this paper, we study a new IRS-aided communication system with the IRS integrated to its aided access point (AP) to achieve both functions of transmit diversity and passive beamforming simultaneously. Specifically, we first show an interesting result that the IRS’s passive beamforming gain in any channel direction is invariant to the common phase-shift applied to all of its reflecting elements. Accordingly, we design the common phase-shift of IRS elements to achieve transmit diversity at the AP side without the need of any CSI of the users. In addition, we propose a practical method for the users to estimate the CSI at the receiver side for information decoding. Meanwhile, we show that the conventional passive beamforming gain of IRS can be retained for the other users with their CSI known at the AP. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic performance of both IRS-aided transmit diversity and passive beamforming in closed-form, by considering the large-scale IRS with an infinite number of elements. Numerical results validate our analysis and show the performance gains of the proposed IRS-aided simultaneous transmit diversity and passive beamforming scheme over other benchmark schemes.}

This paper considers an edge computing system where the server and workers have possibly different computing and communication capabilities and employ quantization before transmitting messages. To explore the full potential of FL in such an edge computing system, we first present a general FL algorithm, namely GenQSGD, parameterized by the numbers of global and local iterations, mini-batch size, and step size sequence. Then, we analyze its convergence for an arbitrary step size sequence and specify the convergence results under three commonly adopted step size rules, namely the constant, exponential, and diminishing step size rules. Next, we optimize the algorithm parameters to minimize the energy cost under the time constraint and convergence error constraint, with the focus on the overall implementing process of FL. Specifically, for any given step size sequence under each considered step size rule, we optimize the numbers of global and local iterations and mini-batch size to optimally implement FL for applications with preset step size sequences. We also optimize the step size sequence along with these algorithm parameters to explore the full potential of FL. The resulting optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems with non-differentiable constraint functions. We propose iterative algorithms to obtain KKT points using general inner approximation (GIA) and tricks for solving complementary geometric programming (CGP). Finally, we numerically demonstrate the remarkable gains of GenQSGD with optimized algorithm parameters over existing FL algorithms and reveal the significance of optimally designing general FL algorithms.}

	abstract = {Signal detectors are quite important to attain the diversity of doubly-dispersive wireless channels. Detectors based on message-passing (MP) of factor graphs have been regarded as the way to achieve the near-optimal performance for OTFS. In this paper, by deriving the pattern of the multipath vectorized channel matrix of the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system, it is shown that short girth (i.e. girth-4) may exist in the Tanner graphs, which will degrade the performance of MP detectors, especially with high modulation orders. By introducing interleavers at the transmitter and receiver, the vectorized channel matrix turns out to be a sparse upper block Heisenberg matrix, whose structure is beneficial for the computation of matrix QR decomposition (QRD). Successive interference canceling (SIC) detectors based on QRD and sorted QRD are constructed to eliminate the cross-symbol interference and improve the reliability of the symbol-level channel. Simulation results show that for 4QAM, the QRD-based SIC detectors can achieve about 4dB gain at 10−2 over the non-SIC detectors, while the sorted QRD-based SIC detectors can bring an additional 2dB at 10−3, which is only 1dB gap from the MP. For 16QAM, the sorted SIC detectors show superior BER performance than the MP method, and for 64QAM, the MP detector reaches the error floor while SIC detectors show their excellent performance in all configurations.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a beam tracking algorithm based on the deep Q-network (DQN) for mobile millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. The proposed algorithm determines the receive beam angle from the received signals without knowing the channel model and dynamics. It uses the received signals of the current and previous time slots to design the state and reward of the DQN. Our goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio by the actions of the designed DQN. A significant computational complexity reduction is achieved since the receiver does not need to run complicated signal processing algorithms once the DQN is properly trained. Therefore a practical implementation of mmWave beam tracking with a very large number of antennas under harsh mobile environments becomes feasible. Through the extensive simulations, we verified the performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrated robustness to the system uncertainty and low computational complexity in comparison with particle filter and the Q-learning.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a prospective technology for next-generation wireless networks due to their potential in coverage and capacity enhancement. Previous works on achievable rate analysis of RIS-assisted communication systems have mainly focused on the rich-scattering environment where Rayleigh and Rician channel models can be applied. This work studies the ergodic achievable rate of RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output communication systems in the millimeter-wave band with limited scattering under the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model. Firstly, we derive an upper bound of the ergodic achievable rate by means of majorization theory and Jensen’s inequality. The upper bound shows that the ergodic achievable rate increases logarithmically with the number of antennas at the base station (BS) and user, the number of the reflection units at the RIS, and the eigenvalues of the steering matrices associated with the BS, user and RIS. Then, we aim to maximize the ergodic achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix at the BS and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. Specifically, the transmit covariance matrix is optimized by the water-filling algorithm and the reflection coefficients are optimized using the Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithms.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which provides indirect line-of-sight (LoS) transmission paths between the receiver and its blocked transmitter, has been proposed as one of the promising technologies for network performance enhancement. Recent works indicate that both the numbers of RISs and unit cells per RIS have a significant impact on network performance. However, with a given total number of unit cells, the joint analysis of these two factors considering blockage effect has not been investigated. In this paper, the coverage probability of a three-dimensional downlink millimeter wave RIS-assisted network is analyzed. We first derive the acceptable area where a LoS RIS is capable to satisfy the signal-to-noise ratio threshold at the receiver. Next, we model the centers of building blockages and human-body blockages as two independent Poisson point processes and derive the probability that indirect LoS transmissions exist. Then, we derive and validate the analytical upper and lower bounds of the coverage probability as the functions of network parameters and blockage densities. We also derive and validate the closed-form coverage probability when RISs are much closer to UE than BS. Finally, we propose a general network cost model for RIS-assisted network. Results show that in terms of coverage enhancement, densely deployed small-scale RISs outperform sparsely deployed large-scale RISs in scenarios with dense blockages or short transmission distances, while sparsely deployed large-scale RISs are preferable in scenarios with sparse blockages or long transmission distances.}

	abstract = {Hybrid analog/digital (A/D) beamforming architectures are low complexity alternatives to fully digital designs in large antenna setups. Recent research efforts have been set out to find low-complexity algorithms, which have low implementation complexity in the analog domain. In this paper, we propose a two-stage hybrid precoding design assuming hardware constraints that avoid the use of adaptive phase-shifters (PSs) by introducing a novel combination of Butler matrices (BMs) to feed a uniform planar array (UPA). With several fixed beams, we propose an algorithm to design the analog precoding matrix in the first stage, while in the second stage, hybrid-beamforming (HBF)-weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) is proposed for baseband precoding by taking into account the analog precoding matrix designed in the first stage. The proposed algorithm shows fast convergence, thanks to the analog precoder design, which helps the HBF-WMMSE algorithm to converge within a few iterations. Compared with the classical matched filter (MF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) solutions, HBF-WMMSE outperforms the latter in terms of sum-rate, especially in the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Simulation results further show that the partially connected Butler matrices (PCBMS) approach implemented with fixed-PSs exhibit superior energy-efficiency while maintaining higher spectral-efficiency as compared to the partially connected analog phase shifting (PCAPS) network implemented with variable-PSs.}

	abstract = {Networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging in many application domains, e.g., military surveillance. To perform collaborative tasks, the involved UAVs exchange several types of information, e.g., sensor data and commands. The major question here is how to schedule the tasks under dynamic traffic flows to provide network services. Existing solutions use the Round-Robin Strategy (RRS), where the tasks are scheduled statistically by dividing the time into fixed-length rounds. However, the RRS wastes significant network and device resources due to task scheduling in each round. This paper proposes DROVE– a novel clustering approach that allows the UAVs for dynamic task scheduling. However, determining the task scheduling is crucial, as it significantly affects several network parameters, e.g., throughput. Therefore, we devise the problem of distributed task scheduling under dynamic traffic flow scenarios to optimize the throughput. We propose a clustering task scheduling algorithm to serve dynamic traffic flows. Particularly, we integrate the dynamic traffic flows into the Lyapunov drift analysis framework, and determine the throughput optimality of our proposed scheduling algorithm. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of DROVE. The results show that DROVE outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of energy consumption, clustering overhead, throughput, end-to-end delay, flow success rate and packet drop rate.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is a promising technique for the next generation communication systems. However, the hardware cost and power consumption grow significantly as the number of radio frequency (RF) components increases, which hampers the deployment of practical massive MIMO systems. To address this issue and further facilitate the commercialization of massive MIMO, mixed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) architecture has been considered, where parts of conventionally assumed full-resolution ADCs are replaced by one-bit ADCs. In this paper, we first propose a deep learning-based (DL) joint pilot design and channel estimation method for mixed-ADCs mmWave massive MIMO. Specifically, we devise a pilot design neural network whose weights directly represent the optimized pilots, and develop a Runge-Kutta model-driven densely connected network as the channel estimator. Instead of randomly assigning the mixed-ADCs, we then design a novel antenna selection network for mixed-ADCs allocation to further improve the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, we adopt an autoencoder-inspired end-to-end architecture to jointly optimize the pilot design, channel estimation and mixed-ADCs allocation networks. Simulation results show that the proposed DL-based methods have advantages over the traditional channel estimators as well as the state-of-the-art networks.}

	abstract = {Inspired by emerging applications in vehicular networks, we address the problem of achieving high-reliability and low-latency communication in multi-hop wireless networks. We propose a new family of Automatic-Repeat-Requests (ARQs) based cooperative strategies wherein high end-to-end reliability is obtained using packet re-transmissions at each hop while the low-latency constraint is met by imposing an upper bound on the total number of packet retransmissions across the network. A hallmark of our strategies is the one-hop listening capability wherein nodes utilize the unused ARQs of their preceding node just by counting the number of failed attempts due to decoding errors. We further extend the idea of one-hop listening to multi-hop listening, wherein a set of consecutive nodes form clusters to utilize the unused ARQs of the preceding nodes, beyond its nearest neighbour, to further improve reliability. Thus, our strategies provide the high-reliability feature with no compromise in the original latency-constraint. For the proposed strategies, we solve non-linear optimization problems on distributing the ARQs across the nodes so as to minimize packet drop probability (PDP) subject to a total number of ARQs in the network. Through extensive theoretical results on PDP and delay profiles, we show that the proposed strategies outperform the best-known strategies in this space.}

The reception at each user is facilitated through a dedicated RIS. Owing to the geometry and placements of meta-atoms, the analysis incorporates spatial-correlation among the channels related to RIS. Using moment-matching approach, a new analytical framework is presented for spatially-correlated channels considering the optimal phase-shifts from RIS meta-atoms. The effects of residual self-interference (RSI), self-reflections and interference from the RIS of transmitting user are considered in the analysis. The expressions are derived for the outage probability and ergodic capacity for infinite block-length transmission, and for finite block-length transmission, the expressions are obtained for block-error rate (BLER), ergodic capacity and system goodput. To gain further insights, the expression for the asymptotic outage probability is also derived. The finding of this paper confirms the ability of RIS-assisted communication to counter the detrimental effects of self-interference in FD scenario, even in presence of spatial-correlation. The derived expressions are validated using the Monte-Carlo simulations.}

The timeliness of the system is characterized by Age of Information (AoI). To efficiently utilize the time-frequency resource and achieve a tradeoff between timeliness and reliability, we propose an adaptive transmission policy under hybrid automatic repeat request with chase combining (HARQ-CC) aided NOMA systems. In particular, the BS can adaptively adjust the power allocation and decide whether to transmit old or new packets to users in the NOMA system, based on the current AoI status and the positive/negative acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) feedback signal. We first analyze the BLER under such adaptive systems, and then formulate an AoI minimization problem based on the derived BLER. By transforming the objective function to a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, an optimal policy is obtained to minimize the average AoI of the system. Considering the high complexity of the MDP, we further divise an alternative near-optimal policy based on Lyapunov Drift function. Furthermore, we consider the fairness of users and propose a greedy policy to minimize the maximal expected AoI of users. Based on extensive simulations, it has been found that NOMA can outperform OMA on both an overall and a user-level basis when operating with adaptive retransmission and power allocation strategies.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a communication-efficient federated learning framework inspired by quantized compressed sensing. The presented framework consists of gradient compression for wireless devices and gradient reconstruction for a parameter server (PS). Our strategy for gradient compression is to sequentially perform block sparsification, dimensional reduction, and quantization. By leveraging both dimension reduction and quantization, our strategy can achieve a higher compression ratio than one-bit gradient compression. For accurate aggregation of local gradients from the compressed signals, we put forth an approximate minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach for gradient reconstruction using the expectation-maximization generalized-approximate-message-passing (EM-GAMP) algorithm. Assuming Bernoulli Gaussian-mixture prior, this algorithm iteratively updates the posterior mean and variance of local gradients from the compressed signals. We also present a low-complexity approach for the gradient reconstruction. In this approach, we use the Bussgang theorem to aggregate local gradients from the compressed signals, then compute an approximate MMSE estimate of the aggregated gradient using the EM-GAMP algorithm. We also provide a convergence rate analysis of the presented framework. Using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that the presented framework achieves almost identical performance with the case that performs no compression, while significantly reducing communication overhead for federated learning.}

The proposed scheme employs a message splitting method that divides each data stream into common and private sub-streams, in which the private stream is recovered by the dedicated receiver only while the common stream is required to be recovered by both receivers. Specifically, to enable IF sum decoding at the receiver side, all streams are encoded using the same lattice code. Additionally, the number of common and private streams of each user is carefully determined by considering the number of antennas at transmitters and receivers, the channel matrices, and the effective signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver to maximize the achievable rate. Furthermore, we consider various assumptions of channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) and propose low-complexity linear transmit beamforming suitable for each CSIT assumption. The achievable sum rate and rate region are analytically derived and extensively evaluated by simulation for various environments, demonstrating that the proposed interference management scheme strictly outperforms the previous benchmark schemes in a wide range of channel parameters due to the gain from IF sum decoding.}

	abstract = {In this work, we investigate the status packet covert communication with time uncertainty in time-critical wireless networks. We model the packet generation as a Poisson process that concatenates the information timeliness and communication covertness, since the prior transmission probability is highly correlated with the packet generation. To balance between the timeliness and covertness of the status packet transmission, we propose two schemes, named random sub-slot selection (RSS) scheme and random channel use selection (RCUS) scheme, by exploiting the random transmission time to confuse a warden Willie’s binary detection on the covert communication. Subsequently, the average age of information (AoI) subject to the covertness constraint is derived for the proposed RSS and RCUS schemes. It is demonstrated that the symbol-length of the status packet introduces a non-trivial tradeoff between the covertness and timeliness. Inspired by this, further designs of the symbol-length and the transmit power for the proposed two schemes are formulated as optimization problems and solved optimally. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of proposed schemes over the existing covert communication strategies. In addition, our examination reveals that the RCUS scheme outperforms the RSS scheme when the covertness constraint is extremely strict. Otherwise, the RSS scheme generally outperforms the RCUS scheme in terms of achieving a lower AoI.}

	abstract = {Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) facilitates cost-effective deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks through multihop self-backhauling. Full-duplex (FD) technology, particularly for mmWave systems, is a potential means to overcome latency and throughput challenges faced by IAB networks. We derive practical and tractable throughput and latency constraints using queueing theory and formulate a network utility maximization problem to evaluate both full-duplex (FD)-IAB and half-duplex (HD)-IAB networks. We use this to characterize the network-level improvements seen when upgrading from conventional HD IAB nodes to FD ones by deriving closed-form expressions for (i) latency gain of FD-IAB over HD-IAB and (ii) the maximum number of hops that a HD- and FD-IAB network can support while satisfying latency and throughput targets. Extensive simulations illustrate that FD-IAB can facilitate reduced latency, higher throughput, deeper networks, and fairer service. Compared to HD-IAB, FD-IAB can improve throughput by 8\\times\nand reduce latency by 4\\times\nfor a fourth-hop user. In fact, upgrading IAB nodes with FD capability can allow the network to support latency and throughput targets that its HD counterpart fundamentally cannot meet. The gains are more profound for users further from the donor and can be achieved even when residual self-interference is significantly above the noise floor.}

	abstract = {An efficient beam and channel acquisition and tracking scheme is developed under a reconfigurable hybrid beamforming (R-HBF) architecture for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. Under such an R-HBF, a hierarchical multi-resolution beam scanning and space-frequency compressive sensing method is proposed to achieve fast beam and channel acquisitions in mmWave MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. With the initial frequency-domain beam space channel estimates, Kalman-based algorithms are further developed to track the transmit and receive beamforming directions and the channel coefficients of the sparse propagation paths in mmWave mobile channels. Simulations show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the beam training time, and that the channel capacity evaluated with the estimated channels is only 2 dB inferior to the one with ideal channels. Moreover, the beam selection error rates are less than 10 −3 in typical urban mmWave mobile channels and traveling speeds even if the transmit power is only 10 dBm.}

	abstract = {Wireless links using massive MIMO transceivers are vital for next generation wireless communications networks. Precoding in Massive MIMO transmission requires accurate downlink channel state information (CSI). Many recent works have effectively applied deep learning (DL) to jointly train UE-side compression networks for delay domain CSI and a BS-side decoding scheme. Vitally, these works assume that the full delay domain CSI is available at the UE, but in reality, the UE must estimate the delay domain based on a limited number of frequency domain pilots. In this work, we propose a linear pilot-to-delay estimator (P2DE) that acquires the truncated delay CSI via sparse frequency pilots. We show the accuracy of the P2DE under frequency downsampling, and we demonstrate the P2DE’s efficacy when utilized with existing CSI estimation networks. Additionally, we propose to use trainable compressed sensing (CS) networks in a differential encoding network for time-varying CSI estimation, and we propose a new network, MarkovNet-ISTA-ENet (MN-IE), which combines a CS network for initial CSI estimation and multiple autoencoders to estimate the error terms. We demonstrate that MN-IE has better asymptotic performance than networks comprised of only one type of network.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) enables the computation-intensive and latency-critical application to be processed at the network edge, which reduces the transmission latency and energy consumption. The quality of the wireless channel seriously affects the performance of the edge network. Consequently, the performance of the edge network can be significantly improved from the perspective of communication. The recently advocated intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) intelligently controls the radio propagation environment to improve the quality of wireless communication links. This paper proposes an edge heterogeneous network with the assistance of intelligent reflecting surface. Specifically, the macro base station and small base stations are equipped with MEC servers, and IRS is adopted to provide an additional computation offloading link. The user association, computation offloading and resource allocation, as well as IRS phase shift design are optimized with the aim of minimizing the long-term energy consumption subject to the constraints imposed on quality of service (QoS) and available resources. The challenge of the optimization problem is rooted from the fact that update timescale of user association is different from others. Hence, a two-timescale mechanism is invoked by marrying tools from matching theory and deep reinforcement learning. More specifically, the user association decision takes place in the long timescale. In the short timescale, the computation offloading, resource allocation and IRS phase shift design strategy is performed. The effectiveness of the proposed two-timescale mechanism is verified by the simulation results.}

Owing to its impulsive nature, the characterization of such noise is critically important and fundamentally different from the existing analysis. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of power system electromagnetic impulse noise in smart grid environment on the performance of wireless communication between the grid health monitoring devices (e.g., Phasor Measurement Units) and the local data concentrator. It uses a classical approach to the derivation of a re-parameterized impulse noise model from its characteristic function. A comparison of outage probability between the corona impulse noise (CIN)-ridden and noise-free channel is studied. The study is extended for comparison with co-channel interference (CCI) for establishing a better understanding of the power specific electromagnetic impulse noise. A modified performance metric called signal-to-pulse-noise ratio is defined and its probability distribution is derived and compared with the additive white Gaussian noise, CIN and CCI-ridden channel statistics. The physical layer wireless channel characterization analysis is extended further to study the average system throughput via Markov modeling of the channel.}

	abstract = {Anintelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless-powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) system is conceived, where each device’s computational task can be divided into two parts for local computing and offloading to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, respectively. Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes are considered for uplink (UL) offloading. To fully unleash the potential benefits of the IRS, employing multiple IRS beamforming (BF) patterns/vectors in the considered operating frame to create time-selectivity channels, i.e., dynamic IRS BF (DIBF), is in principle possible at the cost of additional signaling overhead. To strike a balance between the system performance and associated signalling overhead, we propose three cases of DIBF configurations based on the maximum number of IRS reconfiguration times. The degree-of-freedom provided by the IRS may introduce different impacts on the TDMA and NOMA-based UL offloading schemes. Thus, it is still fundamentally unknown which multiple access scheme is superior for MEC UL offloading by considering the impact of the IRS. To answer this question, we provide a comprehensively theoretical performance comparison for the TDMA and NOMA-based offloading schemes under the three cases of DIBF configurations by characterizing their achievable computation rate. Analytical results demonstrate that offloading adopting TDMA can achieve the same computation rate as that of NOMA, when all the devices share the same IRS BF vector during the UL offloading. By contrast, computation offloading exploiting TDMA outperforms NOMA, when the IRS BF vector can be flexibly adapted for UL offloading. Then, we propose computationally efficient algorithms by invoking alternating optimization for solving their associated computation rate maximization problems. Our numerical results demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed designs over various benchmark schemes and also unveil that the optimal time allocated to downlink wireless power transfer can be effectively reduced with the aid of IRSs, which is beneficial for both the system’s spectral efficiency and its energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a new concept of employing intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance the monitoring performance of wireless information surveillance system, where a full-duplex legitimate monitor is employed to eavesdrop the suspicious transmission from a transmitter to a receiver with the help of an IRS. Under this setup, we consider three IRS deployment strategies, where the IRS is placed near the suspicious transmitter, the suspicious receiver and the legitimate monitor, respectively. First, the monitoring rate achievable by the IRS-aided surveillance system under each deployment strategy is analyzed, which reveals that deploying the IRS near the suspicions transmitter achieves the maximum rate with an asymptotically large number of IRS reflecting elements. Next, efficient algorithms are proposed to maximize the monitoring rate by jointly optimizing the receive and jamming beamforming vectors at the legitimate monitor and the reflection coefficients at the IRS. In particular, a performance upper bound is obtained via properly characterizing the upper and lower bounds of the jamming signal power and using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), while low-complexity algorithms based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework are also presented to achieve near-optimal performance. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate our analysis as well as the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and useful insights are drawn.}

This approach enables us to examine the effect of practical phenomena such as impulsive noise on SS problems. In this general framework, we propose a detector based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with favorable performance under various noise models. The proposed model-free and data-driven CNN offers robustness in diverse noise scenarios. Thus, it can be utilized in environments with different physical behaviors. We demonstrate this method outperforms the highly regarded likelihood ratio test (LRT) in most cases. For all impulsive cases, the proposed CNN is the superior detector, providing a near-optimum performance for the conventional Gaussian noise. We indicate the proposed data-driven CNN offers an appropriate alternative solution to LRT. However, it requires more computational operations, a rich training dataset, and a training process, instead. Furthermore, the main rationale for proposing this CNN is that it enables the network to generalize its effective performance to various noise models and cases. To this end, quantitative simulations confirm superiority of the proposed CNN compared to other recent deep-learning methods.}

	abstract = {Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing involves several challenges. In particular, the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) must ensure —before deploying each slice—that corresponding requirements can be met throughout its lifetime. For ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) slices, the MNO must guarantee the packet transmission delay within a delay budget with a certain probability. Most existing solutions focus on allocating dynamically radio resources to maximize the number of packets, whose transmission delay is within the delay budget. However, these solutions do not ensure the violation probability is below a target value in the long term. In this paper, we focus on slicing from a planning perspective. Specifically, we propose a Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC)-based model, which given the amount of radio resources allocated for a uRLLC slice, the target violation probability and the traffic demand distribution, provides the delay bound for such conditions. Additionally, we propose heuristics for planning uRLLC slices. Interestingly, such heuristics benefit from the proposed SNC-based model to compute the amount of radio resources to be assigned to each slice while its delay bound, given a target violation probability, is within the delay budget. We validate the SNC-based model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristics.}

By incorporating the finite antenna size constraint using Chu’s theory and under the assumption of canonical-minimum scattering (CMS), we derive the MC between two radiating volumes of fixed sizes. Expressions for the self and mutual impedances are obtained by the use of the reciprocity theorem. Based on a circuit-theoretic two-port model for SISO radio communication systems, we first establish its input-output relationship where the noise depends on the self/mutual impedances of the antennas, unlike the conventional assumption of independent additive white Gaussian noise. We then characterise the achievable data rate for a given pair of transmit and receive antenna sizes, thereby providing an upper bound on the system performance under physical size constraints. Through the lens of these findings, we shed new light on the influence of MC on the information-theoretic limits of near-field communications using compact antennas.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely considered as one of the key enabling techniques for future wireless communication networks owing to its ability of dynamically controlling the phase shift of reflected electromagnetic (EM) waves to construct a favorable propagation environment. While IRS only focuses on signal reflection, the recently emerged innovative concept of intelligent omni-surface (IOS) can provide the dual functionality of manipulating reflecting and transmitting signals. Thus, IOS is a new paradigm for achieving ubiquitous wireless communications. In this paper, we consider an IOS-assisted multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) system where the IOS utilizes its reflective and transmissive properties to enhance the MU-MISO transmission. Both power minimization and sum-rate maximization problems are solved by exploiting the second-order cone programming (SOCP), Riemannian manifold, weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Simulation results verify the advancements of the IOS for wireless systems and illustrate the significant performance improvement of our proposed joint transmit beamforming, reflecting and transmitting phase-shift, and IOS energy division design algorithms. Compared with conventional IRS, IOS can significantly extend the communication coverage, enhance the strength of received signals, and improve the quality of communication links.}

A closed-form asymptotic approximation of the UB-QDVP is developed by proving the asymptotic convergence of the Mellin transform and its finite-length truncations. Given the closed-form asymptotic UB-QDVP, we propose two power allocation schemes. The first scheme minimizes the transmit power of a NOMA user pair while guaranteeing the statistical delay QoS of the pair. The second maximizes the\nα\n-utility function of the effective capacity of the user pair, striking a balance between the energy efficiency and user fairness of uplink NOMA systems.

	abstract = {Driven by the rapid growth of Internet of Things applications, tremendous data need to be collected by sensors and uploaded to the servers for further process. As a promising solution, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) enables controllable sensing and transmission processes of multiple types of data in a single device. Despite the appealing advantages, existing works on MCS have mostly simplified two design issues, namely joint control of sensing and transmission processes and corresponding energy consumption. To address the above issues, a single-user MCS system is considered with a typical MCS device sensing and transmitting data to a server in a given time duration. In particular, there exists a busy time interval when the device is incapable of sensing. To minimize the sensing-and-transmission energy consumption of the device, an optimization problem is formulated, where the sensing and transmission rates are jointly optimized over time subjecting to the constraints on the sensing data sizes, transmission data sizes, data casualty, and busy time of sensing. This problem is highly challenging due to the coupling between the rates as well as the existence of the busy time. To deal with this problem, we first show that it can be equivalently decomposed into two subproblems, corresponding to a search for the amount of data size that needs to be sensed before the busy time (referred to as the height), as well as the control of sensing and transmission rates given the height. Next, we show that the latter problem can be efficiently solved by using the classical string-pulling method, while an efficient algorithm is proposed to progressively find the optimal height without the exhaustive search. Moreover, the solution approach is extended to a more complex scenario where there is a finite-size buffer at the server for receiving data. Last, simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs.}

	abstract = {Ambient LoRa backscatter enables battery-free wireless communication with long-range connectivity for the Internet of Things. However, current efforts mainly focus on symbol-level modulation, which trades considerable data rates for long backscatter ranges. To enhance the data rate, this paper presents and prototypes Pacim, which fully explores the potential of long-period LoRa chirps and conveys additional information by varying symbol lengths. Specifically, we propose the chirp interval modulation scheme that modulates multiple data bits in each time interval between two chirp-based anchor symbols. Moreover, we design a twin-chirp cancellation method at the receiver that eliminates the frequency discontinuity within anchor symbols, and propose a fine-grained detection algorithm to measure the arrival time of anchor symbols in the frequency domain. We further propose three reliable methods to improve transmission reliability and analyze the symbol error rate (SER) performance. We also build a hardware prototype and perform comprehensive evaluations. Our experiment results show that Pacim can achieve up to\n8.6×\nthroughput gain while keeping long-range, compared with the state-of-the-art ambient LoRa backscatter design.}

	abstract = {Maintaining freshness of data collection in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks has attracted increasing attention. By taking into account age-of-information (AoI), we investigate the trajectory planning problem of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is used to aid a cluster-based IoT network. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total AoI of the collected data by the UAV from the ground IoT network. Since the total AoI of the IoT network depends on the flight time of the UAV and the data collection time at hovering points, we jointly optimize the selection of hovering points and the visiting order to these points. We exploit the state-of-the-art transformer and the weighted A*, which is a path search algorithm, to design a machine learning algorithm to solve the formulated problem. The whole UAV-IoT system is fed into the encoder network of the proposed algorithm, and the algorithm’s decoder network outputs the visiting order to ground clusters. Then, the weighted A* is used to find the hovering point for each cluster in the ground IoT network. Simulation results show that the trained model by the proposed algorithm has a good generalization ability to generate solutions for IoT networks with different numbers of ground clusters, without the need to retrain the model. Furthermore, results show that our proposed algorithm can find better UAV trajectories with the minimum total AoI when compared to other algorithms.}

To address the non-convex nature of the problem, the proposed method consists of modular structures inspired by a classical iterative suboptimal approach and enhanced with learnable components. More precisely, we propose a deep unfolding of the successive concave approximation (SCA) method. In our unfolded SCA (USCA) framework, the originally preset parameters are now learnable via graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) that directly exploit multi-user channel state information as the underlying graph adjacency matrix. We show the permutation equivariance of the proposed architecture, which is a desirable property for models applied to wireless network data. The USCA framework is trained through a stochastic gradient descent approach using a progressive training strategy. The unsupervised loss is carefully devised to feature the monotonic property of the objective under maximum power constraints. Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate its generalizability across different network topologies of varying size, density, and channel distribution. Thorough comparisons illustrate the improved performance and robustness of USCA over state-of-the-art benchmarks.}

Existing researches ignore the problem that secrecy rate can not be calculated if the eavesdropper’s instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unknown. Furthermore, without the secrecy rate expression, beamforming and phase shifter optimization with the purpose of PLS enhancement is not available. To address these problems, we first give the expression of secrecy outage probability for any beamforming vector and phase shifter matrix as the RIS-assisted PLS metric, which is measured based on the eavesdropper’s statistical CSI. Then, with the aid of the expression, we formulate the minimization problem of secrecy outage probability that is solved via alternately optimizing beamforming vectors and phase shift matrices. In the case of single-antenna transmitter or single-antenna legitimate receiver, the proposed alternating optimization (AO) scheme can be simplified to reduce computational complexity. Finally, it is demonstrated that the secrecy outage probability is significantly reduced with the proposed methods compared to current RIS-assisted PLS systems.}

	abstract = {In fully-connected passive RFID backscatter networks, it is challenging to provide accurate range estimations due to complex channels. Facing this problem, we propose a differential analysis based anti-multipath technique by introducing a reference tag. Through the linear difference between target tag received power measurements with the reference tag activated and not, the power with respect to the reader-reference-target link is separated out from the mixed measurements, achieving the mitigation of multipath and accurately ranging. Under distributed localization schemes, after breaking down the full network into a series of fragments, it is vital but challenging to determine how to assemble them satisfactorily. VIABLE, virtual-actual assembling algorithm, is proposed to achieve distributed and cooperative localization. The virtual assembling phase rectifies the fragments over and over until their errors converge, which enables the mining of a satisfactory and adaptive assembling order. Subsequently, the actual phase assembles the rectified fragments together with that order and accomplishes the overall localization accurately. The theoretical analysis of performance limit is presented via the derivation of Cramér-Rao lower bound approximated by a particle approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing algorithms for cooperative localization.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is very promising for wireless networks to achieve high energy efficiency, extended coverage, improved capacity, massive connectivity, etc. To unleash the full potentials of RIS-aided communications, acquiring accurate channel state information is crucial, which however is very challenging. For RIS-aided multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications, the existing channel estimation methods have computational complexity growing rapidly with the number of RIS units\nN\n(e.g., in the order of\nN\n2\nor\nN\n3\n) and/or have special requirements on the matrices involved (e.g., the matrices need to be sparse for algorithm convergence to achieve satisfactory performance), which hinder their applications. In this work, instead of using the conventional signal model in the literature, we derive a new signal model obtained through proper vectorization and reduction operations. Then, leveraging the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop a more efficient channel estimator that has complexity linear with\nN\nand does not have special requirements on the relevant matrices, thanks to the robustness of UAMP. These facilitate the applications of the proposed algorithm to a general RIS-aided MIMO system with a larger\nN\n. Moreover, extensive numerical results show that the proposed estimator delivers much better performance and/or requires significantly less number of training symbols, thereby leading to notable reductions in both training overhead and latency.}

However, studies in the literature mostly focus on the particular algorithms and setups of such networks, while their theoretical understanding and characterization has been less explored. To fill this gap, this paper conducts the asymptotic (scaling-law) analysis for the delay-outage tradeoff of noise-limited wireless edge networks with joint 3C. In particular, assuming the user requests for different tasks following a Zipf distribution, we derive the analytical expression for the optimal caching policy. Based on this, we next derive the closed-form expression for the optimum outage probability as a function of delay and other network parameters for the case that the Zipf parameter is smaller than 1. Then, for the case that the Zipf parameter is larger than 1, we derive the closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds of the optimum outage probability. We provide insights and interpretations based on the derived expressions. Computer simulations validate our analytical results and insights.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the joint device activity detection and channel estimation problem in a massive Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity system, where a large number of IoT devices exist but merely a random subset of them become active for short-packet transmission in each coherence block. In particular, we propose to leverage the temporal correlation in device activity, e.g., a device active in the previous coherence block is more likely to be still active in the current coherence block, to improve the detection and estimation performance. However, it is challenging to utilize this temporal correlation as side information (SI), which relies on the knowledge about the exact statistical relation between the estimated activity pattern for the previous coherence block (which may be imperfect with unknown error) and the true activity pattern in the current coherence block. To tackle this challenge, we establish a novel SI-aided multiple measurement vector approximate message passing (MMV-AMP) framework. Specifically, thanks to the state evolution of the MMV-AMP algorithm, the correlation between the activity pattern estimated by the MMV-AMP algorithm in the previous coherence block and the real activity pattern in the current coherence block is quantified explicitly. Based on the well-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this useful SI into the denoiser design under the MMV-AMP framework. Specifically, the SI-based soft-thresholding denoiser with binary thresholds and the SI-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser are characterized for the cases without and with the knowledge of the channel distribution, respectively. Numerical results are given to show the significant gain in device activity detection and channel estimation performance brought by our proposed SI-aided MMV-AMP framework.}

We study a channel model that includes the key practical aspects that arise when utilizing dual-polarization: channel cross-polar discrimination (XPD) and cross-polar correlations (XPC) at the transmitter and receiver. We derive the achievable uplink and downlink spectral efficiencies (SE) with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC) when using the linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE), zero-forcing (ZF), and maximum ratio (MR) combining/precoding schemes. The expressions depend on the statistical properties of the MMSE channel estimator obtained for the dual-polarized channel model. Closed-form uplink and downlink SE expressions for MR combining/precoding are derived. Using these expressions, we propose power-control algorithms that maximize the uplink and downlink sum SEs under uncorrelated fading but can be used to enhance performance also with correlated fading. We compare the SEs achieved in dual-polarized and uni-polarized setups numerically and evaluate the impact of XPD and XPC conditions. The simulations reveal that dual-polarized setups achieve 40-60% higher SEs and the gains remain also under severe XPD and XPC. Dual-polarized also systems benefit more from advanced signal processing that compensates for imperfections.}

However, before an eventual system design and deployment can proceed, detailed channel sounding measurements are required to understand key channel characteristics. In this paper, we present a first extensive set of channel measurements for urban outdoor environments that are ultra-wideband, and double-directional where both transmitter and receiver are at the same height. In all, we present measurements at 38 locations, consisting of nearly 50,000 impulse responses, representing both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases in the 1-100 m range between 145-146 GHz. We provide modeling for path loss, shadowing, delay spread, angular spread, multipath component (MPC) power distribution and Qtapnumber. We find, among other things, that outdoor communication over tens of meters is feasible in this frequency range even in NLoS scenarios, that omni-directional delay spreads of up to 100 ns, and directional delay spreads of up to 10 ns are observed, while angular spreads are also quite significant, and a surprisingly large number of MPCs are observed for 1 GHz bandwidth and 13° beamwidth. These results constitute an important first step towards better understanding the wireless channel in the THz band.}

	abstract = {Grant-free random access is a promising mechanism to support modern massive machine-type communications in which devices are sporadically active with small payloads. Under this random access, a unique challenge is the detection of device activity without the cooperation from devices. Furthermore, for only a few bits of data, it is more efficient to embed the data to the signature sequences so that the activity and data detection can be jointly carried out. However, compared with the vanilla device activity detection, joint activity and data detection has an extra discontinuous sparsity constraint, which makes the detection problem more challenging. In contrast to the prevalent way of first neglecting the discontinuous sparsity constraint and reinforcing it at the end, this paper proposes a novel approach to incorporate the discontinuous sparsity constraint into the optimization procedure. In particular, we first establish the equivalence between the discontinuous sparsity constraint and a continuous difference-of-norms (DN) form. Then, by introducing a DN penalty term in the objective function, an iterative DN penalty method with an increasing penalty weight is adopted. We prove theoretically that by solving each penalized problem to a stationary solution, the discontinuous sparsity constraint can be exactly satisfied when the penalty weight is sufficiently large, and the resulting solution is guaranteed to be at least a stationary point of the original problem. Due to the superior theoretical guarantee, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves around 10 times better detection performance than state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles as base stations (UAV-BSs) are recognized as effective means for tackling eruptive communication service requirements especially when terrestrial infrastructures are unavailable. Quality of service (QoS) received by ground terminals (GTs) highly depends on the spatial movement of UAV-BSs. In this paper, we investigate the cooperative trajectory design problem of multiple UAV-BSs towards fair throughput maximization of GTs. Considering the restriction of coverage and sensing, we first propose a heterogeneous-graph-based formulation of relations between GTs and UAV-BSs. Subsequently, we design a framework named graph vision and communication (GVis&Comm) to 1) let each UAV-BS efficiently manage time-varying local observations; 2) facilitate cooperation between UAV-BSs through explicit information exchange. To further reduce the overhead of over-the-air cooperation, we realize discretization of the message passing process among UAV-BSs while still enabling end-to-end training. By leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), UAV-BSs as agents learn a distributed trajectory design policy. Extensive numerical simulation shows that our framework on the one hand achieves remarkable efficiency in processing local observations of each UAV-BS, and on the other improves the overall network performance via close cooperation among UAV-BSs.}

	abstract = {This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless powered sensor network (WPSN), where sensor nodes of multiple types can simultaneously harvest radio-frequency energy from the UAV and then transmit sensing data by using harvested energy. A joint distributed beamforming (DBF) and backscattering scheme is designed, in which the sensor nodes of one type can perform DBF while the sensor nodes of other types perform distributed backscattering (DBS) to improve the received signal strength. A sum-throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing DBF phases, DBS phases, and time allocation (TA), subject to the received signal-to-noise ratio constraints. Since the formulated problem is difficult to be solved due to the tightly coupled optimizing variables, the problem is decoupled into a TA subproblem and a phase optimization subproblem, and then a two-step algorithm is proposed to solve them. Firstly, the closed-form solution for the TA subproblem is derived according to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Secondly, based on iterative optimization and one-dimensional search methods, a centralized algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution for the phase optimization subproblem. Moreover, a decentralized algorithm that obtains the suboptimal solution is proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on throughput enhancement.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the design of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver, which operates over time-frequency doubly selective (DS) channels and uses a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to quantize the received signal. The time-varying multipaths in DS channel and the nonlinear quantization distortion caused by low-resolution ADC, destroy the orthogonality among OFDM subcarriers, incurring severe inter-carrier interference (ICI). Therefore, joint channel-and-data estimation is preferred, since in this way one can effectively tackle the ICI and make the best of the quantized signal in each OFDM symbol. In this paper, we elaborately develop the joint estimation scheme by casting the problem into the Bayesian inference framework. The proposed scheme not only takes into account of the nonlinear quantization in a probabilistic manner, but also exploits the channel sparsity enabled by the basis expansion model (BEM) approximation to DS channels. Furthermore, to benchmark the proposed scheme, we derive the asymptotic theoretical bounds in the large-system regime. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve the performance close to the theoretical bounds, thereby verifying the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) communications has been envisioned as a prominent technology for future wireless networks, since it is capable of simultaneously providing abundant spectrum resources and favorable propagation environments. The small wavelength at mmWave bands also enables the widespread use of large antenna arrays, of which the hybrid beamforming structure has emerged as a cost-effective solution. In this paper, we aim to minimize the sum-mean-square-error (sum-MSE) in the RIS-assisted mmWave multiuser multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) system by jointly optimizing the hybrid analog-digital precoders and the RIS reflection matrix. We demonstrate that the role of RIS in assisting mmWave communications can be completely replaced by a large-scale Kronecker-structured hybrid array. Moreover, an accelerated Riemannian gradient algorithm using majorization minimization technique is proposed to tackle the unit-modulus constrained analog precoder/RIS design. Under the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI), we firstly consider the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) setup and propose an effective alternating minimization (AM) procedure to characterize the system performance limit. Moreover, a two-stage scheme is developed for low-complexity implementation. This AM procedure is then extended to the general MU-MIMO scenario. In addition, we develop a novel enhanced regularized zero-forcing (ERZF) scheme for simultaneously combating strong noise in the low-SNR regime and mitigating multi-user interference (MUI) in the high-SNR regime. The optimality of our proposed algorithms is validated for some simplified practical scenarios. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithms outperform existing benchmark schemes in terms of the actual complexity and performance.}

	abstract = {In this work, we analyze the downlink performance of a cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output system with finite capacity fronthaul links between the centralized baseband unit and the access point (APs). Conditioned on the user and AP locations, we first derive an achievable rate for a randomly selected user in the network that captures the effect of finite fronthaul capacity as a compression error. From this expression, we establish that for the traditional cell-free architecture where each AP serves all the users in the network, the achievable rate becomes zero as the network size grows. Hence, to have a meaningful analysis, for the traditional architecture, we model the user and AP locations as two independent binomial point processes over a finite region and provide an accurate theoretical result to determine the user rate coverage. In contrast, for an asymptotically large network, we consider a user-centric architecture where each user in the network is served by a specified number of nearest APs that limits the fronthaul load. For this architecture, we model the AP and user locations as two independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). Since the rate expression is a function of the number of users served by an AP, we statistically characterize the load in terms of the number of users per AP. As the exact derivation of the probability mass function of the load is intractable, we first present the exact expressions for the first two moments of the load. Next, we approximate the load as a negative binomial random variable through the moment matching method. Using the load results along with appropriate distance distributions of a PPP, we present an accurate theoretical expression for the rate coverage of the typical user. From the analyses, we conclude that for the traditional architecture when the AP transmit power is relatively high, a more collocated antenna deployment is preferred. Further, for the user-centric architecture, the energy efficiency of the system is a concave function of the number of antennas per AP.}

	abstract = {Immersive video, such as virtual reality (VR) and multi-view videos, is growing in popularity. Its wireless streaming is an instance of general multicast, extending conventional unicast and multicast, whose effective design is still open. This paper investigates general rate splitting for general multicast. Specifically, we consider a multi-carrier single-cell wireless network where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates to multiple single-antenna users via general multicast. We consider linear beamforming at the BS and joint decoding at each user in the slow fading and fast fading scenarios. In the slow fading scenario, we consider the maximization of the weighted sum average rate, which is a challenging nonconvex stochastic problem with numerous variables. To reduce computational complexity, we decouple the original nonconvex stochastic problem into multiple nonconvex deterministic problems, one for each system channel state. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm for each deterministic problem to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). In the fast fading scenario, we consider the maximization of the weighted sum ergodic rate. This problem is more challenging than the one for the slow fading scenario, as it is not separable. First, we propose a stochastic iterative algorithm to obtain a KKT point using stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) and the exact penalty method. Then, we propose two low-complexity iterative algorithms to obtain feasible points with promising performance for two cases of channel distributions using approximation and CCCP. The proposed optimization framework generalizes the existing ones for rate splitting for various types of services. Finally, we numerically show substantial gains of the proposed solutions over existing schemes in both scenarios and reveal the design insights of general rate splitting for general multicast.}

	abstract = {Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is a general multiple access scheme for downlink multi-antenna systems embracing both classical spatial division multiple access and more recent non-orthogonal multiple access. Finding a linear precoding strategy that maximizes the sum spectral efficiency of RSMA is a challenging yet significant problem. In this paper, we put forth a novel precoder design framework that jointly finds the linear precoders for the common and private messages for RSMA. Our approach is first to approximate the non-smooth minimum function part in the sum spectral efficiency of RSMA using a LogSumExp technique. Then, we reformulate the sum spectral efficiency maximization problem as a form of the log-sum of Rayleigh quotients to convert it into a tractable form. By interpreting the first-order optimality condition of the reformulated problem as an eigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problem, we reveal that the leading eigenvector of the derived optimality condition is a local optimal solution. To find the leading eigenvector, we propose an algorithm inspired by a power iteration. Simulation results show that the proposed RSMA transmission strategy provides significant improvement in the sum spectral efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art RSMA transmission methods.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the implementation of compressive sensing (CS) approaches for beam alignment (BA) in multiuser millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. We particularly consider wideband time-varying channels in the practical low SNR regime. We examine two different time scales for beam-switching in the BA training phase at both the base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE). We also compare different time scales for running the CS algorithm at the UE, with their corresponding overhead and complexity. We propose an overarching trial-based protocol that re- initializes the BA process at particular times. We also propose a new approach to designing the CS sensing matrix (SM), based on a deterministic construction. Rows of our proposed SM are Kronecker product decomposable, making it ideal for the BA problem. We show that when block-based beam switching is employed in combination with running the CS algorithm Every Epoch (CS-EE), our proposed SM gives superior performance compared to the other approaches. Moreover, our proposed overarching trial-based protocol enhances the performance even further. We also show that running the CS algorithm Every Block (CS-EB) outperforms CS-EE at the cost of higher complexity and overhead.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are distinctly characterized by their array non-stationarity, which has not been considered in the existing beam domain channel models (BDCMs). In this paper, the array non-stationarity of massive MIMO channels is modeled by the spatially consistent visibility regions (VRs) over a large uniform planar array (UPA) in terms of individual multipath components (MPCs). Based on this, a novel three-dimensional (3D) BDCM incorporating the effects of array non-stationarity is proposed. Statistical properties of the proposed BDCM including channel power, power leakage, space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), and beam spread are derived. The ergodic and outage capacities are evaluated. The impacts of array non-stationarity on those statistics and channel capacity are analyzed. Results suggest that the beamwidths or spatial resolutions of the BDCM for different directions are not equal due to the array non-stationarity. This in turn increases the power leakage and correlation between channel elements and reduces the beam domain channel capacity.}

	abstract = {To accommodate the explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), incorporating interference alignment (IA) into existing multiple access (MA) schemes is under investigation. However, when it is applied in MIMO networks to improve the system capacity, the new problem regarding information delay arises which does not meet the requirement of low-latency. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a new metric named degree of delay (DoD) to quantify the issue of information delay. By analyzing DoD with classical transmission schemes, it can be seen that the information latency does affect the performance of the system. To cope with this issue, hybrid antenna array based partial interference elimination and retrospective interference regeneration scheme (HAA-PIE-RIR) is first proposed. It achieves optimal performance in 2-user MIMO scenarios, but suffers a performance loss in\nK\n-user MIMO scenarios. Then, the improved HAA-PIE-RIR scheme (HAA-IPIE-RIR), and HAA based cyclic interference elimination and RIR scheme (HAA-CIE-RIR) are proposed. The former achieves optimal performance in\nK\n-user MIMO scenarios, but requires heavy computational cost. The latter is a trade-off scheme considering performance and computational cost comprehensively. Overall, our proposed schemes can obtain lower DoD and higher DoF than that of traditional IA schemes.}

	abstract = {Edge caching has emerged as a promising technique against latency caused by explosive growth of mobile data traffic through caching popular contents at the edge networks. However, the dynamically changing content popularity nature and limited caching capacity make it challenging to design an effective caching scheme to reduce latency. To solve this, a learning-based hierarchical edge caching (LHEC) scheme is proposed in this work. We first propose a novel deep learning architecture, namely Stacked Autoencoder-Long Short Term Memory Network (SAE-LSTMNet) to capture both the correlation of the request patterns among different content and the periodicity in time domain to improve the prediction accuracy of the content popularity. Then, to predict the popularity of these newly-added contents, a dynamic content catalog is introduced and a similarity-based content popularity prediction (SCPP) approach is proposed. Based on the content popularity prediction, a hierarchical edge caching optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average content downloading latency. Since the formulated problem is NP-hard and difficult to be solved, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to obtain the near-optimal solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed content popularity prediction approach outperforms up to 6.36% in terms of the mean absolute error compared with the state-of-the-art methods and the proposed LHEC scheme reduces the average downloading latency at about 5.3%~7.9% compared with those existing caching schemes.}

	abstract = {In many real-time applications, timely accessibility to actionable insights is an important requirement. We consider users equipped with sensors and actuators, where the sensors generate updates which need to be processed for driving the actuators. The processing task can be carried out locally or at an edge server located at a common base station (BS). The users access the BS via a fading multiple access channel (MAC) using a non-orthogonal multiple access technique. To measure the timeliness of processed information, we adopt a metric called age of processed information (AoPI), defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the last successfully processed packet available to the user. In this setting, we formulate an average AoPI minimization problem, when users are subjected to average power constraints. The BS has to decide when the users should generate status updates and whether to process them locally or at the edge server. We cast the problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and obtain its solution via Lagrangian relaxation. We then obtain a simpler policy via Lyapunov optimization and bound its performance. Via numerical simulations, we finally illustrate properties of the CMDP solution and study behavior of average AoPIs under different policies when problem parameters are varied.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the fundamental multiple access (MA) scheme in an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) system, where an active IRS is deployed to assist the uplink transmission from multiple IoT devices to an access point (AP). Our goal is to maximize the sum throughput by optimizing the IRS beamforming vectors across time and resource allocation. To this end, we first study two typical active IRS aided MA schemes, namely time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), by analytically comparing their achievable sum throughput and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, we prove that given only one available IRS beamforming vector, the NOMA-based scheme generally achieves a larger throughput than the TDMA-based scheme, whereas the latter can potentially outperform the former if multiple IRS beamforming vectors are available to harness the favorable time selectivity of the IRS. To strike a flexible balance between the system performance and the associated signaling overhead incurred by more IRS beamforming vectors, we then propose a general hybrid TDMA-NOMA scheme with device grouping, where the devices in the same group transmit simultaneously via NOMA while devices in different groups occupy orthogonal time slots. By controlling the number of groups, the hybrid TDMA-NOMA scheme is applicable for any given number of IRS beamforming vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the considered optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, where each subproblem is solved optimally. Simulation results illustrate the practical superiorities of the active IRS over the passive IRS in terms of the coverage extension and supporting multiple energy-limited devices, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid MA scheme for flexibly balancing the performance-cost tradeoff.}

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been demonstrated to enhance parameter estimation performance for target tracking. In this paper, a prior information based quantizer design framework is proposed for target tracking for WSNs. In the proposed framework, the imperfect wireless channels between local sensors and the fusion center are considered. To make full use of the historical states and measurements embedded into the Bayesian tracking methodology, the quantizer design is suggested to be implemented with considering the prior state information. To this end, a channel-aware posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) is derived based on the state prediction and further used as the performance indicator for quantizer design. Regarding target tracking, we model the quantizer design problem as a non-convex and highly nonlinear optimization problem that is intractable in general. We split the problem in terms of different scenarios, and for one-bit quantizer design based on a binary symmetric channel (BSC), we find that the optimal solution can be analytically computed. While for the general fading channel-based quantizer design problems, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to find the solutions. Meanwhile, an approximation-based channel-aware particle filter (A-CAPF) is proposed to improve the implementation efficiency of state filtering. Simulation results demonstrate the enhanced performance and execution efficiency of the proposed algorithms in the context of the BSC and Rayleigh fading channel.}

	abstract = {Multi-numerology (MN) providing a flexible transmission frame structure has attracted a considerable attention for supporting abundant services for beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks. However, mobility induces severe performance degradation under different numerologies including temporal and spectral fluctuation, which is not well-investigated in existing literature. We have conceived an MN-enabled energy efficiency (EE) problem aiming for alleviating mobility- and MN-induced interferences through moderate power and sub-carrier assignment, while considering quality-of-service (QoS) and latency requirements for different services. We propose a multi-numerology based power and resource block allocation (MNPRA) scheme considering time-/frequency-division (TD/MD) based MN leveraging temporal and spectral features among numerologies. The original non-solvable problem is theoretically transformed into a convex one by employing Dinkelbach process, Taylor approximation and difference of two concave functions (D.C.). Convergence of proposed MNPRA scheme is analyzed and verified by simulations. In simulation results, we have evaluated MNPRA under different service demands, user velocities and MN types. Our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional single-numerology framing and existing methods in open literature, which results in performances of higher EE as well as of lower throughput/delay outage probability.}

However, MTC is characterized by unprecedented traffic in cellular networks, thus posing a challenge to its successful incorporation. In this work, we propose a unified framework for amicable coexistence of MTC and HTC. We consider a heterogeneous network where machine-type devices coexist with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) devices and propose transceiver techniques that promote efficient signal recovery from these devices. For this, we present an eMBB pilot and MTC data generation strategy that facilitates joint coherent decoding of eMBB data and non-coherent decoding of MTC data. Furthermore, we assess the feasibility of coexistence using receiver operating characteristics, outage probability, and normalized mean square error (NMSE). Our numerical results reveal that a harmonious coexistence of the heterogeneous services can be achieved with properly configured average signal-to-noise ratios and pilot length.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has opened up numerous game-changing opportunities for realizing future wireless systems. In this paper, we propose an ISAC processing framework relying on millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we provide a compressed sampling (CS) perspective to facilitate ISAC processing, which can not only recover the high-dimensional channel state information or/and radar imaging information, but also significantly reduce pilot overhead. First, an energy-efficient widely spaced array (WSA) architecture is tailored for the radar receiver, which enhances the angular resolution of radar sensing at the cost of angular ambiguity. Then, we propose an ISAC frame structure for time-varying ISAC systems considering different timescales. The pilot waveforms are judiciously designed by taking into account both CS theories and hardware constraints induced by hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture. Next, we design the dedicated dictionary for WSA that serves as a building block for formulating the ISAC processing as sparse signal recovery problems. The orthogonal matching pursuit with support refinement (OMP-SR) algorithm is proposed to effectively solve the problems in the existence of the angular ambiguity. We also provide a framework for estimating the Doppler frequencies during payload data transmission to guarantee communication performances. Simulation results demonstrate the good performances of both communications and radar sensing under the proposed ISAC framework.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the allocation of shared resources between ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) in the emerging 5G and beyond cellular networks. In this paper, we design a unique queuing mechanism for the joint eMBB/URLLC system. The aim is to flexibly schedule URLLC traffic to enhance the total eMBB throughput and the reliability of URLLC packets (i.e., the probability of not dropping URLLC packets in each mini-slot) while maintaining a satisfactory transmission latency as per the 3GPP requirements. Precisely, by deriving the steady-state probabilities of URLLC queue backlog analytically, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize the total normalized eMBB throughput and the URLLC utility. Due to the stochastic nature of the objective function, it is expensive to evaluate it for any set of inputs, and thus the Bayesian optimization is applied to obtain the optimal results of such a black-box objective function. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed queuing mechanism never violates the latency requirement of the URLLC services but improves the reliability. It also enhances the total normalized eMBB throughput as compared to the method without queuing.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the emerging vital components of millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless systems. Accurate beam alignment is essential for efficient beam based mmWave communications of UAVs with base stations (BSs). Conventional beam sweeping approaches often have large overhead due to the high mobility and autonomous operation of UAVs. Learning-based approaches greatly reduce the overhead by leveraging UAV data, like position to identify optimal beam directions. In this paper, we propose a deep Q-Network(DQN)-based framework for uplink UAV-BS beam alignment where the UAV hovers around 5G new radio (NR) BS coverage area, with varying channel conditions. The proposed learning framework uses the location information and maximize the beamforming gain upon every communication request from UAV inside the multi-location environment. We compare the proposed framework against multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based and exhaustive approaches, respectively and then analyse its training performance over different coverage area requirements, antenna configurations and channel conditions. Our results show that the proposed framework converge faster than the MAB-based approach and comparable to traditional exhaustive approach in an online manner under real-time conditions. Moreover, this approach can be further enhanced to predict the optimal beams for unvisited UAV locations inside the coverage using correlation from neighbouring grid locations.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G, massive machine-type communication is expected to experience significant growth, leading to severe random access collisions. To address this issue, we first adopt deep neural networks to detect random access collisions by learning the features of the received signals. Based on the collision-detection results, we propose a double-contention random access (DCRA) scheme, with which the base station can schedule one more contention process for devices experiencing collisions. To fully harness the collision-resolution capability of the proposed DCRA scheme, we further analyze its performance and illustrate how to tune the backoff parameters to optimize the network throughput. It is revealed that the maximum throughput of the DCRA scheme depends on the number of random access preambles and the collision recognition accuracy. The corresponding optimal backoff parameters are then obtained, which greatly facilitates implementations in practice. Simulation results show that with a high collision recognition accuracy, the proposed scheme can achieve significant throughput improvement.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have been one of the promising technologies for future wireless networks that integrate a wide range of data-demanding applications. To compensate for the large channel attenuation in mmWave band and avoid high hardware cost, a lens-based beamspace massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is considered. However, the spatial-wideband effect in wideband mmWave systems makes channel estimation very challenging, especially when the receiver is equipped with a limited number of radio-frequency (RF) chains. Furthermore, the real channel data cannot be obtained before the mmWave system is used in a new environment, which makes it impossible to train a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimator using real data set beforehand. To solve the problem, we propose a model-driven unsupervised learning network, named learned denoising-based generalized expectation consistent (LDGEC) signal recovery network. By utilizing the Stein’s unbiased risk estimator loss, the LDGEC network can be trained only with limited measurements corresponding to the pilot symbols, instead of the real channel data. Even if designed for unsupervised learning, the LDGEC network can be supervisingly trained with the real channel via the denoiser-by-denoiser way. The numerical results demonstrate that the LDGEC-based channel estimator significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compressive sensing-based algorithms when the receiver is equipped with a small number of RF chains and low-resolution ADCs.}

However, the system power consumption increases sharply with the network density. In this paper, we investigate a user-centric simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) mmWave system employing a time-switching protocol at users to allow both energy harvesting (EH) and data decoding. To enable user-centric BS cooperation, adaptive BS clustering model is used to determine the user’s serving cluster based on its channel condition. Considering both linear and non-linear EH models, we analyze the joint coverage, namely, the probability that the user harvests enough energy in a given time slot and receives the required data from its serving cluster. The random serving clusters and the correlation between the amount of harvested energy and received data rate make the joint coverage analysis more challenging. A tractable tight approximation of the joint coverage probability is thus derived for ultra-dense networks. A mathematical optimization model for the time switching coefficient is also developed to maximize the system joint rate and energy coverage performance. All mathematical expressions are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that the proposed analytical framework is accurate and efficient for the design and deployment of SWIPT-enabled user-centric mmWave networks.}

An effective dynamic frequency allocation scheme is designed to eliminate inter-cell interference by using the theory of circle packing. For exact performance evaluation, the handoff probability of a typical UAV is characterized, and then the coverage probability with handoffs is attained. Simulation and numerical results corroborate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional CoMP scheme with three nearest cooperating BSs in terms of handoff and coverage probabilities.

In particular, we consider beamforming and propose a CNN which, for a given uplink channel estimate as input, outputs downlink channel information to be used for beamforming. The CNN is trained in a supervised manner considering both uplink and downlink transmissions with a loss function that is based on UE receiver performance. The main task of the neural network is to predict the channel evolution between uplink and downlink slots, but it can also learn to handle inefficiencies and errors in the whole chain, including the actual beamforming phase.

	abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles as aerial base stations (ABSs) can significantly enhance the capacity and coverage of wireless systems. In this paper, the problem of optimal ABS placement is studied while exploiting high-rise topographic features to maximize wireless coverage. In contrast to prior art that relies on simplified full line-of-sight (LoS) channel models or impractical probabilistic LoS channel models, this paper presents a novel feature-aware channel model that decisively discerns whether an air-to-ground (A2G) link is in LoS or non-LoS (NLoS) based on the topographical environment data for the target area. To resolve the challenges created by the dependence between the channel gain and the topographical environment in this feature-aware channel model, the LoS and NLoS zones in the target area are analyzed from a geometrical point of view. Then, based on the analysis results, the coverage area is derived in a tractable form and then used to develop a feature-aware ABS placement algorithm, called ABS-FA, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is compared with two other baseline algorithms based on the full LoS and probabilistic LoS channel models, called ABS-LoS and ABS-Prob, respectively. Simulation results show that, depending on the topographical environment, ABS-LoS may outperform ABS-Prob, or vice versa, and even both may be very limited in some cases, because the full LoS and probabilistic LoS channel models cannot properly capture whether an A2G link is in LoS or NLoS. The results also show that the proposed ABS-FA scheme always outperforms these baseline algorithms and that, for instance, it can provide approximately 25% and 50% higher coverage performance compared to ABS-Prob and ABS-LoS, respectively. These results verify that considering a feature-aware channel model can be a very effective approach for determining the ABS location.}

	abstract = {Due to increasing demands of seamless connection and massive information exchange across the world, the integrated satellite-terrestrial communication systems develop rapidly. To shed lights on the design of this system, we consider an uplink communication model consisting of a single satellite, a single terrestrial station and multiple ground users. The terrestrial station uses decode-and-forward (DF) to facilitate the communication between ground users and the satellite. The channel between the satellite and the terrestrial station is assumed to be a quasi-static shadowed Rician fading channel, while the channels between the terrestrial station and ground users are assumed to experience independent quasi-static Rayleigh fading. We consider two cases of channel state information (CSI) availability. When perfect CSI is available, we derive the instantaneous achievable sum rate of all ground users and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate. When only channel distribution information (CDI) is available, we derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability and formulate another optimization problem to minimize the outage probability. Both optimization problems correspond to scheduling algorithms for ground users. For both cases, we propose low-complexity user scheduling algorithms and demonstrate the efficiency of our scheduling algorithms via numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {The 6G network enables a subnetwork-wide evolution, resulting in a “network of subnetworks”. However, due to the dynamic mobility of wireless subnetworks, the data transmission of intra-subnetwork and inter-subnetwork will inevitably interfere with each other, which poses a great challenge to radio resource management. Moreover, most existing approaches require the instantaneous channel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent radio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal strength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However, to directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible thing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net, which integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of inter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and excludes the impact of unrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head attention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will impact individual throughput. Experimental results prove that our proposed framework significantly outperforms both traditional and MARL-based methods in various aspects.}

	abstract = {With the rapid advance of wireless communication technologies, the promising space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) are advocated to provide ubiquitous multicast transmission services for the social community constituted by a group of mobile users that have strong social ties and similar content interests. However, due to the limited yet valuable spectrum resources, the network heterogeneity, and diverse service demands of mobile users, it is challenging to efficiently allocate bandwidth for social communities with the objective of achieving satisfactory quality of experience (QoE) in SAGINs. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical bandwidth allocation scheme to enable high-quality multicast services for social communities in SAGINs. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical bandwidth allocation framework. Wherein, the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite is utilized to provide space-to-air (S2A) unicast bandwidth for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at a certain price. Each UAV is employed to provide air-to-ground (A2G) multicast bandwidth for ground social communities with a certain A2G multicast bandwidth charge. We then formulate the hierarchical bandwidth allocation problem as a four-stage Stackelberg game, where the target of each participant is to maximize its own utility. Afterward, through the game analysis by the backward induction method, the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved, where the closed-form solutions on the optimal policies of both the social communities and UAVs are derived by the convex optimization method, and the optimal pricing policies of the LEO satellite is achieved by a proposed gradient descent iteration algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can greatly increase the utilities of social communities while consuming a less bandwidth compared to conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz)-band (0.1–10 THz) communication will be key in enabling high speed wireless links due to the wide available bandwidths. At THz frequencies, the path-loss is governed by high spreading loss due to small antenna apertures and by molecular absorption loss due to water vapor. The latter also determines the available transmission bandwidth, which shrinks with distance. Modulations that consider the high propagation loss and the distance-dependent bandwidth are needed to fully exploit the THz channel’s bandwidth. Using a hierarchical constellation to simultaneously service users at symbol rates, Hierarchical Bandwidth Modulation (HBM) leverages molecular absorption to increase aggregate data rates in a broadcast system while offering flexibility to receivers experiencing high path loss. This paper introduces HBM and evaluates its performance. The symbol error rate performance for a 4/M-QAM HBM system is derived and verified using simulations. These results are used to define the design constraints for an HBM system: the HBM functional region and transition region. The functional region is verified using an experimental testbed for ultrabroadband communications. The results show that with proper design HBM successfully achieves its goal to exploit the distance-dependent characteristics of the THz channel, to spatially multiplex users, and to increase the system capacity.}

	abstract = {A novel coexisting passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and active decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission framework is proposed. In particular, two communication protocols are conceived, namely Hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA) and Full NOMA (F-NOMA). Based on the proposed two protocols, both the sum rate maximization and max-min rate fairness problems are formulated for jointly optimizing the power allocation at the access point and relay as well as the passive beamforming design at the RIS. To tackle the non-convex problems, an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is first developed, where the transmit power and the RIS phase-shift are alternatingly optimized by leveraging the two-dimensional search and rank-relaxed difference-of-convex (DC) programming, respectively. Then, a two-layer penalty based joint optimization (JO) algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the resource allocation coefficients within each iteration. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed coexisting RIS and relay assisted transmission framework is capable of achieving a significant user performance improvement than conventional schemes without RIS or relay; ii) compared with the AO algorithm, the JO algorithm requires less execution time at the cost of a slight performance loss; and iii) the H-NOMA and F-NOMA protocols are generally preferable for ensuring user rate fairness and enhancing user sum rate, respectively.}

Furthermore, the receiver structures for a fully coherent VLC system and a VLC system employing the least-squares technique for channel estimation are proposed. Employing the receiver structures, the closed/series-form expressions for the symbol error probabilities are derived for all three scenarios of practical VLC channel models. The numerical results particularly show the crucial role of the ratio of the distance of the location of the receiver from the center of the receiving plane to the distance from the light-emitting diode (LED) to the center of the receiving plane in the performance of all the considered VLC systems.}

Such presentation enables yielding the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) performance but with a massive reduction in computational complexity. Attained reduction is accomplished through 1) utilizing the error-repetitive property of DSSK detection to reduce the number of computed error terms and 2) developing two efficient searching strategies that avoid searching the entire alphabet as in ML detectors. These searching strategies enable a trade–off between performance and complexity. Unlike existing sparse recovery (SR) decoders, which require a projection phase to ensure the closure property (i.e., only single transmit antenna is active at each particular time instant and the multiplication of a constellation matrix with another one will produce a matrix from within the set), the new algorithms, inherently, maintain the closure property of DSSK system without additional procedures. Reported results reveal that optimal ML performance is obtained with a huge reduction in complexity by proper adjustment of parameters. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm performs better than state of the art SR algorithms, and the feasibility of massive MIMO configurations with low complexity is demonstrated.}

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, edge computing can be initiated at anytime and anywhere. However, in an IoT environment, edge computing sessions are often ephemeral, i.e., they last for a short period of time and can often be discontinued once the current application usage is completed or the edge devices leave the system due to factors such as mobility. Therefore, in this paper, the problem of ephemeral edge computing in an IoT is studied by considering scenarios in which edge computing operates within a limited time period. To this end, a novel online framework is proposed in which a source edge node offloads its computing tasks from sensors within an area to neighboring edge nodes for distributed task computing, within the limited period of time of an ephemeral edge computing system. The online nature of the framework allows the edge nodes to optimize their task allocation and decide on which neighbors to use for task processing, even when the tasks are revealed to the source edge node in an online manner, and the information on future task arrivals is unknown. The proposed framework essentially maximizes the number of computed tasks by jointly considering the communication and computation latency. To solve the joint optimization, an online greedy algorithm is proposed and solved by using the primal-dual approach. Since the primal problem provides an upper bound of the original dual problem, the competitive ratio of the online approach is analytically derived as a function of the task sizes and the data rates of the edge nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online algorithm can achieve a near-optimal task allocation with an optimality gap that is no higher than 7.1% compared to the offline, optimal solution with complete knowledge of all tasks.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been confirmed to provide significant performance advantages against Doppler in high-mobility scenarios. The core feature of OTFS is that the time-variant channel is converted into a non-fading 2D channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain so that all symbols experience the same channel gain. In available literature, the channel is assumed to be quasi-static over an OTFS frame. As for more practical scenarios, the Doppler shift is dynamic and the channel gain could be time-variant as the environment or medium changes. In this paper, we analyze the characterizations of OTFS modulation over a more general multipath channel, where the signal in each propagation path has experienced a unique rapid fading. First, we derive the explicit input-output relationship of OTFS in the DD domain for the case of ideal pulse and rectangular pulse. It is shown that the rapid fading will produce extra Doppler dispersion without impact on delay domain. We next demonstrate that OTFS can be interpreted as an efficient time diversity technology that combines space-time encoding and interleaving against the rapid fading. Simulation results reveal that OTFS is insensitive to rapid fading and still outperforms conventional multicarrier systems in these channels.}

	abstract = {The unprecedented growth of mobile data traffic has fueled the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, while distilling the intelligence from raw data by machine learning requires tremendous labelling effort. To overcome this challenge, wireless crowd labelling (WCL) is proposed for efficient data labelling by exploiting billions of available mobile annotators and the multicasting property of wireless channels. A WCL system is considered in this paper where unlabelled data (objects) are multicast via fading channels to different clusters of annotators for repetition labelling to improve the accuracy. Given the desired labelling accuracy, the superposition coding technique together with the repetition labelling scheme give rise to a new tradeoff between radio-and-annotator resource consumption. Building on such tradeoff, the annotator clustering and transmit power control are jointly optimized to maximize the labelling throughput (i.e., the number of labelled objects) or minimize the power consumption, resulting in NP-hard integer programming problems. To solve these problems, the optimal structure of annotator clustering is derived by exploiting the property that the power allocation for multicasting objects tends to compensate for the worst channel among the annotators in each cluster. Based on such structure, the throughput maximization problem can be recognized as a longest-path problem and solved by means of branch-and-bound, while the power minimization problem can be recasted to a shortest-path problem and solved by means of forward dynamic programming. The solution approaches can be further simplified when the channels are symmetric by merging the same nodes and cutting the identical paths in the path graph. In addition, exact polices are derived for the special cases where either the annotators or power are constrained. Last, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of our proposed joint designs.}

	abstract = {Large array systems use a massive number of antenna elements and clever precoder designs to achieve an array gain at the user location. These precoders require linear front-ends, and more specifically linear power amplifiers (PAs), to avoid distortion. This reduces the energy efficiency since PAs are most efficient close to saturation, where they generate most nonlinear distortion. Moreover, the use of conventional precoders can induce a coherent combining of distortion at the user locations, degrading the signal quality. In this work, novel linear precoders, simple to compute and to implement, are proposed that allow working close to saturation, while cancelling the third-order nonlinearity of the PA without prior knowledge of the signal statistics and PA model. Their design consists in saturating a single or a few antennas on purpose together with an negative gain with respect to all other antennas to compensate for the overall nonlinear distortion at the user location. The performance gains of the designs are significant for PAs working close to saturation, as compared to maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding and perfect per-antenna digital pre-distortion (DPD) compensation.}

In the proposed model, the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and non-LoS (NLoS) transmission through ground reflection, single-clusters, and twin-clusters are modeled.

To capture the time-space consistency and S-T-F non-stationarity simultaneously, a new UAV-related non-stationary modeling algorithm that integrates the visibility region (VR), frequency-dependent path gain, and survival probability is developed for the first time. In this algorithm, the UAV-related parameters are considered, including UAV’s height, 3D moving velocity, and self-rotation angles. In the proposed model, the calculation of channel impulse response (CIR) is developed, which considers the cluster density index influenced by communication scenarios, frequency, UAV’s height, and the distance between transceivers. Some important channel statistical properties, such as S-T-F correlation function (STF-CF), Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), and stationary interval, are derived. Finally, simulation results match well with ray-tracing-based results, which verifies the utility of the proposed model.}

	abstract = {Among the realm of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), a challenging problem is how to realize an efficient transmission meeting both latency and reliability requirements. As a promising technique to tackle the above problem, cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) has gained much attention in recent years. When the relay (R) is close to the source, the superior of C-NOMA has been verified if the cooperation is implemented in the first phase. However, the case where R is close to the destination, which also frequently appears in the cooperative transmission, has not been well investigated for URLLC yet. To fill up this gap, we propose a packet re-management based C-NOMA transmission scheme in which the cooperation is implemented in the second phase. Further, considering the importance of power consumption, we aim for jointly optimizing blocklength, power, re-managed packet size, and block error rate to minimize the power consumption subject to URLLC requirements and the maximum power constraint. To tackle the above non-convex and implicit problem, we first propose an algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Then, an extended algorithm is proposed to further approach the optimal solution. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and algorithms.}

We first investigate the density-transform feature of the soft-output OSD (SOSD), by deriving the density of the extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR) with known densities of the priori LLR. Then, we represent the OSD-based JD by bipartite graphs (BGs), and develop the DE framework by characterizing the density-transform features of nodes over the BG under the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) transmission. Numerical examples show that the proposed DE framework accurately tracks the evolution of LLRs during the iterative decoding, especially at moderate-to-high SNRs.

The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency by jointly designing the active beamforming at the base station and the passive beamforming at the RIS. The optimization problem to maximize the system’s energy efficiency is formulated and solved using a two-stage algorithm. To tackle the non-convex nature of the problem, an alternating technique, where the optimization is decomposed into two sub-problems, is proposed. In the first stage, the passive beamforming matrix of the dual-polarized aerial RIS is designed based on the Gaussian randomization method, which relaxes the inhomogeneous non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) into a semi-definite program. In the second stage, the active beamforming at the base station is designed based on a dual-structured beamforming approach, in which the interior point method is used to obtain the prebeamforming matrix, and the beamforming matrices pertaining to the unicasting and broadcasting are obtained based on low-complexity zero-forcing and successive convex approximation, respectively. Numerical results and comparisons are provided. In particular, it is shown that the polarization-based communication system yields higher energy efficiency gains as compared to a system implementing layered division multiplexing.}

	abstract = {Multicarrier transmissions, such as orthogonal frequency/chirp division multiplexing (OF/CDM), offer high spectral efficiency and low complexity equalization in multipath fading channels at the cost of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High peak powers can occur randomly and may drive the power amplifier (PA) into saturation, resulting in non-linear distortion. In this work, we propose a novel tensor-train (TT) deep neural network (DNN) architecture combined with soft clipping to reduce the PAPR to a deterministic level and minimize in-band distortion, while also satisfying spectral mask constraints. The proposed solution requires modifications only at the transmitter and there is no loss of spectral efficiency. Employing the TT decomposition allows for significant reduction in parameters. Results show that the proposed solution allows for significant reduction in PAPR with minimal performance loss. Furthermore, an upper bound for the PAPR is also derived which allows for the prediction of the required input power back off (IBO) without extensive simulations and trial-and-error.}

	abstract = {For distributed learning among collaborative users, this paper develops and analyzes a communication-efficient scheme for federated learning (FL) over the air, which incorporates 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) into analog-aggregation transmissions. To facilitate design parameter optimization, we analyze the efficacy of the proposed scheme by deriving a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate. Our theoretical results unveil the tradeoff between convergence performance and communication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by sparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and noise. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem to mitigate the impact of these aggregation errors through joint optimal design of worker scheduling and power scaling policy. An enumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is optimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices increases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation that is suitable for large-scale networks. Simulation results show that our proposed 1-bit CS based FL over the air achieves comparable performance to the ideal case where conventional FL without compression and quantification is applied over error-free aggregation, at much reduced communication overhead and transmission latency.}

	abstract = {The integration of non-terrestrial networks into the 5G ecosystem is mainly driven by the possibility of provisioning service in remote areas. In this context, the advent of flying base stations at the low Earth orbit (LEO) will enable anywhere and anytime connectivity. To materialize this vision, it is of utmost importance to improve radio protocols with the aim of allowing direct satellite access. Bearing this aspect in mind, we present a new random access signal, which is based on the filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) waveform, and a computationally efficient detection scheme. The proposed solution outperforms the standardized access scheme based on single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM), by reducing out-of-band (OOB) emissions and reducing the missed detection probability in presence of very high carrier frequency offset (CFO), which is inherent to LEO satellite systems. The improvement is related to the fine frequency resolution of the detector and the use of pulse shaping techniques. Interestingly, the FBMC-based random access signal achieves a high level of commonality with 5G new radio, as the preamble generation method and the time-frequency allocation pattern can be kept unchanged. Concerning the practical implementation aspects, the complexity of the detector is similar in both SC-FDM and FBMC.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, most research focuses on the scenario of the narrowband and/or instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while wide bandwidth with the use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) (including sub-Terahertz) spectrum is a major trend in next-generation wireless communications, and statistical CSI is more practical to obtain in realistic systems. Thus, we consider the ergodic achievable rate of RIS-assisted mmWave multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems. The widely used Saleh-Valenzuela channel model is adopted to characterize the mmWave channels and only the statistical CSI is available. We first derive the approximations of the ergodic achievable rate by means of the majorization theory and Jensen’s inequality. Then, an alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed to maximize the ergodic achievable rate by jointly designing the transmit covariance matrix at the base station and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. Specifically, the design of the transmit covariance matrix is transformed into a power allocation problem and solved by spatial-frequency water-filling. The reflection coefficients are optimized by the Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {Starting from first principles of wave propagation, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) representation of a communication system between two spatially-continuous volumes. This is the concept of holographic MIMO communications. The analysis takes into account the electromagnetic interference, generated by external sources, and the constraint on the physical radiated power. The electromagnetic MIMO model is particularized for a pair of parallel line segments in line-of-sight conditions. Inspired by orthogonal-frequency division-multiplexing, we assume that the spatially-continuous transmit currents and received fields are represented using the Fourier basis functions. In doing so, a wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) scheme is obtained, which is not optimal but can be efficiently implemented. The interplay among the different system parameters (e.g., transmission range, wavelength, and sizes of source and receiver) in terms of number of communication modes and level of interference among them is studied with conventional tools of linear systems theory. Due to the non-finite support (in the spatial domain) of the electromagnetic channel, WDM cannot provide non-interfering communication modes. The interference decreases as the receiver size grows, and goes to zero only asymptotically. Different digital processing architectures, operating in the wavenumber domain, are thus used to deal with the interference. The simplest implementation provides the same spectral efficiency of a singular-value decomposition architecture with water-filling when the receiver size is comparable to the transmission range. The developed framework is also used to represent a communication scheme that performs only an integration over short spatial segments. This is equivalent to a classical MIMO system with uniform linear arrays made of electrically small dipoles. Numerical comparisons show that better performance than WDM can be achieved only when a higher number of radio-frequency chains is used.}

	abstract = {In the uplink machine-type communication (MTC) system, a combination of grant-free transmission and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges to reduce the control overhead and transmission latency. In the grant-free scenario, the base station needs to identify the active devices and estimate the channel state information before the data detection. However, due to the lack of a scheduling process, the user activity detection (UAD) and channel estimation (CE) are both challenging, especially when short non-orthogonal preambles are adopted. In this paper, by exploiting the framework of the compressive sensing-based algorithm, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, namely UAD and CE Neural Network (UAD-CE-NN), to effectively solve the joint UAD and CE problem for grant-free NOMA. In the proposed scheme, the user activity and channel state information hidden in the received data signals are also exploited to aid the preamble for higher detection accuracy. Specifically, UAD-CE-NN is composed of two stages: we first build a preamble detection neural network for a tentative UAD-CE; a data detection neural network is then deployed to exploit the data signals. Compared with the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme obtains much higher accuracy for both the UAD and CE, especially when short preamble sequences are employed.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the mobility problem in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which leads to significant performance losses in the practical deployment of the fifth generation mobile communication networks. We propose a novel channel prediction method based on multi-dimensional matrix pencil (MDMP), which estimates the path parameters by exploiting the angular-frequency-domain and angular-time-domain structures of the wideband channel. The MDMP method also entails a novel path pairing scheme to pair the delay and Doppler, based on the super-resolution property of the angle estimation. Our method is able to deal with the realistic constraint of time-varying path delays introduced by user movements, which has not been considered so far in the literature. We prove theoretically that in the scenario with time-varying path delays, the prediction error converges to zero with the increasing number of the base station (BS) antennas, providing that only two arbitrary channel samples are known. We also derive a lower-bound of the number of the BS antennas to achieve a satisfactory performance. Simulation results under the industrial channel model of 3GPP demonstrate that our proposed MDMP method approaches the performance of the stationary scenario even when the users’ velocity reaches 120 km/h and the latency of the channel state information is as large as 16 ms.}

To begin with, a practical MIMO channel model is developed for the THz band that incorporates its molecular absorption and reflection losses, as well as its non-line-of-sight (NLoS) rays associated with its diffused components. Subsequently, a novel CSI estimation model is derived by exploiting the angular-sparsity of the THz MIMO channel. This is followed by designing a sophisticated Bayesian learning (BL)-based approach for efficient estimation of the sparse THz MIMO channel. The Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB) is also determined for benchmarking the performance of the CSI estimation techniques developed. Finally, an optimal hybrid transmit precoder and receiver combiner pair is designed, which directly relies on the beamspace domain CSI estimates and only requires limited feedback. Finally, simulation results are provided for quantifying the improved mean square error (MSE), spectral-efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance for transmission on practical THz MIMO channel obtained from the HIgh resolution TRANsmission (HITRAN)-database.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided uplink (UL) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) system is investigated for dead-zone users where the direct link between the users and the base station (BS) is unavailable and the UL transmission is carried out only through IRS. In the considered RSMA system, a message of each user is split into several sub-messages and each part contributes to the rate of that user and depending upon split proportions BS decodes them using appropriate decoding order. The problem of sum-rate maximization is formulated to jointly design the optimal power allocation at each UL user, passive beamforming at the IRS under optimal decoding order of sub-messages. Due to non-convexity and discrete non-linear programming of the formulated problem, the original problem is intractable and hence, we decouple the problem into different sub-problems in which the problems of power allocation and passive beamforming are alternatively solved under using successive convex approximation and Riemaniann conjugate gradient algorithms, respectively. Moreover, the decoding order strategy is analytically derived which confirm that the optimal decoding order strategy depend upon decreasing order of channel gain of users and increasing order of split proportions of sub-messages. Later, the unified solution based on block-coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results validate that the proposed decoding order scheme attains performance closer to the optimal solution with low computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed IRS aided RMSA system outperforms the system with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes in terms of achievable sum-rate throughput.}

	abstract = {Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is a new Federated Learning (FL) approach to address the heterogeneity issue of the datasets generated by distributed user equipments (UEs). However, most existing PFL implementations rely on synchronous training to ensure good convergence performances, which may lead to a serious straggler problem, where the training time is heavily prolonged by the slowest UE. To address this issue, we propose a semi-synchronous PFL algorithm, termed as Semi-Synchronous Personalized FederatedAveraging (PerFedS2), over mobile edge networks. By jointly optimizing the wireless bandwidth allocation and UE scheduling policy, it not only mitigates the straggler problem but also provides convergent training loss guarantees. We derive an upper bound of the convergence rate of PerFedS2 in terms of the number of participants per global round and the number of rounds. On this basis, the bandwidth allocation problem can be solved using analytical solutions and the UE scheduling policy can be obtained by a greedy algorithm. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of PerFedS2 in saving the training time as well as guaranteeing the convergence of training loss, in contrast to synchronous and asynchronous PFL algorithms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided radar-communication (Radcom) system, where the IRS is leveraged to help Radcom base station (BS) transmit the joint of communication signals and radar signals for serving communication users and tracking targets simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to minimize the total transmit power at the Radcom BS by jointly optimizing the active beamformers, including communication beamformers and radar beamformers, at the Radcom BS and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) required by communication users, the minimum SINR required by the radar, and the cross-correlation pattern design. In particular, we consider two cases, namely, case I and case II, based on the presence or absence of the radar cross-correlation design and the interference introduced by the IRS on the Radcom BS. For case I where the cross-correlation design and the interference are not considered, we prove that the dedicated radar signals are not needed, which significantly reduces implementation complexity and simplifies algorithm design. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Whereas for case II considering the cross-correlation design and the interference, we unveil that the dedicated radar signals are needed in general to enhance the system performance. Since the resulting optimization problem is more challenging to solve as compared with the case I, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. Particularly, instead of relying on the Gaussian randomization technique to obtain an approximate solution by reconstructing rank-one solution, the tightness is achieved by our proposed reconstruction strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms and also show the superiority of the proposed scheme over various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology can achieve high-speed communication due to the large available spectrum. Furthermore, the use of directional beams in mmWave system provides a natural defense against physical layer security attacks. In practice, however, the beams are imperfect due to mmWave hardware limitations such as the low-resolution of the phase shifters. These imperfections in the beam pattern introduce an energy leakage that can be exploited by an eavesdropper. To defend against such eavesdropping attacks, we propose a directional modulation-based defense technique where the transmitter applies random circulant shifts of a beamformer. We show that the use of random circulant shifts together with appropriate phase adjustment induces (APN) in the directions different from that of the target receiver. Our method corrupts the phase at the eavesdropper without affecting the communication link of the target receiver. We also experimentally verify the APN induced due to circulant shifts, using channel measurements from a 2-bit mmWave phased array testbed. Using simulations, we study the performance of the proposed defense technique against a greedy eavesdropping strategy in a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario. The proposed technique achieves better defense than the antenna subset modulation, without compromising on the communication link with the target receiver.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising technology for future wireless communications. With various hardware realizations, RISs can work under different modes (reflective/transmissive/hybrid) or have different architectures (single/group/fully-connected). However, most existing research focused on single-connected reflective RISs, mathematically characterized by diagonal phase shift matrices, while there is a lack of a comprehensive study for RISs unifying different modes/architectures. In this paper, we solve this issue by analyzing and proposing a general RIS-aided communication model. Specifically, we establish an RIS model not limited to diagonal phase shift matrices, a novel branch referred to as beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), unifying modes and architectures. With the proposed model, we develop efficient algorithms to jointly design transmit precoder and BD-RIS matrix to maximize the sum-rate for RIS-aided systems. We also provide simulation results to compare the performance of BD-RISs with different modes/architectures. Simulation results show that under the same mode, fully- and group-connected RIS can effectively increase the sum-rate performance compared with single-connected RIS, and that hybrid RIS outperforms reflective/transmissive RIS with the same architecture.}

	abstract = {As the demand for mobile data traffic continues to grow, offloading data traffic to unlicensed spectrum is a promising approach that can relieve the pressure on cellular systems. Therefore, it is an urgent need to propose an unlicensed spectrum access method to guarantee the harmonious and efficient coexistence between cellular network technologies such as LTE and incumbent users such as WiFi in the unlicensed spectrum. However, existing coexistence schemes such as licensed assisted access (LAA) and LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) still suffer from inefficient spectrum utilization and unsatisfactory fairness. In the paper, we formulate the optimization problem of the unlicensed spectrum access among multiple small bases (SBSs) as a game, and then solve the Nash Equilibrium (NE) with cooperative and distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Specifically, a two level access framework for the coexistence scenario, which consists of feedback cycle and executive cycle, is first proposed, and then the key elements of MADRL including state, action, reward and Q-network are designed in detail based on the proposed access framework. To overcome the problems of learning divergence and prohibitive computation overhead in the coexistence scenario with multiple SBSs due to the non-stability phenomena, we adopt the mean field technology to solve the NE, which can simplify the process of solving NE by converting the interaction of an agent with the remaining multiple agents into an action with the average effect of them. Simulation results show that 1) the proposed algorithm can overcome the learning divergence problem and converge to the NE quickly, and 2) the proposed algorithm can achieve the bi-objective optimization of total throughput and fairness of the coexistence network, and can achieve better performance in terms of throughput and fairness compared with the baseline methods such as Cat-4 LBT, Cooperative LBT and Random schemes.}

	abstract = {Small cell networks (SCNs) have emerged as a promising solution to meet the demand for increasing data traffic for the sixth generation and beyond wireless networks. However, power consumption and two-tier interference issues are two bottlenecks that hinder further development. This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-based SCN in which an RIS serves multiple micro users as a small cell base station while assisting the macro user’s transmission. Compared to the conventional SCNs, the RIS-based SCN can achieve significant power reduction. Meanwhile, the reflected signal can be regarded as a multipath component instead of interference to the macro user. We propose two transmission schemes and formulate the design of the phase shift matrix at the RIS and the beamforming vector at the macro base station as an optimization problem. The alternating optimization algorithm is developed to optimize the phase shift matrix and the beamforming vector to minimize the total power consumption under the user rate and phase shift constraints. Simulation results show that the total power consumption can be reduced significantly by deploying the RIS in the SCN when the number of reflective elements is sufficiently large.}

	abstract = {Wireless backhaul has recently gained a significant amount of interest as a cost-effective solution in comparison with conventional backhaul technologies with dedicated microwave links or fiber optics. Self-interference cancellation (SIC) is an enabling technology that allows wireless backhaul to operate in the more spectrum-efficient in-band full-duplex (IBFD) operation mode instead of the out-of-band mode. Compared to Wi-Fi IBFD transceivers, wireless in-band backhaul systems face some unique challenges, such as significantly higher transmission power and much larger propagation delay spread for the self-interference signal, especially in the low-frequency bands under 1 GHz, which often prevent accurate SIC performance. The SIC is often implemented with an interference-cancelling filter, where the filter weights are essentially the channel estimates of the self-interference signals. In this paper, a frequency-domain Radio Frequency (RF) SIC (RF-SIC) framework with a novel filter weight optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle the challenges of wireless in-band backhaul. The proposed RF-SIC does not require a dedicated training phase which needs to stop the transmission of the backhaul signal. Moreover, it has the capability of tracking the self-interference channel variation since the filter weights are updated in a block-by-block fashion.}

This scheme combines an I/Q imbalanced analog least mean square (ALMS) loop at the transceiver radio frequency frontend and a two-stage digital signal processing (DSP) at the digital baseband to achieve excellent SIC performance with low complexity. The steady state weighting coefficients of the I/Q imbalanced ALMS loop with periodical transmitted signal and the loop’s convergence behaviour are firstly analysed. The residual SI is then modelled as the output of a time-varying widely linear system. With a track/hold control mechanism applied to the ALMS loop, the system model for digital SIC is further presented, followed by the DSP algorithms suitable for real-time implementation. The noise enhancement in each stage digital cancellation is also analysed and formulated. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the overall SIC performance.}

Content is delivered with multipoint multicast operating in file-specific orthogonal resources: all BSs caching a distinct file synchronously multicast it to requesting users in a dedicated resource. For a network modeled as a Poisson Point Process (PPP), an expression for the outage probability is derived. The outage-minimizing cache policy is found from a joint constrained optimization problem over cache placement and resource allocation. We devise principles by which the solution in one propagation environment can be generalized to another. To reduce computational complexity, we obtain a sub-optimal solution based on convex relaxation. We obtain an upper bound of the gap between the optimal and sub-optimal solutions. We compare the outage performance of OMPMC with delivery polices from the literature. Simulation results show that exploiting OMPMC with optimal cache placement and resource allocation outperforms single point cache delivery policies with a wide margin.}

	abstract = {To support ultra-reliable and low-latency services for mission-critical applications, transmissions are usually carried via short blocklength codes, i.e., in the so-called finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Different from the infinite blocklength regime where transmissions are assumed to be arbitrarily reliable at the Shannon’s capacity, the reliability and capacity performances of an FBL transmission are impacted by the coding blocklength. The relationship among reliability, coding rate, blocklength and channel quality has recently been characterized in the literature, considering the FBL performance model. In this paper, we follow this model, and prove the joint convexity of the FBL error probability with respect to blocklength and transmit power within a region of interest, as a key enabler for designing systems to achieve globally optimal performance levels. Moreover, we apply the joint convexity to general use cases and efficiently solve the joint optimization problem in the setting with multiple users. We also extend the applicability of the proposed approach by proving that the joint convexity still holds in fading channels, as well as in relaying networks. Via simulations, we validate our analytical results and demonstrate the advantage of leveraging the joint convexity compared to other commonly-applied approaches.}

In particular, we consider that one UAV-AP, equipped with a vertically placed uniform linear array (ULA), sends combined information and sensing signals to communicate with multiple users and at the same time sense potential targets at interested areas on the ground. Under this setup, we consider two scenarios with quasi-stationary and fully mobile UAVs, in which the UAV is deployed at an optimizable location over the whole ISAC mission period and can fly over different locations during the ISAC mission period, respectively. For the two scenarios, our objective is to jointly design the UAV maneuver (deployment location or flight trajectory) and the transmit beamforming, for maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput of communication users, while ensuring the sensing beampattern gain requirements, subject to the transmit power and flight constraints. However, due to the ULA consideration at the UAV, the two formulated problems are highly non-convex and very difficult to be optimally solved, as the UAV’s location/trajectory variables are involved on the exponent parts of each entry in the steering vectors, and are closely coupled with the transmit beamforming vectors. To tackle this issue, we propose efficient algorithms to find their suboptimal but high-quality solutions, by using various techniques from convex and non-convex optimization. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the superiority of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes with heuristic maneuver designs. It is shown that the joint maneuver and transmit beamforming design efficiently balances the inherent tradeoff between sensing and communication with regards to different beampattern gain thresholds.}

	abstract = {Driven by the stringent demands of future ultra reliable and low latency communication (URLLC), we provide a comprehensive study for a coherent and non-coherent multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) uplink system in the finite blocklength regime. The independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian codebook is assumed for each user. To be more specific, the base station (BS) first uses two popular linear processing schemes to combine the signals transmitted from all users, namely maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF). Following it, the matched maximum-likelihood (ML) and mismatched nearest-neighbour (NN) decoding metric for the coherent and non-coherent cases are respectively employed at the BS. Under these conditions, the refined third-order achievable coding rate, expressed as a function of the blocklength, average error probability, and the third-order term of the information density (called as the channel perturbation), is derived. With this result in hand, a detailed performance analysis is then pursued, through which, we derive the asymptotic results of the channel perturbation, achievable coding rate, channel capacity, and the channel dispersion. These theoretical results enable us to obtain a number of interesting insights related to the impact of the finite blocklength: i) in our system setting, massive MIMO helps to reduce the channel perturbation of the achievable coding rate, which can even be discarded without affecting the performance with just a small-to-moderate number of BS antennas and number of blocks; ii) under the non-coherent case, even with massive MIMO, the channel estimation errors cannot be eliminated unless the transmit powers in both the channel estimation and data transmission phases for each user are made inversely proportional to the square root of the number of BS antennas; iii) in the non-coherent case and for fixed total blocklength, the scenarios with longer coherence intervals and smaller number of blocks will offer higher achievable coding rate.}

	abstract = {Using widely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to perceive the environmental distribution is crucial in many IoT applications, such as intelligent healthcare and smart home. As using traditional sensors will lead to high costs and maintenance, it is important to design the next-generation IoT sensor to reduce the cost of ubiquitous deployment. For this purpose, we propose a novel IoT system based on low-cost and fully passive meta-material sensors. Specifically, the meta-material sensors can sense multiple environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity levels, and transmit back the information by signal reflection, simultaneously. With the information contained in the received signals, a wireless receiver can obtain detailed environmental distributions. However, it is not trivial to achieve high sensing accuracy in the meta-material sensor based IoT system because the structure of the meta-materials, the deployment positions of sensors, and the reconstruction function for environmental distributions need to be jointly optimized. To handle this challenge, we propose an algorithm to design the meta-material based IoT system with the help of a deep learning approach. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm effectively maximizes the sensing accuracy. Experimental evaluations also show that the proposed scheme can obtain humidity distribution with an accuracy of over 93%.}

	abstract = {Device activity detection in the emerging cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has been recognized as a crucial task in machine-type communications, in which multiple access points (APs) jointly identify the active devices from a large number of potential devices based on the received signals. Most of the existing works addressing this problem rely on the impractical assumption that different active devices transmit signals synchronously. However, in practice, synchronization cannot be guaranteed due to the low-cost oscillators, which brings additional discontinuous and nonconvex constraints to the detection problem. To address this challenge, this paper reveals an equivalent reformulation to the asynchronous activity detection problem, which facilitates the development of a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm that satisfy the highly nonconvex constraints in a gentle fashion as the iteration number increases, so that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithms can get around bad stationary points. To reduce the capacity requirements of the fronthauls, we further design a communication-efficient accelerated distributed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed centralized and distributed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art approaches, and the proposed accelerated distributed algorithm achieves close detection performance to that of the centralized algorithm but with a much smaller number of bits to be transmitted on the fronthaul links.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) leverages the private data and computing power of multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model. Many existing FL algorithms over wireless networks adopting synchronous model aggregation suffer from the straggler issue, due to the heterogeneity of local computing power and channel conditions. To address this issue, we in this paper advocate an asynchronous FL framework with adaptive client selection for training latency minimization, taking into account the client availability and long-term fairness. We consider a practical scenario, where the channel conditions and the locally available computing power are not known in prior. This makes the client selection problem challenging, as the training latency consists of the uplink/downlink transmission time and the local training time. To this end, we tackle the asynchronous client selection problem in an online manner by converting the latency minimization problem into a multi-armed bandit problem, and leverage the upper confidence bound policy and virtual queue technique in Lyapunov optimization to solve the problem. We theoretically show that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret performance, ensures long-term fairness, and guarantees training convergence. Results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the training time by up to 50% when compared to the baseline algorithms.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a novel technology to manipulate wireless propagation channels via smart and controllable signal reflection. In this paper, we investigate an IRS-aided integrated terrestrial-satellite network (ITSN) system, where the IRS is deployed to assist the co-existing transmissions of the terrestrial small base stations (SBSs) and the satellite. Because of the spectrum sharing in the ITSN, the interference between the two systems should be carefully mitigated. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing the frame-based coordinated transmit beamforming vectors at the SBSs, the phase shift matrix at the IRS, and the frame user scheduling, subject to SBSs’ individual power constraints and unit modulus constraints of phase shifters. To this end, we first adopt the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) method to schedule the satellite users to different frames. Then the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed, which alternately optimizes the transmit beamforming vectors and the reflective phase shift matrix. In particular, the optimal transmit beamforming vectors are obtained via the fractional programming (FP) technique. Meanwhile, two efficient algorithms, i.e., the Riemannian manifold (RM) and the successive convex approximation (SCA), are proposed for the phase shift optimization. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance gain of our schemes over other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {A new generation of aerial vehicles is hopeful to be the next frontier for the transportation of people and goods, becoming even as important as ground users in the communication systems. To enhance the coverage of aerial users, appropriate adjustments should be made to the existing cellular networks that mainly provide services for ground users by the down-tilted antennas of the terrestrial base stations (BSs). It is promising to up-tilt the antennas of a subset of BSs for serving aerial users through the mainlobe. With this motivation, in this work, we use tools from stochastic geometry to analyze the coverage performance of the adjusted cellular network (consisting of the up-tilted BSs and the down-tilted BSs). Correspondingly, we present exact and approximate expressions of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based coverage probabilities for users in the sky and on the ground, respectively. Numerical results verify the analysis accuracy and clarify the advantages of up-tilting BS antennas on the communication connectivity of aerial users without the potential adverse impact on the quality of service (QoS) of ground users. Moreover, it is unveiled that there exists an optimal value of the up-tilted/down-tilted BS density ratio for maximizing the coverage probability of the aerial or ground users.}

	abstract = {With the widespread application of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the rapid evolution of visible light communication (VLC), visible light-based positioning (VLP) is envisioned as a promising solution for indoor positioning due to its high accuracy and environmental friendliness. However, the performance of VLP is significantly affected by the unknown orientation of the user equipment (UE) and system parameters uncertainty. Besides, high computation complexity and vulnerability to hardware degradation of the VLP algorithms are also the challenges to meet. To handle the above issues, a novel cone geometry-based simultaneous position and orientation estimation (SPO) scheme with low complexity is proposed. By modeling the field of view (FOV) of the photodiode (PD) as a cone, the geometry relationship between the sensed LEDs and the UE position and orientation is established. The binary values of whether the LEDs signals are received or not are exploited, and an alternating flashing strategy for the LED arrays is designed to guarantee normal illumination and reduce bandwidth consumption. Moreover, the theoretical lower bound derived from Kanatani-Cramer-Rao bound (KCRB) is provided to analyze optimality of the estimator. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme achieve an excellent performance gain with low complexity over two classical SPO baseline, and the critical factors that affect the performance are investigated.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can establish favorable wireless environments to combat the severe attenuation and blockages in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. However, to achieve the optimal enhancement of performance, the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) needs to be estimated at the cost of a large overhead that scales with the number of RIS elements and the number of users. In this paper, we design a quasi-static broad coverage at the RIS with the reduced overhead based on the statistical CSI. We propose a design framework to synthesize the power pattern reflected by the RIS that meets the customized requirements of broad coverage. For the communication of broadcast channels, we generalize the broad coverage of the single transmit stream to the scenario of multiple streams. Moreover, we employ the quasi-static broad coverage for a multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) system, and derive the analytical expression of the downlink rate, which is proved to increase logarithmically with the power gain reflected by the RIS. By taking into account the overhead of channel estimation, the proposed quasi-static broad coverage even outperforms the design method that optimizes the RIS phases using the instantaneous CSI. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify these observations.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the feasibility of deploying intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) in massive multiple input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to improve the performance of users in the service dead zone. One question of paramount importance is as follows: if the overhead of channel training and the computational complexity of algorithm design arising from the huge number of IRS reflecting elements and base station (BS) antennas have to be controlled, can we provide reasonable performance to the users with weak direct channels? This paper provides an affirm answer to this question. Specifically, to reduce the channel training overhead, we consider an appealing protocol for the uplink communication in the IRS-assisted massive MIMO systems. Under this protocol, the IRS reflection coefficients are optimized based on the channel covariance matrices, which are generally fixed for many coherence blocks, to boost the long-term performance. Then, given the IRS reflecting coefficients, the BS beamforming vectors are designed in each coherence block based on the effective channel of each user, which is the superposition of its direct and reflected user-IRS-BS channels, to improve the instantaneous performance. Since merely the user effective channels are estimated in each coherence block, the training overhead of this protocol is the same as that in the legacy wireless systems without IRSs. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime that the numbers of IRS elements and BS antennas both go to infinity with a fixed ratio, we manage to first characterize the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators of the user effective channels and then quantify the closed-form user achievable rates as functions of channel covariance matrices with channel training overhead and estimation error taken into account. Interestingly, it is shown that the properties of channel hardening and favorable propagation still hold for the user effective channels, and satisfactory user rates are thus achievable even if simple BS beamforming solutions, e.g., maximal-ratio combining, are employed. Finally, thanks to the rate characterization, we design a low-complexity algorithm to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients based on channel covariance matrices.}

In this paper, we consider a\nK\n-user uplink interference channel and propose a low-complexity algorithmic interference-suppression solution relying on simple switch-based reconfigurable antennas at the receivers. We utilize switches to enable/disable antennas to maximize each user’s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We present an optimization approach to approximate the optimal solution. To evaluate the results, we compare our method with relevant benchmarks. Moreover, we derive a lower bound on the minimum number of antenna elements per receiver to attain the desired SINR and verify the findings via simulations.}

To be specific, through adjusting the phase shifts of these RISs, the strength of reflected signals can be enhanced in order to resist the variance of radio environments. However, it is challenging to coordinate multiple RISs and optimize their phase shifts especially when their locations are unknown to the agent. In order to address these challenges, we formulate a MetaSLAM optimization problem, and design a two-stage optimization algorithm based on the genetic and particle filter algorithms to solve the formulated problem. Analysis of the complexity and the positioning error bound of the proposed SLAM system are provided. Simulation results show that compared with the benchmark schemes, the positioning error obtained by the MetaSLAM system is reduced by at least 31%.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) as an enabler for semantics-empowered communication, a newly advocated communication paradigm centered around data’s role and its usefulness to the communication’s goal. First, we shed light on how the traditional communication paradigm, with its role-blind approach to data, is vulnerable to performance bottlenecks. Next, we highlight the shortcomings of several proposed performance measures destined to deal with the traditional communication paradigm’s limitations, namely the Age of Information (AoI) and the error-based metrics. We also show how the AoII addresses these shortcomings and captures more meaningfully the purpose of data. Afterward, we consider the problem of minimizing the average AoII in a transmitter-receiver pair scenario. We prove that the optimal transmission strategy is a randomized threshold policy, and we propose an algorithm that finds the optimal parameters. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical comparison between the AoII framework and the standard error-based metrics counterpart. Interestingly, we show that the AoII-optimal policy is also error-optimal for the adopted information source model. Concurrently, the converse is not necessarily true. Finally, we implement our policy in various applications, and we showcase its performance advantages compared to both the error-optimal and the AoI-optimal policies.}

	abstract = {Coded distributed computing (CDC) has recently emerged to be a promising solution to address the straggling effects in conventional distributed computing systems. By assigning redundant workloads to the computing nodes, CDC can significantly enhance the performance of the whole system. However, since the core idea of CDC is to introduce redundancies to compensate for uncertainties, it may lead to a large amount of wasted energy at the edge nodes. It can be observed that the more redundant workload added, the less impact the straggling effects have on the system. However, at the same time, the more energy is needed to perform redundant tasks. In this work, we develop a novel framework, namely CERA, to elastically allocate computing resources for CDC processes. Particularly, CERA consists of two stages. In the first stage, we model a joint coding and node selection optimization problem to minimize the expected processing time for a CDC task. Since the problem is NP-hard, we propose a linearization approach and a hybrid algorithm to quickly obtain the optimal solutions. In the second stage, we develop a smart online approach based on Lyapunov optimization to dynamically turn off straggling nodes based on their actual performance. As a result, wasteful energy consumption can be significantly reduced with minimal impact on the total processing time. Simulations using real-world datasets have shown that our proposed approach can reduce the system’s total processing time by more than 200% compared to that of the state-of-the-art approach, even when the nodes’ actual performance is not known in advance. Moreover, the results have shown that CERA’s online optimization stage can reduce the energy consumption by up to 37.14% without affecting the total processing time.}

	abstract = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with flexible deployment is foreseen to be a major part of the sixth generation (6G) networks. The UAVs connected to the base station (BS), as aerial users (UEs), could exploit machine learning (ML) algorithms to provide a wide range of advanced applications, like object detection and video tracking. Conventionally, the ML model training is performed at the BS, known as centralized learning (CL), which causes high communication overhead due to the transmission of large datasets, and potential concerns about UE privacy. To address this, distributed learning algorithms, including federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL), were proposed to train the ML models in a distributed manner via only sharing model parameters. FL requires higher computational resource on the UE side than SL, while SL has larger communication overhead when the local dataset is large. To effectively train an ML model considering the diversity of UEs with different computational capabilities and channel conditions, we first propose a novel distributed learning architecture, a hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) algorithm by reaping the parallel model training mechanism of FL and the model splitting structure of SL. We then provide its convergence analysis under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data with random UE selection scheme. By conducting experiments on training two ML models, Net and AlexNet, in wireless UAV networks, our results demonstrate that the HSFL algorithm achieves higher learning accuracy than FL and less communication overhead than SL under IID and non-IID data, and the learning accuracy of HSFL algorithm increases with the increasing number of the split training UEs. We further propose a Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) based best channel (BC) and best 2-norm (BN2) (MAB-BC-BN2) UE selection scheme to select the UEs with better wireless channel quality and larger local model updates for model training in each round. Numerical results demonstrate it achieves higher learning accuracy than BC, MAB-BC and MAB-BN2 UE selection scheme under non-IID, Dirichlet-nonIID and Dirichlet-Imbalanced data.}

	abstract = {Beam Hopping (BH) is a popular technique considered for next-generation multi-beam satellite communication system which allows a satellite focusing its resources on where they are needed by selectively illuminating beams. While beam illumination plan can be adjusted according to its needs, the main limitation of convectional BH is the adjacent beam avoidance requirement needed to maintain acceptable levels of interference. With the recent maturity of precoding technique, a natural way forward is to consider a dynamic beam illumination scheme with selective precoding, where large areas with high-demand can be covered by multiple active precoded beams. In this paper, we mathematically model such beam illumination design problem employing an interference-based penalty function whose goal is to avoid precoding whenever possible subject to beam demand satisfaction constraints. The problem can be written as a binary quadratic programming (BQP). Next, two convexification frameworks are considered namely: (i) A Semi-Definition Programming (SDP) approach particularly targeting BQP type of problems, and (ii) Multiplier Penalty and Majorization-Minimization (MPMM) based method which guarantees to converge to a local optimum. Finally, a greedy algorithm is proposed to alleviate complexity with minimal impact on the final performance. Supporting results based on numerical simulations show that the proposed schemes outperform the relevant benchmarks in terms of demand matching performance while minimizing the use of precoding.}

	abstract = {The recent introduction of vector coded caching has revealed that multi-rank transmissions in the presence of receiver-side cache content can dramatically ameliorate the file-size bottleneck of coded caching and substantially boost performance in error-free wire-like channels. In this work, we employ large-matrix analysis to explore the effect of vector coded caching in realistic wireless multi-antenna downlink systems. For a given downlink MISO system already optimized to exploit both multiplexing and beamforming gains, and for a fixed set of antenna and SNR resources, our analysis answers a simple question: What is the multiplicative throughput boost obtained from introducing reasonably-sized receiver-side caches that can pre-store information content? The derived closed-form expressions capture various linear precoders, and a variety of practical considerations such as power dissemination across signals, realistic SNR values, as well as feedback costs. The schemes are very simple (we simply collapse precoding vectors into a single vector), and the recorded gains are notable. For example, for 32 transmit antennas, a received SNR of 20 dB, a coherence bandwidth of 300 kHz, a coherence period of 40 ms, and under realistic file-size and cache-size constraints, vector coded caching is here shown to offer a multiplicative throughput boost of about 310% with ZF/RZF precoding and a 430% boost in the performance of already optimized MF-based (cacheless) systems. Interestingly, vector coded caching also accelerates channel hardening to the benefit of feedback acquisition, often surpassing 540% gains over traditional hardening-constrained cacheless downlink systems.}

In this paper, we propose a novel beam alignment framework that leverages images taken by cameras installed at the mobile user. Specifically, we utilize 3D object detection techniques to extract the size and location information of the dynamic vehicles around the mobile user, and design a deep neural network (DNN) to infer the optimal beam pair for transceivers without any pilot signal overhead. Moreover, to avoid performing beam alignment too frequently or too slowly, a beam coherence time (BCT) prediction method is developed based on the vision information. This can effectively improve the transmission rate compared with the beam alignment approach with the fixed BCT. Simulation results show that the proposed vision based beam alignment methods outperform the existing LIDAR and vision based solutions, and demand for much lower hardware cost and communication overhead.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the robust resource allocation design for secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless powered communication networks (WPCN). In particular, deploying an IRS can establish favorable end-to-end radio propagation environment for achieving the desired performance gain in secure wireless-powered systems. We aim to minimize the total hybrid base station (HBS) transmit power by jointly designing the active transmitting and receiving beamforming at the HBS, the passive beamforming at the IRS, and the transmit power of each wireless-powered device (WD) and jammer node (JN). We formulate a non-convex optimization problem for the robust resource allocation design taking into account the secrecy rate requirement of the WDs and the power budgets for both the WDs and the JNs. To handle this intractable problem, we propose a computationally efficient iterative suboptimal algorithm exploiting the block coordinate descent approach, the successive convex approximation, and the penalty method, which attains a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the transformed problem. Also, we reveal that the optimal energy beamforming matrices are rank-one sharing the same spatial direction. Simulation results unveil that the proposed scheme is able to dramatically reduce the HBS transmit power over various baseline schemes adopting existing solutions. Besides, our results show the superiority of introducing IRS for secure communication in wireless-powered systems.}

	abstract = {Providing quality communications under adversarial electronic attacks, e.g., broadband jamming attacks, is a challenging task. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches which treat jamming signals as destructive interference, this paper presents a novel active anti-jamming (AAJ) scheme for a jammed channel to enhance the communication quality between a transmitter node (TN) and receiver node (RN), where the TN actively exploits the jamming signal as a carrier to send messages. Specifically, the TN is equipped with a programmable-gain amplifier, which is capable of re-modulating the jamming signals for jamming modulation. Considering four typical jamming types, we derive both the bit error rates (BER) and the corresponding optimal detection thresholds of the AAJ scheme. The asymptotic performances of the AAJ scheme are discussed under the high jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) and sampling rate cases. Our analysis shows that there exists a BER floor for sufficiently large JNR. Simulation results indicate that the proposed AAJ scheme allows the TN to communicate with the RN reliably even under extremely strong and/or broadband jamming. Additionally, we investigate the channel capacity of the proposed AAJ scheme and show that the channel capacity of the AAJ scheme outperforms that of the direct transmission when the JNR is relatively high.}

In this paper, we are interested in simple bounds for delay-constrained wireless communications with deterministic or even random packet arrivals. More specifically, we present a sufficient condition and derive a legitimate data arrival rate, with which the bounded delay can be guaranteed deterministically with an average power constraint. Our derived results will show that the delay-bounded data rate increases with the average power and the tolerated latency normalized to the coherent time. Furthermore, we derive the upper and lower bounds of the delay-violation probability (DVP) when the bounded delay condition cannot be satisfied. It is revealed that in the log coordinate, the DVP as a function of the normalized tolerated latency may enjoy a non-linear decay, with a decay rate that increases with the latency bound. This is in contrast to the large deviation based performance analysis that focuses on the low-latency transmission policies achieving linearly decayed DVP only. Our result demonstrates that the joint channel-aware and queue-aware scheduling may significantly reduce the DVP, compared to the single-layer approaches.}

In this paper, we study an IRS assisted multiple-input single-output downlink broadcasting system where there exist one access point (AP), multiple users and a wireless powered IRS. We focus on the broadcasting data transmission which includes two phases. In the first phase, the AP transmits broadcasting data to users and energy signals for IRS energy harvesting (EH). In the second phase, the AP broadcasts messages with the assistance of the IRS. We aim at maximizing the transmission throughput by designing the phase duration scheduling, the transmit beamforming at the AP in each phase, the energy signal covariance matrix and the IRS reflect beamforming with discrete phase shifts. We first propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based transmission design by also employing one-dimensional line search and further proposing a randomization process. Then, a low complexity transmission design has been further developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the SDR based design can almost achieve the optimal and the low complexity design can perform close to the SDR based design with much lower complexity.}

As its extension, Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) provides higher bandwidth and smoother network handover by using multiple network interfaces simultaneously. However, to improve HTTP traffic, there are still some issues not yet carefully addressed in the existing MPQUIC, and packet scheduling is a vital one among the issues. Specifically, existing methods fail to respond to the stream prioritization of HTTP Version 2 (HTTP/2), leading to unsatisfying web page load performance. Besides, managing asymmetric and dynamic network paths is also a challenging issue, which may result in Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking and excessive buffer usage if not effectively handled. In this paper, we present a stream-aware per-packet scheduler, HoL Blocking Eliminating Scheduler (HBES), to improve the performance of MPQUIC in mobile networks. Firstly, HBES provides a fair allocation of aggregated bandwidth for different streams based on their priority. Then, it keeps stream data arriving at the receiver in order by estimating packet arrival time to mitigate HoL blocking and excessive buffer usage. We implement HBES and evaluate its performance in various network scenarios. Experimental results verify the superiority of HBES in reducing stream completion time and buffer occupation over those existing MPQUIC schedulers.}

A decentralized frequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm is proposed which uses an average consensus method in which each node in the array iteratively updates its frequency and phase by computing an average of the frequencies and phases of their neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that upon convergence the DFPC algorithm can align the frequencies and phases of all the nodes up to a residual phase error that is governed by the oscillators and the estimation errors. To reduce this residual phase error and thus improve the synchronization between the nodes, a Kalman filter based decentralized frequency and phase consensus (KF-DFPC) algorithm is presented. The total residual phase error at the convergence of the KF-DFPC and DFPC algorithms is derived theoretically. The synchronization performances of these algorithms are compared to each other and to the diffusion least mean square (DLMS), the diffusion KF (DKF) algorithm, and the Kalman consensus information filter (KCIF) algorithms, in light of this theoretical residual phase error by varying the duration of the signals, connectivity of the nodes, the number of nodes in the array, and signal to noise ratio of the received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that under certain conditions the proposed KF-DFPC algorithm outperforms and converges in fewer iterations than all the algorithms. Furthermore, for shorter intervals between local information broadcasts, the KF-DFPC algorithm significantly outperforms the DFPC algorithm in reducing the residual total phase error, irrespective of the signal to noise ratio of the received signals.}

	abstract = {In future 6G millimeter-wave/sub-THz vehicle-to-everything communication systems, vehicles are expected to be equipped with massive antenna arrays to compensate for the severe path loss. However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) direct links are prone to blockage by surrounding vehicles. Emerging metasurface technologies enable the control of the electromagnetic wave reflection towards the desired direction to boost communication performance. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and the pre-configured counterpart intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), are promising low-cost relaying systems for 6G. This paper proposes the usage of conformal metasurfaces (C-RIS or C-IRS) deployed on vehicles’ body to mitigate the blockage impact by creating artificial reflections, compensating for the non-flat shape of the vehicle’s body with proper phase patterns. We analytically derive the phase pattern for a cylindrical C-RIS/C-IRS, accounting for the shape of the car body, which generalizes the conventional planar ones. We propose a novel design for optimally pre-configured C-IRS proving its benefits in a V2V highway scenario. The traffic simulation results show a reduction of blockage probability by 20% for C-IRS and 70% for C-RIS as a benchmark, as well as a remarkable improvement in average signal-to-noise ratio by 10–20 dB for C-IRS and 30–40 dB for C-RIS.}

	abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm where sensor-embedded mobile devices are exploited for collecting and sharing environmental data. In MCS, the participating mobile devices sense the environment, collect the data, (pre-)process the data and transmit the data or pre-processing results to the server for further processing. In wireless edge networks, transmission and/or processing of sensed data may be unsuccessful due to the unstable wireless channels, limited bandwidth, energy and computation resources. To optimize the MCS performance, it is imperative to jointly consider the data sensing, processing and transmission for MCS system design. In this paper, we propose a joint sensing, communication and computation (JSCC) framework for multi-dimensional resource constrained MCS systems. We formulate the JSCC design as an optimization problem, by jointly controlling the data sensing, transmission and computation offloading schemes in the system. Simulation results show that the proposed JSCC framework significantly outperforms several baseline solutions without jointly considering data sensing-transmission-computation and/or multi-dimensional resource limitations.}

The key to guide the fusion process is the evaluation of the confidence levels of the outputs provided by various machine learning schemes implemented at individual sensors in the vehicular sensor network. We first propose an evaluation criterion termed as Environmental Sensitivity (ES), which is used to measure the sensitivity of the network to environmental changes. Based on the ES, we further evaluate the confidence of the perception output of neural networks and quantify the confidence level considering the abnormal level of the input data, the general performance of the perception algorithm, the detection performance and the ES of the network. Semantic information fusion algorithm is then developed based upon the confidence levels. Experiment results are provided to validate the proposed fusion method in various scenarios.}

We propose to integrate the grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) paradigm with the emerging orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation to accommodate the massive IoT access, and mitigate the long round-trip latency and severe Doppler effect of terrestrial–satellite links (TSLs). On this basis, we put forward a two-stage successive active terminal identification (ATI) and channel estimation (CE) scheme as well as a low-complexity multi-user signal detection (SD) method. Specifically, at the first stage, the proposed training sequence aided OTFS (TS-OTFS) data frame structure facilitates the joint ATI and coarse CE, whereby both the traffic sparsity of terrestrial IoT terminals and the sparse channel impulse response are leveraged for enhanced performance. Moreover, based on the single Doppler shift property for each TSL and sparsity of delay-Doppler domain channel, we develop a parametric approach to further refine the CE performance. Finally, a least square based parallel time domain SD method is developed to detect the OTFS signals with relatively low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of ATI, CE, and SD performance confronted with the long round-trip latency and severe Doppler effect.}

Due to their automatic and energy-intensive operations, energy efficiency (EE) becomes crucial, but there is a lack of investigation for EE of random access networks, which is the underlying platform for mMTC. In this paper, we focus on the EE of carrier sense multiple access-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) random access networks. We first construct mathematical models. Instead of investigating all combinations regarding successful decoding events as in previous works, by pivoting around the decoding process of a specific signal, a hidden pattern of NOMA decoding process is unveiled, which can largely decrease analytical complexity. Then, together with this feature, by adopting Markov chain and Q-function approximation, closed-form formulation for EE is derived. Subsequently, to efficiently solve the complicated non-convex EE maximization problem built via the constructed models, we employ an approach that unifies complementary geometric programming (CGP) and difference of convex programming (DCP) to optimize all the controllable parameters at device side, namely, transmission probability, power, and data rate, with a tightest lower bound strategy to guarantee seamless EE improvement and very fast convergence to local optimal points even in the worst case. Simulation experiments verify the accuracy of mathematical models and efficiency of optimization scheme.}

	abstract = {To fully unlock the benefits of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, downlink channel state information (CSI) is required at the base station (BS). In frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, the CSI is acquired through a feedback signal from the user equipment (UE). However, this may lead to an important overhead in FDD massive MIMO systems. Focusing on these systems, in this study, we propose a novel strategy to design the CSI feedback. Our strategy allows to optimally design variable length feedback, that is promising compared to fixed feedback since users experience channel matrices differently sparse. Specifically, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to compress the channel into a latent space with adaptive dimensionality. To quantize this compressed channel, the feedback bits are smartly allocated to the latent space dimensions by minimizing the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) distortion. Finally, the quantization codebook is determined with\nk\n-means clustering. Numerical simulations show that our strategy improves the zero-forcing beamforming sum rate by 17%, compared to CsiNetPro. The number of model parameters is reduced by 23.4 times, thus causing a significantly smaller offloading overhead. At the same time, PCA is characterized by a lightweight unsupervised training, requiring eight times fewer training samples than CsiNetPro.}

	abstract = {Edge computing has been introduced as a promising technology for real-time video streaming systems. However, due to the lack of automatic incentives and the limitation of resources, traditional edge computing performs poorly in nowadays scenarios. To handle these two challenges, we propose a framework of J oint I ncentive design and R esource A llocation (JIRA) for edge-based real-time video streaming systems. Technically, to ensure the trust and automatic distribution of incentives, we develop a novel smart contract based incentive mechanism and implement a prototype. Meanwhile, we propose an efficient online algorithm, i.e., JIRA, which dynamically adjusts compression ratio, offloading decision, and resource allocation to achieve performance optimization for video streaming under long-term latency and resource constraints. Specifically, JIRA is based on Lyapunov optimization, which decomposes the challenging long-term decision problem into a series of real-time optimization problems. Then we propose a multi-cut Generalized Benders Decomposition based algorithm (MGA) to tackle the non-convexity of the decomposed problem. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove the performance bound of JIRA. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve an efficient trade-off between accuracy performance and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a general framework for massive random access based on sparse superposition coding. We provide guidelines for the code design and propose the use of constant-weight codes in combination with a dictionary design based on Gabor frames. The decoder applies an extension of approximate message passing (AMP) by iteratively exchanging soft information between an AMP module that accounts for the dictionary structure, and a second inference module that utilizes the structure of the involved constant-weight code. We apply the encoding structure to (i) the unsourced random access setting, where all users employ a common dictionary, and (ii) to the “sourced” random access setting with user-specific dictionaries. When applied to a fading scenario, the communication scheme essentially operates non-coherently, as channel state information is required neither at the transmitter nor at the receiver. We observe that in regimes of practical interest, the proposed scheme compares favorably with state-of-the art schemes, in terms of the (per-user) energy-per-bit requirement, as well as the number of active users that can be simultaneously accommodated in the system. Importantly, this is achieved with a considerably smaller size of the transmitted codewords, potentially yielding lower latency and bandwidth occupancy, as well as lower implementation complexity.}

Multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) technologies successfully utilize spatial diversity to substantially improve spectral efficiency by scheduling multiple devices for simultaneous spectrum access. Efficient solutions to the NP-hard problem of scheduling large number of users are vital to interference mitigation and spectrum efficiency. Despite successes of machine learning in tackling large-scale optimization problems, direct adoption of supervised learning in MIMO user scheduling is difficult as there is no optimum solution to use as labeled training data, and unsupervised learning would identify similar user channel features instead of promoting channel diversity. In this work, we propose an effective and scalable user scheduling paradigm based on unsupervised learning to enhance spatial diversity in both uplink and downlink. Given users’ channel state information (CSI), we first cluster CSIs over the Grassmannian manifold to identify users with high CSI similarity, before scheduling them into MIMO access groups with low co- channel interference. Our paradigm is generalizable to a variety of different simple and scalable unsupervised learning tools and different diversity optimization criteria. Numerical tests demonstrate substantial gain in terms of spectrum efficiency and interference suppression at modest computation complexity.}

	abstract = {Most works on federated learning (FL) focus on the most common frequentist formulation of learning whereby the goal is minimizing the global empirical loss. Frequentist learning, however, is known to be problematic in the regime of limited data as it fails to quantify epistemic uncertainty in prediction. Bayesian learning provides a principled solution to this problem by shifting the optimization domain to the space of distribution in the model parameters. This paper proposes a novel mechanism for the efficient implementation of Bayesian learning in wireless systems. Specifically, we focus on a standard gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, namely Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), and we introduce a novel protocol, termed Wireless Federated LMC (WFLMC), that is able to repurpose channel noise for the double role of seed randomness for MCMC sampling and of privacy preservation. To this end, based on the analysis of the Wasserstein distance between sample distribution and global posterior distribution under privacy and power constraints, we introduce a power allocation strategy as the solution of a convex program. The analysis identifies distinct operating regimes in which the performance of the system is power-limited, privacy-limited, or limited by the requirement of MCMC sampling. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that, if the channel noise is properly accounted for under suitable conditions, it can be fully repurposed for both MCMC sampling and privacy preservation, obtaining the same performance as in an ideal communication setting that is not subject to privacy constraints.}

Unlike conventional methods of analyzing URLLC performance using average error rate, we focus on the events of burst or clustered (reception) errors 1 as they can be fatal for certain real-time wireless control systems. In the proposed method, to see the impact of clustered errors on the performance, a virtual queue is considered, where the reception error sequence is regarded as the arrival process and the departure process is characterized by the target error rate. This virtual queue allows to find how often the events of clustered errors of certain sizes occur using large deviations theory. For packet-level channels modeled by an independent and identically distributed process and a two-state Markov chain, the quality-of-service exponents are derived, and the asymptotic probability of buffer overflow is obtained, which agrees with simulation results. This demonstrates that the proposed method using virtual queue is useful to find the probability of system failure due to clustered errors and allows to determine the values of key parameters of URLLC for a certain probability of system failure under given conditions.}

In this work, we focus on the joint US-BF design with the goal of maximizing the set cardinality of scheduled users, which is computationally challenging due to the non-convex objective function and the coupled constraints with discrete-continuous variables. To tackle these difficulties, a successive convex approximation based US-BF (SCA-USBF) optimization algorithm is firstly proposed. Then, inspired by wireless intelligent communication, a graph neural network based joint US-BF (J-USBF) learning algorithm is developed by combining the joint US and power allocation network model with the BF analytical solution. The effectiveness of SCA-USBF and J-USBF is verified by various numerical results, the latter achieves close performance and higher computational efficiency.

	abstract = {As a way of providing users flexible computing services, networks exist that can make full use of air and ground computing resources. Such networks are called air-ground collaborative mobile edge computing (AGC-MEC) networks. AGC-MEC supports numerous emerging real-time applications for which timely computed results are critical. Researchers have developed a novel metric “age of information (AoI)” that can capture the freshness of computed results. This is the first paper to study the problem of Ao I -aware scheduling for A ir-ground C ollaborative mobile E dge computing (i.e., IACE). So as to minimize the weighted AoI of all the terrestrial user equipments (UEs), we have jointly optimized task scheduling, computing resource allocation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory taking into account the constraints on the computing resources and the available energy of the UAV. The formulated problem, which is a challenge to solve, is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To obtain an effective solution, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization approach, which entails dividing the considered problem into three subproblems. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower weighted AoI than five benchmark algorithms, while satisfying the resource constraints. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate two interesting insights. First, the introduction of an aerial MEC server facilitates a flexible offloading design of the UEs which is critical to guaranteeing the freshness of computed results. Second, by optimizing the scheduling, the proposed design can unlock performance gains, especially in the resource-limited regime.}

	abstract = {Enabling ultra-reliable and low-latency communication services while providing massive connectivity is one of the major goals to be accomplished in future wireless communication networks. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a hybrid multi-access scheme in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime that combines the advantages of both non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. Two latency-sensitive application scenarios are studied, distinguished by whether the queuing behaviour has an influence on the transmission performance or not. In particular, for the latency-critical case with one-shot transmission, we aim at a certain physical-layer quality-of-service (QoS) performance, namely the optimization of the reliability. And for the case in which queuing behaviour plays a role, we focus on the link-layer QoS performance and provide a design that maximizes the effective capacity. For both designs, we leverage the characterizations in the FBL regime to provide the optimal framework by jointly allocating the blocklength and transmit power of each user. In particular, for the reliability-oriented design, the original problem is decomposed and the joint convexity of sub-problems is shown via a variable substitution method. For the effective-capacity-oriented design, we exploit the method of Lagrange multipliers to formulate a solvable dual problem with strong duality to the original problem. Via simulations, we validate our analytical results of convexity/concavity and show the advantage of our proposed approaches compared to other existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Power splitting (PS) based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is considered in a multi-user multiple-input-single-output broadcast scenario. Specifically, we focus on jointly configuring the transmit beamforming vectors and receive PS ratios to minimize the total transmit energy of the base station under the user-specific latency and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The battery depletion phenomenon is avoided by preemptively incorporating information regarding the receivers’ battery state and EH fluctuations into the resource allocation design. The resulting time-average sum-power minimization problem is temporally correlated, non-convex (including mutually coupled latency-battery queue dynamics), and in general intractable. We use the Lyapunov optimization framework and derive a dynamic control algorithm to transform the original problem into a sequence of per-time-slot deterministic and independent subproblems. The latter are then solved via two alternative approaches: i) semidefinite relaxation combined with fractional programming, and ii) successive convex approximation. Furthermore, we design a low-complexity closed-form iterative algorithm exploiting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for a specific scenario with delay bounded batteryless receivers. Numerical results provide insights on the robustness of the proposed designs to realize an energy-efficient SWIPT system while ensuring latency and EH requirements in a time dynamic network.}

Our goal is to design an online controller that dynamically schedules users and configures their links to minimize system delay. To solve this complex scheduling problem, we model it as a dynamic decision-making process and develop two reinforcement learning-based solutions. The first solution is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which leverages the proximal policy optimization to train a neural network-based solution. Due to the potential high sample complexity of DRL, we also propose an empirical multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based solution, which decomposes the decision-making process into a sequential of sub-actions and exploits classic maxweight scheduling and Thompson sampling to decide those sub-actions. Our evaluation of the proposed solutions confirms their effectiveness in providing acceptable system delay. It also shows that the DRL-based solution has better delay performance while the MAB-based solution has a faster training process.}

This paper considers the uplink of fully and partially centralized CF networks where unmanned aerial vehicles serve as flying base stations (FBSs). A subset of FBSs participates in the reception of each user and a subset of users is received by each FBS. Deterministic equivalent expressions, exact asymptotically in the subset sizes and approximate for finite dimensions thereof, are derived for the spectral efficiency under Rician fading. Capitalizing on these expressions, the FBS deployment problem is investigated for different receiver architectures. The nonconvex deployment problem, tackled through a combination of gradient-based and Gibbs sampling algorithms, results in a superior performance with respect to a square grid deployment; this superiority extends to the minimum and aggregate spectral efficiency for both fully and partially centralized cell-free networks.}

	abstract = {The polarized massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique has been regarded as a promising solution to millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, because it experiences more degrees-of-freedom than the scalar configuration, and it represents a significant opportunity for secure communication. To deliver smart service to terminals, it is essential to provide base stations (BS) with the capability of terminal’s direction-of-arrival (DOA) awareness. In this paper, a compressive sampling (CS) framework is proposed for two-dimensional (2D) DOA and polarization estimation in mmWave polarized massive MIMO systems. The proposed approach first reduces the data volume via a reduced-dimension matrix. Then it computes the signal subspace via the eigendecomposition of the compressed array measurement. Thereafter, the rotational invariance characteristic is utilized to form a normalized polarization steering vector. Finally, 2D-DOA and polarization are estimated by incorporating the Poynting vector and the least squares (LS) techniques. The proposed architecture is computationally much more economical than existing algorithms. Besides, it allows a mmWave BS to provide comparable estimation performance with arbitrary sensor geometry, which is more flexible than most of the existing architectures. Furthermore, it is robust to the sensor position error. Numerical simulations verify the advantages of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is a promising technique for high mobility wireless communications, as it approaches a sparse representation of doubly-selective fading channel and can obtain delay-Doppler (DD) diversity gain. However, in practical OTFS systems, fractional channel parameter is a great challenge and will seriously deteriorates the sparsity and the performance of channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation scheme for doubly selective channel in the presence of both fractional Doppler and fractional delay. First, we analyze the input-output relationship of single-input single-output (SISO) OTFS system based on the integer sampling DD grid, then extend it to the fractional DD grid. Compared with the integer DD domain, the model in the fractional DD domain is sparser and more accurate. Based on our analysis, two kinds of off-grid models, i.e., doubly fractional model and mixed one- and two-dimensional (1&2D) fractional models are proposed and compared. The mixed 1&2D fractional model has an advantage of low complexity, but encounters a tandem off-grid distortion. To tackle this distortion problem, as well as to balance the accuracy and the computational workload, a novel two dimensional off-grid decomposition and combination scheme is proposed based on the doubly and mixed 1&2D fractional model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed channel estimation schemes, compared with the existing work for OTFS systems under doubly selective channels.}

	abstract = {This paper concerns with efficient communication over Gaussian and fading multiple-access channels (MACs). Existing orthogonal multiple-access (OMA) and power-domain nonorthogonal-OMA (NOMA) cannot achieve all rate-tuples in the MAC capacity region. Meanwhile, code-domain NOMA schemes usually require big-loop receiver-iterations for multi-user decoding, which is subject to high implementation cost and latency. This paper studies a linear physical-layer network coding multiple access (LPNC-MA) scheme that is capable of achieving any rate-tuples in the MAC capacity region without receiver iterations. For deterministic Gaussian MACs with M\nusers, we propose to utilize q\n-ary irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) codes over finite integer fields/rings and q\n-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( q\n-PAM) as the underlying coded-modulation. The receiver sequentially computes M\nnetwork coded (NC) messages of the M\nusers. All users’ messages are then recovered by solving the computed M\nNC messages via the inverse of the NC coefficient matrix. A joint nested code construction and extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart based code optimization method is developed, yielding near-capacity performance (within 0.7 and 1.1 dB the capacity limits for two and three users respectively). For fading MAC, we study the symmetric rate of LPNC-MA, and propose a pragmatic method for identifying the mutual information (MI) maximizing network coding coefficient matrix. Numerical results demonstrate that the frame error rate (FER) of the optimized LPNC-MA is within a fraction of dB the outage probability of fading MAC capacity. LPNC-MA remarkably outperforms NOMA-SIC and IDMA while avoiding the big-loop receiver iteration.}

	abstract = {Timely identification of outliers occurring in key performance indicators (KPIs) of mobile cellular networks is crucial for prompt action to unexpected events. The KPIs of cellular networks typically exhibit seasonality and trend effects and these make the detection of outliers challenging. In this paper, an online unsupervised deep machine learning (DML) algorithm for outlier detection for time series with seasonality and trend is proposed. The proposed algorithm utilizes a neural network based on a temporal convolution network (TCN) and an autoencoder (AE) to reconstruct a time series that captures the normal behavior of the input data and then the reconstruction errors between the input and reconstructed time series at the output of the TCN-AE network are used for outlier detection. To train the TCN-AE network to learn the normal behavior of the input time series, we propose a two-step training process to overcome the presence of outliers in the training data. In addition, a novel loss function specially designed to address the seasonality and trend effects of the time series is proposed. Furthermore, a pre-processing technique is used to combat the adverse trend effect which might cause false alarms in outlier detection. The performance of the proposed TCN-AE-based outlier detection algorithm is evaluated using synthetic time series, Yahoo Webscope dataset and real time series of KPIs of mobile cellular networks. The results show that the proposed TCN-AE-based outlier detection algorithm achieves better detection accuracy in terms of F-score than other DML-based algorithms such as long short-term memory (LSTM)-AE-based algorithm and the convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithm.}

This paper investigates the scenario where multiple UAVs cooperatively fly over heterogeneous ground users (GUs) and collect data without a central controller. With the consideration of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and fairness among users, we jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and the GUs associations to maximize the total throughput and energy efficiency. We formulate the long-term optimization problem as a decentralized partially observed Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDP) and derive an approach combining the coalition formation game (CFG) and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). We first formulate the discrete association scheduling problem as a non-cooperative theoretical game and use the CFG algorithm to achieve a decentralized scheme converging to Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, a MARL-based technique is developed to optimize the trajectories and energy consumption continuously in a centralized-training but decentralized-execution manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the commonly used schemes in the literature, regarding the fair throughput and energy consumption in a distributed manner.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a general framework on the hybrid analog-digital transceiver design for multi-hop communications. For the inclusive purpose, a transceiver model unifying both linear and nonlinear transceivers has been taken into account. Various performance metrics, including the most representative capacity and weighted mean-squared error (MSE), have been investigated in a unified manner. In particular, to meet practical needs for the quality of services (QoS), a general eigenvalue power constraint model is introduced, which contains a sum power constraint and box eigenvalue constraints as special cases. Specifically, by carefully designing the auxiliary analog and digital beamformers, the multi-hop transceiver optimization is decomposed into a series of independent sub-problems, where the analog beamformers for different hops are completely decoupled. Based on that, this framework establishes a majorization-minimization (MM) based analog beamformer design algorithm, which is able to handle the complicated weighted unit-modulus matrix optimizations by finding their semi-closed-form solutions. Furthermore, an efficient waterfilling algorithm is proposed for the digital beamformer designs to deal with the difficulties of optimizations subject to the multiple eigenvalue power constraints. The numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate that due to large variations in link signal-to-noise-ratios, the key to good performance in underlay cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (CNOMA) is intelligent adaptation. First adaptation involves switching between the cooperative mode (CM) and the non-cooperative mode (NCM). While a full-duplex near user (NU) assists the multiple-antenna base-station in communication to a far user (FU) in CM, allowing the NU to switch to NCM ensures that its performance is same as in a network without the FU. The second adaptation relates to transmit antenna selection. In the first scheme, the NOMA power allocation parameter (NPAP), and the interference temperature limit (ITL) apportioning parameter (ITLAP) depend on channel statistics. The third adaptation (presented for the first time in literature) used in two other proposed schemes involves selection of inter-dependent NPAP and ITLAP based on channel state information (CSI). The fourth adaptation used in the third proposed scheme relates to use of CSI-dependent ITL, which is shown to dramatically improve performance. Optimum choices of NPAP and ITLAP are expressed in closed-form for all three schemes, and performance with these is analyzed (and validated by computer simulations) assuming imperfect successive interference cancellation and residual self-interference cancellation at the NU.}

	abstract = {To ensure a seamless mobility of users in the scenario with flying base stations (FlyBSs) and static ground base stations (GBSs), an efficient handover mechanism is required. In this paper, we introduce new framework simultaneously managing cell individual offset (CIO) for handover of both FlyBSs and mobile users. Our objective is to maximize capacity of the mobile users while considering also a cost of handover to reflect potential excessive signaling and energy consumption due to redundant handovers. This problem is of a very high complexity for conventional optimization methods and optimal solution would require knowledge of information commonly not available to the mobile network. Hence, we adjust the CIO of FlyBSs and GBSs via reinforcement learning. First, we adopt Q- learning to solve the problem. Due to practical limitations implied by a large Q-table, we also propose Q- learning with approximated Q-table. Still, for larger networks, even the approximated Q-table can require a large storage and computation time. Therefore, we apply also actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results demonstrate that all three proposed algorithms converge promptly and increase the communication capacity by dozens of percent while the handover failure ratio and the handover ping-pong ratio are reduced multiple times compared to state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {The polarization domain provides an extra degree of freedom (DoF) for improving the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper takes advantage of this additional DoF to alleviate practical issues of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) schemes. Specifically, we propose three dual-polarized downlink transmission approaches for a massive MIMO-RSMA network under the effects of polarization interference and residual errors of imperfect SIC. The first approach implements polarization multiplexing for transmitting the users’ data messages, which removes the need to execute SIC in the reception. The second approach transmits replicas of users’ messages in the two polarizations, which enables users to exploit diversity through the polarization domain. The third approach, in its turn, employs the original SIC-based RSMA technique per polarization, and this allows the BS to transmit two independent superimposed data streams simultaneously. An in-depth theoretical analysis is carried out, in which we derive tight closed-form approximations for the outage probabilities of the three proposed approaches. Accurate approximations for the ergodic sum-rates of the two first schemes are also derived. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. For instance, under low to moderate cross-polar interference, the results show that, even under high levels of residual SIC error, our dual-polarized MIMO-RSMA strategies outperform the conventional single-polarized MIMO-RSMA counterpart. It is also shown that the performance of all RSMA schemes is impressively higher than that of single and dual-polarized massive MIMO systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques.}

	abstract = {Due to their flexibility and low cost deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) will most likely act as base stations and backhaul relays in the next generation of wireless communication systems. However, these UAVs—in the untethered mode—can only operate for a finite time due to limited energy they carry in their batteries. In free-space optical communications, one solution is to transport both data and energy from the source to the UAV through the laser beam—a concept known as simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). In this study, we have analyzed the SLIPT scheme for laser-powered decode-and-forward UAV relays in an optical wireless backhaul. The major goal of this study is to optimally allocate the received beam energy between the decoding circuit, the transmitting circuit and the rotor block of the relay in order to maximize a quality-of-service metric such as maximum achievable rate, outage or error probabilities. As expected, we note that the optimal power allocation depends heavily on the source-relay and relay-destination channel conditions. In the final part of this study, we have maximized the operational time of the UAV relay given that the maximum achievable rate stays above a certain threshold in order to meet a minimum quality-of-service requirement.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communications are regarded as a pillar technology for the 6G systems, by offering multi-ten-GHz bandwidth. To overcome the huge propagation loss, THz ultra-massive MIMO systems with hybrid beamforming are proposed to offer high array gain. Notably, the adjustable phase shifters considered in most existing hybrid beamforming studies are power-hungry and difficult to realize in the THz band. Moreover, due to the ultra-massive antennas, full channel-state-information (CSI) is challenging to obtain. To address these practical concerns, in this paper, an energy-efficient dynamic-subarray with fixed phase shifters (DS-FPS) architecture is proposed for THz hybrid beamforming. To compensate for the spectral efficiency loss caused by the fixed phase of FPS, a switch network is inserted to enable dynamic connections. In addition, by considering the partial CSI, we propose a row-successive-decomposition (RSD) algorithm to design the hybrid beamforming matrices for DS-FPS. A row-by-row (RBR) algorithm is further proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive simulation results show that, the proposed DS-FPS architecture with the RSD and RBR algorithms achieves much higher energy efficiency than the existing architectures. Moreover, the spectral efficiency of the DS-FPS architecture with the proposed algorithms is robust to the CSI error.}

	abstract = {This work investigates the covert information freshness in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided communications, where a public full-duplex user (Alice) and a private full-duplex user (Bob) exchange information in the presence of a watchful warden (Willie). In particular, with the help of Alice’s undisguised signal transmission, Bob can establish covert communications such that his transmission can be shielded from Willie. Considering both the non-retransmission protocol and the automatic repeat-request (ARQ) protocol for Bob’s transmission, we study the resource allocation design. By exploiting the channel statistics, the joint design of active beamforming at Alice and Bob, the passive beamforming at the IRS, and the packet length of the confidential data packet is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which minimizes the age of information (AoI) at Alice for the two considered protocols taking into account the quality of service in terms of the maximum tolerable AoI at Bob and communication covertness. To circumvent the non-convexity of the design problem, we propose alternating optimization algorithms to find effective solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed optimization algorithms over various benchmarks and unveil the decrease of the optimized packet length with the improved covert channel quality.}

Existing BA methods search the entire beam space to identify the optimal transmit-receive beam pair. This incurs a significant latency when the number of antennas is large. In this work, we develop a bandit-based fast BA algorithm to reduce BA latency for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Our algorithm is named Two-Phase Heteroscedastic Track-and-Stop (2PHT&S). We first formulate the BA problem as a pure exploration problem in multi-armed bandits in which the objective is to minimize the required number of time steps given a certain fixed confidence level. By taking advantage of the correlation structure among beams that the information from nearby beams is similar and the heteroscedastic property that the variance of the reward of an arm (beam) is related to its mean, the proposed algorithm groups all beams into several beam sets such that the optimal beam set is first selected and the optimal beam is identified in this set after that. Theoretical analysis and simulation results on synthetic and semi-practical channel data demonstrate the clear superiority of the proposed algorithm vis-à-vis other baseline competitors.}

Therefore, this paper investigates a buffer-aided cooperative relaying system with\nK\nrelays and a direct link from the source to the destination, providing a general scenario different from other existing state-of-the-art techniques. In particular, we propose a novel link selection scheme, which adaptively coordinates the selection priorities of the direct and cooperative relay link according to the instantaneous buffer state. The performance of the proposed link selection scheme is analyzed, in terms of outage probability, average packet delay (APD) and diversity order by providing closed-form expressions. For asymptotic analysis, a theoretical framework is presented by dividing all buffer states into different sets, which verifies that the minimum buffer size is just two for achieving the full diversity order of\n2K+1\n. We also provide the relationship between the asymptotic APD and diversity order by adjusting predefined target queue lengths, which shows that the diversity order ranges from\nK+1\nto\n2K+1\nas the asymptotic APD ranges from 0 to\nK\ntime slots per packet. Both theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that direct transmission significantly improves the outage and delay performance simultaneously.}

	abstract = {As an important part of the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied in various communication scenarios due to their high operability and low cost. In this paper, we investigate a multi-UAV communication system with moving users and consider the co-channel interference caused by the transmissions of all other UAVs. To ensure the fairness, we maximize the minimum average user rate during the observed time by jointly optimizing UAVs’ trajectories, transmission power, and user association. Considering that UAVs can cover a large area for communications, UAVs do not need to move as soon as the users move. Therefore, a two-timescale structure is proposed for the considered scenario, where the UAVs’ trajectories are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) in a long timescale, while the transmission power and the user association are optimized based on the instantaneous CSI in a short timescale. To effectively tackle this challenging non-convex problem with both discrete and continuous variables, we propose a joint neural network (NN) design, where a deep reinforcement learning based Pointer Network named advantage pointer-critic (APC) is applied to optimize discrete variables and a deep-unfolding NN is used to optimize the continuous variables. Specifically, we first formulate a Markov decision process to model the user association, and then employ the APC network trained by the advantage actor-critic algorithm to address it. The APC network consists of a Pointer Network and a Multilayer Perceptron. As for the deep-unfolding NN, we first develop a block coordinate descent based algorithm to optimize the UAVs’ trajectories and transmission power, and then unfold the algorithm into a layer-wise NN with introduced trainable parameters. These two networks are jointly trained in an unsupervised fashion. Simulation results validate that the proposed joint NN significantly outperforms the optimization algorithm with much lower complexity, and achieves good performances on scalability and generalization ability.}

Two geometry-based models are aided for estimating the first and last hop scatterers under different bouncing orders. The performance of the proposed algorithm, as called geometry-aided SAGE (GA-SAGE), is illustrated by means of the Cramér-Rao lower bound derived for parameter estimates and the root-mean-square-estimation-errors (RMSEEs) obtained through and Monte-Carlo simulations, which shows the applicability both near- and far-field estimation. Finally, the GA-SAGE is applied to processing the experimental data obtained from measurements in an indoor office environment by using a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) configuration. The obtained results show that the method proposed outperforms the traditional SAGE algorithm in terms of MPCs estimation accuracy, convergence rate, and the extra capability of localizing scatterers involved in different bouncing order propagation paths. It is considered useful in environment sensing alike applications and makes the GA-SAGE an efficient and effective tool for the development of geometry-based stochastic channel models capable of reproducing channel realizations of the so-called spatial consistency or spatial non-stationarity, which are the basis for the design of transmission technologies using extremely-large antenna array (ELAA) for 5G and beyond.}

Traditional codebooks are designed for universal environments, although in practice a particular BS will only serve a particular environment. In this paper, we propose novel site-specific codebook design methods by utilizing the visual information captured through cameras. Different from other site-specific codebook design methods that require a large amount of measured channel state information (CSI), the proposed ones need only a simple snapshot of the environment followed by efficient computer vision (CV) techniques. Thus the proposed CV-aided codebook design reduces the overhead of communications system, such as the cost of time, human resources, as well as the hardware installation and calibration. Specifically, we propose a CV-based approach that detects the LOS area around the BS and reconstructs the LOS channel vectors set (CVS). With this knowledge, we build a vision-based beam codebook using Lloyd algorithm. Further, we design a FusionNet to generate the codebook that can serve the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) users. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CV-aided codebook design methods and their superiority compared to the conventional methods.}

Differing from most existing approaches that first estimate channels and then optimize phase shifts, the proposed blind beamforming method explores the wireless environment by extracting statistical features directly from random samples of the received signal power, without acquiring channel station information (CSI). This new method just requires a polynomial number of random samples to provide a quadratic SNR boost in the number of reflective elements without CSI, whereas the standard random-max sampling algorithm can only achieve a linear boost under the same condition. Moreover, we interpret blind beamforming from a least-squares point of view. Field tests demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed blind beamforming approach over the benchmark methods in enhancing wireless transmission.}

To guarantee the performance of joint support recovery in noisy environments, different kinds of prior information are required, one of which is sparsity, a time-varying parameter. To address the dependence of recovery performance on signal sparsity, this paper proposed a two-step scheme for blind wideband spectrum sensing using a Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) sub-Nyquist sampling front-end. The scheme first adopts the model order selection (MOS) method to estimate sparsity from the compressed covariance matrix, and then uses the estimates to dynamically adjust joint support recovery. The complete theoretical derivation innovatively applies MOS to sub-Nyquist sampling and presents a design method for MOS penalty constant. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only achieve blind sensing under the spectrum occupancy up to 40%, reduce the overall computational complexity of iterative SOMP, but also significantly improve the false alarm performance, meeting the requirements of the IEEE 802.22 standard.}

	abstract = {Although in-band full-duplex (IBFD) communication can theoretically double the spectral efficiency compared with conventional wireless communication technologies, it cannot be realized without reducing a high-power self-interference (SI) signal. Since the SI signal is affected by nonlinear distortion of radio-frequency (RF) circuits of its own terminal, cancellation systems capable of removing the nonlinear distorted SI have been actively developed. Detailed theoretical analysis based on the authors’ past literature shows that for IBFD using a nonlinear self-interference canceller, the symbol error rate is improved when the power amplifier has certain distortion characteristics rather than being ideally linearized. However, it is not yet known what amplifier characteristics are best for the IBFD system. In this study, we theoretically analyze the self-interference signal to clarify the optimum amplifier characteristics for the IBFD system. An optimization problem to obtain an optimum transfer function from theoretical analysis is formulated as an Rayleigh quotient with constraints, and we introduce a numerical technique to solve the optimization problem. By numerical experiments, we show that the SI cancellation performance, signal-to-interference-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SIDNR), and amplifier’s power efficiency are improved by the optimization.}

	abstract = {A cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) system can provide uniform spectral efficiency (SE) with simple signal processing. On the other hand, a recently introduced technology called hybrid relay-reflecting intelligent surface (HR-RIS) can customize the physical propagation environment by simultaneously reflecting and amplifying radio waves in preferred directions. Thus, it is natural that incorporating HR-RIS into CF mMIMO can be a symbiotic convergence of these two technologies for future wireless communications. This motivates us to consider an HR-RIS-aided CF mMIMO system to utilize their combined benefits. We first model the uplink/downlink channels and derive the minimum-mean-square-error estimate of the effective channels. We then present a comprehensive analysis of SE performance of the considered system. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the uplink and downlink SE. The results reveal important observations on the performance gains achieved by HR-RISs compared to conventional systems. The presented analytical results are also valid for conventional CF mMIMO systems and those aided by passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. Such results play an important role in designing new transmission strategies and optimizing HR-RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to verify the analytical derivations and the effectiveness of the proposed system design under various settings.}

	abstract = {To legitimately eavesdrop communications of suspicious users such as criminals, proactive eavesdropping has been proposed as an effective approach. Current works considered that suspicious communication links (SCLs) carry homogeneous services, which is unrealistic due to randomness of user behaviors. Thus, this paper investigates proactive eavesdropping over multiple SCLs with heterogeneous services. The relative eavesdropping non-outage probability and the relative eavesdropping rate are adopted as eavesdropping utilities for delay-sensitive (DS) and delay-tolerant (DT) suspicious services, respectively. The jamming power allocation problem to maximize the weighted sum eavesdropping utility under the average transmit power constraint at the monitor is investigated under the non-adaptive fixed power allocation and the adaptive power allocation schemes adopted by the SCLs. The problem belongs to sum-of-ratios optimization and is transformed to an equivalent parameterized subtractive-form with some extra auxiliary variables. Two nested optimizations are proposed to solve the equivalent problem based on the Lagrange duality method and the damped Newton method. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to various benchmark algorithms in existing literature. It is shown that the impacts of the power allocation schemes of the SCLs on the eavesdropping performance may be different for the DS and DT suspicious services under different system setups.}

	abstract = {To support modern machine-type communications, a crucial task during the random access phase is device activity detection, which is to identify the active devices from a large number of potential devices based on the received signal at the access point. By utilizing the statistical properties of the channel, state-of-the-art covariance based methods have been demonstrated to achieve better activity detection performance than compressed sensing based methods. However, covariance based methods require to solve a high dimensional nonconvex optimization problem by updating the estimate of the activity status of each device sequentially. Since the number of updates is proportional to the device number, the computational complexity and delay make the iterative updates difficult for real-time implementation especially when the device number scales up. Inspired by the success of deep learning for real-time inference, this paper proposes a learning based method with a customized heterogeneous transformer architecture for device activity detection. By adopting an attention mechanism in the architecture design, the proposed method is able to extract features reflecting relevance among device pilots and received signal, permutation equivariant with respect to devices, and its training parameter number is independent of the device number. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better activity detection performance with much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art covariance approach, and generalizes well to different numbers of devices and BS-antennas, different pilot lengths, transmit powers, and cell radii.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the communications between a source and a destination. Recently, continuous aperture RIS is proved to have better communication performance than discrete aperture RIS and has received much attention. However, the conventional continuous aperture RIS is designed to convert the incoming planar waves into the outgoing planar waves, which is not the optimal reflecting scheme when the receiver is not a planar array and is located in the near field of the RIS. In this paper, we consider two types of receivers in the radiating near field of the RIS: (1) when the receiver is equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA), we design RIS coefficient to convert planar waves into cylindrical waves; (2) when the receiver is equipped with a single antenna, we design RIS coefficient to convert planar waves into spherical waves. We then propose the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the focal scanning (FS) method to sense the location of the receiver based on the analytic expression of the reflection coefficient, and derive the corresponding position error bound (PEB). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce energy leakage and thus enlarge the channel capacity compared to the conventional scheme. Moreover, the location of the receiver could be accurately sensed by the ML method with large computation complexity or be roughly sensed by the FS method with small computation complexity.}

For our designed algorithms in this paper, WF-EE-MIMO1, as the subordinate algorithm, is only used for the inner level. IWF-EE-MIMO, as the main algorithm, computes the solution to the considered problem. Note that IWF-EE-MIMO includes WF-EE-MIMO1, to avoid confusion. The considered problem is of non-linear fractional semi-definite optimization in complex-valued matrix optimization variables, beyond the range of standard (semi-definite) optimization theory. Thus, the optimality condition of the considered maximization problem needs to be created.

With a massive number of antennas at the base station (BS), MaMIMO is best equipped to cater prominent use cases of B5G networks such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) or combinations thereof. However, one of the critical challenges to this pursuit is the sporadic access behaviour of a massive number of devices in practical networks that inevitably leads to the conspicuous pilot contamination problem. Conventional linearly precoded physical layer strategies employed for downlink transmission in time division duplex (TDD) MaMIMO would incur a noticeable spectral efficiency (SE) loss in the presence of this pilot contamination. In this paper, we aim to integrate a robust multiple access and interference management strategy named rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with TDD MaMIMO for downlink transmission and investigate its SE performance. We propose a novel downlink transmission framework of RSMA in TDD MaMIMO, devise a precoder design strategy and power allocation schemes to maximize different network utility functions. Numerical results reveal that RSMA is significantly more robust to pilot contamination and always achieves a SE performance that is equal to or better than the conventional linearly precoded MaMIMO transmission strategy.}

Channel prediction, as an effective approach to acquire CSI, is considered a promising approach to improve the communication performance. However, most of the current prediction methods with the assumption of slowly varying channel components cannot cope with rapid variation. In this paper, we propose a novel channel prediction scheme to incorporate the mobility of both transceivers and scatterers. Based on the estimated mobility parameters, the component-wise channel extraction results are derived and then the channel frequency response is predicted. In addition, the prediction performance and the computational complexity of the proposed scheme are analyzed and evaluated, and the relationship between the mobility parameter estimation error and the channel component prediction accuracy is revealed as well. Through predicted results based on the simulated and measured data, the performance of the proposed scheme surpasses the conventional schemes with genie-aided information.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted wireless systems require accurate channel state information (CSI) to control wireless channels and improve both the bandwidth and energy efficiency. However, CSI acquisition is non-trivial for two reasons: 1) the passive nature of RIS does not allow transceiving and processing pilot signals, and 2) the dimensions of the cascaded channel between transceivers increases with the large number of RIS elements, which yields high training overhead and computational complexity. While prior art has mainly focused on frequency-flat channel estimation, this paper proposes novel data-driven and compressive sensing based approaches for estimating both frequency-flat and frequency-selective cascaded channels of RIS-assisted multi-user millimeter-wave large multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with limited training overhead. The proposed methods exploit the common sparsity property among the different subcarriers and the double-structured sparsity property of the angular cascaded channel matrices as different angular cascaded channels observed by different users share completely common non-zero rows and user-specific column supports. The proposed data-driven cascaded channel estimation approaches use denoising neural networks to accurately detect channel supports. Alternatively, when data-training capabilities are not available, the compressive sensing based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) approach relies on sparsity properties and applies simultaneous OMP to detect the channel supports. Simulation results show that the pilot overhead required by the proposed scheme is lower than existing schemes. When compared to other OMP approaches that achieve an NMSE gap of 5 to 6 dB with respect to the Oracle least square lower bound, the proposed algorithms reduce the lower bound gap to only 1 dB, while reducing complexity by more than two orders of magnitude.}

	abstract = {In the upcoming next-generation (5G-Advanced and 6G) wireless networks, sensing as a service will play a more important role than ever before. Recently, the concept of perceptive network is proposed as a paradigm shift that provides sensing and communication (S&C) services simultaneously. This type of technology is typically referred to as Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). In this paper, we propose the concept of sensing quality of service (QoS) in terms of diverse applications. Specifically, the probability of detection, the Crámer-Rao bound (CRB) for parameter estimation and the posterior CRB for moving target indication are employed to measure the sensing QoS for detection, localization, and tracking, respectively. Then, we establish a unified framework for ISAC resource allocation, where the fairness and the comprehensiveness optimization criteria are considered for the aforementioned sensing services. The proposed schemes can flexibly allocate the limited power and bandwidth resources according to both S&C QoSs. Finally, we study the performance trade-off between S&C services in different resource allocation schemes by numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has been extensively studied to enable distributed and tamper-proof data processing in federated learning (FL). Most existing blockchain assisted FL (BFL) frameworks have employed a third-party blockchain network to decentralize the model aggregation process. However, decentralized model aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the third-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client side. To optimize the learning performance of FL, we propose to maximize the long-term time average (LTA) training data size under a constraint of LTA energy consumption. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of training client selection and resource allocation (i.e., the transmit power and computation frequency at the client side), and solve the long-term mixed integer non-linear program based on a Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling (DRACS) algorithm can achieve a trade-off of [\nO(1/V)\n,\nO(\nV\n−\n−\n√\n)\n] to balance the maximization of the LTA training data size and the minimization of the LTA energy consumption with a control parameter\nV\n. Our experimental results show that the proposed DRACS algorithm achieves better learning accuracy than benchmark client scheduling strategies with limited time or energy consumption.}

To resolve these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been recently adopted, as they can effectively exploit the domain knowledge, i.e., the graph topology in wireless communications problems. GNN-based methods can achieve near-optimal performance in large-scale networks and generalize well under different system settings, but the theoretical underpinnings and design guidelines remain elusive, which may hinder their practical implementations. This paper endeavors to fill both the theoretical and practical gaps. For theoretical guarantees, we prove that GNNs achieve near-optimal performance in wireless networks with much fewer training samples than traditional neural architectures. Specifically, to solve an optimization problem on an\nn\n-node graph (where the nodes may represent users, base stations, or antennas), GNNs’ generalization error and required number of training samples are\nO(n)\nand\nO(\nn\n2\n)\ntimes lower than the unstructured multi-layer perceptrons. For design guidelines, we propose a unified framework that is applicable to general design problems in wireless networks, which includes graph modeling, neural architecture design, and theory-guided performance enhancement. Extensive simulations, which cover a variety of important problems and network settings, verify our theory and the effectiveness of the proposed design framework.}

	abstract = {In time-division duplexing (TDD) millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the reciprocity mismatch severely degrades the performance of the hybrid beamforming (HBF). In this work, to mitigate the detrimental effect of the reciprocity mismatch, we investigate reciprocity calibration for the mmWave-HBF system with a fully-connected phase shifter network. To reduce the overhead and computational complexity of reciprocity calibration, we first decouple digital radio frequency (RF) chains and analog RF chains with beamforming design. Then, the entire calibration problem of the HBF system is equivalently decomposed into two subproblems corresponding to the digital-chain calibration and analog-chain calibration. To solve the calibration problems efficiently, a closed-form solution to the digital-chain calibration problem is derived, while an iterative-alternating optimization algorithm for the analog-chain calibration problem is proposed. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithm, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound on the errors in estimating mismatch coefficients. The results reveal that the estimation errors of mismatch coefficients of digital and analog chains are uncorrelated, and that the mismatch coefficients of receive digital chains can be estimated perfectly. Simulation results are presented to validate the analytical results and to show the performance of the proposed calibration approach.}

Different from the conventional phased arrays, the leaky-wave antenna has the potential of improving the sensing accuracy with lower system overhead thanks to its unique spatial-spectral coupling feature. The generalized mobile scenario is studied in which vehicles drive at time-varying speeds. A novel unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based solution is proposed to track the vehicles without requirement of addressing the Doppler effect. Based on the estimated states of multiple vehicles, a low-complexity resource allocation method is developed to maximize the sum rate under user fairness concern. Simulation results confirm that the proposed tracking solution can evaluate the propagation angle, vehicle’s states and inter-vehicle distance accurately, and the tailored resource allocation method strikes a delicate balance between the sum rate and user fairness in the multi-vehicle V2I scenario.}

In it, multiple base stations (BSs) transmit to the URLLC user by pre-empting time-frequency resources assigned to enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) users. We derive insightful expressions for achievability, which is the probability that the URLLC user’s block error rate (BLER) requirement is met by multi-connectivity. We do so for both joint transmission (JT) and orthogonal transmission (OT) modes of URLLC for the general case in which the transmissions occur over frequency-selective channels. We then propose a low-complexity algorithm to jointly select the set of cooperating BSs and their modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) to minimize the eMBB throughput loss. For time-varying channels with feedback delays, we present an alternate stochastic reliability requirement for URLLC traffic. The MCS selected on the basis of this requirement has a markedly higher probability of meeting the BLER target over the grid of URLLC user locations. Our results highlight the different trade-offs between URLLC achievability, eMBB throughput loss, and channel state information feedback overhead of OT and JT. They bring out the significant impact of feedback delays even at moderate Doppler spreads.}

	abstract = {We investigate sensing-assisted beamforming for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication by exploiting integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) functionalities at the roadside unit (RSU). The RSU deploys a massive multi-input-multi-output (mMIMO) array at mmWave. The pencil-sharp mMIMO beams and fine range-resolution implicate that the point-target assumption is impractical, as the vehicle’s geometry becomes essential. Therefore, the communication receiver (CR) may never lie in the beam, even when the vehicle is accurately tracked. To tackle this problem, we consider the extended target with two novel schemes. For the first scheme, the beamwidth is adjusted in real-time to cover the entire vehicle, followed by an extended Kalman filter to predict and track the position of CR according to resolved scatterers. An upgraded scheme is proposed by splitting each transmission block into two stages. The first stage is exploited for ISAC with a wide beam. Based on the sensed results at the first stage, the second stage is dedicated to communication with a pencil-sharp beam, yielding significant communication improvements. We reveal the inherent tradeoff between the two stages in terms of their durations, and develop an optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the average achievable rate. Finally, simulations verify the superiorities of proposed schemes over state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {The surge of massive antenna arrays in wireless networks calls for the adoption of analog/hybrid array solutions, where multiple antenna elements are driven by a common radio front end to form a beam along a specific angle in order to maximize the beamforming gain. Many heuristics have been proposed to sample the angular domain by trading off between sampling step size and overhead, where arbitrarily small angular step size is only attainable with infinite sampling overhead. We show that, for uniform linear and rectangular arrays, lossless reconstruction of the array’s angular responses at arbitrary angular precision is possible using a finite number of samples without resorting to assumptions of angular sparsity. The proposed method, (SARA), defines how many and which angles to be sampled and the corresponding reconstruction. This general solution to scan the angular domain can therefore be applied not only to beam acquisition and channel estimation, but also to radio imaging techniques, making it a candidate for future integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Extensive simulation results for target detection and radio imaging have demonstrated clear advantages of SARA over other considered baselines, both in terms of angular reconstruction performance and computational complexity.}

Experimental observations on free-space and tree Path Loss Model (PLM) based sensor node deployment strategies in a cropping period have shown network disconnectivity due to incorrect assessment of excess attenuation caused by dynamically varying vegetation height and density during the monitoring period. To address the challenge, an empirically formulated PLM is proposed to estimate the excess attenuation at different crop development stages of medium grass vegetation. Further, using the formulated PLM, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) multi-objective optimization is performed to generate initial node deployment with a heterogeneous transmission range. To address the issue of over-coverage, transmitter output power scheduling is performed with predefined upper limit derived from the NSGA-III optimization. The output power is dynamically scheduled during the monitoring period based on changes in the captured RSS to minimize over-coverage. Improvements in coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency compared to existing approaches are validated through Proof of Concept.}

With the aid of theoretical analysis, the average energy harvesting performance as well as the achievable data rate between the transmitter and the receiver are both derived in the semi-closed form. Further, a population-based optimizer is conceived to obtain the power allocation of WDT and WET signals, in order to maximize the energy harvesting performance by satisfying the constraints of the achievable data rate.

In this work, in the presence of extended target and clutters, a HBF design based on the subarray connection architecture is proposed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) DFRC system. In this HBF, the double-phase-shifter (DPS) structure is embedded to further increase the design flexibility. We derive the communication spectral efficiency (SE) and radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) with respect to the transmit HBF and radar receiver, and formulate the HBF design problem as the SE maximization subjecting to the radar SINR and power constraints. To solve the formulated nonconvex problem, the joinT Hybrid bEamforming and Radar rEceiver OptimizatioN (THEREON) is proposed, in which the radar receiver is optimized via the generalized eigenvalue decomposition, and the transmit HBF is updated with low complexity in a parallel manner using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (consensus-ADMM). Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to the multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and show that the solution provides a good trade-off between number of phase shifters and performance gain of the DPS HBF.}

Specially, the outage probability of the typical user is derived by taking void cell and composite fading into account. The locations of remote radio heads and users working on the same resource block are modeled as the Poisson point process (PPP) and Mat \\acute {e}\nrn hard-core point process of type II (MHCPP), respectively. Due to intractability of MHCPP, the PPP-based approximation is adopted. Then the closed expression of Laplace transform of the probability density function of the interfering power under composite fading channels is derived by Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Based on the approximated PPP, we obtain the outage probability of the typical user with user-centric clustering in the presence of void cell. Finally, the outage probability with or without considering void cell is verified and analyzed under different system parameters (i.g., the density of nodes, the radius of cluster, and the threshold of signal quality) and channel fading conditions (i.g., the pathloss exponent, shadowing standard deviation) through extensive simulations. Simulation results show that the effect of void cell on the system performance should be considered, especially when the density of nodes or the size of cluster is limited.}

In this work, we introduce a novel approach for channel estimation using deep score-based generative models. A model is trained to estimate the gradient of the logarithm of a distribution and is used to iteratively refine estimates given measurements of a signal. We introduce a framework for training score-based generative models for wireless MIMO channels and performing channel estimation based on posterior sampling at test time. We derive theoretical robustness guarantees for channel estimation with posterior sampling in single-input single-output scenarios, and experimentally verify performance in the MIMO setting. Our results in simulated channels show competitive in-distribution performance, and robust out-of-distribution performance, with gains of up to 5 dB in end-to-end coded communication performance compared to supervised deep learning methods. Simulations on the number of pilots show that high fidelity channel estimation with 25% pilot density is possible for MIMO channel sizes of up to\n64×256\n. Complexity analysis reveals that model size can efficiently trade performance for estimation latency, and that the proposed approach is competitive with compressed sensing in terms of floating-point operation (FLOP) count.}

Considering two different transmission regimes, namely infinite blocklength (IBL), and finite blocklength (FBL), we analyze the performance of the considered network under the effect of imperfections in channel state information (CSI) estimation and successive interference cancellation (SIC) with the probabilistic line of sight fading channels. For IBL transmission, we derive the closed-form expressions of the outage probability, throughput, and achievable ergodic rate at each GU. Furthermore, for short packet communication, the closed-form expressions of block error rate (BLER), goodput, and achievable ergodic rate are determined with FBL transmission. Moreover, for the FBL regime we also formulate an optimization problem that jointly optimizes the 3D-position of the UAV, power allocated to each user, and common rate distribution at each user to maximize the ergodic sum rate subject to the practical constraints such as maximum tolerable BLER, minimum private and total rate at each user. We then propose an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm to solve the problem. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to verify the accuracy of derived analytical results and demonstrate the trade-off between transmit power and achievable BLER. In addition to this, the effectiveness of RSMA in UAV-assisted communication under IBL and FBL transmission regimes is also observed compared to non-orthogonal multiple access.}

	abstract = {This paper considers trajectory planning for a mobile robot which persistently relays data between pairs of far-away communication nodes. Data accumulates stochastically at each source, and the robot must move to appropriate positions to enable data offload to the corresponding destination. The robot needs to minimize the average time that data waits at a source before being serviced. We are interested in finding optimal robotic routing policies consisting of 1) locations where the robot stops to relay (relay positions) and 2) conditional transition probabilities that determine the sequence in which the pairs are serviced. We first pose this problem as a non-convex problem that optimizes over both relay positions and transition probabilities. To find approximate solutions, we propose a novel algorithm which alternately optimizes relay positions and transition probabilities. For the former, we find efficient convex partitions of the non-convex relay regions, then formulate a mixed-integer second-order cone problem. For the latter, we find optimal transition probabilities via sequential least squares programming. We extensively analyze the proposed approach and mathematically characterize important system properties related to the robot’s long-term energy consumption and service rate. Finally, through extensive simulation with real channel parameters, we verify the efficacy of our approach.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a composite multiple-mode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (C-MM-OFDM-IM) scheme to increase the spectral efficiency (SE) of OFDM-IM systems by extending the indexing to the energy and constellation domains. In C-MM-OFDM-IM, the information bits are mapped to not only the subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) and modulation symbols, but also the energy allocation patterns (EAPs) and constellation activation patterns (CAPs). To cope with the practical situations, we propose a variant IM scheme named C-MM-OFDM-IM-II to build a new mapping rule between information bits and the increased CAPs, capable of further increasing the SE of C-MM-OFDM-IM. Upper-bounded bit error rate (BER) and lower-bounded achievable rate are both derived in closed-form to evaluate the performance of C-MM-OFDM-IM(-II). Moreover, we further propose two enhanced schemes, named generalized C-MM-OFDM-IM(-II) and C-MM-OFDM with in-phase/quadrature IM(-II), where the former jointly considers all SAPs, EAPs, CAPs and modulated symbols, while the latter expands the index implementation to the in-phase and quadrature constellation domains. Simulation results show that C-MM-OFDM-IM(-II) outperforms the conventional OFDM-IM related schemes, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, and verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis for the upper-bounded BER and achievable rate.}

	abstract = {Solving the optimal symbol detection problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is known to be NP-hard. Hence, the objective of any detector of practical relevance is to get reasonably close to the optimal solution while keeping the computational complexity in check. In this work, we propose a MIMO detector based on an annealed version of Langevin (stochastic) dynamics. More precisely, we define a stochastic dynamical process whose stationary distribution coincides with the posterior distribution of the symbols given our observations. In essence, this allows us to approximate the maximum a posteriori estimator of the transmitted symbols by sampling from the proposed Langevin dynamic. Furthermore, we carefully craft this stochastic dynamic by gradually adding a sequence of noise with decreasing variance to the trajectories, which ensures that the estimated symbols belong to a pre-specified discrete constellation. Based on the proposed MIMO detector, we also design a robust version of the method by unfolding and parameterizing one term– the score of the likelihood– by a neural network. Through numerical experiments in both synthetic and real-world data, we show that our proposed detector yields state-of-the-art symbol error rate performance and the robust version becomes noise-variance agnostic.}

	abstract = {Pre-distortion is a key technique to compensate for the nonlinear distortions caused by the transmitter in wireless communication systems. Generally, pre-distortion can be classified into digital pre-distortion (DPD) and analog pre-distortion (APD), which focus on optimizing and assessing the nonlinearity in their own areas. In this paper, we propose a new DPD approach to optimize the performance metric of the analog RF-domain (i.e., inter-modulation distortion (IMD) or adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)) and that of the digital IF-domain (i.e., mean square error (MSE)) simultaneously. To make the joint design feasible, we derive a new hybrid performance metric, where the analog preferred metric is defined in the form of digital signals to bridge the gap between digital and analog signal processing. On top of that, an effective DPD scheme is developed based on a new dual time-delayed neural network (TDNN) learning architecture. The coefficients of the TDNN for power amplifier (PA) modeling can be trained offline with a PA dataset, while those of the TDNN for pre-distortion are obtained adaptively by optimizing the proposed joint design metric. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is able to significantly improve the IMD/ACPR performance without compromising the MSE, compared to conventional DPD schemes.}

	abstract = {The integration of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has attracted academic and industrial interest as a promising enabling approach due to their massive bandwidth support and greater spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider NOMA heterogeneous network (HetNet) in mmWave communications, consisting of the macro-cell and small cell tiers connected through the wireless backhaul. Following this, we propose a user grouping algorithm to significantly simplify the user clustering process where each cluster consists of highly correlated users to suppress the inter-cluster interference. We then propose a hybrid analog/digital precoding scheme at the macro base station. The goal is to maximize the system’s total energy-efficiency (EE) in NOMA HetNet by jointly optimizing the transmission of hybrid precoding, power allocation, and bandwidth partition. Next, we formulate an optimization problem within the proposed framework under the minimum data rate and total maximum transmission power constraints. Due to the non-convexity nature of the formulated problem, it is challenging to obtain the optimal solution. As a result, we transform the original problem into a quasi-convex equivalent by analyzing its structure. Then we propose energy-efficient distributed power allocation algorithms to optimize the resource allocation of macro-cell and small cells. Finally, we exhibit the simulation results to demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s performance gains. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithmic approach surpasses state-of-the-art and traditional mmWave orthogonal multiple access systems in both capacity and EE.}

	abstract = {Existing works on grant-free access, proposed to support massive machine-type communication (mMTC) for the Internet of Things (IoT), mainly concentrate on narrow band systems under flat fading. In contrast, this paper investigates massive grant-free access in a wideband system under frequency-selective fading. First, we present an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive grant-free access scheme. Then, we propose two different but equivalent models for the received pilot signal. Specifically, one directly models the received signal for actual devices, whereas the other can be interpreted as a signal model for virtual devices. The two signal models are insightful and essential for designing various device activity detection and channel estimation methods for OFDM-based massive grant-free access. Next, we systematically investigate statistical device activity detection under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading based on the two signal models. In particular, in the case without prior knowledge of device activities, we model device activities as deterministic but unknown binary constants and propose three maximum likelihood (ML) estimation-based device activity detection methods with different detection accuracies and computation times. In the case with prior knowledge of device activities, we model device activities as realizations of Bernoulli random variables with a known joint distribution, which appropriately incorporates the prior knowledge, and propose three maximum a posterior probability (MAP) estimation-based device activity methods, which further enhance the accuracies of the corresponding ML estimation-based methods at the cost of increased computational complexities. The proposed methods can meet diverse practical needs for OFDM-based massive grant-free access.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technique to enhance the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. While FL has been extensively studied, the communication and networking challenges related to the operations of FL in dynamic yet dense vehicular networks remain under-explored. Limited storage and communication capacities of individual vehicles throttle the timely training of an FL model in distributed vehicular networks. In this paper, we present a communication framework for FL (CF4FL) in transportation systems. CF4FL aims to accelerate the convergence of FL training process through the innovation of two complementary networking components: (i) a deadline-driven vehicle scheduler (DDVS), and (ii) a concurrent vehicle polling scheme (CVPS). DDVS identifies a subset of vehicles for local model training in each iteration of FL, with the aim of minimizing data loss while respecting the deadline constraints derived from vehicles’ storage, computation, and energy budgets. CVPS takes advantage of multiple antennas on an edge server to enable concurrent local model transmissions in dynamic vehicular networks, thereby reducing the airtime overhead of each FL iteration. We have evaluated CF4FL through a blend of experimentation and simulation. Trace-driven simulation shows that, compared to existing scheduling and transmission schemes, CF4FL reduces the convergence time of FL training by 39%.}

	abstract = {We consider the scenario of inference at the wireless edge, in which devices are connected to an edge server and ask the server to carry out remote classification, that is, classify data samples available at edge devices. This requires the edge devices to upload high-dimensional features of samples over resource-constrained wireless channels, which creates a communication bottleneck. The conventional feature pruning solution would require the device to have access to the inference model, which is not available in the current split inference scenario. To address this issue, we propose the progressive feature transmission (ProgressFTX) protocol, which minimizes the overhead by progressively transmitting features until a target confidence level is reached. A control policy is proposed to accelerate inference, comprising two key operations: importance-aware feature selection at the server and transmission-termination control. For the former, it is shown that selecting the most important features, characterized by the largest discriminant gains of the corresponding feature dimensions, achieves a sub-optimal performance. For the latter, the proposed policy is shown to exhibit a threshold structure. Specifically, the transmission is stopped when the incremental uncertainty reduction by further feature transmission is outweighed by its communication cost. The indices of the selected features and transmission decision are fed back to the device in each slot. The control policy is first derived for the tractable case of linear classification, and then extended to the more complex case of classification using a convolutional neural network. Both Gaussian and fading channels are considered. Experimental results are obtained for both a statistical data model and a real dataset. It is shown that ProgressFTX can substantially reduce the communication latency compared to conventional feature pruning and random feature transmission strategies.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of data and wireless devices, federated learning (FL) over wireless medium has emerged as a promising technology for large-scale distributed intelligent systems. Yet, the urgent demand for ubiquitous intelligence will generate a large number of concurrent FL tasks, which may seriously aggravate the scarcity of communication resources. By exploiting the analog superposition of electromagnetic waves, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is an appealing solution to alleviate the burden of communication required by FL. However, sharing frequency-time resources in over-the-air computation inevitably brings about the problem of inter-task interference, which poses a new challenge that needs to be appropriately addressed. In this paper, we study over-the-air federated multi-task learning (OA-FMTL) over the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access (MAC) channel. We propose a novel model aggregation method for the alignment of local gradients of different devices, which alleviates the straggler problem in over-the-air computation due to the channel heterogeneity. We establish a communication-learning analysis framework for the proposed OA-FMTL scheme by considering the spatial correlation between devices, and formulate an optimization problem for the design of transceiver beamforming and device selection. To solve this problem, we develop an algorithm by using alternating optimization (AO) and fractional programming (FP), which effectively mitigates the impact of inter-task interference on the FL learning performance. We show that due to the use of the new model aggregation method, device selection is no longer essential, thereby avoiding the heavy computational burden involved in selecting active devices. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the analysis and the superb performance of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Constant envelope orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CE-OFDM) is a multi-carrier waveform with 0 dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This property enables the exploitation of multi-carrier waveforms with non-linear power amplifiers, avoiding the undesirable clipping effects. However, the existing channel estimation techniques designed for OFDM cannot be reused, since the use of a phase modulator makes CE-OFDM a non-linear waveform. Previous works assumed that the channel estimation process relies on the transmission of preambles, and the data symbols are equalized using a frequency domain equalizer (FDE). To avoid the overhead induced by preambles, a phase-domain injected training (PIT) is proposed, where the pilot sequence is embedded in the phase dimension of the data symbols. This novel approach does not waste time and/or frequency resources as in preamble-based schemes. Moreover, it does not require additional power for the training. The received symbols are averaged with a dual procedure, and owing to the particular structure of CE-OFDM, the channel estimates are recovered. Also, the analytical expression of the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Finally, several numerical results illustrate the performance of the proposal, showing that the MSE, bit error rate (BER) and achievable rate are improved, as compared to the existing works.}

	abstract = {We consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisting data collection from multiple sensor nodes (SNs). We provide a completion time minimization design via jointly deciding the UAV trajectory and the SN assignment scheme. In particular, we first characterize the fundamental features of the joint optimal solution to the formulated problem. On the one hand, the optimal UAV trajectory is proved following a successive-hover-fly (SHF) structure. Namely, in an optimal solution, the UAV successively visits multiple hovering points and performs hovering with designated duration, while the maximum speed is achieved during the whole flying period between each two hovering points. On the other hand, the optimal SN assignment is characterized to follow a segment-based scheme. Based on the two characterizations, we are motivated to implement SHF structure with turning points in trajectory design and reasonably assume each segment in SHF structure having constant SN assignment. Afterwards, we relax the binary constraints for SN assignments and establish a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, which enables an iterative algorithm. A suboptimal joint solution is obtained via iteratively optimizing the completion time. A realization strategy is also provided for the relaxed solution while assuring the completion of data collection tasks. Finally, the proposed solution is validated and evaluated through numerical results. Both a low complexity and an accurate task completion guarantee of our proposed solution are observed in comparison with the benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) plays an important role in boosting the data rate for 6G networks. Because of the huge bandwidth and the large number of antennas, wideband XL-MIMO introduces a significant near-field beam split effect, where beams at different frequencies are focused on different locations. This effect results in a severe array gain loss, and existing works mainly consider to compensate for this loss by utilizing time-delay (TD) beamforming. This paper demonstrates that despite degrading the array gain, the near-field beam split effect can also contribute to the fast near-field beam training. Specifically, we first reveal the controllable near-field beam split effect. This effect indicates that TD beamforming can control the degree of the near-field beam split effect, i.e., beams at different frequencies can flexibly occupy the desired location range. Due to the similarity with the dispersion of natural light caused by a prism, we also call this effect as “near-field rainbow”. Then, by taking advantage of the near-field rainbow, a fast wideband beam training scheme is proposed to generate beams focusing on multiple locations at multiple frequencies with the help of TD beamforming. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to realize efficient near-field beam training with low training overheads.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been developed as a promising approach to enhance the performance of fifth-generation (5G) systems through intelligently reconfiguring the reflection elements. However, RIS-assisted beamforming design highly depends on the channel state information (CSI) and RIS’s location, which could have a significant impact on system performance. In this paper, the robust beamforming design is investigated for a RIS-assisted multiuser millimeter wave system with imperfect CSI, where the weighted sum-rate maximization problem (WSM) is formulated to jointly optimize transmit beamforming of the BS, RIS placement and reflect beamforming of the RIS. The considered WSM maximization problem includes CSI error, phase shifts matrices, transmit beamforming as well as RIS placement variables, which results in a complicated nonconvex problem. To handle this problem, the original problem is divided into a series of subproblems, where the location of RIS, transmit/reflect beamforming and CSI error are optimized iteratively. Then, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is introduced to gradient projection-based alternating optimization, which can alleviate the performance loss caused by the effect of imperfect CSI.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) can significantly improve the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless communication links. However, most works assume perfect transceivers and IRS, which is impractical in real communication systems. In this work, we study the effect of the hardware impairments in IRS-assisted MISO systems with single user, where we consider both phase noise caused by the imperfect transceivers and IRS. To this end, we propose a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation algorithm that takes the phase noise into account. Furthermore, we study the impact of phase noise on the downlink performance of an IRS-assisted system. Both analytical and numerical results are presented, where we prove that the transceiver phase noise can be compensated with the optimized IRS, while the IRS phase noise remains but is not exacerbated. As the number of reflective elements\nN\napproaches infinity, the IRS phase noise results in a constant loss in terms of the ergodic rate. Moreover, we find that the phase noise has no impact on the scaling laws. If the direct channel is blocked and as\nN→∞\n, the transmit power can be scaled down by\n1\nN\nand\n1\nN\n2\n, respectively, for random and optimized IRS, without compromising the received signal to noise ratio (SNR).}

Such batteryless tags are powered and controlled by a software-defined radio reader, with properly modified software, so that a source-destination link is assisted, operating at a different band. Signal model includes small-scale and large-scale fading, direct link, as well as specific parameters relevant to reflection (i.e., backscatter) radio, such as antenna structural mode and reflection efficiency, typically overlooked in the literature. An algorithm is offered that computes the optimal RIS configuration with complexity of\nO(MlogM)\nin number of elements\nM\n, instead of intractable exponential complexity of exhaustive search, while accommodating any number\nK≥2\nof loads. With the proposed algorithm, it is shown that performance gains reach a plateau for constant element spacing and increasing number of elements, suggesting that the weak, passive nature of backscattered links limits the performance gains, even with perfect channel estimation. Channel estimation with linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator is shown to be effective, provided that there are sufficient number of pilot symbols. A concrete way is offered to design and prototype a wireless, batteryless, RF-powered, reconfigurable surface and a proof-of-concept is experimentally demonstrated.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the design of a burst jamming detection method for delay-sensitive Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. In order to obtain a timely detection of burst jamming, we propose an online principal direction anomaly detection (OPDAD) method. We consider the one-ring scatter channel model, where the base station equipped with a large number of antennas is elevated at a high altitude. In this case, since the angular spread of the legitimate IoT transmitter or the jammer is restricted within a narrow region, there is a distinct difference of the principal direction of the signal space between the jamming attack and the normal state. Most of existing binary hypothesis test based works cannot apply to detect burst jamming, because the attackers’ target time window does not match with the legitimate transmission. Unlike existing statistical features based batching methods, the proposed OPDAD method adopts an online iterative processing mode, which can quickly detect the exact attack time block instance by analyzing the newly coming signal. In addition, our detection method does not rely on the prior knowledge of the attacker, because it only cares the abrupt change in the principal direction of the signal space. Moreover, based on the high spatial resolution and the narrow angular spread, we provide the convergence rate estimate and derive a nearly optimal finite sample error bound for the proposed OPDAD method. Numerical results show the excellent real time capability and detection performance of our proposed method.}

Contrary to existing CI precoding approaches which have to be designed on a symbol-by-symbol level, here a constant precoding matrix is applied to a collection of symbols within a given transmission block, thus significantly reducing the computational costs over traditional CI-based symbol-level precoding (CI-SLP) as the CI-BLP optimization problem only needs to be solved once per block. For both PSK and QAM modulation, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum CI effect over the block subject to a block- rather than symbol-level power budget. We mathematically derive the optimal precoding matrix for CI-BLP as a function of the Lagrange multipliers in closed form. By formulating the dual problem, the original CI-BLP optimization problem is further shown to be equivalent to a quadratic programming (QP) optimization. Numerical results validate our derivations, and show that the proposed CI-BLP scheme achieves improved performance over the traditional CI-SLP method, thanks to the relaxed power constraint over the considered block of symbol slots.}

	abstract = {Efficient scheduling of transmissions is a key problem in wireless networks. The main challenge stems from the fact that optimal link scheduling involves solving a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which is known to be NP-hard. In practical schedulers, centralized and distributed greedy heuristics are commonly used to approximately solve the MWIS problem. However, most of these greedy heuristics ignore important topological information of the wireless network. To overcome this limitation, we propose fast heuristics based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that can be implemented in centralized and distributed manners. Our centralized heuristic is based on tree search guided by a GCN and 1-step rollout. In our distributed MWIS solver, a GCN generates topology-aware node embeddings that are combined with per-link utilities before invoking a distributed greedy solver. Moreover, a novel reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train the GCN in a non-differentiable pipeline. Test results on medium-sized wireless networks show that our centralized heuristic can reach a near-optimal solution quickly, and our distributed heuristic based on a shallow GCN can reduce by nearly half the suboptimality gap of the distributed greedy solver with minimal increase in complexity. The proposed schedulers also exhibit good generalizability across graph and weight distributions.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has become a promising technique for developing intelligent wireless networks. In traditional FL paradigms, local models are usually required to be homogeneous for aggregation. However, due to heterogeneous models coming with wireless sysTem heterogeneity, it is preferable for user equipments (UEs) to undertake appropriate amount of computing and/or data transmission work based on sysTem constraints. Meanwhile, considerable communication costs are incurred by model training, when a large number of UEs participate in FL and/or the transmitted models are large. Therefore, resource-efficient training schemes for heterogeneous models are essential for enabling FL-based intelligent wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quantization scheme based on ensemble distillation (AQeD), to facilitate heterogeneous model training. We first partition and group the participating UEs into clusters, where the local models in specific clusters are homogeneous with different quantization levels. Then we propose an augmented loss function by jointly considering ensemble distillation loss, quantization levels and wireless resources constraints. In AQeD, model aggregations are performed at two levels: model aggregation for individual clusters and distillation loss aggregation for cluster ensembles. Numerical results show that the AQeD scheme can significantly reduce communication costs and training time in comparison with some state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems have been widely applied in practice since OFDM has diverse outstanding advantages. However, their performance improvement is confronted with bottlenecks. In this paper, in order to tackle this issue, intelligent resource allocation driven by reinforcement learning is studied in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enhanced OFDM systems. The system sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the subcarrier allocation, the transmit beamforming of the base station and the phase shift of the IRS. An intelligent resource allocation scheme based on combining deep Q networks (DQN) and deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG) is proposed to tackle the formulated challenging non-convex problems. In order to further improve the spectrum efficiency, spectrum sharing is considered in the IRS-enhanced OFDM system. The secondary users sum rate maximization framework is formulated by jointly optimizing the channel allocation, the transmit beamforming of the secondary base station (SBS) and the phase shift of the IRS. Dueling double deep Q networks (D3QN) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) are exploited to tackle the hybrid action space issue under interference. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes can significantly improve the transmission rate compared to the benchmark schemes.}

Due to high demands, energy efficiency concerns, and scarcity of available resources, it is pivotal how these resources are used. Installed antennas and their corresponding hardware at the Base Station (BS) are of these resources. In this paper, we address the problem of antenna selection to minimize Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of a planar antenna array when fewer antennas than total available antennas have to be used for a UT. First, the optimal antenna selection strategy to minimize the expected CRLB is proposed. Then, using this strategy as a preliminary step, we present a two-stage greedy antenna selection method whose goal is to minimize the instantaneous CRLB. The optimal start point of the greedy algorithm is presented alongside some methods to reduce the algorithm’s computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of proposed solutions. They demonstrate that the proposed antenna selection method only requires a small proportion of the total available antennas to accomplish a significant amount of the total performance, enhancing hardware utilization efficiency. Also, it is shown that the presented algorithm has a high error tolerance.}

Against this backdrop, we analyze the performance of the UAV-enabled heterogeneous networks, where antenna downtilt at each UAV-mounted base station (BS) is employed to mitigate inter-cell interference, and the tethered UAV (TUAV)-mounted BS is deployed to provide backhaul connectivity for multiple spatially randomly distributed untethered UAV-mounted BSs, while they are cooperatively serving the terrestrial users. Through leveraging stochastic geometry, the user association probability and conditional distance distributions of serving links are derived. Then, the compact expressions of coverage probability and ergodic rate of the UAV-enabled heterogeneous networks are derived, and the impacts of antenna downtilt and backhaul connectivity are investigated. Numerical results validate our analysis and show the effectiveness of antenna downtilt and the TUAV-enabled backhaul connectivity. Moreover, we find that a larger antenna downtilt angle is required for a higher deployment altitude. We show that the optimal size of the network area that maximizes the average coverage probability reduces, when the backhaul connectivity is considered. We also demonstrate that the average network performance can be significantly improved by judiciously selecting the number of untethered UAVs, which is closely related to the size of the network area. Finally, the advantage of the proposed UAV-enabled heterogeneous network on the average ergodic rate has been validated by comparing it with two benchmarks under the 3GPP channel model.}

We first introduce the concept of triple beams (TBs) in the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain and establish a TB based channel model using sampled triple steering vectors. With the established channel model, we then investigate the optimal channel estimation and pilot design for pilot segments. Specifically, we find the conditions that allow pilot reuse among multiple user terminals (UTs), which significantly reduces pilot overhead and increases the number of UTs that can be served. Moreover, we propose a channel prediction method for data segments based on the estimated TB domain channel. To reduce the complexity, we formulate the channel estimation as a statistical inference problem and then obtain the channel by the proposed constrained Bethe free energy minimization (CBFEM) based channel estimation algorithm, which can be implemented with low complexity by exploiting the structure of the TB matrix together with the chirp z-transform (CZT). Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed channel acquisition approach.}

	abstract = {Due to the advantage of achieving scalable connectivity and low-latency communications, air-ground integrated mesh networks (AGIMNs) will play an important role in the next generation wireless communication systems. However, due to the heterogeneous character of AGIMNs, it is challenging to manage the network and optimize the communication resources for improving the end-to-end (E2E) performance. Therefore, in this paper, we study a joint routing and time-frequency resource scheduling problem aiming at minimizing the total weighted E2E delay for heterogeneous AGIMNs. To capture the features of this complex system, we mathematically model the network constraints and formulate an optimization problem. To solve the original nonconvex problem, a suboptimal solution is proposed. First, we propose an optimal minimum-weight routing method, in which the hop count, conflict delay, and contention delay are taken into consideration. Then, we transform the time-frequency resource scheduling subproblem into a series of tractable problems for maximizing the number of active links through channel assignment in successive time slots. Finally, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is utilized to solve the channel assignment problem per time slot. Extensive simulation results show the performance superiority of the proposed solution compared to the benchmarks in terms of the total E2E delay.}

However, due to double path loss, existing fully passive RIS systems that purely reflect the incident signals into preferred directions attain an unsatisfactory performance improvement over the traditional wireless networks in certain conditions. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel transmission scheme, named hybrid reflection modulation (HRM), exploiting both active and passive reflecting elements at the RIS and their combinations, which enables to convey information without using any radio frequency (RF) chains. In the HRM scheme, the active reflecting elements using additional power amplifiers are able to amplify and reflect the incoming signal, while the remaining passive elements can simply reflect the signals with appropriate phase shifts. Based on this novel transmission model, we obtain an upper bound for the average bit error probability (ABEP), and derive achievable rate of the system using an information theoretic approach. Moreover, comprehensive computer simulations are performed to prove the superiority of the proposed HRM scheme over existing fully passive, fully active and reflection modulation (RM) systems.}

	abstract = {We consider a cell-free wireless system operated in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode with user-centric clusters of remote radio units (RUs). Since the uplink pilot dimensions per channel coherence slot is limited, co-pilot users might incur mutual pilot contamination. In the current literature, it is assumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user channels is available. This enables Minimum Mean-Square Error channel estimation or simplified dominant subspace projection, which achieves significant pilot decontamination under certain assumptions on the channel covariance matrices. However, estimating the channel covariance matrix or even just its dominant subspace at all RUs forming a user cluster is not an easy task. In fact, if not properly designed, a piloting scheme for such long-term statistics estimation will also be subject to the contamination problem. In this paper, we propose a new channel subspace estimation scheme explicitly designed for cell-free wireless networks. Our scheme is based on 1) a sounding reference signal (SRS) using latin squares wideband frequency hopping, and 2) a subspace estimation method based on robust Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA). The SRS hopping scheme ensures that for any user and any RU participating in its cluster, only a few pilot measurements will contain strong co-pilot interference. These few heavily contaminated measurements are (implicitly) eliminated by R-PCA, which is designed to regularize the estimation and discount the “outlier” measurements. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves almost perfect subspace knowledge, which in turns yields system performance very close to that with ideal channel state information, thus essentially solving the problem of pilot contamination in cell-free user-centric TDD wireless networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we establish an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on a distributed semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), which allows location sensing and data transmission to be conducted on the same time-frequency resources. The detailed working process of the proposed IRS-based ISAC system is designed, including the transmission protocol, location sensing and beamforming optimization. Specifically, each coherence block consists of the channel estimation period, the ISAC period with two time blocks, and the pure communication (PC) period. During the channel estimation period, the low-dimensional effective user-BS channel is estimated. During each time block of the ISAC period, data transmission and user positioning are carried out simultaneously. The estimated user location in the first time block will be used for beamforming design in the second time block. During the PC period, only data transmission is conducted, by invoking the user location estimated in the second time block of the ISAC period for beamforming design. Simulation results show that a millimeter-level positioning accuracy can be achieved by the proposed location sensing scheme. Besides, the proposed two beamforming schemes based on the estimated location achieve similar performance to the benchmark schemes assuming perfect channel state information, verifying the effectiveness of beamforming design using sensed location information.}

	abstract = {Two of the main problems to achieve ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) are related to instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI) acquisition and the coexistence with other service modes such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB). The former comes from the non-negligible time required for accurate I-CSI acquisition, while the latter, from the heterogeneous and conflicting requirements of different nodes sharing the same network resources. In this paper, we leverage the I-CSI of multiple eMBB links and the channel measurement’s history of a URLLC user for multi-antenna beamforming design. Specifically, we propose a precoding design that minimizes the transmit power of a base station (BS) providing eMBB and URLLC services with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and outage constraints, respectively, by modifying existing I-CSI-based precoding schemes to account for URLLC channel history information. Moreover, we illustrate and validate the proposed method by adopting zero-forcing (ZF) and the transmit power minimization (TPM) precoding with SINR constraints. We show that the ZF implementation outperforms TPM in adverse channel conditions as in Rayleigh fading, while the situation is rapidly reversed as the channel experiences some line-of-sight (LOS). Finally, we determine the confidence levels at which the target outage probabilities are reached. For instance, we show that outage probabilities below 10-3 are achievable with more than 99% confidence for both precoding schemes under favorable LOS conditions with 16 transmit antennas and 500 samples of URLLC channel history.}

	abstract = {Cooperative localization is a promising technique in wireless networks, and neighbor selection (NS) is essential to limit the degree of cooperation and reduce the amount of data to be exchanged. However, the existing NS algorithms may suffer from major performance loss when applied to networks with limited resources (e.g., bandwidth, time and energy). In this paper, we establish a general optimization framework for the NS problem to minimize the localization error under strict resource constraints. Based on the squared position error bound (SPEB) criterion, we formulate two distributed NS problems under implicit and explicit energy constraints, respectively, to balance the energy consumption of the network, where implicit energy constraints mean that specific energy profiles of the nodes’ neighbors are unavailable while explicit energy constraints mean the opposite. Moreover, we propose to jointly optimize the NS and power allocation in the explicit case to further improve the localization performance. The resulting problems are challenging to solve due to the nonlinear objective functions and discrete optimization variables. We first transform them into more tractable forms and then develop novel algorithms based on the penalty dual decomposition method to solve the transformed problems efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform benchmark algorithms. In particular, the proposed algorithm almost achieves the performance lower bound in the implicit case.}

	abstract = {Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) relies on multi-antenna rate splitting (RS) at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. In RS the users’ messages are split into a common message and private messages, where the common part is first decoded by the all users, while the private part is decoded only by the intended user using SIC technique. This split of the users ’ signals into common and private parts raises some interesting tradeoffs between maximizing sum rate versus secrecy rate. In this work we consider the secrecy performance of RSMA in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where secrecy is defined by the ability of any user to decode the signal intended for user\nk\nin the system. To that end, new analytical expressions for the ergodic sum-rate and ergodic secrecy rate are derived for two closed-form precoding techniques of the private messages, namely, 1) zero-forcing (ZF) precoding approach, 2) minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach. Then, based on the analytical expressions of the ergodic rates, novel power allocation strategies that maximize the sum-rate subject to a target secrecy rate for the two precoding schemes are presented and investigated. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a close match with our theoretical derivations. They also reveal that, by tuning the split of the messages, our power allocation approaches provide a scalable tradeoff between rate benefits and secrecy.}

To address this issue, we study the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HSR network, where one RIS is deployed nearby the onboard mobile relay (MR) to suppress the interference as well as jamming in HSR system. Aiming at enhancing the HSR network capacity against the interference, we formulate an optimization problem for designing the phase shifts at the RIS. Since the HSR environment is time-varying and complicated, the optimization problem is challenging to settle. Inspired by the recent advances of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based scheme to settle the problem through designing the action space, the state space as well as the reward function. Simulation results present that 1) deploying the RIS nearby the onboard MR is strongly facilitative of suppressing the interference; 2) the proposed DDPG scheme can achieve better capacity than the baseline schemes, and be gradually close to the upper boundary with the number of RIS elements increasing.}

It is shown that the number of spatial degrees of freedom (DOF) afforded by this setting grows in proportion with the IRS aperture, as opposed to being dictated by the transmit and receive apertures; this buttresses the interest in IRS deployments at mmWave and terahertz frequencies, with wavelengths and transmission ranges small enough to enable LOS MIMO. Explicit and simple-to-implement IRS phase shifts are put forth that achieve, not only the maximum number of DOF, but the capacity, under a certain geometrical condition. The insights leading to the proposed phase shifts, and to the optimality condition itself, are asymptotic in nature, yet extensive simulations confirm that the performance is excellent for a broad range of settings and even if the optimality condition is not strictly met.}

	abstract = {Due to the features of on-demand deployment and flexible observation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising for serving as the next-generation aerial sensors by using their onboard sensing devices. Compared to a single UAV with limited sensing coverage and communication capability, multi-UAV cooperation is able to realize more effective sensing and transmission (S&T) services, and delivers the sensory data to the control center more efficiently for further analysis. Nevertheless, most existing works on multi-UAV sensing mainly focus on mutually exclusive task allocation and independent data transmission, which did not fully exploit the benefit of multi-UAV sensing and communication. Motivated by this, we propose a novel multi-UAV cooperative S&T scheme with overlapped sensing task allocation. Although overlapped task allocation may sound counter-intuitive, it can actually foster cooperative transmission among multiple UAVs through a virtual multi-antenna system and thus reduce the overall sensing mission completion time. To obtain the optimal task allocation and transmit power of the proposed scheme, a mission completion time minimization problem is formulated. To solve this problem, a condition that specifies whether it is necessary for the UAVs to perform overlapped sensing is derived. For the cases of overlapped sensing, this time minimization problem is transformed into a monotonic optimization and is solved by the generic Polyblock algorithm. To efficiently evaluate the mission completion time in each iteration of the Polyblock algorithm, new auxiliary variables are introduced to decouple the otherwise sophisticated joint optimization of transmission time and power. While for the degenerated case of non-overlapped sensing, the closed-form expression of the optimal transmission time is derived, which provides insights into the optimal solution and facilitates the design of an efficient double-loop binary search algorithm to optimally solve the degenerated problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the mission completion time over benchmark schemes.}

We propose a beamforming framework that exploits multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the HetNet to maximize the system downlink sum-rate. In our framework, each AP acts as an agent, which is equipped with an online policy deep neural network (DNN) and an online Q-function DNN. The former generates an AP’s beamforming vector based only on local observations in a time slot, while the latter evaluates the appropriateness of this beamforming vector. We present a distributed-updating-centralized-rewarding scheme to train the policy DNNs and Q-function DNNs of all the APs in an online trial-and-error way. Under this scheme, all the APs take the system downlink sum-rate in a recent time slot (informed by a central controller) as their identical one-step reward. Trained by the experience items with centralized rewards in every time slot, the weight vectors of each AP’s local DNNs will be updated in the direction to the global optimum. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework converges fast and outperforms the benchmark beamforming methods in terms of the system downlink sum-rate performance.}

In the ML-TP, each prediction task forms a base-task, and a multi-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network is constructed as its base-learner. Through fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses of real-world network traffic data, we find that the five most dominating frequency components can capture the cell-level traffic variations, and hence can be used as a base-task’s meta-features. We prove that the well-trained weight vector of a previous base-task’s base-learner is likely to be a proper initial weight vector of a new base-task’s base-learner if the meta-features of the two base-tasks are close to each other in the Euclidean space. Accordingly, we propose a K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm based meta-learner to deal with the meta-task in the ML-TP. Numerical tests show that the ML-TP can significantly increase the base-learners’ after-training prediction accuracy and learning efficiency in terms of the number of base-samples and the number of epochs needed in each base-learner’s fine-tuning progress.}

In this paper, we study a D2D collaboration based MEC system, where the service platform purchases resources from resource-rich collaborative D2D devices when the task arrival rate exceeds the platform’s capability for providing satisfactory QoS. The design objective is to maximize the platform profit while maximally satisfying the delay requirements of tasks. We define delay based utility functions for different participants and accordingly formulate the platform profit maximization problem as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem. For the online case where future task arrivals are unknown in advance, we propose a reverse auction based task assignment and urgency-value based transmission scheduling algorithm (RAGM). We present the detailed algorithm design and deduce its computation complexity. We prove that RAGM satisfies individual rationality of all participants. We conduct extensive simulations and the results show the high performance of RAGM as compared with benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {By employing powerful edge servers for data processing, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been recognized as a promising technology to support emerging computation-intensive applications. Besides, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided MEC system can further enhance the spectral efficiency with massive tasks offloading. However, with more dynamic devices brought online and the uncontrollable stochastic channel environment, it is even desirable to deploy appealing technique, i.e., intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), in the MEC system to flexibly tune the communication environment and improve the system energy efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the joint offloading, communication and computation resource allocation for the IRS-assisted NOMA MEC system. We first formulate a mixed integer energy efficiency maximization problem with system queue stability constraint. We then propose the Lyapunov-function-based Mixed Integer Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LMIDDPG) algorithm which is based on the centralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To be specific, we design the mixed integer action space mapping which contains both continuous mapping and integer mapping. Moreover, the award function is defined as the upper-bound of the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function. To enable end devices (EDs) to choose actions independently at the execution stage, we further propose the Heterogeneous Multi-agent LMIDDPG (HMA-LMIDDPG) algorithm based on distributed RL framework with homogeneous EDs and heterogeneous base station (BS) as heterogeneous multi-agent. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms can achieve superior energy efficiency performance to the benchmark algorithms while maintaining the queue stability. Specially, the distributed structure HMA-LMIDDPG can acquire more energy efficiency gain than the centralized structure LMIDDPG.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a popular service paradigm by which mobile devices can offload their latency-sensitive and computation-intensive workloads to edge servers. The MEC service scheduling problem has been investigated in recent years. However, most MEC service scheduling mechanisms only consider workloads on homogeneous edge servers, causing servers’ queue backlogs to be too large when innumerable user requests arrive concurrently. In this paper, we are the first to propose a double-queue workloads scheduling model innovatively, and formulate a system (including user ends and edge server ends) utility into a scheduling optimization problem. To tackle such an NP scheduling problem, we present a Lyapunov-based decomposition strategy to convert the original problem into three equivalent subproblems. By aggregating three subproblem solving strategies, we propose the Lyapunov-based online matching algorithm for edge service scheduling, named LOMES, to obtain an optimal system utility while guaranteeing the load balancing of mobile devices and heterogeneous edge servers. Simulations further validate that LOMES realizes the load balancing of two queue lengths and a\n[O(1/V);O(V)]\ntradeoff between the system’s utility and workloads with a utility-workload tradeoff parameter\nV\n.}

Moreover, OAM wireless communications can achieve high spectral efficiency (SE) by utilizing a set of information-bearing modes on the same frequency channel. Benefitting from the above advantages, in this paper, we design a novel radar-centric joint OAM radar-communication (RadCom) scheme based on uniform circular arrays (UCAs), which modulates information signals on the existing OAM radar waveform. In details, we first propose an OAM-based three-dimensional (3-D) super-resolution position estimation and rotation velocity detection method, which can accurately estimate the 3-D position and rotation velocity of multiple targets without beam scanning. Then, we derive the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) of the OAM-based estimates and, finally, we analyze SE of the integrated system. To achieve the best trade-off between imaging and communication, the transmitted integrated OAM beams are optimized by means of an exhaustive search method. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed radar-centric joint OAM RadCom scheme can accurately estimate the 3-D position and rotation velocity of multiple targets while ensuring the SE of the communication receiver, which can be regarded as an effective supplement to existing joint RadCom schemes.}

	abstract = {In this work, a hybrid free-space optics (FSO)/ teraHertz (THz) based backhaul network is considered to provide high-data-rate reliable communication to the terrestrial mobile users (MUs) operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. The FSO link is affected by atmospheric turbulence and pointing error impairments. At the FSO receiver, both intensity-modulated direct detection and heterodyne detection techniques are considered. The multi-antenna THz link suffers from high path-loss, small-scale fading, and misalignment error. To minimize the effect of back-and-forth switching, soft switching method is introduced at the access point (AP) to select the signal coming through the hybrid FSO/THz link, and a comparison with hard switching method is presented. Selective decode-and-forward relaying is considered at the AP. In this context, we derive closed-form expressions of the individual link’s outage probability, end-to-end (E2E) outage probability, asymptotic outage probability, ergodic capacity, and generalized average bit-error-rate. Finally, we study the effect of different parameters such as atmospheric turbulence, pointing/misalignment errors, link distance, atmospheric attenuation/path-loss, fading parameters of the THz and access links, and number of antennas on the network performance. Our results indicate that, with a proper switching method, the joint implementation of FSO/THz links improves the rate/reliability of the backhaul links with limited switching overhead.}

	abstract = {Wireless multi-casting is an efficient transmission modality for downlink network control and content sharing. Conventional multi-casting amounts to finding an optimized beamforming vector under a specific performance metric and without the need of a dedicated treatment at the receiver. However, the so-called one-fit-all strategy is not directly applicable to mmWave systems equipped with 1-bit digital-to-analog converters (DAC), prompting us to develop a new multi-casting framework. The overarching design is built upon a vector-based instead of a scalar-based modulation, with which the multi-casting exhibits special features on both the transmitter and receiver. Specifically, we start by revealing the theoretical fundamentals for multi-casting under different 1-bit setups. Then, we design an iterative scheme to generate high-order constellations by establishing the equivalence between the codeword basis and low-order constellations. Finally, effective detection solutions are individually proposed for low-order and high-order constellations per their specific signal structures. Extensive analyses and simulations have been carried out to corroborate the decency of the proposed multi-casting strategy.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) system has emerged as a revolutionary technology to enhance the spectrum efficiency for future wireless networks. This work introduces two novel RIS systems, namely, RIS partition-assisted (RISP) PD-NOMA (RISP-PD-NOMA) and RISP-Quadrature-NOMA (RISP-Q-NOMA), to maximize the diversity order and to improve the signal quality of all users by dedicating fixed RIS units to each user. The closed-form expressions of average sum-rate, outage probability, and diversity order are evaluated for both systems under the Rician fading channel for perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) operations. Further, the performance of both RISP-PD-NOMA and RISP-Q-NOMA systems is compared with RIS partitioned PD-NOMA, RIS-assisted PD-NOMA, and PD-NOMA systems. It is noticed from the analysis that under perfect SIC, RISP-PD-NOMA outperforms all other systems. However, under imperfect SIC, RISP-Q-NOMA demonstrates superior performance to other systems due to the lesser number of SIC operations that reduce detection delay and decoding complexity. Furthermore, the analytical expression for bit error rate (BER) of RISP-PD-NOMA and RISP-Q-NOMA is derived, and then the closed-form expression of average-BER is evaluated. Numerical results demonstrate that RISP-Q-NOMA is superior to RISP-PD-NOMA.}

	abstract = {A novel analog beamforming technique that utilizes single radio frequency (single-RF) electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antennas is proposed. The ESPAR beamforming techniques are aimed at precoding in multiple antenna wireless communication systems using the single or hybrid RF approach. One advantage of ESPAR analog beamforming compared to conventional analog beamforming using phase shifters is that arbitrary patterns can be straightforwardly formed. Therefore, ESPAR analog beamforming can provide performance almost identical to digital beamforming. More importantly, ESPAR analog beamforming does not require phase shifters and power splitters, overcoming implementation challenges of conventional analog beamforming. It also has a more compact size compared to conventional beamforming using uniform antenna arrays. We analyze and optimize ESPAR analog beamforming and propose a channel approach based on beamspace pilot transmission to acquire channel state information (CSI). In addition, we propose limited feedback ESPAR analog beamforming based on a beamforming selection strategy. Simulation results for average gain show that ESPAR analog beamforming has almost identical performance to digital beamforming and better performance than analog beamforming using phase shifters. Energy efficiency simulations show that the technique has the highest efficiency among all the beamforming techniques. Therefore, ESPAR analog beamforming has near optimal performance, high energy efficiency, low circuit complexity, low cost, compact size and can be an effective alternative to conventional analog beamforming.}

	abstract = {In order to mitigate the double near-far effect , we focus on a mobile wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where sensor nodes harvest energy from the radio frequency (RF) signal of the mobile energy access point (EAP), and transmit data to the mobile data access point (DAP) by using the harvested energy. Only the sensor nodes with energy larger than a threshold, which is mainly determined by the energy consumption of one transmission, have opportunities to transmit data. Due to the mobility of the EAP and DAP, the distance between the EAP and DAP changes over time. When the DAP moves into the operation region of the EAP, the EAP and DAP could not work simultaneously due to the severe interference, and an energy harvesting probability is employed to denote the probability that the EAP works in this scenario. The purpose of this paper is to identify the optimal transmission policy, i.e., the optimal pairing of the energy consumption of one transmission and the energy harvesting probability, that maximizes the throughput of the WPCN under an energy causality constraint. By analyzing the energy causality constraint, we show that the WPCN could be divided into an energy-sufficient state and an energy-limited state by the pairing of the energy consumption of one transmission and the energy harvesting probability. Since the energy consumption of one transmission and the energy harvesting probability are jointly intertwined with the energy causality constraint, making the joint optimization problem intractable, we divide the throughput maximization problem into two layers. In the inner problem, we investigate the optimal energy consumption of one transmission with a given energy harvesting probability. In the outer problem, we derive the optimal energy harvesting probability based on the obtained optimal energy consumption of one transmission. According to the aforementioned investigations, we propose a two-layer algorithm to obtain the specific solution. Numerical results are conducted to validate the theoretical results and the efficiency of the proposed two-layer algorithm.}

	abstract = {The analysis and optimization of single intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted systems have been extensively studied, whereas little is known regarding multiple-IRS-assisted systems. This paper investigates the analysis and optimization of a double-IRS cooperatively assisted downlink system (D-IRS-C), where a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves a single-antenna user with the help of two multi-element IRSs, connected by an inter-IRS channel. The channel between any two nodes is modeled with Rician fading. The BS adopts the instantaneous CSI-adaptive maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) beamformer, and the two IRSs adopt a cooperative quasi-static phase shift design. The goal is to maximize the average achievable rate, which can be reflected by the average channel power of the equivalent channel between the BS and user at low channel estimation and phase adjustment costs and computational complexity. First, we obtain tractable expressions of the average channel power of the equivalent channel in the general (Rician factor), pure line of sight (LoS), and pure non-line of sight (NLoS) regimes, respectively. Then, we jointly optimize the phase shifts of the two IRSs to maximize the average channel power of the equivalent channel in these regimes. The optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems. We obtain globally optimal closed-form solutions for some cases and propose computationally efficient iterative algorithms to obtain stationary points for the other cases. Next, we compare the computational complexity for optimizing the phase shifts and the optimal average channel power of D-IRS-C with those of a counterpart double-IRS non-cooperatively assisted system (D-IRS-NC) and a counterpart single-IRS-assisted system (S-IRS) at a large number of reflecting elements in the three regimes. Finally, we numerically demonstrate notable gains of the proposed solutions over the existing solutions at different system parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first work that optimizes the quasi-static phase shift design of D-IRS-C and characterizes its advantages over the optimal quasi-static phase shift design of the counterpart D-IRS-NC and S-IRS.}

	abstract = {Remote state estimation where sensors send their measurements of distributed dynamic plants to a remote estimator over shared wireless resources is essential for mission-critical applications of Industry 4.0. Existing algorithms on dynamic radio resource allocation for remote estimation systems assumed oversimplified wireless communications models and can only work for small-scale settings. In this work, we consider remote estimation systems with practical wireless models over the orthogonal multiple-access and non-orthogonal multiple-access schemes. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which remote estimation systems can be stabilized. The conditions are described in terms of the transmission power budget, channel statistics, and plants’ parameters. For each multiple-access scheme, we formulate a novel dynamic resource allocation problem as a decision-making problem for achieving the minimum overall long-term average estimation mean-square error. Both the estimation quality and the channel quality states are taken into account for decision making. We systematically investigated the problems under different multiple-access schemes with large discrete, hybrid discrete-and-continuous, and continuous action spaces, respectively. We propose novel action-space compression methods and develop advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problems. Numerical results show that our algorithms solve the resource allocation problems effectively and provide much better scalability than the literature.}

However, sensitive information of user equipments (UEs) may be exposed to the involved access points or the central processing unit in practice. To guarantee data privacy, effective privacy-preserving mechanisms are defined in this paper. In particular, we demonstrate and characterize the possibility in exploiting the inherent quantization error, caused by low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs), for privacy-preserving in a FL CF mMIMO system. Furthermore, to reduce the required uplink training time in such a system, a stochastic non-convex design problem that jointly optimizing the transmit power and the data rate is formulated. To address the problem at hand, we propose a novel power control method by utilizing the successive convex approximation approach to obtain a suboptimal solution. Besides, an asynchronous protocol is established for mitigating the straggler effect to facilitate FL. Numerical results show that compared with the conventional full power transmission, adopting the proposed power control method can effectively reduce the uplink training time under various practical system settings. Also, our results unveil that our proposed asynchronous approach can reduce the waiting time at the central processing unit for receiving all user information, as there are no stragglers that requires a long time to report their local updates.}

Our proposed technique WF-ECS computes a weighted average of the group of reference points (RPs) having similar RSS patterns and thus, creates a more perfect match between fused positional co-ordinates and RSS patterns considered for merging to a single entry. Extensive experimentation have been carried out to evaluate and compare the performances of our proposed system WF-ECS with the contemporary fingerprint positioning systems including our prior work using the simulation test bed, the dataset collected from our departmental building and also the benchmark dataset . The experimental results depict that our newly proposed technique WF-ECS can outperform the contemporary techniques in terms of positioning accuracy and positioning overhead while reducing the storage overhead in real indoor settings.}

	abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and polar codes have demonstrated superiority in supporting massive connections and short-packets, which are essential in the uplink transmission of the internet of things. This paper proposes a sparse neural network (SNN) for the detection and decoding of the non-binary polar-coded SCMA. The network consists of the message passing algorithms (MPA) and the sparse belief propagation (SBP) modules, which are immigrated from the MPA and BP algorithms, respectively. The nodes of the bipartite BP factor graph that do not contribute to the belief propagation are pruned to form the SBP module. A structure factor\nα\ndefined by the ratio of the number of layers in the MPA modules and that of the SBP modules is analyzed to find a balance between the decoding performance and the complexity. The weights are set on the neurons of the layers and trained by the stochastic gradient descent. Finally, the simulation results show substantial improvements in bit error rate with low complexity over the traditional receiver. Specifically, the SNN receiver outperforms the traditional receiver by 2.56 dB in the AWGN channel when the code length is 16, the code rate is\n1\n2\n, and the user overloading factor is 150%.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) achieve high passive beamforming gains for signal enhancement or interference nulling by dynamically adjusting their reflection coefficients. Their employment is particularly appealing for improving both the wireless security and the efficiency of radio frequency (RF)-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by this, we conceive and investigate a RIS-assisted secure simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system designed for information and power transfer from a base station (BS) to an information user (IU) and to multiple energy users (EUs), respectively. Moreover, the EUs are also potential eavesdroppers that may overhear the communication between the BS and IU. We adopt two-timescale transmission for reducing the signal processing complexity as well as channel training overhead, and aim for maximizing the average worst-case secrecy rate achieved by the IU. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the short-term transmit beamforming vectors at the BS (including information and energy beams) as well as the long-term phase shifts at the RIS, under the energy harvesting constraints considered at the EUs and the power constraint at the BS. The stochastic optimization problem formulated is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, and is non-smooth due to the existence of multiple EUs/eavesdroppers. No standard optimization approach is available for this challenging scenario. To tackle this challenge, we propose a smooth approximation aided stochastic successive convex approximation (SA-SSCA) algorithm. Furthermore, a low-complexity heuristic algorithm is proposed for reducing the computational complexity without unduly eroding the performance. Simulation results show the efficiency of the RIS in securing SWIPT systems. The significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over the relevant benchmark schemes are also demonstrated.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a pioneering technology to realize smart electromagnetic environments by reshaping the wireless channel. Jointly designing the transceiver and RIS relies on the channel state information (CSI), whose feedback has not been investigated in multi-RIS-assisted frequency division duplexing systems. In this study, the limited feedback of the RIS-assisted wireless channel is examined by capitalizing on the ability of the RIS in channel customization. By configuring the phase shifters of the surfaces using statistical CSI, we customize a sparse channel in rich-scattering environments, which significantly reduces the feedback overhead in designing the transceiver and RISs. Since the channel is customized in terms of singular value decomposition (SVD) with full-rank, the optimal SVD transceiver can be approached without a matrix decomposition and feeding back the complete channel parameters. The theoretical spectral efficiency (SE) loss of the proposed transceiver and RIS design is derived by considering the limited CSI quantization. To minimize the SE loss, a bit partitioning algorithm that splits the limited number of bits to quantize the CSI is developed. Extensive numerical results show that the channel customization-based transceiver with reduced CSI can achieve satisfactory performance compared with the optimal transceiver with full CSI. Given the limited number of feedback bits, the bit partitioning algorithm can minimize the SE loss by adaptively allocating bits to quantize the channel parameters.}

This paper presents the design and evaluation of SmartRFID, a novel UHF RFID authentication system to promote commodity crypto-less UHF RFID tags for security-sensitive applications. SmartRFID explores extremely popular smart devices and requires a legitimate user to enroll his smart device along with his RFID tag. Besides authenticating the RFID tag as usual, SmartRFID verifies whether the user simultaneously possesses the associated smart device with both feature-based machine learning and deep learning techniques. The user is considered authentic if and only if passing the dual verifications. Comprehensive user experiments on commodity smartwatches and RFID devices confirmed the high security and usability of SmartRFID. In particular, SmartRFID achieves a true acceptance rate of above 97.5% and a false acceptance rate of less than 0.7% based on deep learning. In addition, SmartRFID can achieve an average authentication latency of less than 2.21 s, which is comparable to inputting a PIN on a door keypad or smartphone.}

	abstract = {The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), one of the key technologies for next-generation mobile communication systems, can facilitate data transmission for users all over the world, especially in some remote areas where vast amounts of informative data are collected by Internet of remote things (IoRT) devices to support various data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) services. However, training AI models centrally with the assistance of SAGIN faces the challenges of highly constrained network topology, inefficient data transmission, and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel topology-aware federated learning framework for the SAGIN, namely Olive Branch Learning (OBL). Specifically, the IoRT devices in the ground layer leverage their private data to perform model training locally, while the air nodes in the air layer and the ring-structured low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in the space layer are in charge of model aggregation (synchronization) at different scales. To further enhance communication efficiency and inference performance of OBL, an efficient Communication and Non-IID-aware Air node-Satellite Assignment (CNASA) algorithm is designed by taking the data class distribution of the air nodes as well as their geographic locations into account. Furthermore, we extend our OBL framework and CNASA algorithm to adapt to more complex multi-orbit satellite networks. We analyze the convergence of our OBL framework and conclude that the CNASA algorithm contributes to the fast convergence of the global model. Extensive experiments based on realistic datasets corroborate the superior performance of our algorithm over the benchmark policies.}

	abstract = {One of the main obstacles in full-duplex radios is analog-to-digital converter (ADC) saturation on a receiver due to the strong self-interference (SI). To solve this issue, researchers have proposed two different types of analog self-interference cancellation (SIC) methods—i) passive suppression and ii) regeneration-and-subtraction of SI. For the latter case, the tunable RF component, such as a multi-tap circuit, reproduces and subtracts the SI. The resolutions of such RF components constitute the key factor of the analog SIC. Indeed, they are directly related to how well the SI is imitated. Another major issue in analog SIC is the inaccurate estimation of the SI channel due to the nonlinear distortions, which mainly come from the power amplifier (PA). In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the SIC performance of the multi-tap circuit; we consider how the RF components must overcome such practical impairments as digitally-controlled attenuators, phase shifters, and PA. For a realistic performance analysis, we exploit the measured PA characteristics and carry out a 3D ray-tracing-based, system-level throughput analysis. Our results confirm that the non-idealities of the RF components significantly affect the analog SIC performance. We believe our study provides insight into the design of the practical full-duplex system.}

	abstract = {Data-aided channel estimation is a promising solution to improve channel estimation accuracy by exploiting data symbols as pilot signals for updating an initial channel estimate. In this paper, we propose a semi-data-aided channel estimator for multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. Our strategy is to leverage reinforcement learning (RL) for selecting reliable detected symbols, then update the channel estimate by utilizing only the selected symbols as additional pilot signals. Towards this end, we first define a Markov decision process (MDP) which sequentially decides whether to use each detected symbol as an additional pilot signal. We then develop an RL algorithm to find an effective policy of the MDP based on a Monte Carlo tree search approach. In this algorithm, we exploit the a-posteriori probability for approximating both the optimal future actions and the corresponding state transitions of the MDP and derive a closed-form expression for the optimal policy under the approximations. A key advantage of the proposed channel estimator is that it requires less computational complexity than conventional iterative data-aided channel estimators. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimator effectively mitigates both channel estimation error and detection performance loss caused by insufficient pilot signals.}

	abstract = {Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been touted as a technology star for future wireless networks, the critical bottleneck still lies in the accurate acquisition of channel state information (CSI). The vast majority of state-of-the-art cascaded channel estimates entail the pilot overhead typically proportional to the number of RIS elements, which results in a long training time and thus may not be tolerable in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the channel tracking for RIS-aided high-mobility millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. By leveraging the angular domain representation of cascaded channels, we initially demonstrate the dynamic dual-structured sparsity (DDS), i.e., i) the angular cascaded channel matrices associated with different users share the identical non-zero rows while differ in their non-zero columns and ii) the cascaded channel support exhibits temporal correlation inherent to the dynamic nature of mobile channels. Then, a layered processing with dynamic dual-structured sparsity (LP-DDS) framework is customized to provide sparse priors for the exact distributions of cascaded channels. In this case, the joint estimate of the angular cascaded channel and Doppler shift is formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem while taking into account the temporal correlation of dynamic channels, which, however, is highly intractable due to the ill-conditioned sensing matrix. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm, namely DDS-VBIMP, where in particular, both variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing techniques are complemented each other to achieve parameter updates by taking full advantage of the sparse priors as captured by LP-DDS. We demonstrate through our analyses that the proposed DDS-VBIMP can significantly reduce pilot overhead. Simulation results reveal the superiority and robustness of the proposed DDS-VBIMP as compared to various benchmark schemes.}

Deep convolutional networks (ConvNets) have been recently applied in cognitive radio and achieved remarkable performance. However, existing ConvNet-based methods mainly focus on the first-order architecture design, while fail to explore feature correlations of radio signal, which are particularly significant for useful information extraction in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this paper, we propose high-order convolutional attention networks (HoCANs) for radio signal expression and feature correlation learning, based on a novel high-order attention mechanism to rescale the convolutional features along channel and sequence dimensions. High-order convolutional layer and covariance matrix after nonlinear transformation are led for tenser filtering with more discriminative representations of radio signals. Experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of HoCANs which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for automatic modulation classification on RADIOML 2018.01A dataset.}

In this paper, we propose an LT\n-collision resolution GFRA ( LT\n-GFRA) scheme by combining a pilot set containing L\northogonal pilots and a T\n-order codebook, where each activated user equipment (UE) randomly selects one of L\npilots, and directly sends to the base station (BS) followed with data encoded by the T\n-order codebook together. Thus, the BS can receive L\ndifferent frames and a conventional collision occurs when more than one UE select the same pilot. Moreover, we design a successive cancellation then joint decoding (SCJD) decoder, and prove the BS can decode at most T\nUEs from the frame on the same pilot and can recover up to LT\nUEs. Then, we derive the decoding error probability of our LT\n-GFRA scheme in Rayleigh fading channel, and further derive the access failure probability (AFP) and the system throughput in the single- and multiple-antenna systems. We also extend and evaluate our LT\n-GFRA scheme in the shadowed-Rician fading channel. Finally, simulations validate our analytical results, and indicate that our LT\n-GFRA scheme can greatly outperform the state-of-art schemes for massive access in IoT.}

To address this anti-jamming problem, a Markov decision process (MDP) with a two-dimensional action space consisting of transmit frequency and power is proposed in this paper, modeling the interaction between a normal communication link and the presence of malicious jammers in a frequency hopping (FH) communication system. Furthermore, we also prove the existence of the deterministic optimal policy of the proposed model theoretically.

In this paper, we first study the outage performance of the greedy best user scheduling SGF scheme (BU-SGF) by considering the impacts of Rayleigh fading, path loss, and random user locations. In order to tackle the admission fairness problem of the BU-SGF scheme, we propose a fair SGF scheme by applying cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS-SGF), in which the GF user with the best channel relative to its own statistics will be admitted. Moreover, by employing the theories of order statistics and stochastic geometry, the outage performances of both BU-SGF and CS-SGF schemes are analyzed. Theoretical results show that both schemes can achieve full diversity orders only when the served users’ data rate is capped, which severely limits the rate performance of SGF schemes. To further address this issue, we propose a distributed power control strategy to relax such data rate constraint, and derive analytical expressions of the two schemes’ outage performances under this strategy. Finally, simulation results validate the fairness performance of the proposed CS-SGF scheme, the effectiveness of the power control strategy, and the accuracy of the theoretical analyses.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a dynamic detection network (DDNet) based detector for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By constructing an improved DetNet (IDetNet) detector and the OAMPNet detector as two independent network branches, the DDNet detector performs sample-wise dynamic routing to adaptively select a better one between the IDetNet and the OAMPNet detectors for every samples under different system conditions. To avoid the prohibitive transmission overhead of dataset collection in centralized learning (CL), we propose the federated averaging (FedAve)-DDNet detector, where all raw data are kept at local clients and only locally trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server for aggregation. To further reduce the transmission overhead, we develop the federated gradient sparsification (FedGS)-DDNet detector by randomly sampling gradients with elaborately calculated probability when uploading gradients to the central server. Based on simulation results, the proposed DDNet detector consistently outperforms other detectors under all system conditions thanks to the sample-wise dynamic routing. Moreover, the federated DDNet detectors, especially the FedGS-DDNet detector, can reduce the transmission overhead by at least 25.7% while maintaining satisfactory detection accuracy.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted wireless data aggregation (WDA) in multi-cluster networks, where multiple UAVs simultaneously perform different WDA tasks via over-the-air computation (AirComp) without terrestrial base stations. This work focuses on maximizing the minimum amount of WDA tasks performed by each cluster by optimizing the UAV trajectory and transceiver design as well as cluster scheduling and association, while considering the WDA accuracy requirement. Such a joint design is critical for interference management in multi-cluster AirComp networks, via enhancing the signal quality between each UAV and its associated cluster for signal alignment while reducing the inter-cluster interference between each UAV and its non-associated clusters. Although it is generally challenging to optimally solve the formulated non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, an efficient iterative algorithm as a compromise approach is developed by exploiting bisection and block coordinate descent methods, yielding an optimal transceiver solution in each iteration. The optimal binary variables and a suboptimal trajectory are obtained by using the dual method and successive convex approximation, respectively. Simulations show the considerable performance gains of the proposed design over benchmarks and the superiority of deploying multiple UAVs in increasing the number of performed tasks while reducing access delays.}

We introduce a new notion of “cluster pairs” to capture the dynamic nature of the users spatial distribution in order to exploit one of the top advantages of UAVs, which is the mobility and relocation flexibility. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we first derive a new distance distribution that is vital for the energy efficiency analysis. Next, we compute the coverage probability under two deployment strategies: (i) one UAV per cluster pair, and (ii) one UAV per cluster. Finally, we compute the energy efficiency for both strategies. Our numerical results reveal which of the two strategies is better for different system parameters. Our work investigates some new aspects of the UAV-enabled communication system such as the dynamic density of users and the advantages or disadvantages of one- or two-UAV deployment strategies per cluster pair. By considering the relationships between the densities of user cluster pairs and the charging pads, it is shown that an optimal cluster pair density exists to maximize the energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {When acting as dynamic receivers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have several advantages over the conventional static base stations for received signal strength (RSS) based target searching. It is highly likely that the RSS is becoming stronger as the UAV is moving towards the estimated coordinate, and this leads to a higher estimation precision for each localization update. On the other hand, despite its low cost, low energy consumption and simple hardware requirement, RSS can be severely influenced by land layouts, therefore the assumption of a simple free space propagation model may lead to poor estimation precision and even failure, especially for an area where the topography is highly complex. In this paper, we propose multi-UAV target searching with the assistance of radio maps, which contain abundant information of the topography influence on RSS. We generate radio maps from real topographic data, and derive the minimum mean square error estimator for multi-UAV target searching with the radio map knowledge for memoryless observations. Simulations for areas with complex topography, show that the localization precision and searching efficiency can be considerably improved with the assistance of radio maps.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-cluster wireless powered Internet of Things (WP-IoT) network assisted by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (multi-IRS). In this network, a power station (PS) first broadcasts wireless energy to the distributed IoT devices grouped into multiple clusters. The IoT devices then use the harvested energy to convey their information to an access point (AP), based on a hybrid time- and frequency-division multiple access (TDMA-FDMA) protocol. Furthermore, multiple IRSs are deployed to perform anomalous reflection for energy and information transfer, to improve energy harvesting and data transmission capabilities. Under the constraints of the unit-modulus phase shifts, the transmission time shared among clusters and the bandwidth shared by the devices in each cluster, the considered system is optimized by maximizing its sum throughput. The optimization problem is non-convex and with complicatedly coupled variables. To solve this problem, we propose to first apply the Lagrange dual method and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to derive closed-form solutions for transmission scheduling and bandwidth allocation, then the quadratic transformation (QT) and the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm are introduced to solve the downlink and uplink IRS phase shifts, whilst the Majorization-Minimization (MM) and Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO) methods are applied to iteratively derive their closed-form solutions. Additionally, we provide a benchmark scheme to facilitate the system design, where each IRS can control its “on/off” state to aid the downlink and uplink transmissions in the condition of at most one activated IRS during one certain time duration. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the optimality of our proposed scheme and highlight the beneficial role of the IRS.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled air-ground integrated communication systems are vulnerable to jamming attack, mainly due to the high probability with line-of-sight wireless channel conditions. Although a few UAV anti-jamming transmission schemes have been recently proposed, the fundamental performance limits by simultaneously considering the UAV and jammer’s mobility have not yet been reported. These observations motivate us to formulate an interactive reward region (IRR) characterization problem for the scenario that the UAV and the jammer compete with each other to maximize their respective rewards via power and mobility control. Then, we propose a transmit and jamming power optimization algorithm to characterize the IRR with power control, by leveraging successive convex approximation technique, where two transmit power design schemes are given in closed-form expressions from a game-theoretic perspective. Furthermore, the IRR with joint power and mobility control is characterized based on alternating optimization, in which both the UAV and jammer can simultaneously adjust their power and trajectories. Finally, extensive simulation results reveal that joint transmit power and trajectory optimization can enlarge the IRR, and increasing the UAV mobility and flight time length improves the UAV reward.}

	abstract = {Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) have great potential to be used in the radiator/receptor elements of future wireless transmitters and receivers, replacing conventional metallic antennas. This can be attributed to their unique properties, such as the ability to be reconfigured in real-time and to reduce the radio frequency chains, resulting in low implementation cost. However, the Lorentzian constraint associated with the DMA elements poses a challenge to real-time configuration and limits the application of the DMA. In this study, we propose a DMA-based wireless network, wherein a DMA-equipped base station (BS) communicates with single and multiple users. For the single-user scenario, we develop an optimal algorithm to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the user, which provides the weight of each DMA element in closed form. Furthermore, for multiple users, we formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) problem and employ techniques from the single-user case to develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm, which optimizes both the transmit precoders and DMA weights, to enhance the WSR of the system under the transmit power constraint of the BS. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in achieving better performance than that of the benchmark schemes.}

The latter problem is solved here via the new JCDE scheme which differs from state-of-the-art (SotA) alternatives due to two contributions. The first is the design and incorporation of de-quantization (DQ) step which relies only on scalar Gaussian approximation (SGA) assumptions in conformity with mild central limit theorem (CLT), in contrast to the much harder asymptotic conditions required by the classic bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiGAMP) algorithm. The second is a modification of bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP), whereby quantized outputs are linearized via the Bussgang decomposition enabling tractable signal processing. The resulting DQ-aided JCDE method achieves both low-complexity and high-accuracy by exploiting both the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) obtained from, and the observations at the CAP to compensate for the low-resolution distortion introduced by, the distributed APs. The efficacy of the proposed method over the SotA is confirmed via computer simulations.}

	abstract = {Downlink joint transmission by a cluster of remote radio-heads (RRHs) is essential for enhancing throughput in future cellular networks. This method requires global channel state information (CSI) at the processing unit that designs the joint precoder. To this end, extensive CSI must be shared between the RRHs and that unit. This paper proposes two contributions. The first is a new upper bound on the rate loss, which implies a lower bound on the achievable rate for an RRHs-cluster employing joint zero-forcing (ZF) with incomplete CSI with single-user decoding (SUD) at the mobile stations (MSs). The second contribution, which follows insights from the bound, is a new CSI sharing scheme that drastically reduces the significant overhead associated with acquiring global CSI for joint transmission. In a nutshell, each RRH applies a local precoding matrix that creates low-dimensional effective channels that can be quantized more accurately with fewer bits, thereby reducing the overhead of sharing CSI. In addition to the CSI sharing-overhead, this scheme reduces the data rate delivered to each RRH in the cluster.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system by considering only the statistical channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). We aim to maximize its sum-rate via the joint optimization of precoding matrix at the BS and phase shifts vector at the RIS. However, the multi-user MIMO transmissions and the spatial correlations make the optimization cumbersome. For tractability, an asymptotic sum-rate is derived under a large number of the reflecting elements. By adopting the asymptotic sum-rate as the objective function, optimal designs of the transmit precoding matrix and the phase shifts vector can be decoupled and solved individually. More specifically, a high-quality suboptimal solution of the transmit precoding matrix and phase shifts vectors can be obtained by utilizing the water-filling algorithm and the projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm, respectively. Comparing to the case of the instantaneous CSI assumed at the BS, the proposed algorithm based on the statistical CSI can achieve comparable performance but with much lower channel estimation overhead, information feedback overhead, and computational complexity, which is more affordable and appealing for practical applications. Moreover, the impact of spatial correlation on the asymptotic sum-rate is examined by using majorization theory.}

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as a supplement to the ground networks, to relieve the communication pressure on ground facilities, such as base stations. In this paper, we use multiple UAVs to provide services for vehicles and model the multi-UAV scenario as a collaborative multi-agent system. In addition, we take vehicle safety as the top priority and the delay requirement as the constraints. Then we exploit the Lagrange multiplier to combine the constraint function and cost function, so as to reduce the resource consumption as much as possible on the premise of ensuring the safety of the vehicles. The influence of spectrum efficiency and computing power should also be taken into account when allocating resources. We adopt the multi-agent reinforcement learning to train the UAVs, and meanwhile introduce the attention mechanism so that each UAV can optimize itself better with the information of other UAVs. Through extensive simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed method is verified. Particularly, the limited resources can allocated efficiently according to the vehicle’s needs under the premise of ensuring vehicle safety.}

Specifically, with the target of securing the VAA-aided D2DM communication under the threat of multiple eavesdroppers, we propose a secure beamforming scheme by jointly considering the formed VAA and the Base Station (BS). For obtaining the optimal beamforing vectors, a nonsmooth and nonconvex Weight Sum Rate Maximization Problem (WRMP) is formulated and solved using Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach. Furthermore, we consider the worst case that eavesdroppers cooperatively form a eavesdrop VAA to enhance the overhearing capacity. In the worst case, we modify the securing beamforming scheme, formulate the corresponding WRMP and solve it using a two-level optimization.

	abstract = {Contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) setups often include an external source delivering content to a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). “Cutting the wire” in such setups and going truly wireless will require a wireless network capable of delivering enormous amounts of video data at an extremely low latency. The massive bandwidth of higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, can meet these requirements. Due to high attenuation and path loss in the mmWave frequencies, beamforming is essential. In wireless VR, where the antenna is integrated into the HMD, any head rotation also changes the antenna’s orientation. As such, beamforming must adapt, in real-time, to the user’s head rotations. An HMD’s built-in sensors providing accurate orientation estimates may facilitate such rapid beamforming. In this work, we present coVRage, a receive-side beamforming solution tailored for VR HMDs. Using built-in orientation prediction present on modern HMDs, the algorithm estimates how the Angle of Arrival (AoA) at the HMD will change in the near future, and covers this AoA trajectory with a dynamically shaped oblong beam, synthesized using sub-arrays. We show that this solution can cover these trajectories with consistently high gain, even in light of temporally or spatially inaccurate orientational data.}

	abstract = {Time-sensitive wireless applications have strict requirements on real-time data transmission and control operation. Even though time synchronization has been extensively studied for providing a common timing among distributed wireless nodes, there still exists a lack of research for low-accuracy and large-drifting clocks, such as internal Resistor-Capacitor (RC) oscillator clocks with around\n4×\n10\n5\nparts per million (ppm) frequency drift, which are widely used in wearable sensor systems. This paper proposes a Proportional Packet-Coupled Oscillators (P-PkCOs) protocol for synchronizing poor-performing internal RC oscillator clocks with high disturbances in the single-cluster wireless network. The behaviour of such a drifting clock is described by a non-identical and time-varying model. To achieve time synchronization on low-accuracy internal RC oscillator clocks, a packet-coupled synchronization scheme is proposed for adjusting drifting clocks via the proportional control-based correction scheme. The RC oscillator frequency in an embedded system cannot be corrected, and this work utilizes the clock threshold adjustment as a substitute for frequency correction. The stability region of controller parameters is given to guarantee that the clock threshold approaches a value, which is jointly determined by the nominal threshold and the corresponding clock frequency. We also propose a linear matrix inequality condition to prove that the P-PkCOs performance is robust against the large clock disturbances. We demonstrate the implementation of P-PkCOs. The experimental results show that P-PkCOs can achieve and maintain robust time synchronization on the internal RC oscillator clocks.}

	abstract = {Ambient environment information, including reflectors’ geometrical layout, dimension, and reflectivity, is a key input to versatile millimeter-wave networking and sensing applications. It has found versatile applications in optimizing network coverage and robustness, enhancing mobile link performance, and enabling high-accuracy indoor localization and navigation. Recent approaches of deriving mmWave environment information require heavy infrastructure support and rely on costly software-defined radios, which prevent their usage in practice. In this work, we design and implement e-mmRanger, which can efficiently sense the environment without infrastructure support. e-mmRanger equips a pair of low-cost off-the-shelf mmWave radios in a commodity robot, which constantly samples the ambient environment by exchanging a series of mmWave signals while it moves. It then re-engineers the time-domain signal series to derive the spatial-domain environment structure through novel reflection path extraction and clustering algorithms. Moreover, e-mmRanger accelerates the mapping process by incorporating a novel Space-knit algorithm, which strategically plans an optimal movement route consisting of minimum sampling locations for the robot. Our experiments verify that e-mmRanger can accurately and efficiently sense the surrounding environment, and the learned information can bring multi-fold performance gain over empirical approaches in mmWave networks.}

	abstract = {Wireless communications over Terahertz (THz)-band frequencies are vital enablers of ultra-high rate applications and services in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, THz communications suffer from poor coverage because of inherent THz features such as high penetration losses, significant molecular absorption, and severe path loss. To surmount these critical challenges and fully exploit the THz band, we explore a coexisting radio frequency (RF) and THz finite indoor network in which THz small cells are deployed to provide high data rates, and RF macrocells are deployed to satisfy coverage requirements. Using stochastic geometry tools, we assess the performance of coexisting RF and THz networks and derive tractable analytical expressions for the coverage probability and average achievable rate. The analytical results are validated with Monte-Carlo simulations. Several insights are devised for accurate tuning and optimization of THz system parameters, including the THz bias, and the fraction of THz access points (APs) to deploy. The obtained results recognize a clear coverage/rate trade-off where a high fraction of THz AP improves the rate significantly but may degrade the coverage performance. Furthermore, the location of a user in the finite area highly affects the fraction of THz APs that optimizes its quality of service.}

	abstract = {With the development of internet of things, latency-sensitive applications such as telemedicine are constantly emerging. Unfortunately, due to the limited computation capacity of wireless user devices, the real-time demands can not be met. Multi-access edge computing (MEC), which enables the deployment of edge access points (E-APs) to support computation-intensive applications, has become an effective way to meet the real-time demands. However, the number of WUDs that E-APs can serve are limited. To increase system capacity, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted computation offloading architecture in the terahertz (THz) band is proposed. In this paper, the problem of UAV placement optimization, resource allocation, and computation offloading is investigated considering the quality of service and resource constraints. The joint optimization problem is non-convex and hard to be solved in time by using traditional algorithms, such as successive convex approximation. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach is a promising way to solve the formulated non-convex problem of minimizing latency. Double deep Q-learning (DDQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms are provided to search for near-optimal solutions in highly dynamic environments. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is proved by simulation results in different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Finding the optimal beamformers in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks is challenging because of its non-convexity, and conventional optimization based algorithms suffer from high computational costs. Recently, deep learning based methods have been proposed because of their computational efficiency, but they typically can not generalize well when deployed in heterogeneous scenarios where the base stations (BSs) are equipped with different numbers of antennas and have different inter-BS distances. This paper proposes a novel deep learning based beamforming algorithm to address above challenges. Specifically, we consider the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem in multi-input and single-output (MISO) interference channels, and propose a beamforming learning architecture by unfolding a parallel gradient projection algorithm. By leveraging the low-dimensional structures of the optimal beamforming solution, our constructed learning network can be made independent of the numbers of transmit antennas and BSs. Moreover, such a design can be further extended to a cooperative multicell network where users are jointly served by multiple BSs. Numerical results based on both synthetic and ray-tracing channel models show that the proposed neural network can achieve high WSRs with significantly reduced runtime, while exhibiting favorable generalization capability with respect to the antenna number, BS number and the inter-BS distance.}

The effects of attenuation loss, atmospheric turbulence, pointing error and angle-of-arrival (AOA) are taken into account. Also, the application of adaptive optics correction, one of the most effective turbulence mitigation techniques, is analyzed using the Zernike polynomials representation. Analytical expressions are obtained for probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), Rytov variance, adaptive optics filter function and outage probability mainly in terms of Meijer’s G functions when both no adaptive optics correction is used and adaptive optics correction is applied. Some selected results are presented depending on the various parameters such as the HAPS altitude, the ratio of vertical and horizontal deviations, beam waist, Zenith angle, height of ground station, receiver aperture diameter, channel state threshold and wind speed. The performance improvement with adaptive optics correction is investigated by removing different Zernike modes. We show that (i) the downlink outperforms the uplink, (ii) the performance of the horizontal link sharply increases above a certain altitude, and, (iii) the communication links benefit from the adaptive optics correction up to a certain level in terms of performance improvement.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in cognitive wireless networks, consisting of primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs), where only partial observations are available at the SUs due to narrowband sensing and transmissions. The network operates in a time-slotted regime, where the traffic patterns of the PUs are modeled as finite-memory Markov chains, that are unknown to the SUs. Since observations are partial, then both channel sensing and access actions affect the throughput. Focusing on the case in which there is a single SU, our objective is to maximize the SU’s long-term throughput. To that aim, we develop a novel algorithm that learns both access and sensing policies via deep Q-learning, dubbed Double Deep Q-network for Sensing and Access (DDQSA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly optimizes both sensing and access policies for DSA via deep Q-learning. Next, we consider wireless networks with access policy which implements a fixed channel hopping dynamics, for which we analytically determine the optimal SU sensing and access policy and its associated throughput. Then, we demonstrate that indeed, the proposed DDQSA algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance for the considered network. Our results show that the proposed DDQSA algorithm learns a policy that implements both sensing and channel access, which significantly outperforms existing approaches, and can achieve the optimal performance in certain scenarios.}

We continue the evolution of index modulation in MIMO by adopting all-antenna activation and obtaining a set of unique symbols from altering the positions of the antenna transmit power. We provide the analysis of the achievable rate of PMM under Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) distribution and finite cardinality input (FCI). Numerical results are evaluated by comparing PMM with the other existing systems.

A low complexity detection scheme based on zero-forcing (ZF) is proposed, and maximum likelihood (ML) detection is discussed.

Resonant beam SWIPT (RB-SWIPT) scheme utilizes narrow optical beam as carrier and with spatially separated resonator structure, which can support high power and high rate SWIPT for mobile devices. However, the performance of original RB-SWIPT systems is limited by returning beam interference and transmission loss. In this paper, we propose a RB-SWIPT scheme for transmission-enhanced and anti-interference. The telescope internal modulator (TIM) and second harmonic generator (SHG) are adopted in the proposed system. The TIM can compress beams to reduce the transmission loss. The SHG can generate frequency-doubled beams to avoid interference. To evaluate the proposed system, we establish mathematical models to depict the beam transmission, energy conversion, electric power output and data receiving. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed system can achieve 18 bit/s/Hz spectral efficiency and deliver 8 W power over 100 m distance.}

To overcome the inter-task interference inherent in the non-orthogonal transmission among tasks, we design a novel transmission method called model sparsification and random compression (MSRC) as well as a reception method called modified turbo compressed sensing (M-Turbo-CS). More specifically, at each edge device, the local model updates of all tasks are first sparsified and randomly compressed with different random compression matrices for different tasks, before being superimposed and sent over the uplink channel. Then the ES constructes the model aggregations of all the tasks from the channel observation data through a modified version of the turbo compressed sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm called M-Turbo-CS. We analyze the performance of the proposed OA-FMTL framework with MSRC and M-Turbo-CS. Based on the analysis, we formulate a communication-learning optimization problem to improve the system performance by adjusting the power allocation among the tasks at the edge devices. Numerical simulations show that our proposed OA-FMTL efficiently suppresses the inter-task interference to achieve a learning performance comparable to the inter-task interference free bound at a significantly reduced communication overhead. It is also shown that the proposed inter-task power allocation optimization algorithm further reduces the overall communication overhead by appropriately adjusting the power allocation among the tasks.}

To improve spectrum utilization and ensure that SU can harvest as much energy as possible, we let the size-limited SUs be equipped with orthogonally dual-polarized antennas (ODPAs). Based on these setting-ups, we propose the polarization-enabled two-phase cooperative framework, where SU transmitters first apply the power splitting technique to harvest energy from radio frequency (RF) signals radiated by the PU, and then use the harvested energy to concurrently transmit their own and the PU’s data. Under our proposed framework, we develop three secure resource allocation schemes for scenarios when SUs are untrusted users, which implies that each SU may overhear the PU’s and the other SUs’ confidential information. For these scenarios, which has hardly been studied, we jointly optimize the allocation of relays, subcarriers, power splitting ratios, and powers when SUs adopt the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy or the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy to relay the PU’s data, with the objective to maximize the total secrecy rate of all SUs while guaranteeing the PU’s secrecy rate. Finally, we validate and evaluate our proposed cooperative framework and secure resource allocation schemes through numerical analyses.}

	abstract = {As a novel wireless transmission scheme, multi-mode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (MM-OFDM-IM) is proposed recently, where multiple distinguishable constellations (modes) and their full permutation are employed for data transmission. However, the minimum intra-mode distance (MIAD) and inter-mode distance (MIRD) of the two dimensional (2D) multi-mode constellation decrease significantly as the constellation size becomes larger, degrading the error performance of the system. To meet this challenge, we propose a new modulation technique called high-dimensional MM-OFDM-IM (HM-OFDM-IM), where the high dimensional (HD) multi-mode constellations with considerably larger MIAD and MIRD are utilized. Besides, since index bits which consumes no energy accounts for larger proportion, the proposed scheme achieves higher energy efficiency (EE). However, HM-OFDM-IM can not provide any diversity gain, which is critical for the ultra-reliable communication in the fading channel. Therefore, the fading-resistant HM-OFDM-IM (RF-HM-OFDM-IM) is also proposed by introducing the rotated signal constellation, where the diversity order of symbol bits is identical with the dimension of the constellation. By minimizing the maximum pairwise error probability (PEP), the optimal rotation angles are obtained. Finally, the proposed schemes, as revealed by the theoretical analyses and simulation results, provide the better error performance compared with state-of-the-art IM-based schemes in the Rayleigh fading channel.}

	abstract = {Proactive Mobile Network (PMN) has been proposed to support extremely low latency communications with multi-tier computing architectures, machine-centricity, and data-driven operation features. Nevertheless, the communication reliability of the PMN introduces new substantial technological challenges. As PMN employs unique proactive open-loop communication, any feedback-based control is avoided to enhance end-to-end latency. This paper focuses on machine-initiated uplink transmission in PMN and proposes a reliability-guaranteed resource management scheme. Without requiring feedback control information, our scheme uniquely decomposes conventional resource management into two collaborative decision processes: predictive resource allocation suggested by network anchor nodes (ANs) and proactive smart resource utilization by smart equipment (SE). These two decision-making processes are constructed as independent reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but implicitly share the states of radio resources according to operating environments. Different algorithms for different operating scenarios have been investigated for this dual-decision solution. Simulation results in various scenarios show that our scheme enables PMN’s reliability close to the theoretical optimal value and successfully serves radio resource utilization in the PMNs.}

	abstract = {In the past few years, satellite communications have greatly affected our daily lives, and the integrated terrestrial-satellite network can combine the advantages of satellite and base stations (BSs) to provide wider coverage and lower cost. Because the resources of terrestrial-satellite network are limited, how to allocate resources of terrestrial-satellite network through effective methods has become a major challenge. This paper proposes a framework for resource allocation of terrestrial-satellite network based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Then, a deployment method of local cache pools is given to achieve lower time delay and maximize energy efficiency in terrestrial-satellite network. In the proposed framework, we adopt a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method to obtain the maximum energy efficiency by user association, power control, and cache design. The MADDPG algorithm is divided into two stages, users and BSs are set as agents to complete the optimization problem in the framework. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method has better optimized performance compared with the traditional single-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm and can efficiently solve the problems of resource allocation and cache design in the integrated terrestrial-satellite network.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose joint beamforming and photo-detector (PD) orientation (BO) optimization schemes for mobile visible light communication (VLC) with the orientation adjustable receiver (OAR). Since VLC is sensitive to line-of-sight propagation, we first establish the OAR model and the human body blockage model for mobile VLC user equipment (UE). To guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of mobile VLC, we jointly optimize BO with minimal UE the power consumption for both fixed and random UE orientation cases. For the fixed UE orientation case, since the transmit beamforming and the PD orientation are mutually coupled, the joint BO optimization problem is nonconvex and intractable. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain the transmit beamforming and the PD orientation. For the random UE orientation case, we further propose a robust alternating BO optimization algorithm to ensure the worst-case QoS requirement of the mobile UE. Finally, the performance of joint BO optimization design schemes are evaluated for mobile VLC through numerical experiments.}

	abstract = {With the introduction of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in 802.11ax, the role of the Access Point (AP) in Wi-Fi networks changes significantly, thanks to the opportunity of implementing more complex scheduling logic to handle Downlink (DL) traffic flows and simultaneously act as coordinator of Multi User (MU) Uplink (UL) transmissions. In this context, it becomes necessary to develop reliable network analysis and simulation tools that allow for an in-depth investigation of the trade-offs involved in the usage of OFDMA, especially considering that the standard leaves much of the actual scheduling algorithmic details to vendor-specific implementation. In this work we present a series of results highlighting how several network settings have an impact on throughput and Head-of-Line Delay, in a network that employs multiple 802.11ax features such as OFDMA and the MU Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) Parameter Set, while also containing legacy devices. The results are obtained via both the newly re-designed ns-3 wifi module and an original analytical framework, based on the well-established Bianchi 802.11 model.}

	abstract = {The sum of random variables (RVs) appears extensively in wireless communications, at large, both conventional and advanced, and has been subject of longstanding research. The statistical characterization of the referred sum is crucial to determine the performance of such communications systems. Although efforts have been undertaken to unveil these sum statistics, e.g., probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), no general efficient nor manageable solutions capable of evaluating the exact sum PDF and CDF are available to date. The only formulations are given in terms of either the multi-fold Brennan’s integral or the multivariate Fox\nH\n-function. Unfortunately, these methods are only feasible up to a certain number of RVs, meaning that when the number of RVs in the sum increases, the computation of the sum PDF and CDF is subject to stability problems, convergence issues, or inaccurate results. In this paper, we derive new, simple, exact formulations for the PDF and CDF of the sum of\nL\nindependent and identically distributed\nα\n-\nμ\nRVs. Unlike the available solutions, the computational complexity of our analytical expressions is independent of the number of summands. Capitalizing on our unprecedented findings, we analyze, in exact and asymptotic manners, the performance of\nL\n-branch pre-detection equal-gain combining and maximal-ratio combining receivers over\nα\n-\nμ\nfading environments. The coding and diversity gains of the system for both receivers are analyzed and quantified. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the computation time reduces drastically when using our expressions, which are arguably the most efficient and manageable formulations derived so far.}

Specifically, we propose a resilient uplink base station cooperative reception framework in FD-RAN, which is a large-scale fading based two-tier signal combination approach for the uplink transmission, including the localized signal combination at the base station and centralized signal combination at the edge cloud, respectively. Then, we formulate a weighted sum-rate maximization problem for the uplink transmission optimization, and decompose it into two subproblems. A spectrum-efficiency maximized virtual service cluster selection (SEMVS) algorithm is designed by leveraging the channel statistical information for solving subproblem one, and a fractional programming based power control (FPPC) algorithm is introduced for the power optimization of subproblem two. Compared to the typical RAN architectures with corresponding access and power control methods, simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvements of uplink FD-RAN with the proposed solution.}

To protect the legitimate transmission, Alice employs HB to send both the information signal and the artificial noise, while the IRS employs passive beamforming (PB) to reconstruct the wireless environment. Aiming at the secrecy capacity (SC) maximization, the joint optimization of HB and PB is formulated as a non-convex problem with constant-modulus constraints. To efficiently solve such a challenging problem, the original problem is decomposed into a PB subproblem and an HB subproblem, then these subproblems are sequentially solved by the proposed algorithms. Particularly, for the PB subproblem, we propose a channel information aided PB algorithm, which is proved to converge at a stationary point. With the solution of PB subproblem, two algorithms are proposed for the HB subproblem: 1) near-optimal SC approaching HB algorithm that achieves a near-optimal solution; 2) low-complexity HB algorithm that achieves a slight lower SC with less computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of proposed algorithms in comparison with the state-of-the-art works.}

Thus, extracting the maximum amount of information bits for given spatial constraints when designing wireless systems will be of great importance. In this paper, we present antenna array topologies that maximize the communication channel capacity for given number of array elements while occupying minimum space. Capacity is maximized via the development of an advanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm devising optimum standardized and arbitrarily-shaped antenna array topologies. Number of array elements and occupied space are informed by novel heuristic spatial degrees of freedom (SDoF) formulations which rigorously generalize existing SDoF formulas. Our generalized SDoF formulations rely on the differential entropy of three-dimensional (3D) angle of arrival (AOA) distributions and can associate the number of array elements and occupied space for any AOA distribution. The proposed analysis departs from novel closed-form spatial correlation functions (SCFs) of arbitrarily-positioned array elements for all classes of 3D multipath propagation channels, namely, isotropic, omnidirectional, and directional. Extensive simulation runs and comparisons with existing trivial solutions verify correctness of our SDoF formulations resulting in optimum antenna array topologies with maximum capacity performance and minimum space occupancy.}

In the proposed CPSC-RIS, the RIS is configured according to the transmitted PSK symbols such that different cyclically delayed versions of the incident signal are created by the RIS to achieve multipath diversity. A practical and efficient channel estimator is developed for CPSC-RIS and the mean square error of the channel estimation is expressed in closed-form. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance of CPSC-RIS over frequency-selective Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels. An upper bound on the BER is derived by assuming maximum-likelihood detection. Furthermore, by applying the concept of index modulation (IM), we propose an extension of CPSC-RIS, termed CPSC-RIS-IM, which enhances the spectral efficiency. In addition to conventional constellation information of PSK symbols, CPSC-RIS-IM uses the full permutations of cyclic delays caused by the RIS to carry information. A sub-optimal receiver is designed for CPSC-RIS-IM to aim at low computational complexity. Our simulation results in terms of BER corroborate the performance analysis and the superiority of CPSC-RIS(-IM) over the conventional CPSC without an RIS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with an RIS.}

Towards this end, we first formulate a robust joint precoder and combiner design as a stochastic minimum mean squared error optimization problem. Then, employing an alternating optimization approach, we propose an algorithm to obtain the precoding and combining matrices assuming imperfect CSI and calibration errors at both the BS and the user sides. We also provide asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean squared error (MSE) and the achievable sum-rate in the massive MIMO regime. The results indicate that while the MSE linearly increases with the calibration errors at the user side, the sum-rate is asymptotically independent of them. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed robust joint precoder/combiner outperforms the existing solutions while having the same order of complexity. Moreover, when the BS sends a quantized version of the combining coefficients to the users, it is observed that the proposed solution is more robust to the quantization errors than the existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {Quantum mechanics allows an information carrier to traverse through multiple trajectories of communication channels simultaneously, this leads us to quantum trajectories where alternative causal orders of communication channels being traversed are in a superposition, so that the relative orders of communication channels become indefinite. It has been shown that entanglement distribution process over quantum trajectory with an EPR pair being prepared by a sender enables quantum teleportation process to be heralded as a noiseless communication process with probability, the heralded result of which is unachievable in classical trajectory with a definite causal order of communication channels. In this work, we investigate the potential advantage of quantum trajectory on the generation of link-level entanglement, the basic element of quantum networks. To this aim, the performance of entanglement distribution process over multiple quantum trajectories where an EPR pair is prepared by a communication provider is analyzed. Besides, the application of entanglement purification protocol on quantum trajectory is first analyzed to reduce the effect of noise on link-level entanglement. The analysis shows that the link-level entanglement generated over quantum trajectory is more robust to long-distance quantum communication, with respect to classical trajectory, which paves the way for designing effective quantum networks.}

	abstract = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is widely used in some scenes with high requirements for information freshness. Due to the limited endurance of the UAV, especially in the scenes with large area and dense sensor nodes (SNs), it is difficult for one UAV to complete the data collection task under the condition of ensuring the freshness of SNs’ information. Therefore, multiple UAVs are required to cooperate to participate in data collection. In this paper, we study the multi-UAV assisted data collection problem to improve information freshness. We use the Age of Information (AoI) to measure the freshness of information, mainly including the SNs’ uploading time, the UAVs’ flight time and the data offloading time. The data collection problem is formulated to minimize the SNs’ peak AoI and average AoI in multi-UAV assisted wireless sensor networks. Since the problem is complex, we introduce a start-to-end strategy comprising of association and planning to minimize two SNs’ AoIs through an iterative three-step process. Firstly, the locations of data collection points (CPs) at which the UAVs hover to collect data and the SN-CP association are determined based on a density-based clustering algorithm. Secondly, the CPs are clustered to form CP clusters, and the CP-UAV association is established. Finally, based on the results of the above two steps, the flight trajectories of the UAVs are optimized by improved ant colony (ACO) algorithm subject to the limited endurance capability. The simulation results show the proposed strategy can optimize the peak-AoI and ave-AoI of SNs to improve the freshness of information.}

	abstract = {Channel-state-information-based localization in 5G networks has been a promising way to obtain highly accurate positions compared to previous communication networks. However, there is no unified and effective platform to support the research on 5G localization algorithms. This paper releases a link-level simulator for 5G localization, which can depict realistic physical behaviors of the 5G positioning signal transmission. Specifically, we first develop a simulation architecture considering more elaborate parameter configuration and physical-layer processing. The architecture supports the link modeling at sub-6GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands. Subsequently, the critical physical-layer components that determine the localization performance are designed and integrated. In particular, a lightweight new-radio channel model and hardware impairment functions that significantly limit the parameter estimation accuracy are developed. Finally, we present three application cases to evaluate the simulator, i.e. two-dimensional mobile terminal localization, mmWave beam sweeping, and beamforming-based angle estimation. The numerical results in the application cases present the performance diversity of localization algorithms in various impairment conditions.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of network and computer technologies, virtual cyberspace keeps evolving, and Metaverse is the main representative. As an irreplaceable technology that supports Metaverse, the sensing information transmission from the physical world to Metaverse is vital. Inspired by emerging semantic communication, in this paper, we propose a semantic transmission framework for transmitting sensing information from the physical world to Metaverse. Leveraging the in-depth understanding of sensing information, we define the semantic bases, through which the semantic encoding of sensing data is achieved for the first time. Consequently, the amount of sensing data that needs to be transmitted is dramatically reduced. Unlike conventional methods that undergo data degradation and require data recovery, our approach achieves the sensing goal without data recovery while maintaining performance. To further improve Metaverse service quality, we introduce contest theory to create an incentive mechanism that motivates users to upload data more frequently. Experimental results show that the average data amount after semantic encoding is reduced to about 27.87% of that before encoding, while ensuring the sensing performance. Additionally, the proposed contest theoretic based incentive mechanism increases the sum of data uploading frequency by 27.47% compared to the uniform award scheme.}

For the first time, this paper derives the ensemble weight distribution of the RMA scheme. We derive an upper bound on the decoding error performance of the RMA scheme under ML decoding in an AWGN channel with BPSK modulation. Using the derived bound as the fitness function, we adopt the continuous genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of the RMA scheme. Simulation results show the tightness of the derived bound and the superiority of the optimized degree distribution over the conventional degree distributions.}

	abstract = {WiFi fingerprint-based localization has been intensive studies as a promising technology of ubiquitous location-based services. Two main concerns for its wide spread applications are to tackle with the cumbersome efforts of site survey and to combat vulnerable environment changes. To address these issues comprehensively, we propose a novel approach on adaptive fingerprint-based localization with less site survey, named as LESS, by exploring a new paradigm of radio map construction and adaptation with few-shot relation learning. Firstly, we extend sparsely collected fingerprints with the fingerprint augmentation method which produces new related data and derives their location information based on local proximity property in a low-dimensional manifold space. Then, LESS designs deep relation networks to learn not only the appropriate features but also a transferable deep-distance metric for modeling the fundamental relationships of the neighborhood fingerprints. Finally, once trained, LESS can quickly establish the neighborhood relationships among new fingerprints in the changed surroundings to realize adaptive location estimations, even without the network updating. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that LESS can achieve an attractive trade-off between the system overhead and the location performance with the superiorities over others in dynamic indoor environments.}

	abstract = {To overcome the challenge of limited bandwidth, client selection has been considered an effective method for optimizing Federated Learning (FL). However, since the volatility of the learning environment, the available clients exhibit some volatility over the training process in terms of client population, client data, training status, and transmitting status, which greatly increases the difficulty of client selection. To find a practical solution, we explore a client selection problem in volatile federated learning (Volatile FL). Specifically, we first derive the convergence analysis for non-convex and strongly convex cases to illustrate the main factors affecting the convergence speed. Then, we introduce the client utility to quantify the client’s contribution to model training and discuss the key problems of client selection in Volatile FL. For an efficient settlement, we propose CU-CS, a Combinatorial Multi-Arm Bandit (C 2 MAB) based decision scheme for the proposed selection problem. Theoretically, we prove that the regret of CU-CS is strictly bounded by a finite constant, justifying its theoretical feasibility. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly boosts FL by speeding up model convergence, promoting model accuracy, and reducing energy consumption.}

Instead of free access to shared data, encrypted data trading will alleviate security and privacy concerns and provide an incentive for vehicle owners to share their data. The edge server needs to pay the price in data trading, and reputation management is a great method to help it trade with reliable and available vehicles. In this paper, we propose a multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based reputation management scheme, so the edge servers can select the high reputation vehicles for data trading, which can ensure the credibility and reliability of the data. The encryption scheme is applied to achieve the required transmission security level and defend the rights and interests of the edge server. On the other hand, implementing security measures will consume the computation and communication resources of the vehicles. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the revenue of vehicles in data trading under the constraints of time delay, energy consumption, and security level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and efficient for vehicle reputation management, data trading selection, and resource allocation.}

In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between the network maximum flow and coordination overhead under the service function chain (SFC) constraints. Specifically, we propose the group sparse joint VNFs deployment and flow routing strategy (GS-VNF-R) to strike the trade-off between the network maximum flow and coordination overhead. Although the GS-VNF-R scheme can be formulated as a convex problem, for a large-scale SIN, solving the GS-VNF-R problem by traditional convex optimizations imposes a heavy computation burden. In order to reduce the time complexity, we propose a novel optimal low-complexity block-successive upper-bound minimization method of multipliers based group sparse (BSUM-M-GS) algorithm, which can converge to the global optimal with much less complexity. Simulation results show that for some scenarios, 60% of active nodes can be saved by using the proposed GS-VNF-R scheme without any performance loss compared to the full cooperation scheme, which results in significant cooperation overhead reduction. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed BSUM-M-GS algorithm can significantly reduce the complexity to the extent of 7 orders of magnitude for some scenarios.}

	abstract = {Age of information (AoI) is an effective measure of the information freshness for wireless networked control systems (WNCSs). However, the AoI performance for a closed loop of WNCS with two-way delays has remained unexplored, especially in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. In this paper, we investigate the peak age of loop (PAoL) performances, including the average, variance and outage probability of PAoL, for WNCSs with FBL over fading channels. Their closed-form expressions are respectively derived regarding the blocklength and the maximum number of allowable transmissions. We prove that the average PAoL is less than the sum of the average peak AoI in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) due to the coupling between UL and DL. We also show that there is a tradeoff between the average PAoL and the variance/outage probability of PAoL. Based on the comprehensive performance analysis, we study a PAoL-oriented communication and control co-design with an adaptation scheme for transmission power, blocklength and the maximum number of allowable transmissions. Simulation results verify the correctness of the analytical results and show that the proposed PAoL-oriented scheme significantly outperforms the UL only and DL only optimization schemes, with an up to 8-fold reduction in the average control cost.}

	abstract = {A promising approach to reducing the energy consumption is to consider coarse quantization at the receiver. In this study, we investigate novel precoding techniques in space and time for bandlimited multiuser MIMO downlink channels with 1-bit quantization and oversampling at the receiver, considering zero-crossing modulation. The proposed time-instance zero-crossing modulation conveys the information into the time-instances of zero-crossings. Two design criteria for time-instance zero-crossing modulation are investigated, namely, the minimum distance to the decision threshold and the mean-square error between the received and the desired signal. The maximization of the minimum distance to the decision threshold can be formulated as a quadratically constraint quadratic program. As an alternative, an equivalent problem can be formulated based on power minimization, which reduces computational complexity. Departing from the conventional mean-square error based technique, a more sophisticated algorithm is developed, which implies active constellation extension in order to improve the performance at high SNR. The extended problem is solved with two approaches, namely by formulating the problem as a second-order cone program and by considering an alternating optimization algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed time-instance zero-crossing precoding methods significantly improve the bit error rate compared to the state-of-the-art methods.}

In this paper, we introduce Fed-MADRL by incorporating federated learning (FL) and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to design a collaborative DSA strategy. Our Fed-MADRL scheme employs FL to enable multiple users to collaboratively optimize the system goal without sharing their training data. By keeping all the training data at the user end, FL improves the communication efficiency and strengthens user data privacy. To further reduce the communication overheads, each user only shares quantized information. We provide the convergence analysis to characterize the trade-off between the communication efficiency and the system performance. In particular, we show that the introduced method converges at a rate\nO(1/\nK\n1/4\n)\n, where\nK\nis the number of FL iterations. To the best of our knowledge, Fed-MADRL is the first work that utilizes FL in DSA networks under quantized communication. Performance evaluation results show that the introduced Fed-MADRL method outperforms the independent learning method and achieves comparable performance with the centralized MADRL method, which requires much higher communication overheads.}

	abstract = {By moving to millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, base stations (BSs) will be densely deployed to provide seamless coverage in sixth generation (6G) mobile communication systems, which, unfortunately, leads to severe cell-edge problem. In addition, with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays employed at BSs, the beamspace channel is sparse for each user, and thus there is no need to serve all the users in a cell by all the beams therein jointly. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop a flexible clustered cell-free networking scheme that can decompose the whole network into a number of weakly interfered small subnetworks operating independently and in parallel. Given a per-user rate constraint for service quality guarantee, this paper aims to maximize the number of decomposed subnetworks so as to reduce the signaling overhead and system complexity as much as possible. By formulating it as a bipartite graph partitioning problem, a rate-constrained network decomposition (RC-NetDecomp) algorithm is proposed, which can smoothly tune the network structure from the current cellular network with simple beam allocation to a fully cooperative network by increasing the required per-user rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RC-NetDecomp algorithm outperforms existing baselines in terms of average per-user rate, fairness among users and energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a phase-shift coupled simultaneous transmitting/refracting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided uplink (UL) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) system is investigated to achieve improved spectral efficiency. The considered UL RSMA system splits the rate for each user by dividing their message into multiple sub-messages and these sub-messages are transmitted to the base station (BS) via STAR-RIS as direct link between BS and user is absent. In particular, we formulate a resource allocation design problem which aim to maximize the overall rate-throughput of the considered system under the joint optimization of power allocation, decoding order, user-fairness and beamforming design at STAR-RIS for various operating modes of STAR-RIS modes, which is mixed- integer non-linear programming (MINLP). To solve the formulated non-convex complex problem, we first transform the original sum-rate maximization into its simplified form and then solved it using an alternating optimization algorithm where the sub-problems of power allocation and beamforming design under given decoding order are solved alternatively using general convex approximation and fractional programming approaches. Numerical simulation and computational complexity analysis validate that the proposed solution attains fast convergence. Moreover, the proposed RSMA scheme in STAR-RIS aided UL system outperforms the conventional nonorthogonal multiple access and orthogonal multiple access schemes in terms of overall rate-throughput and user-fairness.}

	abstract = {To support the unprecedented growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, tremendous data need to be collected by the IoT devices and delivered to the server for further computation. By utilizing the same signals for both radar sensing and data transmission, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique enables simultaneous data collection and delivery in the physical layer. By exploiting the analog-wave addition property in a multi-access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been proposed as a communication approach that also enables function computation. The promising performances of ISAC and AirComp motivate the current work on developing a framework called integrated sensing, communication, and computation over-the-air (ISCCO). Two schemes are designed to support multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) ISCCO simultaneously, namely the separated and shared schemes. The separated scheme splits antenna array for radar sensing and AirComp, while all the antennas transmit a joint waveform for both radar sensing and AirComp in the shared scheme. The performance of radar sensing is evaluated by the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated target response matrix, while the MSE of the estimated function is adopted as the metric to evaluate the performance of the coupled communication and computation in AirComp. The design challenge of MIMO ISCCO lies in the joint optimization of beamformers at both the IoT devices and the server, which results in a non-convex problem. To solve this problem, an algorithmic solution based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation is proposed. The results reveal that the beamformer at each sensor needs to account for supporting dual-functional signals in the shared scheme, while dedicated beamformers for sensing and AirComp are needed to mitigate the mutual interference between the two functionalities in the separated scheme. The application of ISCCO on target location estimation is further demonstrated via simulation.}

The proposed scheme enables the users to transmit with the same codeword length but different coding rates under diverse user channel conditions. First, we propose the row-combining (RC) method and row-extending (RE) method to design practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) channel codes for rate-diverse GMAC. Second, we develop an iterative rate-diverse joint user messages decoding (RDJD) algorithm for GMAC, where all user messages are decoded with a single parity-check matrix. In contrast to the conventional network-coded multiple access (NCMA) and compute-forward multiple access (CFMA) schemes that first recover a linear combination of the transmitted codewords and then decode both user messages, this work can decode both the user messages simultaneously. Extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and simulation results indicate that RDJD can achieve gains up to 1.0 dB over NCMA and CFMA in the two-user GMAC. In particular, we show that there exists an optimal rate allocation for the two users to achieve the best decoding performance given the channel conditions and sum rate.}

	abstract = {As a promising technology in the 5G era, the artificial intelligence (AI) enabled Internet of controllable things (IoCT) is expected to be an integral part of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in the future. However, the realization of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in IoCT communications underlaid HetNet has stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements, resulting in unprecedented challenges for existing wireless resource allocation methods. In this paper, we first describe a cellular HetNet model with uplink IoCT communications, then formulate a dynamic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) resource allocation problem for maximizing the long-term average energy efficiency under URLLC requirements including reliability, latency, and transmission rate. To solve the problem, we propose a decentralized MADRL-based resource allocation algorithm with a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (dec-POMDP) and a mixed-centralized-decentralized (MCD) framework to address the partial observability and the scalability issues, respectively. In addition, we design a reward function featuring the objective decomposition, baseline-guided scaling, and QoS violation penalty so that the agents are coordinated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the convergence, scalability, and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms conventional resource allocation methods and different agent communication mechanisms in terms of maximizing energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {Due to the agile maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great promise for on-demand communications in the next-generation wireless networks. Considering the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, this paper proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) beam domain channel model (BDCM) for UAV communications. Through dividing the large antenna array into several sub-arrays and classifying multipath components as near-field and far-field components, the proposed BDCM takes the spherical wave front (SWF) and array non-stationarity into account. Channel statistical properties including spatial-temporal-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), root-mean-squared (RMS) Doppler spread, beam spread, channel matrix collinearity (CMC), and stationary time interval are derived and simulated for the proposed BDCM. Influences of SFW and non-stationary properties on the statistical properties and system performance are analyzed. Simulation results show that, compared with the equivalent geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM), the proposed BDCM has better temporal correlation, while BDCM and GBSM are equivalent in the system performance evaluation. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed BDCM is evaluated in terms of accuracy, complexity, and pervasiveness. The results show that the proposed BDCM can represent massive MIMO channel properties accurately with low complexity and good compatibility.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is an emerging paradigm for accurate channel estimation for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless communication systems. It has been proven to be a promising way to achieve better channel estimation performance for the IRS-aided wireless communication system than traditional methods (e.g., least-square algorithm). However, existing DL-based methods rely on ground truth (labels of the true channels) which is difficult to obtain in real networks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for the IRS channel estimation problem. No ground truth channel is needed in the training, while a simple and novel self-supervised denoising formula without a clean reference signal is presented. Particularly, in the training phase, the self-supervised signal and the input are the received signal vector and its noisy version, respectively. While in the inference phase the input is the estimated channel by using the least-square method and the output is the refined channel estimation. That is, our neural network-based channel estimation algorithm is not reciprocal for training and testing. We demonstrate that the proposed SSL solution has good convergence performance and generalization ability through numerical simulations. Interestingly, we find a “double descent” phenomenon in the learning curve during the test phase, i.e., when we gradually increase the number of training epochs, the performance first gets better, then becomes worse, and further gets better again. Besides, we propose to analyze SSL using the loss landscape and centered kernel alignment method. The results show that the self-supervised model has a similar loss landscape and representational similarity to the supervised model. We explored the effects of different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different neural network sizes, and different training data volumes on our algorithm through numerical simulations. Extensive numerical simulation results show that our SSL algorithm is still competitive without ground truth. We also show that the developed scheme exhibits robustness to SNR ratio mismatch.}

Next, assuming only passive self-interference cancellation at the FD relay, we derive the achievable data rate of a system comprised of a source, the proposed FD relay, and a destination. We then compare the achievable data rate of the proposed FD relaying system with the achievable data rate of the same system but with the FD relay replaced by an ideal passive RIS. Our results show that the proposed relaying system with 2-bit quantized analog phase shifters significantly outperforms the RIS-assisted system. In fact, the performance gains are so large, at least for small to intermediate numbers of antenna elements, that we believe it makes this result of interest to the wireless community. The proposed FD relay can also be built with reconfigurable holographic surfaces, one surface for the transmit-side and one for the receive-side. For such a scenario, we derive the energy efficiency of the relay-assisted system and compare it with the RIS-assisted system. Our numerical results show that the energy efficiency of the relay-assisted system built with reconfigurable holographic surfaces is significantly higher than the energy efficiency of the RIS-assisted system. Intuitively, the RIS system is at a disadvantage since there the total transmit power P_{T}\nis used entirely by the source, whereas in the FD relaying system the total transmit power P_{T}\nis shared by the source and the FD relay in addition to the noise-cleansing process performed by the decode-and-forwarding at the FD relay.}

	abstract = {Mixed numerology has been adopted in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based physical layer of 5G new radio (NR) to serve diverse use cases and services. Since the subcarriers of different numerologies have different bandwidths and symbol durations, they interfere with each other despite being centered at different frequencies. We analyze the inter-numerology interference (INI) encountered by these systems in wideband time-varying channels in the presence of phase noise. We derive novel expressions for the fading-averaged INI power at each subcarrier as a function of the channel’s power delay profile. These lead to insightful, tight bounds for the bandwidth-averaged INI power, which bring out the combined impact of Doppler spread and phase noise. Our comprehensive approach applies to the entire family of numerologies of 5G NR, and accounts for partial subcarrier loading, guard bands, and non-line-of-sight and line-of-sight channels. Our results show that INI affects high-rate modulation and coding schemes (MCSs). To mitigate its impact, we propose a novel statistical square root power allocation scheme that exploits the variation in the average INI powers across the subcarriers. It achieves a lower block error rate than uniform power allocation, which is used in 5G NR.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication is a newly emerged communication paradigm that exploits deep learning (DL) models to realize communication processes like source coding and channel coding. Recent advances have demonstrated that DL-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) can achieve exciting data compression and noise-resiliency performances for wireless image transmission tasks, especially in environments with low channel signal-to-noises (SNRs). However, existing DeepJSCC-based semantic communication frameworks still cannot achieve adaptive code rates for different channel SNRs and image contents, which reduces its flexibility and bandwidth efficiency. In this paper, we propose a predictive and adaptive deep coding (PADC) framework for realizing flexible code rate optimization with a given target transmission quality requirement. PADC is realized by a variable code length enabled DeepJSCC (DeepJSCC-V) model for realizing flexible code length adjustment, an Oracle Network (OraNet) model for predicting peak-signal-to-noise (PSNR) value for an image transmission task according to its contents, channel signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the compression ratio (CR) value, and a CR optimizer aims at finding the minimal data-level or instance-level CR with a PSNR quality constraint. By using the above three modules, PADC can transmit the image data with minimal CR, which greatly increases bandwidth efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DeepJSCC-V model can achieve similar PSNR performances compared with the state-of-the-art Attention-based DeepJSCC (ADJSCC) model, and the proposed OraNet model is able to predict high-quality PSNR values with an average error lower than 0.5dB. Results also demonstrate that the proposed PADC can use nearly minimal bandwidth consumption for wireless image transmission tasks with different channel SNR and image contents, at the same time guaranteeing the PSNR constraint for each image data.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) composed of a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements has attracted significant attention from communication communities because of its ability to substantially improve the communication performance. In this paper, the aperture area and radiation pattern of the IRS reflecting elements are considered, and a novel geometry-based three-dimensional (3-D) wideband channel model is proposed for IRS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems. In the proposed model, the reflection phase is designed by jointly considering the aperture area of the IRS reflecting element and the propagation phases among UAV, IRS, and receiver (Rx), each IRS reflecting element is modeled as an anomalous reflector instead of a specular reflector, and large-scale IRS reflecting elements can jointly beamform the signal in a desired direction. Based on the proposed model, the effects of arbitrary trajectory of UAV and the number and the size of passive reflecting elements on channel statistical characteristics are considered, and the average received signal power and the ergodic sum capacity, which consider the impacts of the number and the size of passive reflecting elements, are also investigated. Furthermore, the path loss of the IRS-assisted link, which is in inverse proportion to the square of aperture area of IRS reflecting elements, is derived, and it coincides with the measured results in real outdoor scenarios. Analysis shows that the communication performance can be enhanced by increasing the number and the size of IRS reflecting elements, and it is validated by numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulation results.}

	abstract = {In this article, we propose multiple machine learning (ML) based physical-layer receiver solutions for demodulating orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals that are subject to high level of nonlinear distortion. Specifically, three novel deep learning based convolutional neural network receivers are devised, containing layers in time- and/or frequency-domains, allowing to demodulate and decode the transmitted bits reliably despite the high error vector magnitude (EVM) in the transmit signal. Applicable training procedures are also described, such that the learned layers in the receiver processing properly generalize over different nonlinear distortion and multipath channel characteristics. Extensive set of numerical results is provided, in the context of 5G NR uplink (UL) incorporating also measured terminal power amplifier (PA) characteristics. The obtained results show that the proposed receiver systems are able to clearly outperform the classical linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) receiver as well as the existing ML receiver approaches, especially when the EVM is high compared to modulation order. This is particularly so when the devised ML receiver is of hybrid nature with layers both in time and frequency. The proposed ML receivers can thus facilitate pushing the terminal PA systems deeper into saturation, and thereon improve the terminal power-efficiency, radiated power and network coverage. Through combining the obtained radio link performance results with link budget calculations, all carried out at the 28GHz mmWave band, it is shown that the proposed ML receivers can enhance the network coverage in terms of maximum UL link distances by close to 100%, when compared to classical LMMSE receiver based networks.}

	abstract = {The energy consumption of the fifth generation (5G) of cellular technology is concerning for the mobile industry and the entire society. To minimize the environmental footprint and economic costs of 5G, it is necessary to adapt the transmission capabilities of networks to end-users’ quality of service requirements. In this paper, we focus on the carrier shutdown approach that enables a base station (BS) to autonomously switch off during low traffic periods, by transferring its load to neighbouring active BSs. More specifically, we propose a data-driven framework, constructed through real network measurements, which statistically characterizes the user equipment (UE) transfer across neighbouring BSs, when carrier shutdown operates. The implementation of this framework allows the 5G system to determine a poor load distribution due to energy saving mechanisms, prevent drastic reductions in UE performance, and ultimately estimate energy savings when activating carrier shutdown.}

	abstract = {We investigate the problem of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field localization of a user equipment (UE) served by a base station (BS) under phase-dependent amplitude variations at each RIS element. Through a misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis and a resulting lower bound (LB) on localization, we show that when the UE is unaware of amplitude variations (i.e., assumes unit-amplitude responses), severe performance penalties can arise, especially at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Leveraging Jacobi-Anger expansion to decouple range-azimuth-elevation dimensions, we develop a low-complexity approximated mismatched maximum likelihood (AMML) estimator, which is asymptotically tight to the LB. To mitigate performance loss due to model mismatch, we propose to jointly estimate the UE location and the RIS amplitude model parameters. The corresponding Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is derived, as well as an iterative refinement algorithm, which employs the AMML method as a subroutine and alternatingly updates individual parameters of the RIS amplitude model. Simulation results indicate fast convergence and performance close to the CRB. The proposed method can successfully recover the performance loss of the AMML under a wide range of RIS parameters and effectively calibrate the RIS amplitude model online with the help of a user that has an a-priori unknown location.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an attractive network in 6G communications that significantly increases the spectral efficiency. Operating in time-division duplex (TDD) mode, the downlink beamforming is achieved by the estimated uplink channel, which is equal to the downlink channel due to the property of channel reciprocity. However, the involvement of different radio frequency (RF) gains in transceiver antennas renders the whole channel non-reciprocal. Therefore, it is of great necessity to calibrate the bi-directional channel. In this paper, we focus on the issue of over-the-air channel calibration in cell-free system. Taking a toy scenario as an example, we examine the performance differences between the calibration methods of ‘Direct Process’ and ‘Indirect Process’. A novel low-cost calibration method based on spanning tree model is proposed specifically for this distributed AP scenario, where a calibration tree is established to calculate calibration coefficients. Numerical results manifest that higher accuracy of our method is achieved compared to the existing calibration methods in the literatures. Our method is less sensitive to the location of master AP compared to Argos, and practical applications under the impact of phase noise show the priority of our method compared to LS method.}

These systems usually consist of two main parts, {i}\n. {e}\n., a positioning network that learns the mapping from high-dimensional CSI to physical locations and a tracking system that utilizes historical CSI to reduce the positioning error. This paper presents a new localization system with high accuracy and generality. On the one hand, the receptive field of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-fingerprinting positioning networks is limited, restricting their performance as useful information in CSI is not explored thoroughly. As a solution, we propose a novel attention-augmented residual CNN to utilize the local information and global context in CSI exhaustively. On the other hand, considering the generality of a tracking system, we decouple the tracking system from the CSI environments so that one tracking system for all environments becomes possible. Specifically, we remodel the tracking problem as a denoising task and solve it with deep trajectory prior. Furthermore, we investigate how the precision difference of inertial measurement units will adversely affect the tracking performance and adopt plug-and-play to solve the precision difference problem. Experiments show the superiority of our methods over existing approaches in performance and generality improvement.}

Through careful relaxation procedures, we arrive at a suitable and novel optimization problem, which maximizes the radar output power in the Bartlett sense, under probabilistic outage signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio constraints. Theoretical analysis proves optimality of the solution given by the relaxed version of the problem, as well as closed-form solutions in certain scenarios.

	abstract = {A cognitive approach is proposed to detect unknown beacons of terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs). Two scenarios are considered in the paper: (i) detection of unknown beacons with integer constraints (IC) and (ii) detection of unknown beacons with no integer constraint (NIC). An example of beacons with IC is the pseudo-noise (PN) sequences in cellular code division multiple access (CDMA) signals. On the other hand, the reference signals (RSs) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based systems can be considered as beacons signals with NIC. Matched subspace detectors are proposed for both scenarios, and it is shown experimentally that the proposed matched subspace detectors are capable of detecting cellular third-generation (3G) cdma2000 signals and fifth-generation (5G) OFDM signals. A low complexity method is derived to simplify the matched subspace detector with IC for\nM\n-ary phase shift keying (\nM\nPSK) modulation. The effect of symbol errors in the estimated beacon signal on the carrier to noise ratio (CNR) is characterized analytically. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic probability of detection and false alarm are derived. Experimental results are presented showing an application of the proposed cognitive approach by enabling an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to detect and exploit terrestrial cellular signals for navigation purposes. In one experiment, the UAV achieved submeter-level accurate navigation over a trajectory of 1.72 km, by exploiting signals from four 3G cdma2000 transmitters. In another experiment, the UAV achieves a position root mean-squared error (RMSE) of 4.63 m over a trajectory of 416 m, by exploiting signals from two 5G transmitters.}

	abstract = {In cellular networks, the User Equipment (UE) often needs to send control information to the base station. For example, to initiate a connection, a UE transmits a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence on a channel called PRACH, where the sequence is randomly selected from up to 64 sequences. Also, a connected UE may send the Scheduling Request (SR) bit on a channel called PUCCH to start an uplink data transmission. In this paper, novel access methods, namely, ABF PRACH and ABF SR, are proposed based on the Analog Bloom Filter (ABF). With ABF PRACH, a UE transmits a pattern, which consists of multiple ZC sequences. The performance is improved, because the number of patterns, currently 2304, is much larger than the number of sequences, resulting in a much lower collision probability. Similarly, with ABF SR, each connected UE is assigned a unique pattern. The system capacity is improved, because the resource is shared by many UEs, instead of dedicated to individual UEs. Both ABF PRACH and ABF SR have been demonstrated in real-world experiments. Simulations show that ABF PRACH significantly outperforms the existing PRACH. Also, ABR SR achieves a 2.52-fold increase of capacity, while maintaining very low error ratios.}

Facing the explosively increasing number of multi-service devices, traditional industrial network technology is no longer applicable. The advent of the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks brings unprecedented possibilities for deploying the anticipated IIoT. To address the two main issues, i.e., connection density and multi-service requirements, in 5G empowered IIoT, we consider the non-orthogonal network slicing in this work. In particular, we jointly utilize network slicing to incorporate different types of services and exploit non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance the connection density. We formulate the connectivity maximization problem with joint sub-carrier association and power allocation as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To tackle the intractable MINLP, we first transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and then simplify the MILP into an integer linear programming (ILP) by developing a simple yet effective pairing guideline. In order to further reduce the computational complexity, we then propose the alternating selection best-effort pairing (AS-BEP) algorithm with low complexity to solve the ILP effectively. Our analyses are supplemented by comprehensive simulation results that illustrate the performance superiority of the proposed algorithms to the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Multi-station passive localization algorithms based on hybrid Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA) have been thoroughly studied. But it usually requires each station to obtain the AOA of the source and relies on the precise station position. These conditions are generally not satisfied in practical applications. In addition, the geometry between the source and these stations also affects the localization accuracy. This paper studies the passive source localization problem based on multi-station TDOA and single-station AOA measurements. First, we propose a closed-form solution source localization method based on multi-station TDOA and single-station AOA measurements, which requires only the reference station used to calculate TDOA to be able to observe the AOA measurements of the source. It solves the problem of hybrid localization of different numbers of TDOA and AOA measurements. Theoretical analysis proves that the performance of the proposed method can reach the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) under small noise conditions. Then, we model the relationship between the position of each station relative to the source and the localization accuracy. Through the D-optimality criterion, we obtain the optimal geometry between multiple stations and the source Simulation results confirm the validity of these theories.}

We assume that the workers do not have channel state information, hence the PS employs multiple antennas to alleviate the fading effects. Wireless channel variations result in inter-carrier interference, which has a detrimental effect on the performance of OFDM systems, especially when the channel is rapidly varying. We examine the effects of the channel time variations on the convergence of the FL with over-the-air aggregation, and show that the resulting undesired interference terms have only limited destructive effects, which do not prevent the convergence of the learning algorithm. We also validate our results via extensive simulations, which corroborate the theoretical expectations.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) backscatter based uplink coordinated transmission strategy for a radio cellular network, where IRS serves as a transmitter enabling uplink transmission from each user to the associated base station (BS). To be specific, the considered network is made up of multiple cells, each of which consists of one multi-antenna BS and its served users. While one multi-antenna power beacon (PB) is deployed to radiate energy-bearing electromagnetic wave, the radio signal received by each IRS is modulated to send its connective user’s information to the associated BS. Based on such a network framework, this paper aims to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) under the constraints of total transmit power and reflecting coefficient by joint optimization of active beamforming at the PB, passive beamforming at the IRSs and uplink user scheduling. To address this challenging problem, fractional programming (FP), alternative optimization and weighted bipartite matching are employed to convert the logarithm objective function into a more tractable form and to handle the optimization variables. The simulation results demonstrate the achievable WSR of the considered network.}

Transmit antenna selection (AS) harnesses the benefits of multiple antennas with a smaller number of radio frequency (RF) chains. We focus on joint optimization of antenna subset and transmit beamforming at the transmitter (Tx) and passive beamforming at the IRS to maximize the receive signal power. We derive a closed-form optimal AS rule for a Tx and receiver (Rx) equipped with single RF chain each and ideal IRS. We analyze its performance with a correlated channel model and then extend it to non-ideal IRS. We also propose a simpler rule that significantly reduces the number of computations and pilots. For an Rx that performs maximal ratio combining, we propose a manifold optimization algorithm and a low-complexity selection rule. For a Tx with multiple RF chains, we propose a subset selection algorithm that yields a locally optimal solution and an alternating optimization algorithm that reduces complexity. Our simulations study the impact of estimation errors, discrete phase shifts, and channel correlation on the proposed selection rules, which perform better than the existing AS rules. They also show that the proposed low-complexity rules are near-optimal.}

OFDM-based power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) is one of the promising approaches to achieve simultaneous connections of massive devices. Nevertheless, the problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is a major challenge, since power amplifier (PA) efficiency is a critical factor for IoT and D2D devices consisting of low-cost hardware components. This paper overcomes this problem by introducing time-frequency domain NOMA (TF-NOMA), where OFDM and DFT-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are superposed over the time-frequency domain. By utilizing the low PAPR property achieved by DFT-precoding, TF-NOMA can efficiently reduce the PAPR of the downlink signal transmitted by the base station (BS) as well as the uplink signals of the devices located far from BS. As a result, the proposed TF-NOMA can operate with higher PA efficiency than the conventional OFDM-based PD-NOMA. Furthermore, the insertion of DFT-precoding with the aim of PAPR reduction also enhances the error propagation resistance due to the resulting Gaussian mixture signal property. Throughout the mathematical analysis and computer simulations, we demonstrate that TF-NOMA achieves better error rate performance than the conventional PD-NOMA with significant improvement of PA efficiency.}

	abstract = {With the high flexibility of supporting resource-intensive and time-sensitive applications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed as an innovational paradigm to support the mobile users (MUs). As a promising technology, digital twin (DT) is capable of timely mapping the physical entities to virtual models, and reflecting the MEC network state in real-time. In this paper, we first propose an MEC network with multiple movable UAVs and one DT-empowered ground base station to enhance the MEC service for MUs. Considering the limited energy resource of both MUs and UAVs, we formulate an online problem of resource scheduling to minimize the weighted energy consumption of them. To tackle the difficulty of the combinational problem, we formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) with multiple types of agents. Since the proposed MDP has huge state space and action space, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with Beta distribution and attention mechanism to pursue the optimal computation offloading policy. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to efficiently reduce the energy consumption and outperforms the benchmarks in performance, convergence speed and utilization of resources.}

	abstract = {Carrier-free pulse-based waveforms are desired in terahertz (THz) communications since pulse-based systems have simpler transceiver architectures than carrier-based systems. For such a pulse-based THz communication system, there still lacks pulse waveforms that can support high-order modulation and flexible multiple access. In this paper, a pulse-based waveform with continuously tunable center frequencies and bandwidths is designed for carrier-free THz communications. More specifically, a Gaussian pulse is utilized as the basic pulse, and then the weighted sum of its high-order derivatives is used to generate waveforms with tunable frequencies and bandwidths according to the probability density function of Rice distribution. Such a pulse-based waveform is called frequency and bandwidth continuously tunable (FBCT) pulse. By making the derivative orders of all weighted terms odd or even, a pair of orthogonal FBCT pulses can be generated. Based on the pair of orthogonal FBCT pulses, a basic pulse-based\nM\n-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (\nPM\nQAM) scheme can be readily achieved. Moreover, with frequency and bandwidth tunability, FBCT pulse can support pulse division multiple access (PDMA) with tunable bandwidth, through which frequencies with high molecular absorption loss can be avoided. Numerical results demonstrate that FBCT pulse is significantly effective and flexible in supporting carrier-free THz communications.}

	abstract = {This work develops LoneSTAR, a novel enabler of full-duplex millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems through the design of analog beamforming codebooks. LoneSTAR codebooks deliver high beamforming gain and broad coverage while simultaneously reducing the self-interference coupled by transmit and receive beams at a full-duplex mmWave transceiver. Our design framework accomplishes this by tolerating some variability in transmit and receive beamforming gain to strategically shape beams that reject self-interference spatially while accounting for digitally-controlled analog beamforming networks and self-interference channel estimation error. By leveraging the coherence time of the self-interference channel, a mmWave system can use the same LoneSTAR design over many time slots to serve several downlink-uplink user pairs in a full-duplex fashion without the need for additional self-interference cancellation. Compared to those using conventional codebooks, full-duplex mmWave systems employing LoneSTAR codebooks can mitigate higher levels of self-interference, tolerate more cross-link interference, and demand lower SNRs in order to outperform half-duplex operation—all while supporting beam alignment. This makes LoneSTAR a potential standalone solution for enabling simultaneous transmission and reception in mmWave systems, from which it derives its name.}

We propose a cross-domain receiver for the considered OTFS-SCMA system which efficiently carries out OTFS symbol estimation and SCMA decoding in a joint manner. This is done by iteratively passing the extrinsic information between the time domain and the delay-Doppler (DD) domain via the corresponding unitary transformation to ensure the principal orthogonality of errors from each domain. We show that the proposed OTFS-SCMA detection algorithm exists at a fixed point in the state evolution when it converges. To further enhance the error performance of the proposed OTFS-SCMA system, we investigate the cooperation between downlink users to exploit the diversity gains and develop a distributed cooperative detection (DCD) algorithm with the aid of belief consensus. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm and show an increased spectral efficiency compared to the conventional OTFS transmission.}

In this paper, we consider optical IRS for improving the performance of visible light communication (VLC) under a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) setting, where the mean square error (MSE) of the IRS-aided MIMO VLC is minimized by jointly designing the IRS and transceiver signal processing. To this end, the MIMO channel gains of the IRS-aided VLC are first derived under the point source assumption, based on which the MSE minimization problem is formulated subject to the emission power constraints and the IRS configuration constraints. Next, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into three subproblems, to iteratively optimize the IRS configuration, the precoding and detection matrices for minimizing the MSE. Moreover, theoretical analysis on the performance of the proposed algorithm in high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes is investigated, revealing that the joint optimization process can be simplified in such special cases, and the algorithm’s convergence property and computational complexity are also discussed. Finally, numerical results show that IRS-aided schemes significantly reduce the MSE as compared to their counterparts without IRS, and the proposed algorithm outperforms other baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {With growing popularity of enormous public safety and transportation infrastructure cameras, there are increasing demands for automatic mobile video analytics. The emerging multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology has been recently applied to improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff of mobile video analytics. In this paper, we study an MEC-enabled multi-device video analytics system and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to meet two practical challenges: i) the absence of ground truth in real-time and ii) the content-varying degradation-accuracy relation. In particular, we aim to design an online joint frame degradation and bandwidth allocation algorithm with the time-varying function and limited feedback from each device. Thanks to the MDP formulation and\nn\n-step return technique, the long-term goal offers adaptive information gathering and thus improves the average accuracy and latency. For sample efficiency, we decompose the MDP problem into discrete degradation adaptation subproblems and continuous bandwidth allocation subproblems. Based on the decomposition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework, referred to as DBAG, to solve the decomposed subproblems. DBAG integrates model-based optimization and model-free DRL to solve the MDP problem with a discrete-continuous hybrid action space. Under various network setups and public datasets, DBAG greatly improves the accuracy-latency tradeoff.}

	abstract = {For fingerprint-based localization, the time-consuming and labor-intensive construction of offline radio map is the bottleneck which hinders its large-scale implementation. In this paper, we propose a radio map extrapolation and localization algorithm by exploiting the angles and delays of specular multipath components. First, using the concept of virtual anchor nodes (VANs), we calculate the virtual transmitter (VT) of each multipath component according to angle and delay information measured at a known point. By estimating the positions of reflector with these VTs, the angles and delays of the uplink multipath components transmitted at other locations in the indoor environment are extrapolated. Then, a channel fingerprint composed of the extrapolated angles and delays is proposed to represent the channel response in the angle-delay domain, which is spatially unique and discriminative. Thus, the radio map constructed such can significantly reduce the labor and time costs. Lastly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied for indoor localization. The performance of the proposed fingerprint extrapolation and localization method is validated through extensive simulations with a ray-tracing channel model, which exhibits promising localization performance for our proposed scheme with reduced construction costs.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the sixth generation (6G) communication systems, the extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) have attracted substantial attention in both academia and industry. As the array size increases, the so-called “near-field” effect, i.e. channel parameters varying with respect to the antenna’s position becomes evident. Conventional channel models fail to describe such effects as the parameters of multi-path components (MPCs) specified in these models are fixed regardless of array configuration. Due to the mismatch between the constant MPC assumption and the actual variant behavior observed, the parameterization of the models aiming to describe the spatial non-stationary channels cannot be conducted effectively. In order to mitigate the model mismatch and reproduce the channels with spatial non-stationarity specifically for ELAA applications, in this work, a novel measurement-based stochastic channel modeling method is proposed and applied to establishing Scatterer-based Spatial Channel Model (SSCM) that can be used to unify the far- and near-field models using spherical wave and generate the spatial non-stationary channels for ELAAs by integrating the traditional spatial channel model (SCM) with “clusters-of-scatterers (CoS)”. To establish the models based on measurements, the locations of first- and last-hop scatterers existing along propagation paths in a channel are estimated based on the spherical-wave assumption. A novel clustering algorithm is used to group the MPCs taking into account those scatterers’ locations. With a channel measurement campaign conducted using a\n32×32\nRx planar antenna array at carrier frequency of 10 GHz, exemplary SSCMs are established. The SSCM is capable of reproducing the parts of the environment influencing wave propagation, and therefore can be used for the research of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications.}

The importance of these channel norm based energy detection (CNBED) receivers is that they achieve the same diversity order as that of a coherent receiver. Furthermore, their performance degradation when compared to a coherent receiver can be made sufficiently low by appropriate choice of parameters. Due to their performance and the low complexity of energy detection, the CNBED techniques have potential applications to internet of things. Analysis of the CNBED receivers is performed for multi-level amplitude-shift keying (ASK). For the optimum receiver, an analytical approximation of the symbol error probability (SEP) as a sum of univariate integrals involving averaging of Gaussian\nQ\n-functions is derived. For the suboptimum receiver, closed form expressions for the exact SEP and for the approximate SEP under the condition of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are obtained; in addition, using asymptotic approximations, expressions for the optimal ASK transmit levels with high SNR and large number of receive diversity branches, that minimize the SEP subject to an energy constraint, are found. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the receivers.}

	abstract = {In the conventional sense, a passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is perceived as an ideal phase shifter to the incident signal. It is assumed that the phase of the incident signal can be altered to any desired value without affecting its magnitude. In this paper, we question the veracity of this assumption which forms the basis for the communication model that is widely used in the scientific community. Although there exist rigorous electromagnetic (EM) based models to analyze and design metasurfaces, the same cannot be said about its successor, intelligent reflecting surface. Therefore, we attempt to present an EM-based model that accurately describes intelligent scattering by any arbitrary-shaped IRS. Our objective in this paper is to bridge the gap between the fundamental EM formulation for an IRS and the communication model that accurately captures its functioning. We use Method-of-Moments (MoM), a computational electromagnetic approach to quantify the intelligent scattering by an arbitrary-shaped IRS. The proposed theoretical model is then validated with computational EM simulation in Feko. We then adopt the general MoM-based model for a special case where each IRS element is a center-loaded wire. Closed-form expressions for pathloss and beamwidth are derived considering free space propagation. We show analytically and numerically, that the received power predicted by the conventional model vs. what is observed through computational EM simulations can differ by 6 dB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the impact of optimizing an IRS using the conventional model, where each element is treated as an ideal passive phase shifter, can result in an additional\n6−8\ndB of power loss. As a final remark, we propose correction to the communication model that is currently used for IRS-aided networks when each IRS element is a center-loaded wire.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output can provide performance gains over traditional MIMO by reshaping the channels, i.e., introducing more channel realizations. In this paper, we focus on the achievable rate maximization pattern design for reconfigurable MIMO systems. Firstly, we introduce the matrix representation of pattern reconfigurable MIMO (PR-MIMO), based on which a pattern design problem is formulated. To further reveal the effect of the radiation pattern on the wireless channel, we consider pattern design for both the single-pattern case where the optimized radiation pattern is the same for all the antenna elements, and the multi-pattern case where different antenna elements can adopt different radiation patterns. For the single-pattern case, we show that the pattern design is equivalent to a redistribution of gains among all scattering paths, and an eigenvalue optimization based solution is obtained. For the multi-pattern case, we propose a sequential optimization framework with manifold optimization and eigenvalue decomposition to obtain near-optimal solutions. Numerical results validate the superiority of PR-MIMO systems over traditional MIMO in terms of achievable rate, and also show the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of various services in wireless communications, spectrum resource has become increasingly valuable. Faster than Nyquist (FTN) signaling, proposed in the 1970s, is a promising paradigm for improving spectrum utilization. This paper proposes the variable-packing-ratio (VPR)-based transmissions for high spectrum efficiency (SE) and security, respectively. Aided by deep learning (DL)-based estimation, the proposed scheme for high SE can achieve a higher capacity than the conventional Nyquist-criterion transmission with negligible modification to existing communication paradigms (e.g., spectrum allocation or frame structure). More importantly, for VPR-based secure transmission, a dynamic generation scheme is proposed to produce randomly distributed positions to switch the packing ratio, which can effectively avoid detections and attacks. In addition, we propose a simplified DL-based packing ratio estimation for both of these two scenarios so that the receiver can estimate the packing ratio without any in-band or out-band control messages. Simulation results show that the proposed simplified estimation achieves nearly the same accuracy and convergence speed as the original multi-branch fully-connected structure with a complexity reduction of 20 folds. Finally, we derive the SE of the proposed VPR transmission under different channels.

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology in next generation wireless communication. However, the increasing number of radio frequency (RF) chains results in higher cost and power consumption. Given that hundreds or even thousands of transmit antennas are equipped at the base station (BS), low resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are preferred to reduce the power consumption on both DACs and power amplifiers (PAs). Currently, there have been some studies about the application of low-resolution DACs for single-carrier systems. For multi-carrier systems, this problem hasn’t been fully investigated. This paper aims to design a 1-bit downlink precoding algorithm for massive multi-user MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. A nonlinear precoding algorithm is proposed, which can address the non-convex optimization problem with discrete output constraint and guarantee convergence. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm factors in the different path-losses experienced by different users. Furthermore, some approximation schemes can be applied to bring down the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm further. Simulation results illustrate that our algorithm performs the best among other nonlinear precoding methods in OFDM systems.}

By introducing an unobservable semantic source, we extend the classical results by Csiszar to semantic-aware communication systems. Both upper and lower bounds of the exponent for the discrete memoryless source-channel pair are established. Moreover, an extended achievable bound of the excess distortion exponent for MIMO systems is derived. Further analysis explores how the block fading and numbers of antennas influence the exponent of semantic-aware MIMO systems.

	abstract = {Cognitive radio (CR) is one of the most disruptive techniques for enabling the next generation wireless communication networks due to its potential in improving the spectral efficiency. In this paper, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is exploited to enhance both the accuracy of spectrum sensing and the secondary transmission in a CR network (CRN) employing the opportunistic spectrum access. A novel detection threshold based on the probability of false alarm is derived for improving the spectrum sensing performance. The average achievable rate of the secondary network is maximized under both the two-stage and one-stage IRS phase shifts case. To tackle the challenging non-convex optimization problem under the two-stage case, a computationally efficient block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm is proposed coputilizing the techniques of successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Moreover, a BCD method and a tractable approximation of the probability of detection are exploited to tackle the problem under one-stage IRS phase shifts case. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed designs are superior to the benchmark schemes in terms of the achievable rate and the sensing performance, and IRS can greatly improve the spectral efficiency of the CRN.}

For better spectral efficiency, we investigate the use of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) in such networks and focus on joint optimization of RSMA parameters, 3D-coordinates of the UAV/RIS, and phase shift matrix at the RIS along with analyzing the outage probability, block error rate (BLER) and achievable weighted sum rate for finite blocklength (FBL) and infinite blocklength (IBL) codes under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at each user and residual-self interference (RSI) at the UAV. We first formulate the weighted sum rate maximization problem and adopt the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to deal with the non-convex nature of the problem. Thereafter, we propose a BCD-based algorithm that jointly optimizes these parameters using a heuristic approach for optimum power allocation, a Riemannian conjugate gradient-based algorithm to get the optimal phase shift at the RIS, and an iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal UAV/RIS position. It also distributes the common rate among the users optimally. Next, with obtained optimal parameters, we further analyze the performance of the network and derive the closed-form expressions of BLER, outage probability, and average weighted sum rate. We present Monte Carlo simulation-based results to validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithms and derived expressions, and demonstrate the superiority of RSMA over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technique to control wireless propagation environment for enhancing the communication performance cost-effectively. However, the rapidly time-varying channel in high-mobility communication scenarios such as vehicular communication renders it challenging to obtain the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) efficiently for IRS with a large number of reflecting elements. In this paper, we propose a new roadside IRS-aided vehicular communication system to tackle this challenge. Specifically, by exploiting the symmetrical deployment of IRSs with inter-laced equal intervals on both sides of the road and the cooperation among nearby IRS controllers, we propose a new two-stage channel estimation scheme with off-line and online training, respectively, to obtain the static/time-varying CSI required by the proposed low-complexity passive beamforming scheme efficiently. The proposed IRS beamforming and online channel estimation designs leverage the existing uplink pilots in wireless networks and do not require any change of the existing transmission protocol. Moreover, they can be implemented by each of IRS controllers independently, without the need of any real-time feedback from the user’s serving BS. Simulation results show that the proposed designs can efficiently achieve the high IRS passive beamforming gain and thus significantly enhance the achievable communication throughput for high-speed vehicular communications.}

	abstract = {Sub-terahertz (sub-THz, 100–300 GHz) communications promise to bring extraordinary rates in future 6G systems. High path loss and blockage effects will limit the coverage of base stations (BS) to a few hundred meters making deployment of such systems along the roads expensive. As a way to decrease the BS density, relaying has been proposed. However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation is characterized by different sets of communications paths depending on the antenna locations raising the question of their optimal positions. In this paper, by utilizing IEEE 802.15.3d parameters and 300 GHz propagation measurements, we develop a mathematical framework for comparison of multi-hop relaying systems with different antenna locations. We utilize coverage, BS availability, and the data rate over a multi-hop path as metrics of interest. Our results show that the windshield location is characterized by lower data rates and larger coverage while bumper and engine levels are similar in terms of these metrics. For the windshield location, the coverage is extended by 50% with BS availability 0.95. The windshield location is recommended as it is less sensitive to the technology penetration rate and is characterized by larger coverage. The proposed approach shows gains of up to 32% in terms of required BS density for the range of vehicles density (10-40 units/km).}

	abstract = {With the rapid expansion of the scale of deployed low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the ultra-dense LEO satellite-terrestrial integrated network (LTIN) is envisioned as a promising architecture in the sixth-generation (6G) system to implement seamless connectivity and high-speed data rate service. Especially for ultra-remote real-time services with long transmission distance and high delay requirements, the integrated network can guarantee its end-to-end service continuity. However, many challenges have been posed to the efficient resource orchestration for the service delivery, owing to the large scale, heterogeneity and high mobility of the integrated network. For each service, its data needs to go through a series of on-board processing, before being downloaded to the terrestrial network for further applications. To this end, service function chain (SFC), an ordered concatenation of network functions (NFs), is introduced to support service provision. By allocating the constituent NFs over the LTIN, we propose an efficient multiple service delivery scheme to minimize the overall delivery completion latency, while taking into account resource sharing and competition among multiple SFCs. First, we formulate the multiple SFC embedding problem as a noncooperative game that is further proved as the weighted potential game with at least one Nash equilibrium (NE). With the help of the proposed global coordination mechanism, we design two algorithms to obtain the NE. One is the best response (BR) algorithm with faster convergence, while the other is adaptive play (AP) algorithm with more capacity for best solutions. Then, the stochastic learning (SL) algorithm is proposed to adapt to network dynamics and reduce global information exchange. Finally, extensive simulations validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of providing channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter in multi-user “massive” MIMO systems operating in frequency division duplexing (FDD). The wideband MIMO channel is a vector-valued random process correlated in time, space (antennas), and frequency (subcarriers). The base station (BS) broadcasts periodically $\\beta _{\\mathrm{ tr}}$ pilot symbols from its $M$ antenna ports to $K$ single-antenna users (UEs). Correspondingly, the $K$ UEs send feedback messages about their channel state using $\\beta _{\\mathrm{ fb}}$ symbols in the uplink (UL). Using results from remote rate-distortion theory, we show that, as ${\\sf snr}\\to \\infty $ , the optimal feedback strategy achieves a channel state estimation mean squared error (MSE) that behaves as $\\Theta {(}1)$ if $\\beta _{\\mathrm{ tr}} < r$ and as $\\Theta \\left ({{\\sf snr}^{-\\alpha }}\\right)$ when $\\beta _{\\mathrm{ tr}} \\ge r$ , where $\\alpha = \\min (\\beta _{\\mathrm{ fb}}/r, 1)$ , where $r$ is the rank of the channel covariance matrix. The MSE-optimal rate-distortion strategy implies encoding of long sequences of channel states, which would yield completely stale CSI and therefore poor multiuser precoding performance. Hence, we consider three practical “one-shot” CSI strategies with minimum one-slot delay and analyze their large-SNR channel estimation MSE behavior. These are: (1) digital feedback via entropy-coded scalar quantization (ECSQ), (2) analog feedback (AF), and (3) local channel estimation at the UEs via compressed sensing and digital feedback. These schemes have different requirements in terms of knowledge of the channel statistics at the UE and at the BS. In particular, the latter strategy requires no statistical knowledge and is closely inspired by a CSI feedback scheme currently proposed in 3GPP standardization. It is shown that ECSQ achieves optimal MSE at the price of a slight increase in feedback rate which vanishes for large SNR. AF achieves the optimal MSE decay rate of $\\Theta ({\\sf snr}^{-1})$ whenever $\\beta _{\\mathrm{ tr}},\\beta _{\\mathrm{ fb}} \\ge r$ but is sub-optimal if $\\beta \\ge r$ and $\\beta _{\\mathrm{ fb}} < r$ . The 3GPP-inspired scheme is shown, via numerical simulations, to achieves performance similar to ECSQ and AF when the multipath channel is sufficiently sparse in the angle-delay domain, but suffers from a large performance gap if this requirement is not met.}

	abstract = {Automatic modulation identification (AMI) is a technique to detect the modulation type and order of a received signal, which has the potential to enhance cognitive radio capabilities for future generations of communication devices. However, AMI classifiers traditionally have exhibited low efficiency in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. Hence, to address this problem we present our novel Gated Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN) classifier for feature-based AMI. This architecture includes a robust feature extraction stage to extract deep correlative patterns about the received symbols. Not only does this feature extraction stage use the temporal characteristics of the received symbols, but it also takes advantage of embedded signaling features from the received signal. In the proposed classifier, the received constellations are treated as a graph, allowing it to outperform state-of-the-art classifiers due to its strong performance in graph classification. This is observed clearly in the visualization of the extracted features, even for high-order modulation schemes. In this paper, we present our systematic research conducted for maximizing the efficiency obtainable by our classifier. Extensive simulation results demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement of 18.44 percentage points, and an efficiency increase by 60.78% for our GGCNN-AMI classifier compared to state-of-the-art classifiers in low-SNR environments.}

Spatial CCM is essential for two-timescale beamforming in IRS-assisted systems; however, estimating the spatial CCM is challenging due to the passive nature of reflecting elements and the large size of the CCM resulting from massive reflecting elements of the IRS. In this paper, we propose a CCM estimation method by exploiting the low-rankness as well as the positive semi-definite (PSD) 3-level Toeplitz structure of the CCM. Estimation of the CCM is formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is developed. Our analysis shows that the proposed method is theoretically guaranteed to attain a reliable CCM estimate with a sample complexity much smaller than the dimension of the CCM. Thus the proposed method can help achieve a significant training overhead reduction. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the performance of two-timescale beamforming scheme based on the estimated CCM.}

	abstract = {In next-generation wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are foreseeable to support a large number of antennas at the transceiver as well as a large number of reflecting elements at the RIS. To fully unleash the potential of RIS, the phase shifts of RIS elements should be carefully designed, resulting in a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem that is hard to solve with affordable computational complexity. In this paper, we address this scalability issue by partitioning RIS into sub-surfaces, so as to optimize the phase shifts in sub-surface levels to reduce complexity. Specifically, each sub-surface employs a linear phase variation structure to anomalously reflect the incident signal to a desired direction, and the sizes of sub-surfaces can be adaptively adjusted according to channel conditions. We formulate the achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Under the RIS partitioning framework, the RIS phase shifts optimization reduces to the manipulation of the sub-surface sizes, the phase gradients of sub-surfaces, as well as the common phase shifts of sub-surfaces. Then, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the system with an infinitely large number of transceiver antennas and RIS elements. The asymptotic analysis provides useful insights on the understanding of the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoff in RIS partitioning design. We show that in the asymptotic domain, the achievable rate maximization problem has a rather simple form with an explicit physical meaning of optimization variables. We develop an efficient algorithm to find an approximately optimal solution to the asymptotic problem via a one-dimensional (1D) grid search. Moreover, we discuss the insights and impacts of the asymptotic result on finite-size system design. By applying the asymptotic result to a finite-size system with necessary modifications, we show by numerical results that the proposed design achieves a favorable tradeoff between system performance and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the performance of multi-antenna proactive eavesdropping in 5G uplink systems with spatially correlated Rayleigh fadings, where the base station (BS) serves an illegal user and a multi-antenna legitimate monitor eavesdrops the suspicious link with the help of jamming attack. Based on a practical assumption of channel state information (CSI) in 5G uplink, i.e., imperfect instantaneous CSI of the suspicious link at the BS and that of eavesdropping link at the monitor, and only jamming channel statistics at the monitor, we first give a statistical jamming beamforming design. Then, semi-closed form expressions of eavesdropping non-outage probability and relative average eavesdropping rate are, respectively, derived for delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant scenarios. Via reasonable approximations and asymptotic analysis, we gain many insights on the effect of key system parameters, e.g., location-dependent channel path loss and angular spread, jamming energy and the number of antennas. Further, we provide the optimal energy allocation between pilot and data jamming and the optimal antenna allocation between jamming and eavesdropping under total energy constraint and total antenna number, respectively, which are both explicit functions of system parameters. Finally, simulation results validate our analytical results.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air federated learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving edge artificial intelligence paradigm, where over-the-air computation enables spectral-efficient model aggregation by achieving simultaneous communication and aggregation. However, due to limited transmit power, the performance of over-the-air FL is limited by the device with the worst channel condition toward the edge server. In this paper, we leverage reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to mitigate the communication bottleneck of over-the-air FL and explicitly characterize the corresponding convergence upper bound. The convergence analysis illustrates the detrimental impact of the accumulated aggregation error over all rounds and inspires us to formulate a time-average transmission distortion minimization problem by jointly optimizing the transceiver and RIS phase-shifts. To reduce the computation complexity and enhance the model aggregation accuracy, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) based learning algorithm to directly map channel coefficients to the optimized network parameters. By exploiting permutation equivalence and invariance properties of graphs, the parameter dimension of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of edge devices, which reduces the computational complexity and improves the algorithmic scalability. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm speeds up the computation by three orders of magnitude compared to the baselines, while achieving performance superiority and algorithmic robustness.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel channel-aware latency taming scheme, called Optimal Transmission Latency Taming (OTLT), to detect hidden channel state and tame the distribution tail of the packet sojourn time in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. Specifically, we design a forward algorithm based on a hidden semi-Markov model to detect the hidden channel state, with a particular emphasis on the state sojourn duration, and to calculate the corresponding channel access probability. Then we develop a time-sensitive model to investigate the minimum sojourn time a packet spends in the IIoT device before leaving successfully. With the obtained channel access probability, the first passage probability of the proposed model is explored to find the maximum probability of a packet being successfully transmitted in a given back-off sojourn duration (BSD). The distribution tail of the packet sojourn time can be tamed by minimizing the cumulative summation of each BSD in consideration of the quadratic penalty latency constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that, in the industrial environment, the OTLT scheme can keep the packet’s sojourn duration within a quantifiable limit and variance. It can also obtain considerably efficient control over packet transmission latency in a time-varying wireless propagation channel even with the increasing number of IIoT devices.}

This paper investigates the sensor motion effect for the positioning of an object, using angles of arrival only or together with time of arrival measurements. The biases from the AOA and TOA data models when ignoring the motion effect are examined. Positioning algorithms for AOA localization and mixed AOA-TOA localization that account for the motion effect are developed by the pseudo-linear formulation. The algorithms derived include the computationally attractive closed-form estimators and the noise resilient semidefinite programming solutions. The bias coming from the pseudo-linear formulation is analyzed in detail, and it can be subtracted from the closed-form solution to obtain a bias-suppressed estimate. Simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in achieving the CRLB performance under Gaussian noise before the thresholding effect occurs.}

To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also considered as other benchmarks.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of the data traffic and the access number of intelligent devices, the wireless communication systems based on the radio frequency (RF) is suffering from the pressure of spectrum shortage and access congestion constantly, which can be alleviated with the help of visible light communication (VLC). However, due to the limitations of VLC such as finite coverage and inconvenient uplinks, it is imperative to form the hybrid systems and realize the complementary advantages of VLC and RF. In this paper, the hybrid VLC-RF system with multi-users is investigated, where the sum achievable rate and energy efficiency (EE) are maximized via the alternate optimization of transceiver association and power allocation. In addition, based on various types of multiple access points, EE is optimized under different QoS requirements for green communications. With the assistance of proper approximations, the overall problem is decomposed into several convex sub-problems, which can be solved analytically and avoid traversal permutation. The numerical simulations show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm in the hybrid VLC-RF system, which can achieve superior performances than the conventional methods and single systems in multifarious scenarios.}

	abstract = {Grouping vehicles into platoons is a promising cooperative driving scenario to enhance the traffic safety and capacity of future vehicular networks. However, fast changing channel conditions in multi-platoon vehicular networks cause tremendous uncertainty for resource allocation. In addition, the unprecedented proliferation of various emerging vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) applications may result in some service demands with conflicting quality of experience. In this paper, we formulate a multi-objective resource allocation problem, which maximizes the transmission success ratio of intra-platoon communications and the mean opinion score (MOS) of V2I communication links. To efficiently solve this multi-objective optimization problem, we resort to a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Specifically, we divide it into a set of scalar optimization subproblems based on the weighted sum approach and model each one as a partially observable stochastic game (P-OSG), where each platoon acts as an agent and the actions taken by all platoons correspond to the resource allocation solution. We further propose a contribution-based dual-clip proximal policy optimization (CD-PPO) algorithm to deal with each subproblem, which is a DRL algorithm based on the actor-critic framework. The network parameters of all subproblems are then optimized collaboratively by using the proposed training algorithm and the neighborhood parameter transfer strategy. The desired Pareto front is obtained when all subproblems are solved. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can outperform other algorithms in terms of the MOS and transmission success ratio.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a unicast beamforming network for covert ambient backscatter communications (AmBC). Different from the prior covert backscatter works using artificial noise or a power-variable RF source, our work achieves covertness by arming the backscatter tag with multiple antennas. The tag uses a subset of its antennas to modulate covert information on backscattered RF signals while using the other antennas to modulate overt message as a cover to hide the covert transmission from the warden. We first derive the warden’s optimum detection threshold to minimize the detection error probability. To fight against the optimum warden, the tag changes impedance matching on each antenna to vary the reflected power and make the reflected overt and covert signals beamforming at space. We derive the optimum beamforming vectors by solving the problems of maximizing the covert rate at the receiver and the detection error probability at the warden, respectively. To address the non-convex constraints, we use semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and obtain near optimal parameters by designing binarySearch algorithms. Numerical results confirm the superiority of our work to the state-of-the-art one, and the existence of tradeoffs between the covert rate and the detection error probability.}

	abstract = {Although combining Full Duplex (FD) and Cognitive Radio (CR) technologies can provide several benefits, the presence of the residual self-interference (RSI) at the FD transceiver may influence the spectrum sensing capabilities. In particular, focusing on the blind eigenvalue-based detectors (EVDs), this paper shows that operating at mmWave widebands, the RSI is a colored noise strongly affecting the detection performance even when it is characterized by low power. Consequently, we propose here a whitened detector whose novelty consists in the real-time computation of the whitening matrix, differently from previous works which employ an offline computation. The proposed whitening matrix computation uses a sample covariance matrix (SCM) regularization tailored for the FD scenario, instead of the conventional SCM estimator. Particularly, we prove that the proposed whitened detector is robust against RSI power uncertainty, attaining a constant false alarm rate under typical FD operating conditions. Finally, we show that our method provides computational load reduction and faster convergence to the theoretical false alarm probability characteristic of the white noise case. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis confirming the better performance of the proposed whitening approach, particularly when applied to the sphericity test, in comparison to the offline-based approach.}

The wide adoption of wireless devices and applications makes security of the wireless transmissions more critical. Many attacks aiming at wireless communications have been proposed (e.g., jamming attack). Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) together with multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) design and adaptive modulation (AM) becomes an important technique to achieve high data rates. However, most of the attacks are not tailored for OFDM based systems. In this paper, we reveal a potential security issue of (MIMO-)OFDM-AM systems by developing three learning-based attack methods to (MIMO-) OFDM-AM systems. Based on the principle of AM, channel state information (CSI) is inferred from the modulation type of each subcarrier without any prior knowledge of the desired transmission. With the inferred CSI, we develop three adversarial attacking methods by maximizing error rate, minimizing capacity, or maximizing outage probability. Simulation results show that our learning-based method can detect the modulation type of each subcarrier in high accuracy and then successfully infer the CSI range. Furthermore, simulations also demonstrate that the proposed attacks cause severe performance degradation of (MIMO-)OFDM-AM systems (e.g., error rate, capacity) with fairly low power.}

	abstract = {Long-range underwater acoustic communication (LR-UWAC) is an essential technique for applications such as the control of unmanned underwater vehicles, gliders, or tactical submarines for long-term monitoring tasks. While techniques for estimating the channel impulse response (CIR) of short-range UWAC have been successfully applied, this is not the case for LR-UWAC. Here, the main challenge is to handle the diverse channel structure, which can be of a sparse or a non-sparse structure. In this paper, we propose a robust channel estimator for LR-UWAC. Our solution includes a switching mechanism to classify the channel as either sparse or non-sparse. In its sparse form, the LR-UWAC channel is characterized by a long time delay spread, time-invariant characteristics, and a block structure. Thus, we propose a non-trivial combination of the block subspace pursuit and the distributed subspace pursuit algorithms to exploit the channel’s block structure. For non-sparse LR-UWAC channel structures, we approximate the received signal as Gaussian, and derive a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator to separate the non-resolvable multipath. Extensive numerical simulation and results from two long-range sea experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in identifying the channel’s structure, and to accurately estimate the channel compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) wireless communications are commonly regarded as one of the key technologies of 6G communication. Combined with THz, the newly exploited physical layer transmission dimension orbital angular momentum (OAM) that multiplexes a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel, can unleash its potential in achieving high spectrum efficiency. Currently, most of the research on radio OAM communications focus on the point-to-point scenario in microwave and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. In this paper, we propose a uniform circular array (UCA)-based THz multi-user OAM (MU-OAM) communication system including downlink and uplink transmission schemes that simplifies the signal detection to the despiralization and amplitude detection (AD). A salient feature of the proposed MU-OAM communication scheme is lower computational complexity than the traditional MU-MIMO scheme without sacrifacing bit error rate (BER) and achievable sum rate performances, which is validated by mathematical analysis and numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {Due to its potential to enable global connectivity in remote locations, such as rural areas and islands, Space-Air-Ground networks have become an ambitious solution for terrestrial communication in the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication network. In this paper, we propose a novel structure of Space-Air-Ground-Sea integrated networks (SAGSINs) to study and derive the coverage probability (CP) of users who are annotated as surface stations (SSs) on the far-reaching ocean surface that is far away from the coastline. By incorporating different types of relays such as onshore stations (OSs), tethered balloons (TBs), high altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites (SATs), communication links between the terrestrial core connected base stations (CCBSs) and SSs are established via one of the four types of relay stations. Considering practical scenarios with a random distribution of SSs, we model the channel using the point-to-area model, which is recommended by ITU (for OSs to SS), the Rician model (for TBs or HAPs to SS), and the Shadowed-Rician model (for SATs to SS). When the SS’s distance from the coastline continues to increase from zero, since different channel models are considered, different relay stations will result in specific received signal strengths at SSs. The most powerful relay station will be chosen as the relay at one time. Hence, as we move away from the coastline, the respective strengths of the different types of relay stations vary, and hence, the association preference (among HAPs, OSs, TBs, and SATs) of the SSs changes leading to a CP value high enough even at locations far away from the coastline into the ocean. We analyze the CP using tools from stochastic geometry. Comparisons of CP between the integrated system with four types of relay stations and the single relay station system (only one type of relay station available) are represented. Numerical results verified by Monte-Carlo simulations reveal insights into the applicability of SAGSINs.}

In order to deal with the non-convex constraints of the considered problems, i.e., bounded CSI error based constraint and statistical CSI error based constraint, S-procedure is adopted to convert the non-convex SINR constraint with bounded CSI error into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the Bernstein-type inequality is utilized to transform the outage probability constraint with statistical CSI error into a second-order cone (SOC) constraint and linear inequalities. Following that, two efficient algorithms based on alternate optimization (AO) are proposed to solve the fairness problems and QoS problems, wherein the semi-definite programming (SDP), penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) are utilized. Furthermore, we analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithms. Finally, some numerical simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the impacts of the CSI error and the discrete precision of IRS reflection phase shift on the system performance are analyzed, which provides some insights for the IRS deployment and system robust design.}

The demanding reliability requirement set for URLLC claims for novel techniques that can deliver the necessary level of reliability without sacrificing the overall system capacity. In this context, this work presents and analyses a hybrid transmission scheme for improved reliability in millimetre wave bands with adaptive diversity combining. The proposed scheme is based on a hybrid approach that combines two links, one in the FR1 band (characterised by lower capacity but higher reliability due to more favourable propagation) and one in the FR2 band (offering higher capacity but experiencing a less reliable connectivity). The proposed scheme dynamically adapts the usage of both links in order to exploit the complementary characteristics of both bands (reliability of FR1 bands and capacity of FR2 bands) by switching between FR2-only and joint FR1-FR2 transmission according to the instantaneous channel quality in the main FR2 link. The performance is evaluated under two popular and well-known diversity combining techniques, namely Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC). The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve the same level of reliability as a continuous dual-link transmission scheme but with a much lower level of links usage and without sacrificing (and indeed enhancing) the capacity, thus making it a suitable candidate to deliver URLLC services in a resource-efficient manner.}

The main challenge is how to describe the signal strength attenuation due to the blockage from the environment. Conventional interpolation-type approaches fail to exploit the close relation between the radio map and the geometry of the environment. This paper proposes to construct radio maps by first estimating and constructing a multi-class 3D virtual obstacle map that describes the geometry of the environment with radio semantics. Mathematically, a least-squares problem is formulated to jointly estimate the virtual obstacle map and the propagation parameters. This problem is found to have a partial quasiconvexity that leads to the development of an efficient parameter estimation and radio map construction algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed method substantially reduces the amount of measurement required for achieving the same radio map accuracy. It is also demonstrated that in a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided relay communication scenario, a radio map assisted approach for UAV placement can achieve more than 50% capacity gain.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study channel estimation at a uniform linear array (ULA) with\nN\nantennas, where the channel at the ULA is composed of\nL\npaths with different angles of arrival (AoAs). It is assumed that Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) beams (also known as analog beams with DFT beams as special cases) are applied at the ULA to project the incoming signal onto a single (or multiple) RF chain(s), after which the signal is sampled and measured in baseband domain; the underlying signal is assumed to be constant during the projections. This measurement procedure arises in various communication systems, such as the receive beam sweeping phase in 5G NR, where DTFT beams are used due to their simple implementation as linear phase shifts on analog antennas. A fundamental question about this procedure is the number of DTFT measurements\nK\nneeded to recover the\nL\nAoAs. Previous work on this problem showed (by applying compressed sensing theory) that\nK≈LO(log(N/L))\nmeasurements are sufficient for recovering the AoAs, which grows with\nN\n. First, we show that necessary conditions for recovery are\nN≥2L\nand\nK≥2L\n. Second, by using properties of DTFT beam projections, we are able to show that if\nN≥2L\nthen\nK≥3L\narbitrary DTFT measurements suffice; hence, dependency on\nN\nis completely removed. Furthermore, if the DTFT beams are chosen to equal DFT beams with period\nN\n, then\nK≥2L\nbeam measurements are enough, achieving sufficiency of the necessary conditions. With these results, an AoA estimation algorithm is formulated which has enormous complexity savings compared to\nL\n-dimensional AoA search such as maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the algorithm’s improved performance over conventional algorithms such as beamspace ESPRIT and compressed sensing.}

	abstract = {Deploying 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is promising to reduce the energy consumption. However, serious quantization errors limit the feasibility of high order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). This paper focuses on the performance analysis of 1-bit ADC massive MIMO systems with high order QAM. Firstly, we theoretically analyze the relationship between the quantization error and various quantization parameters. We reveal that there exists an overlapping of constellations at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) with symmetric quantization. This is because the amplitude information in the detected signal at high SNR is lost which is multiplied by the zero quantization threshold in the symmetric quantization. To overcome this problem, asymmetric quantization should be considered. Based on the analysis of the quantization error, we propose two approaches to recover the amplitude information. One is a near unbiased detection (NUD) by scaling the traditional linear detector and optimizing the quantization threshold. The other is a sub-array detection based on non-uniform quantization (SAD-NQ) to correct the deviation of the detection result by averaging over sub-arrays. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can significantly improve the detection performance of high order QAM signal in the 1-bit ADC massive MIMO systems.}

	abstract = {A new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver scheme for practical binary codes is proposed that provides consistent gains over conventional linear receivers. We first develop a practical successive integer forcing (IF) scheme based on practical binary codes rather than lattice codes. We then present the successive cancellation integer forcing (SC-IF) scheme, which combines and enhances successive IF and minimum mean squared error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC). In this scheme, the receiver first decides whether individual decoding or IF sum decoding is appropriate for each data stream, and then conducts successive IF sum decoding only for selected streams while decoding the remaining streams using MMSE-SIC. The proposed SC-IF methodology mitigates the performance loss caused by mismatched IF filtering in fading channels, while attenuating the noise amplification caused by MMSE filtering. Extensive link-level simulations demonstrate that the proposed successive IF significantly improves the basic IF, and the SC-IF improves both the successive IF and MMSE-SIC, offering uniform improvements over conventional linear receivers for most channel correlation and variation parameters and modulation orders at comparable computational costs. These results illustrate the viability of SC-IF as a fundamental building block for high-performance MIMO receivers in 5G-Advanced and/or subsequent-generation communication systems.}

In this paper, we investigate the spectrum sharing problem in ITSN, in particular focusing on the downlink transmission of the satellite network, which adopts the framing structure for the satellite users (SUs). We model the interference from both terrestrial downlink and uplink transmissions to SUs according to the beamforming techniques. For the terrestrial downlink transmission, we assume that terrestrial users (TUs) are served cooperatively by multiple small base stations (SBSs) via joint beamforming, while the virtual multiple access channel (VMAC) scheme is adopted for the terrestrial uplink transmission. We propose the optimization framework by jointly considering the terrestrial beamformer design and satellite user scheduling to maximize the sum rate of all users. The optimization problems are decomposed into three sub-problems: satellite user scheduling, terrestrial beamformer design, and time slot allocation, which are solved by deep clustering, second-order cone programming (SOCP) (or fractional programming (FP)), and linear programming, respectively. Then, an alternating iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in multiple cases.}

However, the dynamic nature of communication channels often leads to rapid distribution shifts, which may require periodically retraining. This paper formulates a data-efficient two-stage training method that facilitates rapid online adaptation. Our training mechanism uses a predictive meta-learning scheme to train rapidly from data corresponding to both current and past channel realizations. Our method is applicable to any deep neural network (DNN)-based receiver, and does not require transmission of new pilot data for training. To illustrate the proposed approach, we study DNN-aided receivers that utilize an interpretable model-based architecture, and introduce a modular training strategy based on predictive meta-learning. We demonstrate our techniques in simulations on a synthetic linear channel, a synthetic non-linear channel, and a COST 2100 channel. Our results demonstrate that the proposed online training scheme allows receivers to outperform previous techniques based on self-supervision and joint-learning by a margin of up to 2.5 dB in coded bit error rate in rapidly-varying scenarios.}

	abstract = {Compared with underwater acoustic communication, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has the advantages of wide communication bandwidth, high transmission speed and strong directional transmission, which make it have broad application prospects. However, the absorption and scattering effects in underwater environments cause a UWOC system to suffer from severe channel fading. To reduce the system complexity and power loss, the on- -off-keying (OOK) modulation scheme and one-bit analog-to-digital converter are considered in this work. Besides, to deal with the complex underwater optical channels and the nonlinearity of the one-bit quantization, a novel deep learning based architecture integrating the autoencoder (AE) and generative adversarial network (GAN), named hybrid AE-GAN, is developed. In the proposed hybrid AE-GAN, the generator in GAN is responsible for a generalized channel equalization, which aims to equalize both the impairments from underwater optical channels and the distortion from one-bit quantization. While the decoder in AE and the discriminator in GAN share the same network to distinguish true and fake as well as reconstruct the sent messages simultaneously. Meanwhile, the one-bit quantized signal is regarded as conditional information for GAN to assist in targeted channel equalization for various signals. Moreover, a specialized loss function and training strategy for the hybrid AE-GAN are also presented, which can optimize AE and GAN at the same time, and deal with the problem that the binarization of OOK stymies the gradient backpropagation. The simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid AE-GAN can achieve superior performance.}

	abstract = {The backscatter communications (BackCom) and physical layer security are respected to realize extremely low-power secure communications in the imminent sixth generation (6G). In a BackCom system, the backscatter device without radio frequency components sends messages to users by reflecting the external signals. However, the double-fading effect limits BackCom’s performance and the commonly used broadcast mode is vulnerable to eavesdropping. Two promising technologies, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), show excellent potential in handling these problems. In this paper, we propose a UAV-empowered IRS-BackCom network, where an IRS acts as the backscatter device and uses the received signals from a UAV for BackCom. We aim to guarantee secure transmission and maximize the broadcast secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV’s beamformer and trajectory and the IRS’s reflection coefficient. To tackle the non-convex problem, we leverage the block coordinate descent method to decompose it into three subproblems. Specifically, the UAV’s beamformer and trajectory and the IRS’s reflection matrix are optimized alternatively. Further, we adopt reinforcement learning to facilitate the intractable UAV’s trajectory optimization. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system model and the optimization scheme.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a realistic and novel protocol for two-way communication in multiple-input-single-output (MISO) wireless-powered interference channels, namely, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) then wireless information transfer (WIT) protocol. In the protocol considered, transmitters first perform SWIPT in a forward link (FL) and receivers and then execute WIT using the harvested energy in a backward link (BL). Given that the operation of SWIPT in the FL affects the performance of WIT in the BL, our aim is to find a resource allocation strategy that maximizes the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the FL and BL, which requires the joint optimization of the transmit beamforming vector, transmit power, and energy harvesting (EH) ratio in the FL and the receive beamforming vector in the BL. To deal with the non-convexity of the optimization problem, a deep learning (DL) framework is devised, in which the optimal resource allocation strategy is approximated by a well-designed deep neural network (DNN) model consisting of six independent DNN modules where the sigmoid and softmax functions are jointly utilized to properly model each control parameter. Furthermore, a two-stage training method is proposed where the DNN model is initialized using suboptimal solutions that are found using a low complexity algorithm in a supervised manner before it is fine-tuned using the main training based on unsupervised learning. Through intensive simulations performed in various environments, we confirm that the proposed method improves the training performance of the DNN model while reducing the training overhead. As a result, the proposed DL-based resource allocation achieves a near-optimal performance in terms of the sum SE with a low computation time.}

	abstract = {Installing more base stations (BSs) into the existing cellular infrastructure is an essential way to provide greater network capacity and higher data rates in the 5th-generation cellular networks (5G). However, a non-negligible amount of the population is concerned that such network densification will generate a notable increase in exposure to electric and magnetic fields (EMF) over the territory. In this paper, we analyze the downlink, uplink, and joint downlink&uplink exposure induced by the radiation from BSs and personal user equipment (UE), respectively, in terms of the received power density and exposure index. In our analysis, we consider the EMF restrictions set by the regulatory authorities such as the minimum distance between restricted areas (e.g., schools and hospitals) and BSs, and the maximum permitted exposure. Exploiting tools from stochastic geometry, mathematical expressions for the coverage probability and statistical EMF exposure are derived and validated. Tuning the system parameters such as the BS density and the minimum distance from a BS to restricted areas, we show a trade-off between reducing the population’s exposure to EMF and enhancing the network coverage performance. Then, we formulate optimization problems to maximize the performance of the EMF-aware cellular network while ensuring that the EMF exposure complies with the standard regulation limits with high probability. For instance, the exposure from BSs is two orders of magnitude less than the maximum permissible level when the density of BSs is less than\n20\nBSs/km\n2\n.}

	abstract = {To fulfill the stringent requirements brought by human-type communication (HTC) along with massive machine-type communication (MTC), device-to-device (D2D) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques will inevitably be incorporated into dense cellular networks to cater massive connectivity and maintain high spectral efficiency. However, such combination may lead to very complex network topologies and bring challenge in resource allocation, interference management and transmission mode selection. Note the received signal strength (RSS) is an important factor for cellular and D2D mode selection, it can affect multi-access mode determination in D2D-aided HTC/MTC dense NOMA systems. Therefore, the RSS threshold of each cell has great impact on system performance and should be carefully tuned. To this end, we formulate the RSS-threshold selection problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process to maximize the performance for downlink and uplink communications. Accordingly, we employ a multi-agent reinforcement learning based scheme wherein each small base station acts as an agent and chooses the optimal RSS threshold to achieve maximum sum rate by interacting with the environment continuously. Extensive simulation results reveal our proposed scheme can improve the system sum rate and coverage by enhancing the connectivity of massive HTC and MTC devices via D2D and NOMA techniques.}

	abstract = {Joint communication and sensing (JCS) has become a promising technology for mobile networks because of its higher spectrum and energy efficiency. Up to now, the prevalent fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based sensing method for mobile JCS networks is on-grid based, and the grid interval determines the resolution. Because the mobile network usually has limited consecutive OFDM symbols in a downlink (DL) time slot, the sensing accuracy is restricted by the limited resolution, especially for velocity estimation. In this paper, we propose a multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based JCS system that can achieve higher sensing accuracy for the angle of arrival, range, and velocity estimation, compared with the traditional FFT-based JCS method. We further propose a JCS channel state information (CSI) enhancement method by leveraging the JCS sensing results. Finally, we derive a theoretical lower bound for sensing mean square error (MSE) by using perturbation analysis. Simulation results show that in terms of the sensing MSE performance, the proposed MUSIC-based JCS outperforms the FFT-based one by more than 20 dB. Moreover, the bit error rate (BER) of communication demodulation using the proposed JCS CSI enhancement method is significantly reduced compared with communication using the originally estimated CSI.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a promising wireless technology for the dynamic configuration and control of electromagnetic waves, thus creating a smart (programmable) radio environment. In this context, we study a multi-IRS assisted two-way communication system consisting of two users that employ full-duplex (FD) technology. More specifically, we deal with the joint IRS location and size (i.e., the number of reflecting elements) optimization in order to minimize an upper bound of system outage probability under various constraints: minimum and maximum number of reflecting elements per IRS, maximum number of installed IRSs, maximum total number of reflecting elements (implicit bound on the signaling overhead) as well as maximum total IRS installation cost. First, the problem is formulated as a discrete optimization problem and, then, a theoretical proof of its NP-hardness is given. Moreover, we provide a lower bound on the optimum value by solving a linear-programming relaxation (LPR) problem. Subsequently, we design two polynomial-time algorithms, a deterministic greedy algorithm and a randomized approximation algorithm, based on the LPR solution. The former is a heuristic method that always computes a feasible solution for which (a posteriori) performance guarantee can be provided. The latter achieves an approximate solution, using randomized rounding, with provable (a priori) probabilistic guarantees on the performance. Furthermore, extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to the baseline schemes. Finally, useful conclusions regarding the comparison between FD and conventional half-duplex (HD) systems are also drawn.}

	abstract = {The past years have witnessed increasing research interest in achieving passive human localization with commodity WiFi devices. However, due to the fundamental limited spatial resolution of WiFi signals, it is still very difficult to achieve accurate localization with existing commodity WiFi devices. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose to exploit the degree of freedom provided by the Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), which is composed of a large number of controllable reflective elements, to modulate the spatial distribution of WiFi signals and thus break down the spatial resolution limitation of WiFi signals to achieve accurate localization. Specifically, in the single-person scenario, we derive the closed-form solution to optimally control the phase shift of the IRS elements. In the multi-person scenario, we propose a Side-lobe Cancellation Algorithm to eliminate the near-far effect to achieve accurate localization of multiple persons in an iterative manner. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that without any change to the existing WiFi infrastructure, the proposed framework can locate multiple moving persons passively with sub-centimeter accuracy under multipath interference and random noise.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of joint Task offloading and resource Allocation for vehicular edge computing with Result Feedback Delay (TARFD). Specifically, we consider a typical roadside unit (RSU) and vehicles within its coverage area, and optimize the task offloading decisions of vehicles as well as the uplink bandwidth allocation and the computation resources allocation on the RSU. The TARFD problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to minimize the average delay consisting of task offloading delay, task computation delay, and result feedback delay. We derive a lower bound of the optimum to the TARFD problem, based on which we propose an approximate algorithm of the TARFD problem, called A-TARFD. The A-TARFD algorithm can effectively deliver solutions for small-scale scenarios. To tackle large-scale scenarios, a low-complexity algorithm for the TARFD problem, called L-TARFD, is developed by constructing an iteratively updated sequence of locally tight approximate geometric programming (GP) problems. The L-TARFD algorithm can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point and forces the offloading decisions arbitrarily close to binary values. By comparison with the lower bound, simulation results show that the proposed two algorithms have near-optimal performance over a wide range of parameter settings.}

The self-attention mechanism is employed to achieve input precoding for the input features before processing them in the decoder. In particular, we implement multi-head attention in the encoder and a residual convolutional neural architecture as the decoder, respectively. We also employ a customized weight-level pruning to slim the trained neural network with a fine-tuning process, which reduces the computational complexity significantly to realize a low complexity and low latency solution. This enables reductions of up to 70% in the parameters, while maintaining an almost identical performance compared with the complete Channelformer. We also propose an effective online training method based on the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) configuration for the modern communication systems, which only needs the available information at the receiver for online training. Using industrial standard channel models, the simulations of attention-based solutions show superior estimation performance compared with other candidate neural network methods for channel estimation.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reconfigurable surface IRS are becoming an attractive component of cellular networks due to their ability to shape the propagation environment and thereby improve coverage. While IRS nodes incorporate a great number of phase-shifting elements and a controller entity, the phase shifts are typically determined by the cellular base station (BS) due to its computational capability. Since controlling a large number of phase shifts may become prohibitive in practice, it is important to reduce the control overhead between the BS and the IRS controller. To this end, in this paper, we propose a low-rank modeling approach for the IRS phase shifts. The key idea is to represent the IRS phase shift vector using a low-rank tensor approximation model, where each rank-one component is modeled as the Kronecker product of a predefined number of factors of smaller sizes, obtained via tensor decomposition algorithms. We show that the proposed low-rank models drastically reduce the required feedback requirements associated with the BS-IRS control links. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method is especially attractive in scenarios with a strong line of sight component, in which case nearly the same spectral efficiency is reached as in the cases with near-optimal phase shifts, but with significantly lower feedback overhead.}

	abstract = {Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (IFDMA) has the salient advantage of lower Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) than its competitors like Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA). A recent research effort of ours put forth a new IFDMA transceiver design significantly less complex than conventional IFDMA transceivers. The new IFDMA transceiver design reduces the complexity by exploiting a certain correspondence between the IFDMA signal processing and the Cooley-Tukey IFFT/FFT algorithmic structure so that IFDMA streams can be inserted/extracted at different stages of an IFFT/FFT module according to the sizes of the streams. Although our prior work has laid down the theoretical foundation for the new IFDMA transceiver’s structure, the practical realization of the transceiver on specific hardware with resource constraints has not been carefully investigated. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. Specifically, this paper puts forth a heuristic algorithm called multi-priority scheduling (MPS) to schedule the execution of the butterfly computations in the IFDMA transceiver with the constraint of a limited number of hardware processors. The resulting FFT computation, referred to as MPS-FFT, has a much lower computation time than conventional FFT computation when applied to the IFDMA signal processing. Importantly, we derive a lower bound for the optimal IFDMA FFT computation time to benchmark MPS-FFT. Our experimental results indicate that when the number of hardware processors is a power of two: 1) MPS-FFT has near-optimal computation time; 2) MPS-FFT incurs less than 44.13% of the computation time of the conventional pipelined FFT.}

By focusing on the typical Rician fading channels, we analyze the pair-wise error probability of superimposed SCMA codewords and then deduce the design metrics for multi-dimensional constellation construction and sparse codebook optimization. For significant reduction of the decoding complexity, we advocate the key idea of projecting the multi-dimensional constellation elements to a few overlapped complex numbers in each dimension, called low projection (LP). An emerging modulation scheme, called golden angle modulation (GAM), is considered for multi-stage LP optimization, where the resultant multi-dimensional constellation is called LP-GAM. Our analysis and simulation results show the superiority of the proposed LP codebooks (LPCBs) including one-shot decoding convergence and excellent error rate performance. In particular, the proposed LPCBs lead to decoding complexity reduction by at least 97% compared to that of the conventional codebooks, whilst owning large minimum Euclidean distance. Some examples of the proposed LPCBs are available at https://github.com/ethanlq/SCMA-codebook .}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is envisioned as a core component of future wireless communication networks due to, among other reasons, the very large unlicensed bandwidth it offers and the fact that it does not cause any interference to existing radio frequency (RF) communication systems. In order to take advantage of both RF and VLC, most research on their coexistence has focused on hybrid designs where data transmission to any user could originate from either an RF or a VLC access point (AP). However, hybrid RF/VLC systems fail to exploit the distinct transmission characteristics (e.g., susceptibility of VLC transmissions to blockages, limited field-of-view of VLC APs and receivers, more coverage and better reliability of RF systems, etc.) of RF and VLC systems to fully reap the benefits they can offer. Aggregated RF/VLC systems, in which any user can be served simultaneously by both RF and VLC APs, have recently emerged as a more promising and robust design for the coexistence of RF and VLC systems. To this end, this paper, for the first time, investigates AP assignment, subchannel allocation (SA), and transmit power allocation (PA) to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) of aggregated RF/VLC systems while considering the effects of interference and VLC line-of-sight link blockages. A novel and challenging EE optimization problem is formulated for which an efficient joint solution based on alternating optimization is developed. More particularly, an energy-efficient AP assignment algorithm based on matching theory is proposed. Then, a low-complexity SA scheme that allocates subchannels to users based on their channel conditions is developed. Finally, an effective PA algorithm is presented by utilizing the quadratic transform approach and a multi-objective optimization framework. Extensive simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed joint AP assignment, SA, and PA solution obtains significant EE, sum-rate, and outage performance gains with low complexity, and 2) the aggregated RF/VLC system provides considerable performance improvement compared to hybrid RF/VLC systems.}

	abstract = {Motivated by the high information freshness requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper investigates adaptive packet length adjustment schemes to minimize the average age of information (AoI) for status update systems, where a machine type communication device adaptively adjusts the packet length in real time by exploiting the channel state information and AoI. Since the status packets in the IoT are often short, a significant packet error rate is introduced. Due to the instability of channel fading and the high packet error rate, optimizing the AoI performance is tricky. Under a power consumption constraint, the AoI minimization problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and the structure of the optimal scheme is revealed. Then, under the CMDP framework, this paper transforms the AoI minimization problem into a linear programming problem and proposes a probabilistic packet length adjustment scheme, which can lead to the optimal solution. When the power consumption constraint is loose, a low-complexity suboptimal scheme is further proposed, where the expected average AoI of one period length is minimized. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed optimal scheme and show that the proposed low-complexity scheme can reach near-optimal performance.}

	abstract = {This work considers a multi-way massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) relaying system wherein several wireless information and power transfer capable users, first harvest energy, and then exchange information via a relay. The mMIMO relaying system is practically modelled by considering spatially-correlated relay-user channels, and by using a non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model. A closed-form spectral efficiency expression is derived for this system, which is then used to jointly allocate the relay and users transmit powers, and the charging time to optimize the weighted sum energy efficiency (WSEE) metric. The spatially-correlated channel and the non-linear EH model not only couple the optimization variables, but also introduce nested scalar fractional optimization functions. This makes the WSEE metric non-convex. The proposed solution first uses the existing quadratic transformation (QT) to decouple the scalar fractional forms. It then applies novel results, which are developed by extending the QT framework, to decouple the optimization variables. The proposed WSEE optimization algorithm is shown to provide close-to-optimal WSEE. It is also shown that channel spatial correlation increases the amount of energy harvested by the users, but reduces their WSEE.}

	abstract = {In this study, we consider an energy-efficient and low-complexity transmission control in a SWIPT-NOMA-based green cellular network (GCN) that consists of a green base station (GBS) and green users (GUEs). First, we formulate a non-convex problem that minimizes transmit power consumption while supporting minimum downlink user service rate, downlink data queue stability, and user battery availability. Then, we transform the problem into a Lyapunov-drift-penalty minimization problem, which can determine a new resource allocation scheme that balances transmit power consumption and queue stability. Second, the Lyapunov-drift-penalty problem is decomposed into subchannel assignment, power allocation, and power splitting (PS) ratio control problems. The subchannel assignment problem is solved using a matching theory-based low-complexity algorithm. The power allocation and PS ratio control problems are solved using the alternating optimization (AO) approach and bisection method. This decomposed subproblem-based control also enables distributed control between the GBS and GUEs. Third, we prove the convergence, optimality, and polynomial computation complexity of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, we demonstrate that the proposed control outperforms the benchmark controls regarding transmit power consumption and the achievable rate. Owing to the optimality and low complexity, the proposed control can be efficiently applied to large-scale and distributed GCNs in sixth-generation environments.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the robust precoding with imperfect channel state information (CSI) for high frequency (HF) skywave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Starting with a sparse beam based a posteriori channel model for the available imperfect CSI at the base station (BS), we prove that the robust precoder for ergodic sum-rate maximization can be designed by optimizing the beam domain robust precoder (BDRP) without any loss of optimality. Furthermore, the asymptotic optimal precoder is beam structured for a sufficiently large number of antennas at the BS, involving a low-dimensional BDRP. As a result, the beam structured robust precoding is asymptotic optimal and can be efficiently implemented based on chirp z-transform. We then derive an iterative algorithm to design the BDRP using majorization-minimization (MM). Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity BDRP design with an ergodic sum-rate upper bound, simplifying the MM based design algorithm. Based on our simulation results, the proposed beam structured robust precoding can achieve a near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity in various scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the spectral/energy efficiency (SE/EE) of a full-duplex (FD) cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) over Rician fading channels. Due to the FD radios, the access points (APs) suffer from self-interference (SI) and inter-AP interference (IAI) while the downlink (DL) users’ signals are corrupted by the uplink (UL) users’ transmissions. We consider the case, where low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are utilized at the APs and DL users, which introduces the quantization noise (QN). The combined effects of Rician\nκ\n-factor, residual SI/IAI, UL-to-DL interference, multi-user interference, and QN on the UL/DL SEs are characterized. The UL SE is degraded by the increase in DL power, whereas the growth in UL power deteriorates the DL SE. The effects of the residual SI/IAI and UL-to-DL interference are worsened by the low-resolution ADCs. We optimize the UL/DL transmit powers to maximize the overall sum SE of the network. It is observed that the proposed power allocation algorithm brings substantial sum SE gain. A trade-off analysis between the EE and SE, as a function of the ADCs’ resolution, shows that the entire envelope of the operating region of FD CF mMIMO is enhanced in Rician channels.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a promising physical layer security technique that employs the hardware-introduced features extracted from the received signals for device identification. In this paper, we consider an RFFI problem in the presence of hybrid time-varying distortions (HTVDs) induced by multipath fading channel, carrier frequency offset (CFO), and phase offset. To solve this problem, an HTVDs-robust RFFI framework is proposed. Firstly, we derive that the residual HTVDs after CFO correction can be approximated as multiplicative interference in the frequency domain. Secondly, we define a novel signal analysis dimension named spectral quotient (SQ) representation and then present the spectral circular shift division (SCSD) method to generate the HTVDs-robust SQ signals, where the multiplicative interference can be suppressed. Thereafter, the statistics including root mean square (RMS), variance (VAR), skewness (SKE), and kurtosis (KUR) are extracted from the real and imaginary components of the SQ signals, respectively. Finally, the statistical features are used for the training and testing of the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To further enhance the performance of the proposed RFFI scheme, we also present the spectral circular multi-shift division (SCMSD) method, which increases the flexibility in the generation of the HTVDs-robust SQ signals. Given what we knew, this is the first time attempting to mitigate the HTVDs by leveraging the strong frequency correlation at the neighboring subcarriers in the multivariate hypothesis tasks. Compared to several handcraft feature-based RFFI methods, the proposed method exhibits superior identification accuracy and strong robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed RFFI scheme can achieve the accuracy of 91.3% with five devices and 86.4% with sixteen devices when the classifiers are trained with the additive white Gaussian noise but are tested with the Rayleigh channel.}

	abstract = {Motivated by automotive applications, we consider joint radar sensing and data communication for a system operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands, where a Base Station (BS) is equipped with a co-located radar receiver and sends data using the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation format. We consider two distinct modes of operation. In Discovery mode, a single common data stream is broadcast over a wide angular sector. The radar receiver must detect the presence of not yet acquired targets and performs coarse estimation of their parameters (angle of arrival, range, and velocity). In Tracking mode, the BS transmits multiple individual data streams to already acquired users via beamforming, while the radar receiver performs accurate estimation of the aforementioned parameters. Due to hardware complexity and power consumption constraints, we consider a hybrid digital-analog architecture where the number of RF chains and A/D converters is significantly smaller than the number of antenna array elements. In this case, a direct application of the conventional MIMO radar approach is not possible. Consequently, we advocate a beam-space approach where the vector observation at the radar receiver is obtained through a RF-domain beamforming matrix operating the dimensionality reduction from antennas to RF chains. Under this setup, we propose a likelihood function-based scheme to perform joint target detection and parameter estimation in Discovery, and high-resolution parameter estimation in Tracking mode, respectively. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to reliably detect multiple targets while closely approaching the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of the corresponding parameter estimation problem.}

	abstract = {A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the entire space is partitioned by STARS into a sensing space and a communication space. A novel sensing-at-STARS structure is proposed, where dedicated sensors are mounted at STARS to address the significant path loss and clutter interference of sensing. The Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) estimation of the sensing target is derived, which is then minimized subject to the minimum communication requirement. A novel approach is proposed to transform the complicated CRB minimization problem into a trackable modified Fisher information matrix (FIM) optimization problem. Both independent and coupled phase-shift models of STARS are investigated: 1) For the independent phase-shift model, to address the coupling problem of ISAC waveform and STARS coefficient, an efficient double-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework is conceived; 2) For the coupled phase-shift model, based on the PDD framework, a low complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle the coupled phase-shift constraint by alternately optimizing the amplitude and phase-shift coefficients of STARS with closed-form expressions. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that: 1) STARS significantly outperforms conventional RIS in terms of CRB under the communication constraints; 2) coupled phase-shift model achieves comparable performance to the independent one for low communication requirements or sufficient STARS elements; 3) it is more efficient to increase the number of passive elements of STARS than the active elements of the sensor; 4) higher sensing accuracy can be achieved by STARS using the practical 2D maximum likelihood estimator compared with the conventional RIS.}

	abstract = {IoT systems typically involve separate data collection and processing, and face the scalability issue when the number of nodes increases. For some tasks, only the result of data fusion is needed. Then, the whole process can be realized in an efficient way, integrating the data collection and fusion in one step by over-the-air computation (AirComp). Its shortcoming, however, is signal distortion when channel gains of nodes are different, which cannot be well solved by transmission power control alone in times of deep fading. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-slot over-the-air computation (MS-AirComp) framework for the sum estimation in fading channels. Compared with conventional data collection (one slot for each node) and AirComp (one slot for all nodes), MS-AirComp is an alternative policy that lies between them, exploiting multiple slots to improve channel gains so as to facilitate power control. Avoiding to obtain instantaneous channel gains of all nodes at the sink is a key point. Specifically, the transmissions are distributed over multiple slots and a threshold of channel gain is set for distributed transmission scheduling. Each node transmits its signal only once, in the slot when its channel gain first gets above the threshold, or in the last slot when its channel gain remains below the threshold. Theoretical analysis gives the closed-form of the computation error in fading channels, based on which the optimal parameters are found. Noticing that computation error tends to be reduced at the cost of more transmission power, a method is suggested to control the increase of transmission power. Simulations confirm that the proposed method can effectively reduce computation error, compared with state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Model update compression is a widely used technique to alleviate the communication cost in federated learning (FL). However, there is evidence indicating that the compression-based FL system often suffers the following two issues, i) the implicit learning performance deterioration of the global model due to the inaccurate update, ii) the limitation of sharing the same compression rate over heterogeneous edge devices. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient learning framework, named Snowball, that enables edge devices to incrementally upload their model updates in a coarse-to-fine compression manner. To this end, we first design a fine-grained compression scheme that enables a nearly continuous compression rate. After that, we investigate the Snowball optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption of parameter transmission with learning performance constraints. By leveraging the theoretical insights of the convergence analysis, the optimization problem is transformed into a tractable form. Following that, a water-filling algorithm is designed to solve the problem, where each device is assigned a personalized compression rate according to the status of the locally available resource. Experiments indicate that, compared to state-of-the-art FL algorithms, our learning framework can save five times the required energy of uplink communication to achieve a good global accuracy.}

	abstract = {Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with federated learning (FL) has been seen as a promising paradigm for dealing with the massive amounts of data generated by intelligent devices. Nevertheless, although FL has natural advantages in data security protection, eavesdroppers can also deduce the raw data according to the shared parameters. Existing works mainly focused on encrypting the content of uploaded parameters, but we believe that it can improve security further by hiding the presence of parameter updating. Therefore, in this paper, we conceive a UAV-enabled covert federated learning architecture, where the UAV is not only responsible for orchestrating the operation of FL but also for emitting artificial noise (AN) to interfere with the eavesdropping of unintended users. To strike a balance between the security level and the training cost (including time overhead and energy consumption), we propose a distributed proximal policy optimization-based strategy for the sake of jointly optimizing the trajectory and AN transmitting power of the UAV, the CPU frequency, the transmitting power and the bandwidth allocation of the participated devices, as well as the needed accuracy of the local model. Furthermore, a series of experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles with RIS (UAV–RIS) can offer ubiquitous deployment services in communication-disabled areas, but is limited by the on-board energy of the UAVs. In this paper, a novel energy harvesting (EH) scheme on top of the UAV–RIS system, called EH-RIS scheme, is developed for the next generation high performance wireless system. The proposed EH-RIS scheme extends the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system by splitting the passive reflected arrays on the geometric space for transporting information and harvesting energy simultaneously. However, pedestrian mobility, and rapid channel changes post challenges to efficient resource allocation in wireless systems. Thus, a robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is developed to improve the proposed EH-RIS scheme for guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) under dynamic wireless environments. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed robust DRL-based EH-RIS system, which not only outperform the existing state-of-the-art solutions but also approach to the performance of the exhaustive search method.}

	abstract = {Multipath TCP (MPTCP) improves the bandwidth utilization in wireless network scenarios, since it can simultaneously utilize multiple interfaces for data transmission. However, with the fast growth of mobile devices and applications, link interruptions caused by handoffs still lead to drastic performance degradation in such scenarios. Typically, a series of packet losses on part of the links will block the transmission of the entire connection when handoff occurs. This paper proposes an Experience-driven Adaptive Redundant packet scheduler (EdAR) for MPTCP, aiming at achieving seamless handoffs in mobile networks. EdAR enables flexibly scheduling redundant packets with an experience-driven learning-based approach in the face of drastic network environment changes for multipath performance enhancement. To enable accurate learning and prediction, both the network environment and the best course of actions are jointly learned via a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, which we design with a hybrid structure to deal with the complexity of system states. Furthermore, both offline and online learning are utilized to allow the agent to adapt to different and changing network environments. Evaluation results show that EdAR outperforms the state-of-the-art MPTCP schedulers in most network scenarios. Specifically in mobile networks with frequent handoffs, EdAR brings\n2×\nimprovement in terms of the overall goodput.}

	abstract = {Channel acquisition is one of the main challenges for the deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided communication systems. This is because an RIS has a large number of reflective elements, which are passive devices with no active transmitting/receiving abilities. In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem for the RIS aided multi-user millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. Specifically, we propose a novel channel estimation protocol for the above system to estimate the cascaded channels, which are the products of the channels from the base station (BS) to the RIS and from the RIS to the users. Further, since the cascaded channels are typically sparse, this allows us to formulate the channel estimation problem as a sparse recovery problem using compressive sensing (CS) techniques, thereby allowing the channels to be estimated with less training overhead. Moreover, the sparse channel matrices of the cascaded channels of all users have a common block sparsity structure due to the common channel between the BS and the RIS. To take advantage of the common sparsity pattern, we propose a two-step multi-user joint channel estimation procedure. In the first step, we make use of the common column-block sparsity and project the received signals onto the common column subspace. In the second step, we make use of the row-block sparsity of the projected signals and propose a multi-user joint sparse matrix recovery algorithm that takes into account the common channel between the BS and the RIS.}

	abstract = {An integrated satellite and aerial network (ISAN) is considered a promising candidate to provide seamless connectivity for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective based robust beamforming (BF) scheme for an ISAN to support heterogeneous services with high flexibility, where the satellite network serves various heterogeneous satellite terminals through multicast non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA), while the aerial network offers services to many internet of things devices using layered division multiplexing (LDM). Specifically, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to achieve a good trade-off between sum rate maximization and total transmit power minimization. To tackle this mathematically intractable problem, we exploit the weighted Tchebycheff approach to transform the MOOP into a single-objective problem. Since only the angular information based channel state information is available, we exploit the angular discretization method and sequential convex approximation to design a robust BF algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results demonstrated that our proposed scheme can achieve a optimal trade-off between multiple performance metrics with high spectrum and energy efficiency, so as to support heterogeneous services in the ISAN and fill the gap of only single type of serivce in the existing ISAN works.}

	abstract = {This paper integrates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into a wireless powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) network, where IoT devices need to harvest energy from an energy station (ES) before transmitting their monitoring data to an access point. An IRS is invoked to improve energy and spectral efficiency by changing propagation environment. Considering that the ES and IoT devices come from different operators, IoT devices need to provide monetary payment in exchange for the ES’s charging before implementing nonlinear energy harvesting. We build this energy interaction via Stackelberg game under three multiple access schemes, i.e., IRS-assisted time division multiple access (IRS-TDMA), IRS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (IRS-NOMA), and IRS-assisted frequency division multiple access (IRS-FDMA). To solve the common follower game among the three schemes, we first employ an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with Majorization-Minimization (MM) to alternately optimize the energy beamforming and energy phase shifts, and then derive the optimal ES transmit power. For the leader game of IRS-TDMA, the optimal time allocation and optimal information phase shifts are first derived in closed form through Lagrange dual method and triangular inequality, respectively. On this basis, an AO algorithm is developed to optimize energy price and energy transfer time alternately. Similar procedures are also used to solve the leader games for IRS-NOMA and IRS-FDMA. Simulation results show that IRS-NOMA and IRS-FDMA achieve the same utilities for the ES and IoT devices. Due to IRS time selectivity, IRS-TDMA is more energy and spectral efficient than IRS-NOMA and IRS-FDMA, and this advantage is more pronounced in higher numbers of IRS elements and IoT devices.}

	abstract = {Low overhead channel estimation based on compressive sensing (CS) has been widely investigated for hybrid wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The channel sparsifying dictionaries used in prior work are built from ideal array response vectors evaluated on discrete angles of arrival/departure. In addition, these dictionaries are assumed to be the same for all subcarriers, without considering the impacts of hardware impairments and beam squint. In this manuscript, we derive a general channel and signal model that explicitly incorporates the impacts of hardware impairments, practical pulse shaping functions, and beam squint, overcoming the limitations of mmWave MIMO channel and signal models commonly used in previous work. Then, we propose a dictionary learning (DL) algorithm to obtain the sparsifying dictionaries embedding hardware impairments, by considering the effect of beam squint without introducing it into the learning process. We also design a novel CS channel estimation algorithm under beam squint and hardware impairments, where the channel structures at different subcarriers are exploited to enable channel parameter estimation with low complexity and high accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DL and channel estimation strategy when applied to realistic mmWave channels.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been anticipated to be a novel cost-effective technology to improve the performance of future wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate a practical RIS-aided multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments, RIS phase noise and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Joint design of the MIMO transceiver and RIS reflection matrix to minimize the total average mean-square-error (MSE) of all data streams is particularly considered. This joint design problem is non-convex and challenging to solve due to the newly considered practical imperfections. To tackle the issue, we first analyze the total average MSE by incorporating the impacts of the above system imperfections. Then, in order to handle the tightly coupled optimization variables and non-convex NP-hard constraints, an efficient iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) framework is proposed with guaranteed convergence, where each subproblem admits a closed-form optimal solution by leveraging the majorization-minimization (MM) technique. Moreover, via exploiting the special structure of the unit-modulus constraints, we propose a modified Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) algorithm for the discrete RIS phase shift optimization. Furthermore, the optimality of the proposed algorithm is validated under line-of-sight (LoS) channel conditions, and the irreducible MSE floor effect induced by imperfections of both hardware and CSI is also revealed in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Numerical results show the superior MSE performance of our proposed algorithm over the adopted benchmark schemes, and demonstrate that increasing the number of RIS elements is not always beneficial under the above system imperfections.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the downlink channel state information (CSI) sensing in 5G heterogeneous networks composed of user equipments (UEs) with different feedback capabilities. We aim to enhance the CSI accuracy of UEs only affording the low-resolution Type-I codebook. While existing works have demonstrated that the task can be accomplished by solving a phase retrieval (PR) formulation based on the feedback of precoding matrix indicator (PMI) and channel quality indicator (CQI), they need many feedback rounds. In this paper, we propose a novel CSI sensing scheme that can significantly reduce the feedback overhead. Our scheme involves a novel parameter dimension reduction design by exploiting the spatial consistency of wireless channels among nearby UEs, and a constrained PR (CPR) formulation that characterizes the feasible region of CSI by the PMI information. To address the computational challenge due to the non-convexity and the large number of constraints of CPR, we develop a two-stage algorithm that firstly identifies and removes inactive constraints, followed by a fast first-order algorithm. The study is further extended to multi-carrier systems. Extensive tests over DeepMIMO and QuaDriGa datasets showcase that our designs greatly outperform existing methods and achieve the high-resolution Type-II codebook performance with a few rounds of feedback.}

	abstract = {Due to the harsh propagation environment, limited bandwidth, and constrained battery life, transmission efficiency is a crucial issue for underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. This paper studies the link adaptation problem of a single UWA link by jointly selecting the transmission frequency and data rate. Since the current UWA channel lacks a universal model, we formulate this joint selection problem as a model-based stochastic multi-armed bandit (SMAB) problem. Thereafter, we propose three algorithms to solve this model-based SMAB problem under the settings of the stationary channel, non-stationary channel, and large arm (i.e., frequency and rate pair) space. For the stationary channel, we propose a unimodal objective-based Thompson sampling (UO-TS) algorithm by exploiting the unimodal feature of the objective function. For the non-stationary channel, we put forth a hybrid change detection UO-TS (HCD-UO-TS) algorithm based on the features of the unimodal objective function and non-stationary channel. For the large arm space, we propose an iterative boundary-shrinking TS (IBS-TS) algorithm by using the logistic regression-based arm classification model. These algorithms are all model-based and have low complexity and a fast convergence rate. In addition, we derive an upper regret bound for the UO-TS algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art bandit algorithms and are not sensitive to the arm space.}

	abstract = {Visible light positioning (VLP) is an accurate indoor positioning technology that uses luminaires as transmitters. In particular, circular luminaires are a common source type for VLP, which are typically treated only as point sources for positioning, while ignoring their geometry characteristics. In this paper, the arc feature of the circular luminaire and the coordinate information obtained via visible light communication (VLC) are jointly used for positioning, and a novel perspective arcs approach is proposed for VLC-enabled indoor positioning. The proposed approach does not rely on any inertial measurement unit and has no tilted angle limitation at the user. First, a VLC assisted perspective circle and arc algorithm (V-PCA) is proposed for a scenario in which a complete luminaire and an incomplete one can be captured by the user. Based on plane and solid geometry theory, the relationship between the luminaire and the user is exploited to estimate the orientation and the coordinate of the luminaire in the camera coordinate system. Then, the pose and location of the user in the world coordinate system are obtained by single-view geometry theory. Considering the cases in which parts of VLC links are blocked, an anti-occlusion VLC assisted perspective arcs algorithm (OA-V-PA) is proposed. In OA-V-PA, an approximation method is developed to estimate the projection of the luminaire’s center on the image and, then, to calculate the pose and location of the user. Simulation results show that the proposed indoor positioning algorithm can achieve a 90th percentile positioning accuracy of around 10 cm. Moreover, an experimental prototype is implemented to verify the feasibility. In the established prototype, a fused image processing method is proposed to simultaneously obtain the VLC information and the geometric information. Experimental results in the established prototype show that the average positioning accuracy is less than 5 cm for different tilted angles of the user.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the transmitter and receiver beamforming (TB and RB) for over-the-air computation (AirComp) in massive multiple-inputs and multiple-outputs (MIMO) systems. First, we propose a two-phase hybrid beamforming algorithm to design TB and hybrid RB. In the first phase, we adopt a projected gradient descent with momentum (PGDM) algorithm to search for the optimal fully-digital TB matrices. Compared with the benchmarks on the mean square error (MSE) performances, PGDM can achieve up to 5 dB gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less algorithm execution time when fully-digital RB is assumed. In the second phase, we plug the TB matrices obtained in PGDM as well as the optimal baseband RB (BBRB) matrix into the MSE objective, and adopt gradient descent to search for the optimal radio-frequency RB (RFRB) matrix. Compared with the state-of-the-arts, the proposed two-phase algorithm reduces up to 30% of the algorithm execution time and 18% of the MSE. Second, we propose a statistical TB algorithm to reduce the communication overheads, in which TB completely depends on statistical channel state information (CSI) and thus does not rely on the feedback from the base station (BS). We prove that orthonormal matrices are asymptotically optimal for statistical TB when uncorrelated Rayleigh channels are assumed and the number of receiving antennas approaches to infinity. For correlated channels, experimental results show that the proposed statistical TB can achieve about 5 dB gain in SNR compared with orthonormal matrices in terms of the MSE performance. Third, a large scale system analysis is made in this paper. As the number of the receiving antennas approaches to infinity, asymptotically optimal choices for TB and RB are provided, and upper bounds of MSE are derived in terms of the number of clients and receiving antennas. For hybrid RB, an upper bound of the squared distance between the optimal hybrid RB and the optimal fully-digital RB is also derived.}

	abstract = {In millimeter wave heterogeneous networks with integrated access and backhaul (mABHetNets), a considerable part of spectrum resources are occupied by the backhaul link, which limits the performance of the access link. In order to overcome such backhaul “ spectrum occupancy ”, we introduce cache into mABHetNets. Caching popular files at small base stations (SBSs) can offload the backhaul traffic and transfer spectrum from the backhaul link to the access link. To approach the optimal performance of cache-enabled mABHetNets, we first analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio distribution and derive the average potential throughput (APT) expression by stochastic geometric tools. Then, based on our analytical work, we formulate a joint optimization problem of cache decision and spectrum partition to maximize the APT. Inspired by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method, we propose a joint cache decision, spectrum partition and power allocation (JCSPA) algorithm to approach the optimal solution. Numerical results show the effectiveness and enhancement of the proposed algorithm. Besides, we verify the APT under different parameters and find that the introduction of cache facilitates the transfer of backhaul spectrum to access link. Jointly deploying appropriate caching capacity at SBSs and performing specified spectrum partition can bring up about 90% APT gain in mABHetNets.}

	abstract = {Satellite-aerial communication (SAC) is envisioned as a fundamental component of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Motivated by its importance, we investigate a SAC system including a geostationary satellite (S), a target aircraft (TA), and a set of interfering aircraft (IA). Specifically, TA sends signals to S in the presence of IA interference. Considering the trajectory, hierarchy, and safety distance of the aircraft’s flight routes, we propose a novel three-dimensional stacked Poisson line hardcore point process. That is, we introduce safety distances to the stacked Poisson line Cox process in order to describe the locations of IA in the sky. We also propose two approximations, namely, the equi-dense model and the discretization model, to maintain the tractability of the analysis. To this end, the uplink coverage probability is studied by using the two proposed mathematical models. Moreover, we investigate the coverage probability of the aviation use case with predefined flight altitudes. Finally, numerical results and Monte Carlo simulations are presented to validate the accuracy of the proposed analysis.}

	abstract = {We present a new online method to diagnose faulty elements in an antenna array quickly and reliably while a wireless communication system is under regular operation. Existing methods for fault diagnosis do not usually allow simultaneous operation and diagnosis, leading to downtime, which becomes a severe constraint for modern wireless systems. Our approach is based on exploiting an extra degree of freedom available in the frequency domain in modern multicarrier hybrid/digital precoding architectures by allocating a very small part of the available spectrum for diagnosis while the rest is used for regular operation. Measurements can be made in a single shot by using optimized inputs, thereby minimally disrupting regular operation. We address both fully and partially connected RF precoding architectures of hybrid precoders and introduce one and two-stage fault diagnosis procedures, respectively. While the faulty antennas for fully connected hybrid architectures or digital architectures are diagnosed employing ideas from sparse recovery, additional ideas from block-sparse recovery are used in the case of a partially connected architecture. Our results indicate that online array fault diagnosis is possible in both digital and hybrid precoding architectures by introducing simple digital operations into the system and by using a single fixed receiver measurement setup.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is an emerging technology to tackle time-frequency (TF) selective channel in high mobility scenarios. In OTFS, resource is multiplexed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. Based on the potential sparsity, separability, stability and compactness of the channel spreading function, OTFS is able to realize lower complexity of channel estimation, higher diversity and higher reliability compared with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However, the channel spreading function for practical communication systems is rarely considered in the current OTFS-related literature. High-speed railway (HSR) is a typical high mobility scenario with trains travelling at over 200km/h, which has the potential to employ OTFS. To this end, the HSR channel spreading function is characterized and the performance of OTFS in HSR is evaluated based on the realistic channel measurement in this article. Firstly, the HSR channel in TF domain is measured based on the long term evolution railway (LTE-R) network. Then, the characteristics of the channel spreading function are analyzed. In particular, the impact of time domain channel fading on the spreading function is investigated. The characteristics of the measured spreading function are analyzed with the proposed metrics in railway viaduct and tunnel scenarios. Based on the above analysis, an algorithm for generating the channel spreading function is proposed. Feasibility of the proposed DD domain channel generation algorithm is verified through comparing metrics of which to those of the measured channel. By simulating the bit error rate (BER) and mean square channel estimation error performances of OTFS modulation in the practical band-limited systems, it is shown that the impacts of Doppler shift, delay, SFFT and time domain channel fading need be considered for the application of OTFS modulation, in contrast to the state-of-art DD domain channel generation scheme based on tap delay link (TDL) model. For example, compared to OTFS modulation under the ideal channel spreading function, OTFS modulation requires a signal gain greater than 5 dB under the practical channel spreading function affected by above factors, to achieve the same BER less than 10−2 under parameters defined in simulation.}

	abstract = {Baseband processing algorithms often require knowledge of the noise power, signal power, or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In practice, these parameters are typically unknown and must be estimated. Furthermore, the mean-square error (MSE) is a desirable metric to be minimized in a variety of estimation and signal recovery algorithms. However, the MSE cannot directly be used as it depends on the true signal that is generally unknown to the estimator. In this paper, we propose novel blind estimators for the average noise power, average receive signal power, SNR, and MSE. The proposed estimators can be computed at low complexity and solely rely on the large-dimensional and sparse nature of the processed data. Our estimators can be used (i) to quickly track some of the key system parameters while avoiding additional pilot overhead, (ii) to design low-complexity nonparametric algorithms that require such quantities, and (iii) to accelerate more sophisticated estimation or recovery algorithms. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the proposed estimators for a Bernoulli complex Gaussian (BCG) prior, and we demonstrate their efficacy via synthetic experiments. We also provide three application examples that deviate from the BCG prior in millimeter-wave multi-antenna and cell-free wireless systems for which we develop nonparametric denoising algorithms that improve channel-estimation accuracy with a performance comparable to denoisers that assume perfect knowledge of the system parameters.}

	abstract = {Outdoor-to-indoor communications in millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular networks have been one challenging research problem due to the severe attenuation and the high penetration loss caused by propagation characteristics of mmWave signals. We propose a viable solution to implement the outdoor-to-indoor mmWave communication with the aid of an active intelligent transmitting surface (active-ITS), where the active-ITS allows the incoming signal from an outdoor base station (BS) to pass through the surface and be received by indoor users (UEs) after shifting its phase and magnifying its amplitude. Then, the problem of joint precoding of the BS and active-ITS is investigated to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the system. An efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm is developed to solve it with the suboptimal solutions in nearly closed-forms. In addition, to reduce the size and hardware cost of active-ITSs, we provide a block-amplifying architecture to partially remove the circuit components for power-amplifying, where multiple transmissive-type elements (TEs) in each block share the same power amplifier. Simulations indicate that active-ITS has the potential of achieving a given performance with much fewer TEs compared to the passive-ITS under the same total system power consumption, which makes it suitable for application to the space-limited and aesthetic-needed scenario, and the performance degradation caused by the block-amplifying architecture is negligible.}

We begin by proposing frequency asynchronous NOMA (FA-NOMA) as a basic system. The characteristics and challenges of FA-NOMA are then described. However, the challenges hinder the utilization of FA-NOMA in a practical environment. To further improve and utilize FA-NOMA in practice, we propose a novel sub-band filtered FA-NOMA (SBFA-NOMA) system. We also provide a new transceiver to implement SBFA-NOMA. Simulation results show that the proposed system can achieve performance improvement via gains in received power and degrees of freedom (DoF) compared to the power-domain NOMA (P-NOMA) system.}

In the AAS configuration, multiple passive antenna elements and radio units are integrated into a single box. This paper considers precoded downlink transmission over a single-cell MU-MIMO system. We study optimized linear precoding for AAS with a limited-capacity fronthaul, which requires the precoding matrix to be quantized. We propose a new precoding design that is aware of the fronthaul quantization and minimizes the mean-squared error at the receiver side. We compute the precoding matrix using a sphere decoding (SD) approach. We also propose a heuristic low-complexity approach to quantized precoding. This heuristic is computationally efficient enough for massive MIMO systems. The numerical results show that our proposed precoding significantly outperforms quantization-unaware precoding and other previous approaches in terms of the sum rate. The performance loss for our heuristic method compared to quantization-aware precoding is insignificant considering the complexity reduction, which makes the heuristic method feasible for real-time applications. We consider both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI).}

	abstract = {Beamforming for multi-antenna wireless communication systems has been widely studied and applied in practice. However, its performance in high mobility scenarios deteriorates dramatically due to severe channel aging. This issue stimulates the research of channel prediction in high mobility scenarios. This paper studies the general high-mobility Doppler domain wireless channel characterization and reveals that: 1) the Doppler frequency of the cluster corresponding to the near scatterers varies approximately linearly over short periods; 2) the linear-fitting characteristics of autoregressive model leads to poor channel prediction performance; 3) the parameter estimation algorithms of the chirp model which encompasses the characteristics are particularly complex. Given the shortcomings of existing works, this paper adopts the short-time Fourier transform to pre-estimate the parameter range and leverages the polynomial Fourier transform to obtain the initial values of the parameters. The downhill simplex algorithm is used to search for the fine-grained values of the parameters. In addition, the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is utilized to reconstruct the sparse signal. Evaluation results under the COST2100 channel model and a channel measurement campaign indicate that the proposed scheme can enhance the channel prediction accuracy or reduce the computing overhead compared to the existing matrix completion and polynomial iteration method.}

	abstract = {Differential space-time coding methods have been investigated for ultra-wideband communication systems to avoid channel estimation. However, their performance in the line-of-sight (LOS) environment is worse than the recently proposed orientational beamforming (OBF) system under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). On the other hand, the OBF system cannot work well in the non-LOS (NLOS) environment. To address these issues, a hybrid differential detection (HDD) scheme is proposed in this paper, which combines the OBF system with a proposed differential OBF (DOBF) system. First, the DOBF system with a fully differential detection scheme is proposed, whose performance is almost the same as the differential space-time block coding method. However, its detection complexity only linearly increases with the number of transmitting antennas. Then, the HDD scheme is proposed, with its decision statistic being a combination of a modified OBF decision statistic and the DOBF decision statistic. In the NLOS environment, the HDD scheme is reduced to the DOBF system. In the LOS environment, a combination coefficient is obtained by mapping an SNR-related factor through a sigmoid function. The optimal parameters for the sigmoid function are determined through simulations, with which the proposed HDD scheme can achieve overall better performance than the OBF and DOBF systems.}

Hence, in this paper, we employ UAVs as aerial base stations to transmit data to ground users (GUs) via air to ground (A2G) communication links, where we show how content awareness can help improve the data rate. Specifically, we design two content-sharing (CS) data transmission schemes to improve the average data rate of the GUs. Additionally, two UAV deployment strategies, namely the fixed-point deployment scheme and traverse-search deployment scheme, are proposed based on the proposed CS transmission schemes. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed data transmission schemes combined with their proposed deployment schemes outperform the traditional transmission scheme by 26 bits/s/Hz and 51 bits/s/Hz, respectively.}

	abstract = {In 5G, multi-access edge computing enables the applications to be offloaded to near-end edge servers for faster response. According to the 3GPP standards, users in 5G are separated into many types, e.g., vehicles, AR/VR, IoT devices, etc. Specifically, the high-priority traffic can preempt edge resources to guarantee the service quality. However, even if a traffic is transmitted with low priority, its latency requirement in 5G is much lower than that in 4G. Too strict latency requirement and priority-based service make resource configuration difficult on the edge side. Therefore, we propose the edge-cloud offloading mechanism, in which each edge server can offload tasks to back-end cloud server to ensure service quality of both high- and low-priority traffic. In this paper, we establish a priority-based queuing system to model the edge-cloud offloading behaviors. Based on the formulation of our system model, we propose Knapsack Potential Game (KPG) to derive an optimal offloading ratio for each edge server to balance the cost-effectiveness of the overall system. We demonstrate that KPG has low computational complexity and outperforms two baseline algorithms. The results indicate that KPG’s performance is optimal and provides a theoretical guideline to operators while designing their edge-cloud offloading strategies without large-scale implementation.}

However, the energy waste occurring during low traffic periods can be mitigated through Advanced Sleep Modes (ASMs) that make the BSs enter into progressively deeper and less consuming sleep modes. Deep sleep modes, unfortunately, have longer reactivation times, and may jeopardize service quality. In this paper, focusing on 5G latency requirements in low traffic periods, we propose a framework to dynamically adapt the ASM configuration settings to the actual traffic load so as to meet a desired constraint on the average BS reactivation delay.}

An energy consumption minimization problem is formulated under some constraints including users’ quality of service and information security requirements and the UAV’s trajectory’s causality, by jointly optimizing the CPU frequency, the offloading time, the beamforming vectors, the artificial noise and the trajectory of the UAV, as well as the CPU frequency, the offloading time and the transmit power of each user. To solve the non-convex problem, a reformulated problem is first derived by a series of convex reformation methods, i.e., semi-definite relaxation, S-Procedure and first-order approximation, and then, solved by a proposed successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm. The convergence performance and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing benchmark schemes. Besides, the proposed SCA-based algorithm is superior to traditional alternative optimization-based algorithm.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a paradigm of uncertainty injection for training deep learning model to solve robust optimization problems. The majority of existing studies on deep learning focus on the model learning capability, while assuming the quality and accuracy of the inputs data can be guaranteed. However, in realistic applications of deep learning for solving optimization problems, the accuracy of inputs, which are the problem parameters in this case, plays a large role. This is because, in many situations, it is often costly or sometime impossible to obtain the problem parameters accurately, and correspondingly, it is highly desirable to develop learning algorithms that can account for the uncertainties in the input and produce solutions that are robust against these uncertainties. This paper presents a novel uncertainty injection scheme for training machine learning models that are capable of implicitly accounting for the uncertainties and producing statistically robust solutions. We further identify the wireless communications as an application field where uncertainties are prevalent in problem parameters such as the channel coefficients. We show the effectiveness of the proposed training scheme in two applications: the robust power loading for multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink transmissions; and the robust power control for device-to-device (D2D) networks.}

	abstract = {Using ideas from Generalized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) analyses and extremal network theory, this work studies the extremal gain of optimal power control over binary (on/off) power control, especially in large interference networks, in search of new theoretical insights. Whereas numerical studies have already established that in most practical settings binary power control is close to optimal, the extremal analysis shows not only that there exist settings where the gain from optimal power control can be quite significant, but also bounds the extremal values of such gains from a GDoF perspective. As its main contribution, this work explicitly characterizes the extremal GDoF gain of optimal over binary power control as \\Theta (\\sqrt {K})\nfor all K\n. In particular, the extremal gain is bounded between \\lfloor \\sqrt {K}\\rfloor\nand 2.5\\sqrt {K}\nfor every K\n. For K=2,3,4,5,6\nusers, the precise extremal gain is found to be 1, 3/2, 2, 9/4 and 41/16, respectively. Networks shown to achieve the extremal gain may be interpreted as multi-tier heterogeneous networks. It is worthwhile to note that because of their focus on asymptotic analysis, the sharp characterizations of extremal gains are valuable primarily from a theoretical perspective, and not as contradictions to the conventional wisdom that binary power control is generally close to optimal in practical, non-asymptotic settings.}

	abstract = {In physical-layer security, secrecy capacity is an important performance metric. This work aims to determine the secrecy capacity for an indoor visible light communication system consisting of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropping receiver. In such a system, both signal-independent noise and signal-dependent noise are considered. Under nonnegativity and average optical intensity constraints, lower and upper bounds on secrecy capacity are derived by the variational method, the dual expression of the secrecy capacity, and the concept of “the optimal input distribution that escapes to infinity”. By an asymptotic analysis at large optical intensity, there is a small gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds. Then, by adding a peak optical intensity constraint, we further analyze the exact and asymptotic secrecy-capacity bounds. For practical considerations, the effects of imperfect channel state information, multi-photodiode eavesdropper, and artificial noise on secrecy performance are also discussed. Finally, the derived secrecy-capacity bounds are verified by numerical results.}

	abstract = {The combination of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned as a promising paradigm to improve network capacity and enhance coverage capability. However, to reap full benefits of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO, the main challenge is to efficiently design cooperative beamforming (CBF) at base stations (BSs), RISs, and users. Firstly, we investigate the fractional programing to convert the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem into a tractable optimization problem. Then, the alternating optimization framework is employed to decompose the transformed problem into a sequence of subproblems, i.e., hybrid BF (HBF) at BSs, passive BF at RISs, and combining at users. In particular, the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is utilized to solve the HBF subproblem at BSs. Concretely, the analog BF design with unit-modulus constraints is solved by the manifold optimization (MO) while we obtain a closed-form solution to the digital BF design that is essentially a convex least-square problem. Additionally, the passive BF at RISs and the analog combining at users are designed by primal-dual subgradient and MO methods. Moreover, considering heavy communication costs in conventional CF-mMIMO systems, we propose a partially-connected CF-mMIMO (P-CF-mMIMO) framework to decrease the number of connections among BSs and users. To better compromise WSR performance and network costs, we formulate the BS selection problem in the P-CF-mMIMO system as a binary integer quadratic programming (BIQP) problem, and develop a relaxed linear approximation algorithm to handle this BIQP problem. Finally, numerical results demonstrate superiorities of our proposed algorithms over baseline counterparts.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes an over-the-air aggregation framework for federated learning (FL) in broadband wireless networks where not only edge devices but also a base station (BS) has its own local dataset. The proposed framework leverages the BS dataset to improve communication efficiency of FL by reducing the number of channel uses required for the model convergence as well as avoiding the signaling overhead incurred by power scale coordination among edge devices. We analyze the convergence to a stationary point without convexity assumption on the objective function. The analysis result reveals that the utilization of BS dataset improves the convergence rate and the update distortion caused by the limited power budget is a crucial factor hindering the model convergence. To facilitate the convergence, we develop an optimized power control method by solving the distortion minimization problem without assumptions on power scale coordination and global CSI at BS. Our simulation results validate that BS dataset is beneficial to reducing the number of channel uses for the model convergence and the developed power control method outperforms the conventional method in terms of both convergence rate and converged test accuracy. Furthermore, we identify some scenarios where the compression of local update can be helpful to reduce communication resources for model training.}

One critical application of 5G C-V2X is the direct exchange of safety-critical messages between vehicles to prevent crashes and correspondingly reduce roadway injuries and fatalities. While current C-V2X security protocols concern only message payloads, we expose vulnerabilities in the physical-layer attributes and decentralized MAC-layer scheduling algorithm of 5G C-V2X by developing two stealthy denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to exploit them. These low-duty-cycle attacks dramatically degrade C-V2X availability, increasing the likelihood of prolonged travel times and even vehicle crashes. We further develop detection and mitigation techniques for each attack, in part by exploiting new C-V2X features of 3GPP Rel-17. We experimentally evaluate our attacks and countermeasures in a hardware testbed composed of USRPs and state-of-the-art C-V2X kits as well as through extensive network and roadway simulations, showing that within seconds of initiation our attacks can reduce a target’s packet delivery ratio by 90% or that of the C-V2X channel to under 25%. We further evaluate our machine-learning detection and low-cost mitigation techniques, showing the latter completely thwart one attack and reduce the impact of the other by 80%, providing insight towards developing a more robust 5G C-V2X.}

The objective of this work is to achieve a trade-off between the cost for providing caching services and the content transmission latency. Doing so, there are two challenges: 1) Which UEs can be selected as caching nodes; 2) How to place contents on these selected UEs without user’s privacy disclosure. To address these, a novel community detection and attention-weighted federated learning based proactive edge caching (CAFLPC) strategy is proposed. In the strategy, we first group UEs into different communities based on both the mobility and social properties of UEs, and then select important users (IUs) as caching nodes for each community by considering the social importance of UEs. To determine how to place the popular contents in these selected IUs, an attention-weighted federated learning (AWFL) based content popularity prediction framework is proposed. It integrates the attention-weighted federated learning with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Network (AWFL_BiLSTM) to achieve a higher content popularity prediction accuracy while protecting user’s privacy. Considering the imbalance of UEs’ active levels and local computing capacities, an attention-weighted aggregation mechanism is proposed to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Simulations results show that the proposed CAFLPC strategy outperforms the compared existing caching strategies at about 2.2%-35.1% in terms of the transmission latency reduced by per unit cost.}

	abstract = {Energy efficiency and service reliability are two critical requirements for 5G New Radio cellular access. To address the latter, 3GPP has proposed multiconnectivity operation allowing user equipment (UE) to maintain active links to more than a single base station. However, the use of this technique compromises the energy efficiency of UE. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model capturing key energy and performance indicators as a function of system and environmental conditions. Then, we apply it to investigate the trade-offs between user performance and energy efficiency as well as the effect of scaling of discontinuous reception (DRX) timers. For a considered set of system parameters, our results reveal that for low micromobility speed\n≤\n0.1\n∘\n/s and blockers density,\n≤0.1\nbl./\nm\n2\ntwo simultaneously supported links with minimal DRX timers lead to optimal performance. For higher blockers density more than two links are needed to optimize energy efficiency while for high micromobility speed multiconnectivity does not allow to improve energy efficiency at all. Thus, the optimal degree of multiconnectivity and DRX timer scaling coefficients depend on the environmental characteristics including both micromobility speed and density of blockers and need to be dynamically updated during UE operation.}

Considering the distance difference between satellite and nearby destinations is negligible, the main and wiretapping channels between satellite and IoT node are similar, it poses great challenges to reach physical layer security in satellite-assisted IoT networks. In this paper, to guarantee secure transmissions for satellite-assisted IoT downlink communications, the multi-domain resource multiplexing based secure approach is proposed. Particularly, the self-induced co-channel interference between adjacent nodes is leveraged to increase the difference of signal transmission quality over both main and wiretapping channels. By comprehensively optimizing multi-domain resources, i.e., frequency, power, and spatial domains, secure transmissions from satellite to IoT nodes are reached. Specifically, the problem to maximize the sum secrecy rate of IoT nodes is formulated with a constraint of common communication rate of IoT nodes. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with two inner successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms are executed to solve the power allocation, spectral multiplexing, and precoding. In addition, simulation results are carried out to evaluate the secrecy rate performance and verify the efficiency of our proposed approach.}

	abstract = {With the development of autonomous driving, task offloading of Internet of vehicles has become a hot research issue. In pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenarios, characteristics of tasks are constantly changing due to the influence of pedestrians and road conditions. Real-time offloading optimization and signaling are time-consuming, which may not meet the low delay requirement of task offloading. Therefore, this paper proposes a location prediction-based resource optimization scheme for task offloading in these scenarios. Firstly, the locations of pedestrians are predicted by the social force model based on their movement rules, and the locations of vehicles are predicted by the car-following model on the basis of ensuring pedestrian safety. The characteristics of tasks are obtained based on the predicted locations of vehicles. Then a neural network trained beforehand based on deep Q-learning is used to obtain a task offloading strategy. Since the tasks are obtained by prediction in advance, this strategy decision can be processed before vehicles arriving the predicted locations, which saves the time consumption of optimization and signaling. Besides, simulation results show that the proposed scheme still guarantees an acceptably low task offloading delay compared with the other methods, especially in congested areas.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising interdisciplinary technology that realizes simultaneously transmitting Terabit-per-second (Tbps) and millimeter-level accurate environment or human activity sensing. However, both communication performance and sensing accuracy are influenced by the Doppler effects, which are especially severe in the THz band. Moreover, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) degrades the THz power amplifier (PA) efficiency. In this paper, a discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal time frequency space (DFT-s-OTFS) system with superimposed pilots is proposed to improve the robustness to Doppler effects and reduce PAPR for THz ISAC. Then, a two-phase sensing parameter estimation algorithm is developed to integrate sensing functionality into the DFT-s-OTFS waveform. Meanwhile, a low-complexity iterative channel estimation and data detection method with a conjugate gradient based equalizer is proposed to recover the data symbols of DFT-s-OTFS. The proposed DFT-s-OTFS waveform can improve the PA efficiency by 10% on average compared to OTFS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-phase sensing estimation algorithm for THz DFT-s-OTFS systems is able to realize millimeter-level range estimation accuracy and decimeter-per-second-level velocity estimation accuracy. Moreover, the effectiveness of the iterative method for data detection aided by superimposed pilots in DFT-s-OTFS systems is validated by the simulations and the bit error rate performance is not degraded by the Doppler effects.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the localization of a constant velocity moving object in 3-D using angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements. Compared with the maximum-likelihood estimator, pseudo-linear approach for AOA localization has a large amount of bias resulting from the model transformation to simplify the solution finding. This work aims at reducing the bias and developing bias-reduced semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods for estimating the initial position and velocity of the object, in a batch or sequential manner. This is accomplished by first formulating a bias reduced constrained weighted least squares (BR-CWLS) problem from the transformed measurements, through introducing an auxiliary variable and adding a quadratic constraint. Such an intractable non-convex problem is tackled next by applying the SDR technique and relaxing it into a convex semidefinite program (SDP), which is shown to be capable of reaching the solution of the original BR-CWLS problem. For sequential estimation, we formulate a different BR-CWLS problem and utilize SDR for obtaining a sequential estimation method that updates the initial position and velocity estimates at each time step. We conduct the mean square error (MSE) and bias analyses for both estimation methods to assess their expected performance. Simulation results verify the ability of bias reduction and the good performance of the proposed methods.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we aim to design an effective learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems from a physics-inspired perspective. We first argue that the CSI matrix of a MIMO-OFDM system is physically closer to a two-dimensional (2-D) sequence rather than an image due to its apparent unsmoothness, non-scalability, and translational variance within both the spatial and frequency domains. On this basis, we introduce a 2-D long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to represent the CSI and propose a 2-D sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for CSI compression and reconstruction. Specifically, one two-layer 2-D LSTM is used for CSI feature extraction, and the other is used for CSI representation and reconstruction. The proposed scheme can not only fully utilize the unique 2-D characteristics of CSI but also preserve the index information and unsmooth features of the CSI matrix compared with current convolutional neural network (CNN) based schemes. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is linear in the number of transmit antennas and subcarriers. Its key performances, like reconstruction accuracy, convergence speed, generalization ability after short-term training, and robustness to lossy feedback, are comprehensively compared with existing popular convolutional networks. Experimental results show that our scheme can bring up to nearly 7 dB gain in reconstruction accuracy under the same overhead and reduce feedback overhead by up to 75% under the same accuracy compared with the conventional CNN-based approaches.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose sensing-assisted beamforming designs for vehicles on arbitrarily shaped roads by relying on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signalling. Specifically, we aim to address the limitations of conventional ISAC beam-tracking schemes that do not apply to complex road geometries. To improve the tracking accuracy and communication quality of service (QoS) in vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) networks, it is essential to model the complicated roadway geometry. To that end, we impose the curvilinear coordinate system (CCS) in an interacting multiple model extended Kalman filter (IMM-EKF) framework. By doing so, both the position and the motion of the vehicle on a complicated road can be explicitly modeled and precisely tracked attributing to the benefits from the CCS. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the array gain by dynamically adjusting the array size and thereby controlling the beamwidth, which takes the performance loss caused by beam misalignment into account. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the roadway geometry-aware ISAC beamforming approach outperforms the communication-only-based and ISAC kinematic-only-based technique in tracking performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the dynamic beamwidth design is also verified by our numerical results.}

First, we assume a Perfect Packet Recovery Scenario (PPRS) for which the received packets are decoded with no errors when there is no interference. We introduce Battery Outage Probability (BOP) as an extra performance metric; and, we derive the optimal EH-CSA transmission policies, which offer the maximum attainable traffic load while maintaining an asymptotically negligible Packet Loss Ratio (PLR), under specific rate and BOP constraints. We extend our study to Imperfect Packet Recovery Scenario (IPRS) where impairments at the physical layer, including channel estimation and channel decoding errors, will distort messages being passed through the iterative Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) process. The distorted messages being passed through the SIC process potentially lead to error propagation. In order to track the error propagation process, we define the concept of Accumulated Noise plus Interference Power (ANIP), and analytically track the evolution of its probability distribution. We employ our results to evaluate the bit error rates for different transmission policies for the case of IPRS. We also demonstrate the advantages of the optimal transmission policies through numerical examples for both PPRS and IPRS. Our results show that the optimal EH-CSA policies outperform the policies optimized for standard CSA without EH considerations, and the schemes that are optimal for PPRS are not necessarily optimal for the IPRS case. Furthermore, the EH-CSA optimal policies strictly outperform standard CRDSA when the system is required to support higher traffic loads.}

Considering the spatial correlation between transmitters (TXs) and RISs, their locations are jointly modelled by a Gauss-Poisson process (GPP). Two association strategies, i.e., nearest association and fixed association, are both discussed. For the RIS-aided transmission, the signal power distribution with a direct link is approximated by a gamma random variable using a moment matching method, and the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference power is derived in closed form. Based on these expressions, we analyze the channel hardening effect in the RIS-assisted transmission, the coverage probability, and the average achievable rate of the typical user. We derive the coverage probability expressions for the fixed association strategy and the nearest association strategy in an interference-limited scenario in closed form. Numerical results are provided to validate the analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-assisted transmission with passive beamforming in improving the system performance. Furthermore, it is also unveiled that the system performance is independent of the density of TXs with the nearest association strategy in the interference-limited scenario.}

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provide potential communication opportunities by reflecting and enhancing the signal, thus increasing SNs’ energy efficiency. This paper investigates energy-efficient data collection aided by\nN\nRIS elements, where a height-fixed and flight time-constrained UAV is considered as the collector, a tractable air-to-ground channel model is established considering the cascaded RIS channel and time-varying trajectory of UAV, and maximum energy consumption of SNs is minimized. Specifically, coupling two intractable fourth-order moment variables, the air-to-ground channel model is processed into an easily computable expression through the Gamma function. Furthermore, based on the proposed two RIS deployment schemes, maximum energy consumption of SNs minimization problem is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (NMNP) problem with optimization of UAV trajectory and SNs wake-up schedules. Additionally, through the slack technique and Taylor expansion, the NMNP problem is decoupled as linear programming and quadratically constrained quadratic programming, and an effective algorithm is designed to obtain the sub-optimal solution. Simulations prove the validity of our algorithm and RIS deployment insights are given for SNs energy saving.}

Since the learning performance improves as more devices participate in the federated learning aggregation, we formulate a beamforming vector optimization problem that maximizes the number of selected devices under a given target aggregation mean-squared error. This AirComp uplink beamforming problem with device selection is shown to have the same form as the downlink multicast beamforming problem with user selection, which establishes the AirComp-multicasting duality. We design a low-complexity algorithm based on the projected subgradient method that is orders of magnitude faster than conventional semidefinite relaxation-based algorithms and faster than local model training on the devices, which makes it possible to implement the proposed wireless federated learning in real time. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm provides significant multiple antenna beamforming gains and achieves the performance of the ideal federated learning system with no aggregation errors.}

	abstract = {In an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless power transfer (WPT) system, a practical architecture of an energy receiver (ER) is proposed, which includes multiple receive antennas, an analog energy combiner, a power splitter and multiple energy harvesters. In order to maximise the output direct-current (DC) power, the transmit beamformer of the transmitter, the passive beamformer of the IRS, the energy combiner, and the power splitter of the ER are jointly optimised. The optimisation problem is equivalently divided into two sub-problems, which independently maximises the input RF power and the output DC power of the energy harvesters, respectively. A successive linear approximation (SLA) based algorithm with a low complexity is proposed to maximise the input RF power to the energy harvesters, which converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. We also propose an improved greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (I-GRASP) based algorithm having better performance to maximise the input RF power. Furthermore, the optimal power splitter for maximising the output DC power of the energy harvesters is derived in closed-form. The numerical results are provided to verify the performance advantage of the IRS-aided WPT and to demonstrate that conceiving the optimised energy combiner achieves better WPT performance than the deterministic counterpart.}

Combining with flexibly deployed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the UAV-aided ambient backscatter communication can establish wireless links for isolated IoT nodes efficiently. In this paper, we investigate the outage performance of the UAV-aided air-ground network with underlaid ambient backscatter communications, where the emitted signals from the air-ground link are leveraged as radio frequency (RF) carrier for ambient backscattering. The air-ground channel is modeled as a probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel with Nakagami- m\nfading. Then, the ground communication is modeled as a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel with Rayleigh fading. For the downlink, we derive the expressions of the outage probabilities of the backscatter link and the air-ground link. In addition, the asymptotic cases of infinite transmit power and infinite fading parameter are analyzed. For the uplink, the outage probabilities of the backscatter link and air-ground are analyzed, with the cases of infinite transmit power and fading parameter discussed. Simulation results show that the analytical results match well with the Monte Carlo results, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted secure multiuser communication systems in the presence of hardware impairments (HIs) at the RIS and the transceivers. We jointly optimize the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the phase shifts of the reflecting elements at the RIS so as to maximize the weighted minimum approximate ergodic secrecy rate (WMAESR), subject to the transmission power constraints at the BS and unit-modulus constraints at the RIS. To solve the formulated optimization problem, we first decouple it into two tractable subproblems and then use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to alternately optimize the subproblems. Two different methods are proposed to solve the two obtained subproblems. The first method transforms each subproblem into a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem by invoking the penalty convex–concave procedure (CCP) method and the closed-form fractional programming (FP) criterion, and then directly solves them by using CVX. The second method leverages the minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm. Specifically, we first derive a concave approximation function, which is a lower bound of the original objective function, and then the two subproblems are transformed into two simple surrogate problems that admit closed-form solutions. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed robust transmission methods over existing non-robust designs. In addition, the MM algorithm is shown to have much lower complexity than the SOCP-based algorithm.}

Assuming that proper data links have been established during the initial access stage for DL or UL traffic, we consider the beamforming problem for UL or DL whose payload traffic is much lighter than the other link. Such asymmetric traffic allows part of the massive MIMO array to be deactivated in order to achieve a higher energy efficiency (EE) while still meeting the spectrum efficiency (SE) requirements for UL or DL. To deal with such a problem, we propose the corresponding phase shifter (PS) deactivation strategies based on different SE constraints for individual mobile stations or users independently, which select the PSs to be deactivated accordingly with low computational complexity. We then propose a novel codebook design method, which relies on the iteratively updated average main beam gain, in order to pursue a flatter beam under asymmetric DL-UL traffic that interacts with the corresponding PS deactivation strategy. The proposed codebook not only offers flexible beam width and flat main beam gain, but also can generate some good candidate codewords to account for the need of beam refinements, after some of the PSs have been deactivated. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed energy efficient PS deactivation approach and the corresponding codebook design.}

Then, we show that the asymptotic minimum mean square error (MMSE) of the channel estimation can be minimized if the array response vectors of the user terminals (UTs) that use the same pilot are orthogonal. Inspired by this, we design an efficient graph-based pilot allocation strategy to enhance the channel estimation performance. In addition, we devise a novel two-stage channel estimation (TSCE) approach, in which the received signals at the satellite are manipulated with per-subcarrier space domain processing followed by per-user frequency domain processing. Moreover, the space domain processing of each UT is shown to be identical for all the subcarriers, and an asymptotically optimal vector for the per-subcarrier space domain linear processing is derived. The frequency domain processing can be efficiently implemented by means of the fast Toeplitz system solver. Simulation results show that the proposed TSCE approach can achieve a near performance to the MMSE estimation with much lower complexity.}

	abstract = {Distributed power allocation is important for interference-limited wireless networks with dense transceiver pairs. In this paper, we aim to design low signaling overhead distributed power allocation schemes by using graph neural networks (GNNs), which are scalable to the number of wireless links. We first apply the message passing neural network (MPNN), a unified framework of GNN, to solve the problem. We show that the signaling overhead grows quadratically as the network size increases. Inspired from the over-the-air computation (AirComp), we then propose an Air-MPNN framework, where the messages from neighboring nodes are represented by the transmit power of pilots and can be aggregated efficiently by evaluating the total interference power. The signaling overhead of Air-MPNN grows linearly as the network size increases, and we prove that Air-MPNN is permutation invariant. To further reduce the signaling overhead, we propose the Air message passing recurrent neural network (Air-MPRNN), where each node utilizes the graph embedding and local state in the previous frame to update the graph embedding in the current frame. Since existing communication systems send a pilot during each frame, Air-MPRNN can be integrated into the existing standards by adjusting pilot power. Simulation results validate the scalability of the proposed frameworks, and show that they outperform the existing power allocation algorithms in terms of sum-rate for various system parameters.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we design the physical layer security of a dual-hop spatial modulation system provided the relay node transmits its own private information. Meanwhile, the quadrature virtual channel spatial modulation (QVCSM) is proposed to enhance the physical layer security in the second hop. To achieve system security in both angle and range dimensions, the frequency diverse array (FDA) is used in the relay node with a decode-and-forward (DF) protocol. Moreover, the baseband directional modulation (DM) and artificial noise (AN) are jointly utilized to suppress the received signal at the passive eavesdropper. Additionally, the Ergodic secrecy rate of the proposed system is analyzed, whereas the closed-form expressions for tight upper bounds on the bit error rates (BERs) of the source and relay are derived for both the destination and eavesdropper. The simulation results show that the proposed FDA relay design outperforms the traditional phase array (PA) relay system in terms of the system secrecy rate. In contrast to the quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) method, the proposed designs achieve an improved suppression performance of the eavesdropper.}

In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem for the conceived mmWave MEC system with dynamic offloading process, in which the UEs are characterized by being mobile and having the imperfect knowledge of the offloading tasks coming. By introducing the multi-objective Markov decision process (MOMDP), the resource allocation problem is modeled by simultaneously minimizing the delay and energy consumption, where jointly considering the multi-beam assignment (mBA) and beamwidth and power optimization (BPO). To tackle this problem, we innovatively propose a matching-aided-learning (MaL) resource allocation scheme, with the aid of a learnable weight based attention mechanism (LW-AM) for adapting the dynamic offloading process. In particular, our MaL scheme includes many-to-one matching (M2O-M) based mBA algorithm and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based BPO algorithm, which are executed iteratively and converge with relatively low number of iterations. The simulation results show the practical value of the proposed MaL, which can approach the performance of benchmark scheme with perfect knowledge of offloading tasks.}

It is relevant for the design of compact multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas that can achieve channel capacity bounds when constrained by size. The method is not restricted to a specific antenna configuration and a closed-form expression for the channel capacity limits are provided with various constraints. Furthermore, using loaded N\n-port structures to represent arbitrary antenna geometries, an efficient optimization approach is proposed for finding the optimal MIMO antenna design that achieves the channel capacity bounds.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided uplink multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where the receiver is assumed to conduct low-complexity iterative detection. We aim to minimize the total transmit power by jointly designing the precoder of the transmitter and the passive beamforming of the RIS. This problem can be tackled from the perspective of information theory. But this information-theoretic approach may involve prohibitively high complexity since the number of rate constraints that specify the capacity region of the uplink multiuser channel is exponential in the number of users. To avoid this difficulty, we formulate the design problem of the iterative receiver under the constraints of a maximal iteration number and target bit error rates of users. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a groupwise successive interference cancellation (SIC) optimization approach, where the signals of users are decoded and canceled in a group-by-group manner. We present a heuristic user grouping strategy, and resort to the alternating optimization technique to iteratively solve the precoding and passive beamforming sub-problems. Specifically, for the precoding sub-problem, we employ fractional programming to convert it to a convex problem; for the passive beamforming sub-problem, we adopt successive convex approximation to deal with the unit-modulus constraints of the RIS. We show that the proposed groupwise SIC approach has significant advantages in both performance and computational complexity, as compared with the counterpart approaches.}

	abstract = {A fundamental issue of the vehicular digital twin (DT) is efficiently synchronizing the data between the DT and the vehicular user (VUE). In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNets) in which a VUE can connect to the network through different networks. The HetVNets can improve the efficiency of communication by providing seamless connections. However, the uneven distribution of VUEs and the dynamics of HetVNets make the environment more complex. Therefore, we propose the network selection algorithm for data synchronization between VUEs and DTs in the HetVNets, where the behaviour between the VUEs is considered as a competition for wireless resources. A learning-based prediction model residing in the DT is developed where the DT can predict the waiting time of each relay and transmit the predicted results to the VUE for decision-making. We model the network selection problem as a potential game considering both the transmission time and the waiting time obtained from the prediction model and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE). We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulation results show that our approach can effectively find the optimal strategy while achieving a fast convergence speed and high-level performance compared to the baselines.}

The goal is to maximize the sum-rate of whole trajectories for the multi-robot system by jointly optimizing trajectories and NOMA decoding orders of robots, phase-shift coefficients of the RIS, and the power allocation of the AP, subject to predicted initial and final positions of robots and the quality of service (QoS) of each robot. To tackle this problem, an integrated machine learning (ML) scheme is proposed, which combines long short-term memory (LSTM)-autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and dueling double deep Q-network (\nD\n3\nQN) algorithm. For initial and final position prediction for robots, the LSTM-ARIMA is able to overcome the problem of gradient vanishment of non-stationary and non-linear sequences of data. For jointly determining the phase shift matrix and robots’ trajectories,\nD\n3\nQN is invoked for solving the problem of action value overestimation. Based on the proposed scheme, each robot holds an optimal trajectory based on the maximum sum-rate of a whole trajectory, which reveals that robots pursue long-term benefits for whole trajectory design. Numerical results demonstrated that: 1) LSTM-ARIMA model provides high accuracy predicting model; 2) The proposed\nD\n3\nQN algorithm can achieve fast average convergence; and 3) RIS-NOMA networks have superior network performance compared to RIS-aided orthogonal counterparts.}

	abstract = {The large overhead arising from conventional channel estimations in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided millimeter-wave communication systems, may offset the performance gain brought by the RIS. To tackle this issue, we propose a location information assisted beamforming design without the requirement of the channel training process. First, we establish the geometrical relationship between the channel model and the user location, and mathematically derive an approximate channel state information (CSI) error bound based on the user location error region. Then, for combating the negative impact of the location error on the communication performance, we formulate a worst-case robust beamforming optimization problem to optimize the beamformer at the base station (BS) and the phase-shift matrix at the RIS. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a novel relaxed alternating optimization process (RAOP) by utilizing various optimization tools, such as the Lagrange multiplier, the matrix inversion lemma, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR), as well as the branch-and-bound (BnB). Additionally, we prove sufficient conditions for the SDR to yield rank-one solutions, and modify the BnB to acquire the phase-shift solution under an arbitrary constraint of possible phase-shift values. Finally, we analyse the convergence and complexity of the proposed RAOP, and carry out simulations for performance evaluations. Compared to the conventional non-robust beamforming, our method performs better and shows strong robustness against the location-error-related CSI uncertainty. Compared to the robust beamforming based on the S-procedure and penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP), our method with BnB shows the advantages of being able to converge faster and handle arbitrary phase-shift argument sets.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the sum spectral efficiency maximization problem in downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems with low-resolution quantizers at an access point (AP) and users. We consider rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance spectral efficiency by offering opportunities to boost achievable degree-of-freedom. Optimizing RSMA precoders, however, is highly challenging due to the minimum rate constraint when determining the common rate. The quantization errors coupled with the precoders make the problem more complicated. In this paper, we develop a novel RSMA precoding algorithm incorporating quantization errors for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency. To this end, we first obtain an approximate spectral efficiency in a smooth function. Subsequently, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the form of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP). We propose a computationally efficient algorithm to find the principal eigenvector of the NEP as a sub-optimal solution. We also extend the weighted minimum mean square error-based RSMA precoding to the considered quantization system. Simulation results validate the proposed methods. The key benefit of using RSMA over spatial division multiple access (SDMA) comes from the ability of the common stream to balance between the channel gain and quantization error in multiuser MIMO systems with different quantization resolutions.}

SEFDM is a non-orthogonal multicarrier technique created by compressing the subcarrier spacing of classical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). SEFDM provides high spectrum efficiency (SE) at the expense of increased inter-carrier interference (ICI). SEFDM with index modulation (SEFDM-IM) has two information-bearing units, that is, a subcarrier activation pattern and modulated symbols, which reduce ICI at the expense of an SE deficit owing to inactive subcarriers. The proposed SEFDM-DM uses all available subcarriers while retaining the diversity gain of index modulation (IM). It enhances SE by transmitting distinct constellation modes through a subcarrier index selection mechanism. This study also presents SEFDM-DM with coordinate interleaving (SEFDM-CDM), which introduces space-time block codes with coordinate interleaving to enhance transmission diversity by sending real and imaginary parts of the constellation symbols over different subcarriers. Analytical and simulation results corroborate the benefits of the suggested work in terms of SE and bit error rate.}

To efficiently support various competing services, namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low-latency (uRLLC), the ORAN Alliance has introduced a standard approach toward more virtualized, open, and intelligent networks. To realize the benefits of ORAN in optimizing resource utilization, this paper studies an intelligent traffic steering (TS) scheme within the proposed disaggregated ORAN architecture. For this purpose, we propose a joint intelligent traffic prediction, flow-split distribution, dynamic user association, and radio resource management (JIFDR) framework in the presence of unknown dynamic traffic demands. To adapt to dynamic environments on different time scales, we decompose the formulated optimization problem into two long-term and short-term subproblems, where the optimality of the latter is strongly dependent on the optimal dynamic traffic demand. We then apply a long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to effectively solve the long-term subproblem, aiming to predict dynamic traffic demands, RAN slicing, and flow-split decisions. The resulting non-convex short-term subproblem is converted to a more computationally tractable form by exploiting successive convex approximations. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to several well-known benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {We consider a typical heterogeneous network (HetNet), which consists of a macro base station (BS) and multiple small BSs sharing the same spectrum band. Since the spectrum sharing among different BS-user links may cause severe mutual interference and degrades the global energy efficiency (GEE), it is important to optimize the transmit power of each BS and enhance the GEE. Conventional methods first collect the global instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and then optimize the transmit power in a centralized manner. Nevertheless, it is demanding to obtain the global instantaneous CSI in practical situations and the centralized optimization may easily overwhelm the coherence time of wireless channels. To tackle these issues, we leverage the strong computing capability of the (cloud) core network and the fast configuration capability of (edge) BSs and propose an intelligent cloud-edge collaboration framework. By properly designing the cloud-edge collaboration, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based energy efficient power control algorithm. With the proposed algorithm, each BS can configure its transmit power independently and enhance the GEE. Simulation results reveal that, in both static-user and mobile-user scenarios, the proposed algorithm can provide comparable GEE performance with the conventional methods while requiring a much lower time complexity.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is capable of improving the wireless system performance by steering the reflected signal in the desired direction. One of the major challenges is that both the transceiver and RIS have to be jointly optimized, where the optimization problems have to be reformulated for different system models and scenarios. To circumvent this challenge, new low-complexity antenna selection (AS) algorithms for transceiver-agnostic RIS configuration are proposed. Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, the proposed RIS-AS opts for accurately aligning the RIS both with the transmit antenna (TA) and receive antenna (RA) for the sake of maximizing the MIMO channel’s overall output power. The proposed RIS-AS only has to configure the RIS alone, i.e. without iterations with the transceiver optimization. As a result, the proposed RIS-AS has the compelling benefit that they are generically applicable, regardless of the specific transceiver architecture. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed RIS-AS is capable of supporting any MIMO configuration, regardless of their closed/open-loop, single-/ full-RF and multiplexing-/diversity-oriented setups.}

	abstract = {The full-duplex optical communications can be achieved simply by separating the transmitting link and the receiving link in the space. However, it is challenging to achieve the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) full-duplex ultraviolet (UV) communication due to the serious self-interference caused by the strong multiple scattering effects of UV signals. To explore the capacity of NLOS full-duplex UV communications, in this paper, we first quantify the self-interference using an analytical channel impulse response function. Based on the quantified self-interference, we then derive the error rate and the corresponding achievable information rate (AIR) for on- off keying modulation, 4-digital-pulse-interval modulation and 4-pulse-position modulation. We further propose a self-interference cancelling (SIC) method to mitigate the impacts of self-interferences. Simulation results show that the proposed SIC method can significantly improve the error rate and AIR performances. Besides, we find that the NLOS full-duplex UV communication will gradually lose its advantage over the NLOS half-duplex UV communication as either the communication distance or the elevation angle increases. However, using the proposed SIC method, the NLOS full-duplex UV communication can hold its advantage in a wide range of system geometries.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems have gained considerable attention recently. However, the benefits brought by IRS require the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI) of the cascaded base station (BS)-IRS and IRS-user channel which is difficult to obtain in practice, especially for the multiuser scenario. To address this issue, in this paper, we combine two-timescale beamforming and multi-IRS aided joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) in a mmWave multiuser system. Specifically, all the users are first divided into different groups and each group is associated with an IRS. Then, we propose a novel two-stage grouping-based randomized beamforming (TS-GRB) scheme, where the analog beamformer is designed based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) in the first stage, and the short-term digital beamformer at the BS and long-term passive beam pattern control policy at the IRSs are jointly optimized in the second stage with both S-CSI and dimension-reduced effective I-CSI. In particular, in the first stage, the analog beamformer is designed to reduce the inter-group interference (IGI) and effective channel dimension, while in the second stage, a two-timescale randomized joint beamforming (TRJB) algorithm is proposed to maximize the proportional fairness utility (PFU). We show that through two-timescale beamforming, JSDM and proper problem reformulation, the pilot overhead of our TS-GRB scheme is significantly lower than existing schemes. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS-GRB scheme.}

In the considered network, a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with its users (UEs) through downlink transmission and energy-constrained internet-of-things (IoT) devices, which are randomly deployed around a cluster head (CH), utilize the resources of BS for energy harvesting and information transmission. IRS, deployed randomly around CH, reflects the RF signals transmitted by BS to the IoT devices, providing additional energy to harvest. For the considered network, average distances between BS, CH, IRS, and an IoT device have been computed, statistically. Furthermore, the average harvested energy at an IoT device is computed. Instead of considering a fixed transmit power (FTP) of an IoT device, we consider that its transmit power varies randomly depending on the stored energy. Using the Markov chain model, we obtain transmission probability and state-dependent transmit power (SDTP). Analytical expressions for outage probability and throughput of an IoT device are obtained. To manifest the effectiveness of derived expressions, numerical results are compared with Monte-Carlo simulation results. Our results reveal that the proposed SDTP scheme has a performance gain over the FTP scheme, especially in scenarios where harvested energy is in abundance.}

	abstract = {Multiple access can be realized by utilizing the spatial moments of deep fades, using fluid antennas. The interference immunity for fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA), nevertheless, comes with the requirement of a large number of ports at each user. To alleviate this, we study the synergy between opportunistic scheduling and FAMA. A large pool of users permits selection of favourable users for FAMA and decreases the outage probability at each selected user. Our objective is to characterize the benefits of opportunistic scheduling in FAMA. In particular, we derive the multiplexing gain of the opportunistic FAMA network in closed form and upper bound the required number of users in the pool to achieve a given multiplexing gain. Also, we find a lower bound on the required outage probability at each user for achieving a given network multiplexing gain, from which the advantage of opportunistic scheduling is illustrated. In addition, we investigate the rate of increase of the multiplexing gain with respect to the number of users in the pool, and derive a tight approximation to the multiplexing gain, expressed in closed form. As a key result of our analysis, we obtain an operating condition on the product of the number of users in the pool and the number of ports at each fluid antenna that ensures a high multiplexing gain. Numerical results demonstrate clear benefits of opportunistic scheduling in FAMA networks, and corroborate our analytical results.}

	abstract = {The acquisition of the channel covariance matrix is of paramount importance to many strategies in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications, such as the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation. Therefore, plenty of efficient channel covariance matrix estimation schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, an abrupt change in the channel covariance matrix may happen occasionally in practice due to the change in the scattering environment and the user location. Our paper aims to adopt the classic change detection theory to detect the change in the channel covariance matrix as accurately and quickly as possible such that the new covariance matrix can be re-estimated in time. Specifically, this paper first considers the technique of on-line change detection (also known as quickest/sequential change detection), where we need to detect whether a change in the channel covariance matrix occurs at each channel coherence time interval. Next, because the complexity of detecting the change in a high-dimension covariance matrix at each coherence time interval is too high, we devise a low-complexity off-line strategy in massive MIMO systems, where change detection is merely performed at the last channel coherence time interval of a given time period. Numerical results show that our proposed on-line and off-line schemes can detect the channel covariance change with a small delay and a low false alarm rate. Therefore, our paper theoretically and numerically verifies the feasibility of detecting the channel covariance change accurately and quickly in practice.}

	abstract = {In IEEE 802.11 WiFi-based waveforms, the receiver performs coarse time and frequency synchronization using the first field of the preamble known as the legacy short training field (L-STF). The L-STF occupies upto 40% of the preamble length and takes upto\n32μs\nof airtime. With the goal of reducing communication overhead, we propose a modified waveform, where the preamble length is reduced by eliminating the L-STF. To decode this modified waveform, we propose a neural network (NN)-based scheme called PRONTO that performs coarse time and frequency estimations using other preamble fields, specifically the legacy long training field (L-LTF). Our contributions are threefold: (i) We present PRONTO featuring customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for packet detection and coarse carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, along with data augmentation steps for robust training. (ii) We propose a generalized decision flow that makes PRONTO compatible with legacy waveforms that include the standard L-STF. (iii) We validate the outcomes on an over-the-air WiFi dataset from a testbed of software defined radios (SDRs). Our evaluations show that PRONTO can perform packet detection with 100% accuracy, and coarse CFO estimation with errors as small as 3%. We demonstrate that PRONTO provides upto 40% preamble length reduction with no bit error rate (BER) degradation. We further show that PRONTO is able to achieve the same performance in new environments without the need to re-train the CNNs. Finally, we experimentally show the speedup achieved by PRONTO through GPU parallelization over the corresponding CPU-only implementations.}

To address these issues, we investigate codebook-based passive beamforming for multi-IRS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the control overheads are reduced to several scalars and the number of modes set in the IRS control circuit is reduced to that of codewords. Moreover, we formulate a joint passive and active precoding problem in the multi-IRS-aided mmWave MU-MISO system as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, and then develop a generalized Benders decomposition (GBD)-based joint passive and active precoding algorithm. The proposed algorithm offers near-optimal performance (\n≥99.9\n%) with significantly-reduced computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves energy savings of up to 50% and 95%, compared to the benchmark by the maximum ratio transmission and that without IRSs, respectively. In addition, the energy savings increase with the number of reflecting elements packed on each IRS as well as that of codewords.}

	abstract = {Wireless virtual reality (VR), aiming to provide an untethered immersive experience through 360° videos, could be facilitated by viewport-guided streaming with the help of viewport prediction. Although many recent viewport predictors can output a series of predictions over upcoming frames, most existing work on video streaming does not fully utilize the capability of these predictors. In this paper, we investigate the problem of 360° video streaming by incorporating the complete series of viewport predictions for maximizing the quality of experience (QoE) through cross-frame resource allocation. To address the problem of viewport prediction errors that could result in erroneous estimation of QoE contribution of tiles in upcoming frames, we develop a novel approach based on contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) to “learn” online the viewing behavior of the user and the capability of the predictor such that resource can be preferentially allocated to tiles with significant QoE contribution. Further, to address the problem of transmission failures during wireless streaming, we formulate a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and apply model predictive control (MPC) to account for resource competition among reactive and proactive transmissions as well as retransmissions of tiles. The performance of the proposed streaming system is evaluated using a real-world VR dataset, state-of-the-art viewport predictors, and realistic mmWave channel models. An improvement of 5.68% in QoE and a reduction of 23.0% in resource waste are achieved across various videos, users, and predictors. Simulation results substantiate that the context-aware QoE learned by the proposed CMAB effectively addresses prediction errors for tiles with different temporal and spatial contexts, and the proposed CMDP can achieve the desired performance even under high viewport prediction error and channel error.}

	abstract = {To meet the growing mobility needs in intra-city transportation, the concept of urban air mobility (UAM) has been proposed in which vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft are used to provide a ride-hailing service. In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the aerodromes, thus avoiding the use of complex routing strategies such as those of modern-day helicopters and alleviating the burden on the ground transportation system. For safety, a UAM aircraft must use air-to-ground communications to report flight plan, off-nominal events, and real-time movement to ground base stations (GBSs). A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a suitable spatial model is proposed. For the considered setup, assuming that any given aircraft communicates with the closest GBS, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft’s turbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the estimation of cascaded channels in passive intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing hybrid precoders and combiners. We propose a low-complexity solution that estimates the channel parameters progressively. The angles of departure (AoDs) and angles of arrival (AoAs) at the transmitter and receiver, respectively, are first estimated using inductive matrix completion (IMC) followed by root-MUSIC-based super-resolution spectrum estimation. Forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) is applied to address the coherence issue. Using the estimated AoAs and AoDs, the training precoders and combiners are then optimized and the angle differences between the AoAs and AoDs at the IRS are estimated using the least squares (LS) method followed by FBSS and the root-MUSIC algorithm. Finally, the composite path gains of the cascaded channel are estimated using on-grid sparse recovery with a small-size dictionary. The simulation results suggest that the proposed estimator can achieve improved channel parameter estimation performance with lower complexity as compared to several recently reported alternatives, thanks to the exploitation of the knowledge of the array responses and low-rankness of the channel using low-complexity algorithms at all the stages.}

Edge-based wireless communication technology is developed to be a promising approach to satisfy the communication requirements. Edge caching technology is one of effective methods to reduce the overhead of communication system and the pressure of backhauls. In this paper, the joint optimization problem of caching placement and power allocation in virtualized low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-terrestrial networks is proposed, which is based on cooperative caching, by considering cache size limits and power constraints. The optimization problem is solved using an algorithm inspired by the courtship movements and random flights of mayflies.

	abstract = {LA is one of the most important aspects of wireless communications where the MCS used by the transmitter is adapted to the channel conditions in order to meet a certain target error-rate. In a SU-SISO system with out-of-cell interference, LA is performed by computing the post-equalization SINR at the receiver. The same technique can be employed in MU-MIMO receivers that use linear detectors. Another important use of post-equalization SINR is for PHY abstraction, where several PHY blocks like the channel encoder, the detector, and the channel decoder are replaced by an abstraction model in order to speed up system-level simulations. However, for MU-MIMO systems with non-linear receivers, there is no known equivalent of post-equalization SINR which makes both LA and PHY abstraction extremely challenging. This important issue is addressed in this two-part paper. In this part, a metric called the BMDR of a detector, which is the proposed equivalent of post-equalization SINR, is presented. Since BMDR does not have a closed form expression that would enable its instantaneous calculation, a machine-learning approach to predict it is presented along with extensive simulation results.}

	abstract = {Driven by the ever-increasing scale and intensity of the computing tasks arising from various mobile applications, distributed edge computing has fostered wide research interests. It can effectively reduce the task processing delay by partitioning the original large-scale task into several small subtasks and offloading them to multiple edge nodes (ENs) for parallel computing. In edge computing, as the mobile user usually tends to offload computing tasks to closer ENs to save transmit power, the attacker may stealthily infer user location by exploiting this feature. Although there have been some pioneering works on offloading related location privacy, they mainly focused on the scenario where each task can only be offloaded to a single EN, and may not be directly applicable to distributed edge computing. Besides, the privacy issues considered in existing works are mainly based on good heuristics, and there is still a lack of concrete examples of location privacy attacks in edge computing. To the best of our knowledge, the location privacy issue in distributed edge computing still remains largely unexplored in existing literature. With this consideration, a location inference attack based on matrix sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT) is identified in this work. Besides, a countermeasure based on dynamic multi-EN selection is proposed, together with a location privacy-aware and energy-efficient distributed offloading scheme based on the generic Lyapunov optimization framework. Both theoretic analysis and simulations based on real-world channel measurements are employed to validate the feasibility of the identified MPSRT attack and the effectiveness of the proposed defense scheme.}

	abstract = {Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance network coverage has proven a variety of benefits compared to terrestrial counterparts. One of the commonly used mathematical tools to model the locations of the UAVs is stochastic geometry (SG). However, in the existing studies, both users and UAVs are often modeled as homogeneous point processes. In this paper, we consider an inhomogeneous Poisson point process (PPP)-based model for the locations of the users that captures the degradation in the density of active users as we move away from the town center. In addition, we propose the deployment of aerial vehicles following the same inhomogeneity of the users to maximize the performance. In addition, a multi-tier network model is also considered to make better use of the rich space resources. Then, the analytical expressions of the coverage probability for a typical user and the total coverage probability are derived. Finally, we optimize the coverage probability with limitations of the total number of UAVs and the minimum local coverage probability. Finally we give the optimal UAV distribution parameters when the maximum overall coverage probability is reached.}

	abstract = {We study the average Age of Information (AoI) and peak AoI (PAoI) of a dual-queue status update system that monitors a common stochastic process through two independent channels. Although the double queue parallel transmission is instrumental in reducing AoI, the out of order of data arrivals also imposes a significant challenge to the performance analysis. We consider two settings: the M-M system where the service time of two servers is exponentially distributed; the M-D system in which the service time of one server is exponentially distributed and that of the other is deterministic. For the two dual-queue systems, closed-form expressions of average AoI and PAoI are derived by resorting to the graphic method and state flow graph analysis method. Our analysis reveals that when the two servers have the same service rate, compared with the single-queue system with an exponentially distributed service time, the average PAoI and the average AoI of the M-M system decrease by 33.3% and 37.5%, respectively, and those of the M-D system decrease by 27.7% and 39.7%, respectively. Numerical results show that the two dual-queue systems also outperform the M/M/2 single queue dual-server system with optimized arrival rate in terms of average AoI and PAoI.}

	abstract = {In this study, we propose an over-the-air computation (OAC) scheme to calculate the majority vote (MV) for federated edge learning (FEEL). With the proposed approach, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic gradients, i.e., votes, by activating one of two orthogonal resources. The MVs at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e., hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e., soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when the time-synchronization and the power control are not ideal under heterogeneous data distribution scenarios.}

This paper focuses on reducing the long-term energy consumption of a cell-free network in the downlink integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) for achieving energy sustainability. The resultant design includes both the AP classification on a large time-scale and the beamforming of the APs on a small time-scale in order to simultaneously satisfy the IDET requirements of data users and energy users. For dealing with binary integer actions (AP classification) and continuous actions (beamforming) together, we innovatively propose a stable double parameterized deep-Q-network (DP-DQN), which can be enhanced by a digital twin (DT) running in the intelligent core processor (ICP) so as to achieve faster and more stable convergence. Therefore, the cell-free network may avoid suffering from performance fluctuation during the training process.

In the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, ISAC is considered as one of the most promising technologies. In this paper, a novel ISAC channel model combining forward and backward scattering is proposed. In addition to the non-stationarity caused by motions, the correlations between sensing and communication channels are investigated. The channel characteristics of sensing such as forward scattering and backward scattering are introduced into the communication channel model. Utilizing the correlations between sensing and communication channels, the communication channel model is divided into line-of-sight (LOS), forward scattering, and backward scattering components. These three components are summed according to probability weighting to obtain a more accurate channel model for sensing assisted communication systems. Moreover, important statistical properties of the proposed ISAC channel model are derived and simulated. The analytical and simulation results match well, demonstrating the correctness of derivations and simulations. Some derived/simulated statistical properties are verified by corresponding measurement data, which indicates the utility of the proposed ISAC channel model.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications exploit the abundant bandwidth to fulfill the increasing data rate demands of 6G wireless communications. To compensate for the high propagation loss with reduced hardware costs, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) with a hybrid beamforming structure is a promising technology in the mmWave and THz bands. However, channel estimation (CE) is challenging for hybrid UM-MIMO systems, which requires recovering the high-dimensional channels from severely few channel observations. In this paper, a Pruned Approximate Message Passing (AMP) Integrated Deep Convolutional-neural-network (DCNN) CE (PRINCE) method is firstly proposed, which enhances the estimation accuracy of the AMP method by appending a DCNN network. Moreover, by truncating the insignificant feature maps in the convolutional layers of the DCNN network, a pruning method including training with regularization, pruning and refining procedures is developed to reduce the network scale. Simulation results show that the PRINCE achieves a good trade-off between the CE accuracy and significantly low complexity, with normalized-mean-square-error (NMSE) of −10 dB at signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) as 10 dB after eliminating 80% feature maps.}

	abstract = {Caching at the wireless edge is recognized as a promising solution to accommodate the explosive growth of traffic demand. However, the gain of edge caching is only pronounced given homogeneous user preference. To reap the full potential of caching, recommendation mechanism has emerged as an attractive technology due to its capability of reshaping users’ request distribution. In this work, we propose a joint user-side recommendation and device-to-device (D2D)-assisted offloading strategy, aiming to maximize the operator’s utility. Specifically, we consider that users can recommend their cached contents to encountered users. This strategy takes into account users’ personalized preferences and relative locations, and hence can directly offload the recommended contents through D2D links without burdening cellular links. We then develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the subsequent content transmission, accounting for the randomness of spatial deployment, user mobility, individual delay requirement, incentive, and protection mechanism for existing links. Based on the analytical results, we design a D2D-assisted offloading strategy, which allows the requester to postpone data reception in exchange for discounted service fees. Simulation results show that the operator’s utility can be significantly improved. Particularly, it is found that user mobility facilitates the above process.}

Meanwhile, malicious eavesdropping is posing tremendous challenges on secure transmissions of TSNs due to their widescale wireless coverage. In this paper, we propose an aerial bridge scheme to establish secure tunnels for legitimate transmissions in TSNs. With the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), massive transmission links in TSNs can be secured without impacts on legitimate communications. Owing to the stereo position of UAVs and the directivity of directional antennas, the constructed secure tunnel can significantly relieve confidential information leakage, resulting in the precaution of wiretapping. Moreover, we establish a theoretical model to evaluate the effectiveness of the aerial bridge scheme compared with the ground relay, non-protection, and UAV jammer schemes. Furthermore, we conduct extensive simulations to verify the accuracy of theoretical analysis and present useful insights into the practical deployment by revealing the relationship between the performance and other parameters, such as the antenna beamwidth, flight height and density of UAVs.}

Considering dynamic data arrivals at different sensing nodes, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for AoI minimization in two steps. The users’ transmission scheduling is firstly determined by the outer-loop DRL approach, e.g. the DQN or PPO algorithm, and then the inner-loop optimization is used to adapt either the uplink information transmission or downlink energy transfer to all nodes. A simple and efficient approximation is also proposed to reduce the inner-loop rum time overhead. Numerical results verify that the hierarchical learning framework outperforms typical baselines in terms of the average AoI and proportional fairness among different nodes.}

	abstract = {In millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture, selecting the antennas contributing most from the candidate array to transmit/receive signals is one of the effective solutions to reduce hardware cost and power consumption while maintaining high spectral efficiency. In this paper, for the communication systems where the base station (BS) equipped with massive MIMO antenna array communicates with multiple single-antenna users, the impact of limited-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) on system capacity is investigated, and two antenna selection (AS) algorithms, namely quantization-aware greedy with square maximum-volume (QAG-SMV) and group-selection (GS) schemes, are proposed to enhance system capacity for the uplink and downlink transmission, respectively. Specifically, after the quantization noise caused by limited-resolution ADCs/DACs is converted to independent additive noise, the problem of maximizing system capacity is formulated. Then, two novel AS schemes are proposed to improve system capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed AS algorithms can obtain higher average system capacity, and the computational complexity is reduced as well.}

	abstract = {Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm, particularly tackling the heterogeneity issues brought by various mobile user equipments (UEs) in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, due to the ever-increasing number of UEs and the complicated administrative work it brings, it is desirable to switch the PFL algorithm from its conventional two-layer framework to a multiple-layer one. In this paper, we propose hierarchical PFL (HPFL), an algorithm for deploying PFL over massive MEC networks. The UEs in HPFL are divided into multiple clusters, and the UEs in each cluster forward their local updates to the edge server (ES) synchronously for edge model aggregation, while the ESs forward their edge models to the cloud server semi-asynchronously for global model aggregation. The above training manner leads to a tradeoff between the training loss in each round and the round latency. HPFL combines the objectives of training loss minimization and round latency minimization while jointly determining the optimal bandwidth allocation as well as the ES scheduling policy in the hierarchical learning framework. Extensive experiments verify that HPFL not only guarantees convergence in hierarchical aggregation frameworks but also has advantages in round training loss maximization and round latency minimization.}

To optimize the communication and sensing performance, we formulate a joint user association, UAV trajectory planning and power allocation problem to maximize the minimum weighted spectral efficiency among UAVs. This paper exploits the centralized and the decentralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions to solve the sequential decision-making problem. On one hand, we first introduce the centralized soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Then, we explore the equivalent transformation of the optimization objective based on symmetric group, propose the random and the adaptive data augmentation schemes to design the replay memory buffer of SAC, and accordingly propose SAC algorithms assisted by data augmentation to tackle the transformed problem. On the other hand, the multi-agent soft actor-critic (MASAC), a decentralized solution, is also introduced to solve this sequential decision-making problem. The experiment results reveal the effectiveness of the centralized and the decentralized solutions in considered scenarios. Specifically, the SAC assisted by the adaptive scheme significantly outperforms other centralized solutions in the training speed and the weighted spectral efficiency. Meanwhile, the decentralized MASAC algorithm behaves best in the early training speed.}

However, most existing models for air-ground integrated networks (AGINs) neglect the spatial dependence caused by the complementary deployment of the aerial and ground nodes. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose two AGIN models with horizontal dependence that differ in the vertical dimension, namely uniformly independent altitudes and location-dependent altitudes. The air platforms serve as aerial base stations, distributed as a marked Poisson hole process, and provide flexible beam coverage through varying altitudes. Under this setup, we propose a region-based user association scheme and derive the association probabilities as well as the serving distance distributions of an arbitrarily located user. Considering Nakagami fading and air-to-ground propagation properties, we characterize the signal-to-interference ratio and area spectral efficiency for each model. Using the proposed analytical framework, we demonstrate the importance of deploying the air platforms more sensibly to provide targeted services and flexible beam coverage in reducing the load of base stations and improving the user coverage and network capacity performance.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising computing paradigm that provides flexible and responsive local services for mobile user equipment at the network edge. Software instances for user equipment tasks are typically deployed as Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) at resource-constrained edge nodes. Task data exchanged across the VNFs in serial can incur high task completion latency. It is therefore desirable to deploy certain VNFs in parallel. However, deciding where to deploy VNFs depends on which VNFs are parallel, and conversely, their deployment also affects their parallel execution. In this paper, for the first time, we jointly consider the parallelization and deployment strategies for VNFs at edge nodes. We closely examine the complexity of the joint optimization problem and introduce an Improved Service Function Graph (I-SFG) that reflects the coordination and dependency relations among the VNFs to provide parallel services for each piece of user equipment. We first propose an approach based on integer linear programming to find optimal solutions in small-scale scenarios and then present an effective solution through cascading I-SFG construction and VNF deployment approximation to solve large-scale problems. Theoretical analyses and experimental results show the superiority of our joint design and the proposed practical solution.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be densely deployed in complex environment to create cascaded line-of-sight (LoS) paths between multiple base stations (BSs) and users via tunable IRS reflections, thereby significantly enhancing the coverage performance of wireless networks. To achieve this goal, it is vital to optimize the deployed locations of BSs and IRSs in the wireless network, which is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we divide the coverage area of the network into multiple non-overlapping cells and decide whether to deploy a BS/IRS in each cell given a total number of BSs/IRSs available. We show that to ensure the network coverage/communication performance, i.e., each cell has a direct/cascaded LoS path with at least one BS, as well as such LoS paths have the average number of IRS reflections less than a given threshold, there is a fundamental trade-off with the deployment cost or the number of BSs/IRSs needed. To optimally characterize this trade-off, we formulate a joint BS and IRS deployment problem based on graph theory, which, however, is difficult to be optimally solved due to the combinatorial optimization involved. To circumvent this difficulty, we first consider a simplified problem with given BS deployment and propose the optimal as well as an efficient suboptimal IRS deployment solution to it, by applying the branch-and-bound method and iteratively removing IRSs from the candidate locations, respectively. Next, an efficient sequential update algorithm is proposed for solving the joint BS and IRS deployment problem. Numerical results are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed design approach and optimization algorithms for the joint BS and IRS deployment. The trade-off between the network coverage performance and the number of deployed BSs/IRSs with different cost ratios is also unveiled.}

	abstract = {Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), a new chirp-based multicarrier waveform for high mobility communications, is introduced here. AFDM is based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT), a generalization of discrete Fourier transform, which is characterized by two parameters that can be adapted based on the Doppler spread of doubly dispersive channels. First, we derive the explicit input-output relation in the DAFT domain showing the effect of AFDM parameters in the input-output relation. Second, we show how the DAFT parameters underlying AFDM have to be set so that the resulting DAFT domain impulse response conveys a full delay-Doppler representation of the channel. Then, we show analytically that AFDM can achieve the optimal diversity order in doubly dispersive channels, where optimal diversity order refers to the number of multipath components separable in either the delay or the Doppler domain, due to its full delay-Doppler representation. Furthermore, we present a low complexity detection method taking advantage of zero-padding. We also propose an embedded pilot-aided channel estimation scheme for AFDM, in which both channel estimation and data detection are performed within the same AFDM frame. Finally, simulations corroborate the validity of our analytical results and show the significant performance gains of AFDM over state-of-the-art multicarrier schemes in high mobility scenarios.}

	abstract = {IoT devices have been widely utilized to detect state transition in the surrounding environment and transmit status updates to the base station for system operations. To guarantee the accuracy of system control, age of information (AoI) is introduced to quantify the freshness of the sensory data and meet the stringent timeliness requirement. Due to the limited computing resources, the status update can be offloaded to the mobile edge computing (MEC) server for execution. Since status updates generated by insufficient sensing operations may be invalid and lead to additional processing time, a joint data sensing and processing optimization problem needs to be considered. Therefore, this work formulates an NP-hard problem that considers the freshness of the status updates and energy consumption of the IoT devices. Subsequently, the problem is decomposed into sampling, sensing, and computation offloading optimization problems. To optimize the system overhead, a multi-variable iterative system cost minimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our method in decreasing the system cost, and indicate the influence of sensing and processing under different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite has been considered as a potential supplement for the terrestrial Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider grant-free non-orthogonal random access (GF-NORA) in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to increase access capacity and reduce access latency for LEO satellite-IoT. We focus on the joint device activity detection (DAD) and channel estimation (CE) problem at the satellite access point. The delay and the Doppler effect of the LEO satellite channel are assumed to be partially compensated. We propose an OFDM-symbol repetition technique to better distinguish the residual Doppler frequency shifts, and present a grid-based parametric probability model to characterize channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler-user domain, as well as to characterize the relationship between the channel states and the device activity. Based on that, we develop a robust Bayesian message-passing algorithm named modified variance state propagation (MVSP) for joint DAD and CE. Moreover, to tackle the mismatch between the real channel and its on-grid representation, an expectation–maximization (EM) framework is proposed to learn the grid parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the existing approaches in both activity detection probability and channel estimation accuracy.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) allow digital receivers to learn to operate in complex environments. To do so, DNNs should preferably be trained using large labeled data sets with a similar statistical relationship as the one under which they are to infer. For DNN-aided receivers, obtaining labeled data conventionally involves pilot signalling at the cost of reduced spectral efficiency, typically resulting in access to limited data sets. In this paper, we study how one can enrich a small set of labeled pilots data into a larger data set for training deep receivers. Motivated by the widespread use of data augmentation techniques for enriching visual and text data, we propose dedicated augmentation schemes that exploits the characteristics of digital communication data. We identify the key considerations in data augmentations for deep receivers as the need for domain orientation, class (constellation) diversity, and low complexity. Following these guidelines, we devise three complementing augmentations that exploit the geometric properties of digital constellations. Our combined augmentation approach builds on the merits of these different augmentations to synthesize reliable data from a momentary channel distribution, to be used for training deep receivers. Furthermore, we exploit previous channel realizations to increase the reliability of the augmented samples. The superiority of our approach is numerically evaluated for training several deep receiver architectures in different channel conditions. We consider both linear and non-linear synthetic channels, as well as the COST 2100 channel generator, for both single-input single-output and multiple-input multiple-output scenarios. We show that our combined augmentations approach allows DNN-aided receivers to achieve gains of up to 1 dB in bit error rate and of up to $\\times 3$ in spectral efficiency, compared to regular non-augmented training. Moreover, we demonstrate that our augmentations benefit training even as the number of pilots increases, and perform an ablation study on the different augmentations, which shows that the combined approach surpasses each individual augmentation technique.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications has been a hot topic due to its promising advantages for future wireless networks. Existing works on RIS-assisted channel modeling have mainly focused on far-field propagation condition with planar wavefront assumption. In essence, the far-field condition does not always hold because the RIS array dimension may be comparable to the terminal distance, especially in RIS-assisted mobile networks. To this end, we propose a hybrid far- and near-field stochastic channel model for characterizing a RIS-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation environment, which takes into account both far-field and near-field propagation conditions. To achieve the balance between the modeling accuracy and complexity for the investigation of the RIS-assisted V2V propagation characteristics, we develop a sub-array partitioning scheme to dynamically divide the entire RIS array into several smaller sub-arrays, which makes planar wavefront assumption applicable for the sub-arrays. Important channel statistical properties, including spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), and frequency correlation functions (FCFs), are derived and investigated. Simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed sub-array partition based hybrid far- and near-field modeling solution for RIS-assisted V2V channels.}

	abstract = {In strong line-of-sight millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless systems, the rank-deficient channel severely hampers spatial multiplexing. To address this inherent deficiency, multiple reconfigurable-intelligent-surfaces (RISs) are introduced in this study to customize the wireless channel. Utilizing the RIS to reshape electromagnetic waves, we theoretically show that a favorable channel with an arbitrary tunable rank and a minimized truncated condition number can be established by elaborately designing the placement and reflection matrix of RISs. Different from existing works on multi-RISs, the number of elements needed for each RIS to combat the path loss and the limited phase control is also considered. On the basis of the proposed channel customization, a joint transmitter-RISs-receiver (Tx-RISs-Rx) design under a hybrid mmWave system is investigated to maximize the spectral efficiency. Using the proposed scheme, the optimal singular value decomposition-based hybrid beamforming at the Tx and Rx can be obtained without matrix decomposition for the digital and analog beamforming. The bottoms of the sub-channel mode in the water-filling algorithm, which are conventionally uncontrollable, are proven to be independently adjustable by RISs. Moreover, the transmit power required for realizing multi-stream transmission is derived. Numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and exhibit substantial gains over systems without RISs.}

	abstract = {Cloudlets, which refer to the edge computing services deployed at the proximity of end devices, are key providers of connectivity, storage, and computation resources to many applications. While access to cloudlets is pervasive in typical settings, it can be difficult in challenging, even hostile environments, such as military or post-disaster scenarios, featuring multi-hop communication and energy-constrained end devices. In these cases, cloudlets may have become the only equipment powerful enough to execute life-critical applications, such as battle-field situation awareness, tactic cooperation, and search-and-rescue missions. Quality of these services is greatly influenced by the minimum time that a packet can be delivered, i.e., the cloudlet access delay (CAD), whose characteristics remain unknown. To address the open question of fast and efficient cloudlet access, we establish a packet mobility model that allows CAD and energy consumption to be analyzed as a function of the initial device-cloudlet distance. We find that the expected CAD scales either linearly or quadratically under distinct types of packet mobility, and the successful access rate (SAR) can be bounded by functions of the delay constraint. Based on these findings, we develop a packet shedding algorithm that saves 24% transmission power, and reduces the average CAD by 2%, while maintaining a similar SAR in simulated cloudlet access environments.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaborate on a common learning task via only exchanging model updates. With the progressive improvements in deep learning models, communication is becoming a primary bottleneck of FL. Quantization of model updates before transmitting is an effective technique to reduce communication overhead. Most prior literature assumes lossless transmission, but in practice, quantized model updates are distorted by wireless channels due to the variation of client locations. Therefore, this paper focuses on analysis and design of personalized model update quantization with explicitly incorporating channel diversity in wireless FL. We present a novel convergence analysis of quantized FL, which encompasses full and partial client participation, single and multiple local training iterations, and convex and non-convex loss functions. This analysis explicitly embodies the impact of personalized quantization error, channel diversity and model aggregation in FL, and also elucidates their tradeoff on tightening a convergence rate upper bound. An optimization framework, which seeks an optimal allocation scheme given a total budget of quantization bits, is proposed by minimizing an upper bound with respect to channel quality. A nearly optimal solution is derived for this non-convex integer programming problem via analytically solving Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and linear search. From a perspective of outlier detection, this channel-aware allocation scheme is also extended to robust model aggregation against client dropouts. Comprehensive numerical evaluation demonstrates the performance enhancement of the proposed scheme over the vanilla allocation scheme with equal quantization bits, particularly in terms of training stability, test accuracy, and robustness.}

	abstract = {Effective and adaptive interference management is required in next generation wireless communication systems. To address this challenge, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), relying on multi-antenna rate-splitting (RS) at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, has been intensively studied in recent years, albeit mostly under the assumption of perfect Channel State Information at the Receiver (CSIR) and ideal capacity-achieving modulation and coding schemes. To assess its practical performance, benefits, and limits under more realistic conditions, this work proposes a novel design for a practical RSMA receiver based on model-based deep learning (MBDL) methods, which aims to unite the simple structure of the conventional SIC receiver and the robustness and model agnosticism of deep learning techniques. The MBDL receiver is evaluated in terms of uncoded Symbol Error Rate (SER), throughput performance through Link-Level Simulations (LLS), and average training overhead. Also, a comparison with the SIC receiver, with perfect and imperfect CSIR, is given. Results reveal that the MBDL receiver outperforms by a significant margin the SIC receiver with imperfect CSIR, due to its ability to generate on demand non-linear symbol detection boundaries in a pure data-driven manner.}

	abstract = {This work proposes a new precoded filter bank (FB) system via a two-dimensional (2D) fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT). Its structure is similar to Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) systems, where the OFDM transmitter is changed to a filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) one, thus obtaining a lower out-of-band emission. The complex orthogonality of the FBMC transmission is guaranteed by using pre-coding based on a discrete Fourier transform, which is also used to implement the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform. Furthermore, due to the filtering process, the proposed system obtains a good error performance using a simple equalizer in the time-frequency domain. In this sense, we also introduce a hybrid receiver in the proposed system to exploit this feature. First, the time-frequency domain equalization is performed, followed by an interference cancellation on the delay-Doppler domain. Using the delay-Doppler domain detection, the simulation results show that the proposed system obtains an error performance similar to the OTFS system. Already using the simple equalizer in the time-frequency domain, the proposed scheme presents great advantage compared to the OTFS with the same equalizer in the studied scenarios.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is a promising technology for enlarging the coverage area of millimeter wave systems. Unfortunately, realizing the full potential of these systems requires addressing numerous challenges in channel estimation. In this paper, channel estimation for RIS-assisted mmWave communications is considered. Under the assumption that the array manifolds of the base station antennas and the RIS reflecting elements are given by uniform arrays, an efficient two-stage channel estimation method based on array signal processing techniques is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the direct and indirect channels are jointly estimated by space-time processing that exploits the sparsity in RIS-assisted mmWave channels and the features associated with uniform arrays. Then, several practical issues, including detection of the number of channel paths, imperfect RIS hardware, and complexity, are addressed. Extensions to the cases of uniform planar array-based RIS, wideband communication, and multiple users are also discussed. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {With the prosperity of emerging applications, the\n6\nth\nGeneration mobile communication systems (6G) is coming at an unimaginable speed. It is expected to provide more intelligent, flexible, and secure services. As an essential pillar of 6G networks, ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) has promoted the vigorous development of intelligent communications. However, the existing networks cannot fully satisfy the strict and various requirements of uRLLC services, including delay, reliability and security. Considering the interaction between the physical layer and the upper layer, we propose a Cross-layer Flexible Security Solution (CFSS), which includes initiative waiting strategy, flexible transmission time interval scheduling strategy, and flexible pre-backup transmission strategy. While considering secure communication, CFSS could flexibly provide customized services to the users through cross-layer parameters configuration and resource allocation. In addition, we extend the Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) modeling to the security field, and use Finite Blocklength Coding (FBC) to analyze the service process of uRLLC. Two cases of FBC are considered comprehensively, namely, given decoding error probability and given transmission rate. Finally, Experienced Meta-Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (EM-A3C) algorithm is proposed to solve the complex optimization problem, the establishment of experience pool effectively improves the algorithm efficiency.}

We compare the performance of the proposed method with several other state-of-the-art and alternative channel-allocation algorithms. The two proposed performance metrics are the capacity-based and the utility-based context. In the first case, every unit of additional capacity is regarded as beneficial for any tenant, independent of the already allocated quantity, and the main measure is the total throughput of the system. In the second case, we assume a minimal and maximal required capacity value for each tenant, and consider the implied utility values accordingly. In addition to the total system performance, we also analyze fairness and computational requirements in both contexts. We conclude that at the cost of higher but still plausible computational time, the fairness-enhanced version of the proposed preallocation based combinatorial auction algorithm outperforms every other considered method when one considers total system performance and fairness simultaneously, and performs especially well in the utility context. Therefore, the proposed algorithm may be regarded as candidate scheme for URLLC channel allocation problems, where minimal and maximal capacity requirements have to be considered.}

	abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has drawn particular attention recently due to its high data rate services and low round-trip latency. It has low launching and manufacturing costs than Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. Moreover, LEO SatCom has the potential to provide global coverage with a high-speed data rate and low transmission latency. However, the spectrum scarcity might be one of the challenges in the growth of LEO satellites, impacting severe restrictions on developing ground-space integrated networks. To address this issue, cognitive radio and rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) are the two emerging technologies for high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. This paper proposes a cognitive radio enabled LEO SatCom using RSMA radio access technique with the coexistence of GEO SatCom network. In particular, this work aims to maximize the sum rate of LEO SatCom by simultaneously optimizing the power budget over different beams, RSMA power allocation for users over each beam, and subcarrier user assignment while restricting the interference temperature to GEO SatCom. The problem of sum rate maximization is formulated as non-convex, where the global optimal solution is challenging to obtain. Thus, an efficient solution can be obtained in three steps: first we employ a successive convex approximation technique to reduce the complexity and make the problem more tractable. Second, for any given resource block user assignment, we adopt KarushKuhnTucker (KKT) conditions to calculate the transmit power over different beams and RSMA power allocation of users over each beam. Third, using the allocated power, we design an efficient algorithm based on the greedy approach for resource block user assignment. For comparison, we propose two suboptimal schemes with fixed power allocation over different beams and random resource block user assignment as the benchmark. Numerical results provided in this work are obtained based on the Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate the benefits of the proposed optimization scheme compared to the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Future wireless networks are expected to support diverse mobile services, including artificial intelligence (AI) services and ubiquitous data transmissions. Federated learning (FL), as a revolutionary learning approach, enables collaborative AI model training across distributed mobile edge devices. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, over-the-air computation allows concurrent model uploading from massive devices over the same radio resources, and thus significantly reduces the communication cost of FL. In this paper, we study the coexistence of over-the-air FL and traditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network, where an access point (AP) coordinates a set of devices for over-the-air FL and serves multiple devices for information transfer in the meantime. We propose a coexisting federated learning and information transfer (CFLIT) communication framework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee a given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource allocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the coexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication between the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the challenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication ratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The analysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio that minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to converge to a given error tolerance. Based on the analysis, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm to jointly optimize the radio resource allocation for both the FL devices and IT devices. We further derive an analytical expression of the achievable data rate of IT users. Extensive numerical simulations verify the superior performance of the proposed design for the coexistence of FL and IT devices in wireless cellular systems.}

This paper studies the coverage performance analysis of a cache-enabled UBS-assisted cellular network. Analytical models are derived for investigating the overall coverage probability of the network and the average achievable rate of a cellular user. In deriving the analytical models, an air-to-ground (A2G) channel model with both a line-of-sight (LoS) link and a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link, a BS association strategy based on the strongest average received power, and a cache model with a probabilistic caching strategy are considered. The cache hit probability of UBSs based on the cache model is also taken into consideration. Moreover, the association probabilities with the association strategy are derived for different types of base stations. The derived analytical models are validated through simulation results and the impacts of system parameters on the coverage performance of the network are investigated through numerical results. Compared with existing relevant work, the novelty of this work is that the effects of both an access link and a backhaul link are taken into account in the coverage performance analysis. The obtained results can provide theoretical guidance for the deployment of UBSs in a cache-enabled UBS-assisted cellular network.}

	abstract = {In this paper we consider two Tanner-graph-based transmission schemes for massive multiple access, which combine non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and grant-based random access. Each user transmits two data streams repeatedly using several channel time-frequency resource blocks (RBs) and the transmission schedule is represented by a Tanner graph, where variable nodes and check nodes represent the transmitted signals and the RBs, respectively. In Scheme 1 each variable node represents a data stream of a user, whereas Scheme 2 employs rate splitting and each variable node represents the superimposed data streams of a user. On the receiver side, we first consider peeling decoders that serve both as pilot-based channel estimators and baseline decoders. We then develop message-passing decoders for both transmission schemes that can fully exploit the diversity afforded by the repetitive transmission across different RBs, as opposed to the peeling decoders. We also propose a neural decoder by deep unfolding the message-passing decoder and further performing a small number of training epochs using the pilots. Simulation results show that for Transmission Scheme 1, the message-passing decoder offers decoding performance improvement over the peeling decoder by orders of magnitude; and as a result, Scheme 1 substantially outperforms Scheme 2. Moreover, the neural decoder further improves upon the performance of the message-passing decoder, as more information is learned about the transmitted data over the training epochs.}

	abstract = {Benefiting from the fusion of communication and intelligent technologies, network-enabled robots have become important to support future machine-assisted and unmanned applications. To provide high-quality services for robots in wide areas, hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks are a key technology. Through hybrid networks, computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks can be offloaded to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. However, due to the mobility of mobile robots and unreliable wireless network environments, excessive local computations and frequent service migrations may significantly increase the service delay. To address this issue, this paper aims to minimize the average task completion time for MEC-based offloading initiated by satellite-terrestrial-network-enabled robots. Different from conventional mobility-aware schemes, the proposed scheme makes the offloading decision by jointly considering the mobility control of robots. A joint optimization problem of task offloading and velocity control is formulated. Using Lyapunov optimization, the original optimization is decomposed into a velocity control subproblem and a task offloading subproblem. Then, based on the Markov decision process (MDP), a dual-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed. The convergence and complexity of the improved RL algorithm are theoretically analyzed, and the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the offloading delay.}

	abstract = {The large scale reflector array of programmable metasurfaces is capable of increasing the power efficiency of backscatter communications via passive beamforming and thus has the potential to revolutionize the low-data-rate nature of backscatter communications. In this paper, we propose to design the power-efficient higher-order constellation and reflection pattern under the amplitude constraint brought by backscatter communications. For the constellation design, we adopt the amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK) constellation and optimize the parameters of APSK such as ring number, ring radius, and inter-ring phase difference. Specifically, we derive closed-form solutions to the optimal ring radius and inter-ring phase difference for an arbitrary modulation order in the decomposed subproblems. For the reflection pattern design, we propose to optimize the passive beamforming vector by solving a multi-objective optimization problem that maximizes reflection power and guarantees beam homogenization within the interested angle range. To solve the problem, we propose a constant-modulus power iteration method, which is proven to be monotonically increasing, to maximize the objective function in each iteration. Numerical results show that the proposed APSK constellation design and reflection pattern design outperform the existing modulation and beam pattern designs in programmable metasurface enabled backscatter communications.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has high flexibility and controllable mobility, therefore it is considered as a promising enabler for future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). In this paper, we propose a novel adaptable ISAC (AISAC) mechanism in the UAV-empowered system, where the UAV performs sensing on demand during communication and the sensing duration is flexibly configured according to the application requirements rather than keeping the same with the communication duration. Our designed mechanism avoids the excessive sensing and waste of radio resources, therefore improving the resource utilization and system performance. In the UAV-empowered AISAC system, we aim at maximizing the average system throughput by optimizing the communication and sensing beamforming as well as the UAV trajectory while guaranteeing the quality-of-service requirements of communication and sensing. To efficiently solve the considered non-convex optimization problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to alternately optimize the communication and sensing beamforming as well as the UAV trajectory to obtain a suboptimal solution. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed adaptable mechanism and the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.}

The UEs are equipped with a beam-switchable antenna array for real-time antenna selection where the one with the highest channel magnitude, out of four pre-defined beams, is selected. For the beam-switchable antenna array, we consider two kinds of UE antennas, with different beam-width and different peak-gain. Based on this testbed, we provide measurement results for millimeter-wave (mmWave) MU-MIMO performance in different real-life scenarios with static and mobile UEs. We explore the potential benefit of the mmWave MU-MIMO systems with antenna selection based on measured channel data, and discuss the performance results through real-time measurements.}

However, the convolutional spreading (CS) operation of the systems is computationally complex and involves a high peak-to-average power ratio. To address such issues, we propose the concatenative complete complementary code (CCCC) division multiple access, named (CCC-CDMA). Since the CCCCs can be generated from the rows of the Walsh-Hadamard or discrete Fourier transform matrices, the CS operation can be implemented using corresponding fast transforms to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the enlargement of the spreading factor strengthens the robustness against clipping noise. The binary CCCC generated by Walsh-Hadamard matrix exhibited excellent robustness against Doppler frequency shifts.}

	abstract = {We consider high-dimensional MIMO transmissions in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. For precoding, the frequency selective channel has to be measured, quantized and fed back to the base station by the users. When the number of antennas is very high this typically leads to prohibitively high quantization complexity and large feedback. In 5G New Radio (NR), a modular quantization approach has been applied for this, where first a low-dimensional subspace is identified for the whole frequency selective channel, and then subband channels are linearly mapped to this subspace and quantized. We analyze how the components in such a modular scheme contribute to the overall quantization distortion. Based on this analysis we improve the technology components in the modular approach and propose an orthonormalized wideband precoding scheme and a sequential wideband precoding approach which provide considerable gains over the conventional method. We compare the performance of the developed quantization schemes to prior art by simulations in terms of the projection distortion, overall distortion and spectral efficiency, in a scenario with a realistic spatial channel model.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the beamforming schemes via the novel frequency diverse array (FDA) on enhancing covert communications performance. We first consider the ideal scenario where the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known at the transmitter. Then we characterize the key role of minimizing the correlation of the communication and detection channels in boosting the covertness of the system, which also provides a theoretical design principle for FDA-specific carrier frequency scheduling. By exploiting the optimization framework block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM), we propose a frequency scheduling method which leads to a two-phase beamforming scheme to facilitate the covert transmission. Subsequently, we extend the scenario to the more practical one with partial CSI. By leveraging the convex hull, we manage to transform the formulated semi-infinite programming problem to an equivalent semi-definite one which can be solved optimally. In addition, we present a process to construct the optimal beamforming vector. To mitigate the channel correlations in this scenario, we generalize the steps of BSUM and propose an algorithm to schedule the frequencies efficiently. Afterwards, a three-phase robust beamforming scheme is summarized, which boosts the covert rate significantly. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes.}

The capacity region of the\nK\n-receiver multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel has been characterized using dirty-paper coding and stochastic encoding. However,\nK\nfactorial encoding orders may need to be enumerated to evaluate the capacity region, which makes the problem intractable. In addition, even though the capacity region is known, optimal signaling to achieve the capacity region is unknown. In this paper, we determine one optimal encoding order to achieve every point on the capacity region, and thus reduce the encoding complexity\nK\nfactorial times. We prove that the optimal decoding order for the\nK\n-receiver MIMO wiretap channel is the same as that for the MIMO broadcast channel without secrecy. To be specific, the descending weight ordering in the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem determines the optimal encoding order. Next, to achieve the secrecy capacity region boundary, we form a WSR maximization problem and apply the block successive maximization method to solve this nonconvex problem and find the input covariance matrices corresponding to each message. Numerical results are used to verify the optimality of the encoding order and to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed signaling design.}

To control the RIS, channel state information (CSI) is needed, which entails significant pilot overhead. To reduce this overhead and the need for frequent RIS reconfiguration, we propose a novel framework for integrated localization and communications, where RIS configurations are fixed during location coherence intervals, while BS precoders are optimized every channel coherence interval. This framework leverages accurate location information obtained with the aid of several RISs as well as novel RIS optimization and channel estimation methods. Performance in terms of localization accuracy, channel estimation error, and achievable rate demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {With the increasing exploration of marine resources, various marine wireless devices have been rapidly deployed for different marine applications such as marine navigation, ocean environment monitoring, and seabed resource exploitation. However, due to long transmission delay and low data rate between marine wireless devices and the cloud, it is challenging to satisfy the service requirements of computing-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks. By migrating computing resources from cloud to the near side of ocean, the paradigm of marine edge computing networks, which integrates communication and computation capacities in marine wireless devices, is expected to support a variety of marine tasks (e.g., data collection, monitoring and processing) with low delay and high data rate. However, considering the rationality and selfishness of marine wireless devices and their limited computing-capacity, how to motivate marine wireless devices to conduct task processing becomes an important problem for improving computing efficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an incentive oriented two-tier task offloading scheme for marine edge computing networks via hybrid Stackelberg-auction game approach, with the objective of improving the offloading efficiency and maximizing marine wireless devices’ utilities. Specifically, for underwater acoustic transmission tier, we exploit multi-access task offloading scheme, in which underwater wireless sensor (UWS) uploads its workloads to an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and a sea surface sink node (SN) via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. We formulate the utility of each party and model the task offloading process among UWS, UUV and SN as a Stackelberg game to optimize the UWS’s offloading strategy, UUV’s and SN’s price strategies. For radio frequency transmission tier, SN can offload its partial workloads to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) via frequency division multiple access (FDMA) transmission. We provide their utilities and model the offloading process between a SN and a UAV as a double auction game to optimize their bidding strategies. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can obtain the optimal solutions and increase the utilities for marine wireless devices.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted wireless secure communication system is studied. A multi-antenna access point (AP) intends to send confidential information to a single-antenna user in the presence of an amplify-and-forward (AF) untrusted relay, which may eavesdrop the message when helping relay the signal. It is assumed that the direct link between the AP and the user is blocked by the obstacles. The achievable secrecy rate maximization problem is then formulated. To overcome the non-convexity of the formulated problem, an alternating iteration algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the active and passive beamforming. Specifically, the transmit beamforming vector at the AP, the phase shift matrix at the IRS, and the relay beamforming matrix are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions for the maximum secrecy rates of the proposed scheme in the high and low transmitted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes are derived as well. Finally, numerical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with other benchmark schemes, highlight the importance of properly designed phase shifts at the IRS, and validate the theoretical analysis. It is also demonstrated that the number of antennas at the AP should be strictly larger than the number of antennas at the relay to harvest the benefits of increasing the transmit power at the AP in increasing the secrecy rate.}

	abstract = {Vehicular platooning is a promising way to facilitate efficient movement of vehicles with a shared route. Despite its relevance, the interplay of platooning and the communication performance in the resulting vehicular network (VN) is largely unexplored. Inspired by this, we develop a comprehensive approach to statistical modeling and system-level analysis of VNs with platooned traffic. Modeling the network of roads using the by-now well-accepted Poisson line process (PLP), we place vehicles on each road according to an independent Matérn cluster process (MCP) that jointly captures randomness in the locations of platoons on the roads and vehicles within each platoon. The resulting triply-stochastic point process is a PLP-driven-Cox process, which we term the PLP-MCP. We first present this new point process’s distribution and derive several fundamental properties essential for the resulting VN’s analysis. Assuming that the cellular base-stations (BSs) are distributed as a Poisson point process (PPP), we derive the distribution of the loads served by the typical BS and the BS associated with the typical user. In deriving the latter, we also present a new approach to deriving the length distribution of a tagged chord in a Poisson Voronoi tessellation. Using the derived results, we present the rate coverage of the typical user while considering partial loading of the BSs. We also provide a comparative analysis of VNs with and without platooning of traffic.}

The trajectory is optimized based on max-min fairness to balance the total amount of uploaded data and the fairness among the SDs. The key idea is that we develop non-trivial variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to convexify data transmission, UAV energy consumption and mobility, and energy harvesting constraints under a persistent round-robin transmission schedule of the SDs. The resulting algorithm guarantees a locally optimal trajectory satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Another important aspect is that we further jointly optimize the transmission schedule along with the trajectory, and prove that absolute fairness in terms of uploaded data can be achieved among the SDs under the max-min fairness. The new algorithms apply to both line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant and probabilistic SD-UAV channels. Numerical results show that a 3D trajectory increases the uploaded data by 111%, compared to a two-dimensional (2D) trajectory. The proposed algorithms can balance the energy harvesting and data collection, and achieve fairness in both LoS-dominant and probabilistic SD-UAV channels.}

The proposed idea relies on the fact that, since the radar excitation is periodic, the radar clutter is itself periodic over time scales shorter than the coherence time of the environment. Upon deriving a convenient signal model, we propose two encoding/decoding schemes that do not require any coordination with the radar transmitter or knowledge of the radar waveform. Different tradeoffs in terms of transmission rate and error probability can be obtained upon changing the control signal driving the tag switch or the adopted encoding rule; also, multiple tags can be accommodated with either a sourced or an unsourced multiple access strategy. Some illustrative examples are provided.}

A camera is attached at the RIS to obtain the visual information about the surroundings, with which RIS identifies the incident beam direction and the desired reflected beam direction, and then adjusts the reflection coefficients according to the pre-designed codebooks. We build a 20-by-20 RIS running at 5.4 GHz and develop a high-speed control board to ensure the real-time refresh of the reflection coefficients. Meanwhile we implement an independent peer-to-peer communications system to simulate the physical link between the base station and the user equipment. The vision-aided RIS prototype system is tested in two mobile scenarios: RIS works in near-field conditions as a passive array antenna of the base station; RIS works in far-field conditions to assist the communication between the base station and the user equipment. The experimental results show that RIS can quickly adjust the reflection coefficients for dynamic beam tracking with the help of visual information.}

	abstract = {As an enabler technology in future network, terahertz (THz) joint radar-communication (T-JRC) has been envisioned as a solution to overcome the challenges in THz communications. Recent works on JRC mainly emphasize either performance tradeoffs or mutual benefits between radar and communication functionalities. Unable to characterize both benefit and tradeoff relationships, existing metrics and models are inapplicable to performance analysis on T-JRC systems. In this paper, a closed-form T-JRC performance model are proposed to explore the relationship between radar and communication metrics. To begin with, a novel T-JRC system model concerning random mobility and THz beam tracking is put forward. Next, the performance bounds of T-JRC performance in terms of communication rate and a proposed radar rate are acquired in three different integration cases. Furthermore, the expression of communication rate by radar rate in T-JRC is obtained theoretically, which is the first time to derive the closed-form relationship considering both benefits and tradeoffs to the best of our knowledge. Finally, numerical results validate the proposed model as well as closed-form expression, showing that the model succeeds in benefit and tradeoff relationship characterization in T-JRC systems and the fitting bounds are applicable in non-extreme scenarios.}

	abstract = {Although semantic communications have exhibited satisfactory performance on a large number of tasks, the impact of semantic noise and the robustness of the systems have not been well investigated. Semantic noise refers to the misleading between the intended semantic symbols and received ones, thus causes the failure of tasks. In this paper, we first propose a framework for the robust end-to-end semantic communication systems to combat the semantic noise. In particular, we analyze sample-dependent and sample-independent semantic noise. To combat the semantic noise, the adversarial training with weight perturbation is developed to incorporate the samples with semantic noise in the training dataset. Then, we propose to mask a portion of the input, where the semantic noise appears frequently, and design the masked vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with the noise-related masking strategy. We use a discrete codebook shared by the transmitter and the receiver for encoded feature representation. To further improve the system robustness, we develop a feature importance module (FIM) to suppress the noise-related and task-unrelated features. Thus, the transmitter simply needs to transmit the indices of these important task-related features in the codebook. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be applied in many downstream tasks and significantly improve the robustness against semantic noise with remarkable reduction on the transmission overhead.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have been recently proposed as an enabling technology for programmable wireless environments. In this paper, we present asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of RISs, using statistical physics methods. While nominally valid in the large-system limit, we show that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. We find that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread, which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. Using our novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs, we can optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. When the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.}

	abstract = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising new paradigm that has attracted much attention in recent years, which can enhance the storage and computing capabilities of vehicular networks to provide users with low latency and high-quality services. Due to the open access and unreliable wireless channels, some appropriate security measures should be implemented in the VEC to ensure information security. However, the operation of the security mechanism dominates supererogatory computing resources, thus affecting the performance of VEC systems. The scarcity of computation and energy resources of the vehicles conflicts with the requirement of tasks for time delay and information security. In this paper, taking the driving velocity and position of the vehicles, the number of lanes, the model and density of the attackers, and security strength into consideration, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to jointly optimize offloading decision, transmit power, task computation frequency, encryption computation frequency, edge computation frequency, and block length to obtain optimal secure information capacity and local computation delay. The formulated optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is intractable. We apply the generalized benders decomposition (GBD)-based method to solve it. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms have convergence and effectiveness and achieve fairness among vehicles on the road.}

In the considered system, the active RIS is adopted to enable the secure transmission of primary signals from the primary transmitter to multiple primary users in a multicasting manner, and simultaneously achieve its own information delivery to the secondary user by riding over the primary signals. Taking into account the imperfect channel state information (CSI) related with Eves, we formulate the system power consumption minimization problem by optimizing the transmit beamforming and reflection beamforming for the bounded and statistical CSI error models, taking the worst-case SNR constraints and the SNR outage probability constraints at the Eves into considerations, respectively. Specifically, the S-Procedure and the Bernstein-Type Inequality are implemented to approximately transform the worst-case SNR and the SNR outage probability constraints into tractable forms, respectively. After that, the formulated problems can be solved by the proposed alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with the semi-definite relaxation and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed active RIS scheme can reduce up to 27.0% system power consumption compared to the passive RIS.}

	abstract = {Extensive work has demonstrated the excellent performance of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation in high-mobility scenarios. Time-variant wideband channel estimation serves as one of the key compositions of OTFS receivers since the data detection requires accurate channel state information (CSI). In practical wideband OTFS systems, the Doppler shift brought by the high mobility is frequency-dependent, which is referred to as the Doppler Squint Effect (DSE). Unfortunately, DSE was ignored in overall prior estimation schemes employed in OTFS systems, which leads to severe performance loss in channel estimation and the consequent data detection. In this paper, we investigate DSE of wideband time-variant channel in delay-Doppler domain and concentrate on the characterization of OTFS channel coefficients considering DSE. The formulation and evaluation of OTFS input-output relationship are provided for both ideal and rectangular waveforms considering DSE. The channel estimation is therefore formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem and an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based scheme is adopted to solve it. Simulation results confirm the significance of DSE and the performance superiority compared with traditional channel estimation approaches ignoring DSE.}

The radar cross section (RCS) of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is calculated to develop a general path gain model for RISs and traditional scatterers. The results show that RISs have a greater potential to assist in localization due to their ability to maintain high RCSs and create strong NLOS links. A one-stage linear weighted least squares estimator is proposed to simultaneously determine user equipment (UE) locations, velocities, and scatterer (or RIS) locations using line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS paths. The estimator supports environment sensing and UE localization even using only NLOS paths. A second-stage estimator is also introduced to improve environment sensing accuracy by considering the nonlinear relationship between UE and scatterer locations. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in rich scattering environments and the benefits of using NLOS paths for improving UE location accuracy and assisting in environment sensing. The effects of RIS number, size, and deployment on localization performance are also analyzed.}

	abstract = {Distributed computing enables Internet of vehicle (IoV) services by collaboratively utilizing the computing resources from the network edge and the vehicles. However, the computing interruption issue caused by frequent edge network handoffs, and a severe shortage of computing resources are two problems in providing IoV services. High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can be a promising addition to existing distributed computing frameworks because of its wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. In this regard, this paper proposes an adaptive scheme in a new distributed computing framework that involves HAPS computing to deal with the two problems of the IoV. Based on the diverse demands of vehicles, network dynamics, and the time-sensitivity of handoffs, the proposed scheme flexibly divides each task into three parts and assigns them to the vehicle, roadside units (RSUs), and a HAPS to perform synchronous computing. The scheme also constrains the computing of tasks at RSUs such that they are completed before handoffs to avoid the risk of computing interruptions. On this basis, we formulate a delay minimization problem that considers task-splitting ratio, transmit power, bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation. To solve the problem, variable replacement and successive convex approximation–based method are proposed. The simulation results show that this scheme not only avoids the negative effects caused by handoffs in a flexible manner, it also takes delay performance into account and maintains the delay stability.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the utilization of triple polarization (TP) for multi-user (MU) wireless communication systems with holographic multiple-input multi-output surfaces (HMIMOSs), targeting capacity boosting and diversity exploitation without enlarging the antenna array sizes of the transceivers. We specifically consider that both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with an HMIMOS consisting of compact sub-wavelength TP patch antennas and operating in the near-field (NF) regime. To characterize TP MU-HMIMOS systems, a TP NF channel model is constructed using the dyadic Green’s function, whose characteristics are leveraged to design two precoding schemes for mitigating the cross-polarization and inter-user interference contributions. Specifically, a user-cluster-based precoding scheme that assigns different users to one of three polarizations, at the expense of system’s diversity, is presented together with a two-layer precoding technique that removes interference using a Gaussian elimination method. A theoretical correlation analysis for HMIMOS-based systems operating in the NF region is also derived, revealing that both the spacing of transmit patch antennas and user distance impact transmit correlation factors. Our numerical results showcase that the users located far from the transmit HMIMOS experience higher correlation than those closer in the NF region, resulting in a lower channel capacity. In terms of channel capacity, it is demonstrated that the proposed TP HMIMOS-based systems almost achieve 1.25 and 3 times larger gain compared to their dual-polarized version and conventional HMIMOS systems, respectively. It is also shown that the the proposed two-layer precoding scheme combined with two-layer power allocation realizes the highest spectral efficiency, among compared schemes, without sacrificing diversity.}

	abstract = {Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are an emerging technology that promises a significant diversity gain even in the smallest spaces. It consists of a freely moving antenna in a small linear space to pick up the strongest received signal. Previous works in the literature provide a simple yet insightful parameterization of the FAS channel that leads to single-integral expressions of the probability of outage and various insights on the achievable performance. Nevertheless, this channel model may not accurately capture the correlation between the FAS ports, given by Jake’s model. This work builds on the state-of-the-art by incorporating more parameters into the channel model to accurately approximate the FAS channel distribution while maintaining analytical tractability. The approximation is performed in two stages. The first stage approximation considerably reduces the number of multi-fold integrals in the probability of outage expression, while the second stage approximation represents it in a single integral form. Numerical results validate our approximations of the FAS channel model and demonstrate a limited performance gain under a more accurate correlation model. Further, our work opens the door for future research to investigate scenarios in which the FAS provides a performance gain compared to the current multiple antenna solutions.}

	abstract = {A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) allows a reflection transmission path between a base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). In wireless localization, this reflection path aids in positioning accuracy, especially when the line-of-sight (LOS) path is subject to severe blockage and fading. In this paper, we develop a RIS-aided positioning framework to locate a UE in environments where the LOS path may or may not be available. We first estimate the RIS-aided channel parameters from the received signals at the UE. To infer the UE position and clock bias from the estimated channel parameters, we propose a fusion method consisting of weighted least squares over the estimates of the LOS and reflection paths. We show that this approximates the maximum likelihood estimator under the large-sample regime and when the estimates from different paths are independent. We then optimize the RIS phase shifts to improve the positioning accuracy and extend the proposed approach to the case with multiple BSs and UEs. We derive Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) and demonstrate numerically that our proposed positioning method approaches the CRB.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to provide computational services to ground terminal devices (TDs) in remote areas or for emergency incidents with its flexibility and mobility. This paper aims to maximize the UAV’s energy efficiency while considering the fairness of offloading. We formulate this optimization problem by jointly considering the UAV flight time, the UAV 3D trajectory, the TD binary offloading decisions, and the time allocated to TDs, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The problem is transformed into two sub-problems and we propose a PDDQNLP (parametrized dueling deep Q-network and linear programming) algorithm based on the combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and linear programming (LP) to address them. For the first sub-problem, a DRL-based algorithm is used to optimize the TD offloading decisions, the UAV trajectory, and the UAV flight time. The action space is hybrid that contains discrete actions (e.g., binary offloading) and continuous actions (e.g., UAV flight time). Therefore, we parameterize the action space and propose the PDDQN algorithm, which combines the DDPG algorithm for handling the continuous action space and the Dueling DQN algorithm for handling the discrete action space. According to the solution obtained from the first sub-problem, the LP is used to adjust the time allocated to TDs in the second sub-problem. The numerical results show that the PDDQNLP algorithm outperforms its counterparts.}

First, a method increasing the dimension of the assignment matrix is presented to provide massive connectivity in each cell. The random pattern of arrangement of non-zero elements access (RPA) policy is utilized to allocate the available SCMA resources. Then the coverage probability is characterized under the nearest-BS (NBS) association mechanism by developing a multi-user connectivity model based on the RPA policy and average connectivity ratio (ACR). A compact closed-form expression of the coverage probability and its approximation are derived by utilizing the Toeplitz matrix and finite sum of power series, respectively. We then extract the area potential spectral efficiency (APSE) based on the coverage probability, and provide new insights into the 3D dense multi-cell SCMA networks.

	abstract = {Delay alignment modulation (DAM) has been recently proposed to enable manipulable channel delay spread for efficient single- or multi-carrier communications. In particular, with perfect delay alignment, inter-symbol interference (ISI) can be eliminated even with single-carrier (SC) transmission, without relying on sophisticated channel equalization. The key ideas of DAM are delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming, so that all multi-path signal components may arrive at the receiver simultaneously and be superimposed constructively, rather than causing the detrimental ISI. Compared to the classic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, DAM-enabled SC communication has several appealing advantages, including low peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) and high tolerance for Doppler frequency shift, which renders DAM also appealing for radar sensing. Therefore, in this paper, DAM is investigated for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We first study the output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for ISI-free SC communication and radar sensing, respectively, and then derive the closed-form expressions for DAM-based sensing in terms of the ambiguity function (AF) and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISR). Furthermore, we study the beamforming design problem for DAM-based ISAC to maximize the communication SNR while guaranteeing the sensing performance in terms of the sensing SNR and ISR. Finally, we provide performance comparison between DAM and OFDM for ISAC, and it is revealed that DAM signal may achieve better communication and sensing performance, thanks to its low PAPR, reduced guard interval overhead, as well as higher tolerance for Doppler frequency shift. Simulation results are provided to show the great potential of DAM for ISAC.}

	abstract = {The stochastic geometry-based modeling and analysis of large-scale mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are vital for the effective configuration of MEC networks. In this paper, we develop a meta-analytical framework for MEC-enabled heterogeneous networks with the communication-computation-aware (CCA) user association mechanism. Compared with the communication-based user association mechanisms in most existing works, the CCA user association mechanism can capture the impacts of network computation capability on the association process between the user and MEC access point, at the expense of dealing with the more complex coupling of communication and computing. Given the need for interference characterization, we first derive the essential prerequisite quantities (i.e., per-tier association probability, link distance distribution, interferer process intensity, etc.) to represent the computation-dependent interference model. Further, the moment and the meta distribution of the task success offloading probability are derived, based on which we investigate the task execution latency performance, including the communication latency, local computing latency, and edge computing latency. By theoretical analysis and simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed analytical framework can provide accurate fine-grained network information for the MEC-enabled HetNets. Moreover, we elaborate on the impacts of the edge computation capability on the network performance and reveal important tradeoffs of the performance metrics.}

	abstract = {The UnderWater Acoustic (UWA) communication is the foundation for oceanic information applications. However, existing UWA systems suffer from low data rate problem. Although the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) scheme is proved to be able to increase channel capacity in many terrestrial scenarios, the high cost and complexity of acoustic MIMO significantly limit its usage. Recently, the acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (acoustic RIS) concept has been proposed to address the aforementioned problem. In this paper, with the real-world constraints taken into consideration, three key components of the acoustic RIS are designed to realize the underwater RIS concept, including the new acoustic RIS hardware, the ultra-wideband (UWB) beamforming, and practical operation protocol. Specifically, a completely new hardware design of acoustic RIS is first provided, since existing electromagnetic RIS designed for terrestrial environments do not work for underwater acoustic waves. Then, the UWB beamforming solution is developed, since underwater acoustic RIS need to control the acoustic signals, whose bandwidth is comparable to its carrier frequency. Finally, the practical operation protocol is developed to realize the acoustic RIS functionalities in complex underwater environment. The acoustic RIS design is validated through both COMSOL multiphysics simulations and end-to-end Bellhop-based simulations.}

	abstract = {With the development of computation-intensive applications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-access edge computing (MEC) provides task offloading service for the users with or without terrestrial infrastructure support. Meanwhile, the next generation of UAVs communication systems are expected to be user-centric. Therefore, more attention should be paid to users’ satisfaction with the offered service. In this paper, we study the service satisfaction-oriented task offloading and UAV scheduling problem for UAV-enabled MEC networks, where the task priorities are considered based on the delay requirements of users’ tasks and the remaining energy status of users. Specifically, we firstly divide the users into different groups via the K-means-based grouping algorithm. Then, we develop a novel user satisfaction model by jointly considering the task processing delay and energy saving, based on which a total user satisfaction maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the task offloading decisions and UAV scheduling strategy. To solve the formulated problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., the UAV scheduling sub-problem and the task offloading sub-problem. To solve the first sub-problem, we develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-based UAV scheduling algorithm through dealing with multiple balanced assignment problems. To address the second sub-problem, a GA-based task offloading algorithm is developed. Then, we propose a joint task offloading and UAV scheduling optimization algorithm to solve the original optimization problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization algorithm not only converges fast, but also improves the total users’ satisfaction greatly. The total users’ satisfaction improved by the proposed scheme is up to 16.9% in the case of 170 users.}

	abstract = {The strong interference suffered by users can be a severe problem in cache-enabled networks (CENs) due to the content-centric user association mechanism. To tackle this issue, multi-antenna technology may be employed for interference management. In this paper, we consider a user-centric interference nulling (IN) scheme in two-tier multi-user multi-antenna CEN, with a hybrid most-popular and random caching policy at macro base stations (MBSs) and small base stations (SBSs) to provide file diversity. All the interfering SBSs within the IN range of a user are requested to suppress the interference at this user using zero-forcing beamforming. Using stochastic geometry analysis techniques, we derive a tractable expression for the area spectral efficiency (ASE). A lower bound on the ASE is also obtained, with which we then consider ASE maximization, by optimizing the caching policy and IN coefficient. To solve the resultant mixed integer programming problem, we design an alternating optimization algorithm to minimize the lower bound of the ASE. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed caching policy yields performance that is close to the optimum, and it outperforms several existing baselines.}

	abstract = {We study a multi-source wireless power transfer (WPT) enabled network supporting multi-sensor transmissions. Activated by the energy harvesting from multiple WPT sources, the sensors transmit short packets to a destination with finite blocklength (FBL) codes. This work for the first time characterizes the FBL reliability for such multi-source WPT enabled network and accordingly provides reliability-oriented resource allocation designs, while a practical nonlinear EH model (including the effects of mutual interference among multiple RF signals) is considered. For the scenario with a fixed frame structure, we aim to maximize the FBL reliability via optimally allocating the transmit power among the multiple WPT sources. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the overall error probability and the transmit power of multiple WPT sources, based on which a power allocation problem is formulated. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we first introduce auxiliary variables to make the problem analytically tractable, based on which an iterative algorithm is proposed while applying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to the non-convex components of the problem. Then, we extend our design into a dynamic frame structure scenario, i.e., the blocklength allocated for WPT phase and short-packet transmission phase are adjustable, which introduces more flexibility and new challenges. In particular, we provide a joint power and blocklength allocation design maximizing the overall reliability under total power and blocklength constraints. A problem with high-dimension variables is formulated, which suffers from the complex and non-convex relationship among system reliability, multiple source power and blocklength. To tackle the difficulties, auxiliary variables introduction, multiple variable substitutions along with SCA technique utilization are exploited to reformulate and efficiently solve the problem. Finally, through numerical results, we validate our analytical model and evaluate the system performance, where a set of guidelines for practical system design are concluded.}

We give the definition of a T\n-size UDAS set, and construct two kinds of UDAS sets based on cyclic and quasi-cyclic modes.

To address this issue, in this research, we develop a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced uplink UCN, where RIS is exploited to improve the signal quality of uplink transmission for users with virtually no extra energy consumption. To approach an optimal energy efficiency, we jointly perform reflect beamforming at RISs and uplink power control at users. This is formulated into a non-convex and intractable energy efficiency maximization problem. To solve it effectively, we decompose it into two subproblems and carry out the optimization alternately. That is, we design the reflect beamforming matrices at RISs through fractional programming and an uplink power control at users through constructing a surrogate function via majorization-minimization algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could achieve significant gain both on energy efficiency and spectral efficiency compared to the benchmark algorithm.}

Then, we show that the optimization problem is nonconvex and develop a novel algorithm to obtain the stationary point of the SSP maximization problem by adopting the parallel successive convex approximation (SCA). Moreover, to further reduce the computational complexity, we also provide a low complex algorithm that can obtain the near-optimal solution of the SSP maximization problem in high computing capability region. Finally, from numerical simulations, we show that proposed solutions achieve higher SSP than baseline schemes. Moreover, we show that the near-optimal solution achieves reliable performance in the high computing capability region. We also explore the impacts of target delays, a BSs’ service cache size, and an EC servers’ computing capability on the SSP.}

	abstract = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided coherent communications, channel state information (CSI) is often assumed to be perfectly estimated at the receiver. However, perfect CSI cannot be available in practice. Furthermore, the complex and ever-changing channel makes the acquisition of accurate CSI often unaffordable because of the large overhead in transmitting pilot signals. Motivated by these considerations, a novel non-coherent RIS-aided joint index keying M\n-ary differential chaos shift keying (RIS-JIK-MDCSK) system is proposed in this paper, where the receiver can retrieve information bits by performing non-coherent correlation demodulation without requiring CSI, thereby reducing the system complexity. In RIS-JIK-MDCSK, the states of the reference signal, RIS elements, and information-bearing subcarriers are jointly optimized to devise a joint index keying mechanism, where additional information bits are implicitly transmitted by these state indices, thus increasing the throughput and spectral efficiency. Furthermore, an effective joint index keying detection algorithm is proposed to recover the information bits. The analytical bit error rate (BER) of RIS-JIK-MDCSK is derived over a Rayleigh fading channel. Other evaluation metrics, including the throughput, spectral efficiency, and system complexity are also analyzed and compared against benchmark systems. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the superiority of RIS-JIK-MDCSK compared to existing systems.}

	abstract = {The swarm relay and power allocation policy determines the bit error rate and the energy consumption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and can be optimized based on the network and jamming model, which is rarely known by UAVs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based UAV swarm communication scheme to optimize the relay selection and power allocation against jamming. Based on the network topology, channel states, previous performance and observations shared by the neighboring UAVs, this scheme formulates the policy distribution to improve the policy exploration and applies a policy learning mechanism to stabilize the learning process. Based on transfer learning, the shared swarm experiences are exploited to accelerate the initial learning and improve policy optimization. A deep RL-based scheme is proposed to mitigate the state quantization error for the rapidly changing channel states under high swarm moving speed and thus further improve the anti-jamming performance. This scheme designs a policy network with four fully connected layers to approximate the policy distribution and uses another two neural networks to estimate the average policy distribution and the expected long-term utility, respectively, to update the policy network for stabilized deep learning. We investigate the computational complexity and derive the performance bound regarding the bit error rate, the energy consumption and the utility. Simulation and experimental results verify the performance gain of our proposed schemes over related works.}

	abstract = {The low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in the terahertz (THz) band is one of the promising technologies to provide global coverage and high-rate transmission to the airplane, whose key performance evaluation is required before realistic deployment. In this paper, we consider a downlink THz LEO satellite-airplane network with directional antennas, where the satellites follow a binomial point process on a spherical surface. Incorporating the distinctive THz propagation properties and directional beams in the two scenarios with/without molecular absorption noise, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the coverage probability and average achievable rate of an arbitrary airplane. The analytical results are expressed in terms of the Laplace transforms of the interference-plus-molecular absorption noise and interference. Specifically, considering a frequency reuse strategy, we first provide the probability distributions of the distances from an arbitrary satellite, the serving satellite and any non-serving satellite to the target airplane, and calculate the probabilities of whether an interfering satellite is blocked by the Earth. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the analytical expressions and show that fewer orthogonal channels and lower LEO satellite altitude lead to better coverage and rate performance. As a key parameter in network design, the number of satellites has two competing effects on coverage and rate, and an optimum satellite number exists. Overall, this study provides theoretical guidance for deploying and planning THz satellite constellations.}

In the proposed method, the dimming level can be controlled at a transmitter using a single parameter that a receiver need not know. In addition, the dimming parameter can be adjusted by the transmitter at any time without affecting the quality of data transmissions. Expressions of the illumination percentage and the bit error rate (BER) are derived taking into account the dimming parameter, and validated through comparisons with simulation results. Using these expressions, it is possible to specify the dimming parameter at the transmitter based on the desired illumination percentage and estimate the corresponding BER for data transmissions. Numerical results indicate that, compared to adjusting the direct current (DC) bias for dimming control, the proposed method provides a wider dimming range subject to a constraint on the BER.}

The novelty of this architecture is its flexibility, i.e., allowing the designers to produce a device that may include any type of modes operating seamlessly and jointly by exchanging data, control and synchronization. Many challenges, including high system costs and coordination between different modes, are addressed in the paper. Moreover, numerical evaluation is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed UniSDM architecture. Finally, the performance evaluation shows that the utilization of the UniSDM allows to decrease the transmission latency and improve the energy efficiency, while maintaining high reliability and robustness in underwater communication systems.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a low-complexity groupwise detection scheme for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on two key features of massive MIMO channels. First, most inter-user correlations tend to be negligible as the number of antennas\nM\nat the base station (BS) increases, while some users might have a high correlation that is indistinguishable for linear projection-based detectors. We hence develop a variational Bayesian inference-based groupwise (VBI-G) detector based on a factorization approximation of the a posteriori probability of transmitted symbols, which sequentially performs nonlinear detection for small groups of highly correlated users without computations of large-scale matrices. Second, the variation of normalized inter-user correlation is insignificant over a wide range of frequency, thereby user grouping based on correlation coefficients can be performed on a wideband basis. Accordingly, we propose a low-complexity incremental greedy grouping algorithm for minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the unconditioned posterior probabilities with the constraint of a maximum group size. Theoretical analysis proves that for a BS equipped with a uniform linear array, the maximum group size grows logarithmically with the number of users\nK\nwith high probability in the regime\nM,K→∞\nwith\nK/M<1/2\nunder the worst line-of-sight propagation condition. Simulation results verify that the proposed VBI-G detector achieves superior performance with an extremely low computational overhead for massive MIMO systems.}

	abstract = {Relaying is an effective method to achieve reliable and timely data collection, which is one of the most important parts of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). Considering that the relay position determines the reliability of relay communication, we study the problem of relay placement and place an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to mobile relay data transmission and realize the reliable, low-latency, and low-energy data collection in UASNs. First, we formulate the relay positions that can meet a certain frame error rate (FER) requirement as the FER-restricted area (FRA), and approximate FRA with a three-dimensional geometry formula. The problem of reliable and timely data collection becomes planning a short AUV relaying trajectory under the FRA constraint. To this end, we propose a nearest-community (N-C) trajectory planning algorithm to design the AUV relay trajectory. A member grouping method and the necessity of position (NoP) concept are proposed to further reduce the relay positions and trajectory length of the AUV. Simulation results verify that the approximate FRA is more than 90% consistent with the real FRA and show that the N-C using NoP-based member grouping can successfully receive more packets per minute and consume fewer sensors’ energy than other algorithms.}

	abstract = {Motivated by the increasing computational capabilities of wireless devices, as well as unprecedented levels of user- and device-generated data, new distributed machine learning (ML) methods have emerged. In the wireless community, Federated Learning (FL) is of particular interest due to its communication efficiency and its ability to deal with the problem of non-IID data. FL training can be accelerated by a wireless communication method called Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp) which harnesses the interference of simultaneous uplink transmissions to efficiently aggregate model updates. However, since AirComp utilizes analog communication, it introduces inevitable estimation errors. In this paper, we study the impact of such estimation errors on the convergence of FL and propose retransmissions as a method to improve FL accuracy over resource-constrained wireless networks. First, we derive the optimal AirComp power control scheme with retransmissions over static channels. Then, we investigate the performance of Over-the-Air FL with retransmissions and find two upper bounds on the FL loss function. Numerical results demonstrate that the power control scheme offers significant reductions in mean squared error. Additionally, we provide simulation results on MNIST classification with a deep neural network that reveals significant improvements in classification accuracy for low-SNR scenarios.}

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) in future practical wireless systems is critically dependent on the integration of the RIS into higher-layer protocols beyond the physical (PHY) one, an issue that has received minimal attention in the research literature. In light of this, we consider a classical random access (RA) problem, where uncoordinated users’ equipment (UEs) transmit sporadically to an access point (AP). Differently from previous works, we ponder how a RIS can be integrated into the design of new medium access control (MAC) layer protocols to solve such a problem. We consider that the AP is able to control a RIS to change how its reflective elements are configured, namely, the RIS configurations. Thus, the RIS can be opportunistically controlled to favor the transmission of some of the UEs without the need to explicitly perform channel estimation (CHEST). We embrace this observation and propose a RIS-assisted RA protocol comprised of two modules: Channel Oracle and Access. During channel oracle, the UEs learn how the RIS configurations affect their channel conditions. During the access, the UEs tailor their access policies using the channel oracle knowledge. Our proposed RIS-assisted protocol is able to increase the expected throughput by approximately 60% in comparison to the slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) protocol.}

To exploit the structure information inherited in the received signals from massive antenna array, multi-mode reservoir computing is adopted as the building block to facilitate over-the-air training in time domain. In addition, alternating recursive least square optimization method, and decision feedback mechanism are utilized in our algorithm to achieve the real-time learning capability. That is, the neural network is trained purely online with its weights updated on an OFDM symbol basis to promptly and adaptively track the dynamic environment. Furthermore, an online learning-based module is devised to compensate the nonlinear distortion caused by RF circuit components. On top of that, a learning-efficient classifier named StructNet is introduced in frequency domain to further improve the symbol detection performance by utilizing the QAM constellation structural pattern. Evaluation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves substantial gain over traditional model-based approach and state-of-the-art learning-based techniques under dynamic channel environment and RF circuit nonlinear distortion. Moreover, empirical result reveals our NN model is robust to training label error, which benefits the decision feedback mechanism.}

The proposed ultra-wideband technique is based on phase-mode expansions and the use of nearly frequency-invariant elliptical arrays. New possibilities open with the present approach, as not only elliptical, but also circular and linear (highly flattened) arrays can be considered with the same implementation. Systematic selection/rejection of signals-of-interest/signals-not-of-interest in smart wireless environments is possible, unlike with previous approaches based on circular arrays. Concentric elliptical arrays of many sizes and eccentricities can be jointly considered, with the subsequent improvement that entails in DoA and ToA detection. This leads to the realization of pseudo-random array patterns; namely, quasi-arbitrary geometries created from the superposition of multiple elliptical arrays. Some simulation and experimental tests (measurements in an anechoic chamber) are carried out for several frequency bands to check the correct performance of the method. The method is proven to give accurate estimations in all tested scenarios, and to be robust against noise and position uncertainty in sensor placement.}

	abstract = {Hybrid precoding has been considered as a promising technology for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, since it can achieve a tradeoff between system performance and hardware complexity. However, the optimal solution is difficult to obtain due to the coupling between analog precoder and digital precoder, as well as the non-convex constant modulus constraint, especially in multiuser scenarios. In this paper, we investigate several hybrid transceiver designs in wideband mmWave massive multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems for maximizing the spectral efficiency. Firstly, we propose two joint designs of hybrid precoder and combiner based on alternating optimization. Specifically, the intractable spectral efficiency maximization problem is reformulated as an equivalent weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem. To design the analog precoder and combiner with non-convex constant modulus constraint, we develop two efficient algorithms based on majorization minimization (MM) and element-wise block coordinate descent (EBCD) techniques, respectively. Secondly, to reduce the computational complexity, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook based scheme, which can enhance the beamforming gain and mitigate the inter-beam interference. Thirdly, the convergence and complexity analysis are presented. The proposed two alternating optimization algorithms are guaranteed to converge to locally optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid transceiver designs achieve significant performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have suffered from extremely high hardware complexity and cost because of the introduction of a tremendous number of antennas. Recently, one way to alleviate this is by considering the unequal uplink and downlink data transmission requirements and employing an asymmetrical transceiver. Such asymmetrical transceiver architecture, however, also brings out channel dimension inconsistency between the uplink and downlink. Thus, to well achieve the large array gain and fully exploit the potentials of asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO systems, accurately recovering the full-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI) based on the obtained small-dimensional uplink CSI is necessary. Nevertheless, the CSI at different antennas plays a different role in the CSI recovery due to the spatial correlation. Therefore, investigating appropriate antenna selection for asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO systems is valuable and essential. To address this, we first formulate the antenna selection problem to minimize the mean-square recovery error of the full-dimensional downlink CSI in this paper. Then, two receive antenna selection algorithms are proposed by exploiting the low-rank property of the spatial correlation matrices under single-user scenarios. We also extend these algorithms to multi-user scenarios, and semi-closed-form optimal selection coefficients are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that, with the aid of the proposed antenna selection algorithms, the full-dimensional downlink CSI can be well recovered, which thus paves the way for asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO systems to achieve their excellent downlink transmission performance with a much lower overall system hardware complexity and cost.}

The channel impulse response (CIR) of the proposed multi-UAV cooperative channel model is derived, including line-of-sight (LoS), ground reflection, and non-LoS (NLoS) transmissions. To capture the 3D continuously arbitrary trajectories of multi-UAVs, the 3D time-varying accelerations of multi-UAVs, clusters, and ground station (GS) and the multi-UAVs’ self-rotations are taken into account. In addition, to model the non-stationarity of massive MIMO mmWave multi-UAV cooperative channels in the A-S-T-F domain, a new cooperative A-S-T-F non-stationary algorithm based on the birth-death (BD) process and the\nK\n-Means clustering algorithm is developed. Important cooperative channel statistical properties, including cooperative array-space-time-frequency correlation function (ASTF-CF), cooperative Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), cooperative time stationary interval, and singular value spread (SVS), are derived and investigated. The accuracy of the proposed multi-UAV cooperative channel model is verified by the close agreement between ray-tracing-based results and simulation results.}

	abstract = {Semantic communications utilize the transceiver computing resources to alleviate scarce transmission resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Although the conventional deep learning (DL) based designs may achieve certain transmission efficiency, the uninterpretability issue of extracted features is the major challenge in the development of semantic communications. In this paper, we propose an explainable and robust semantic communication framework by incorporating the well-established bit-level communication system, which not only extracts and disentangles features into independent and semantically interpretable features, but also only selects task-relevant features for transmission, instead of all extracted features. Based on this framework, we derive the optimal input for rate-distortion-perception theory, and derive both lower and upper bounds on the semantic channel capacity. Furthermore, based on the\nβ\n-variational autoencoder (\nβ\n-VAE), we propose a practical explainable semantic communication system design, which simultaneously achieves semantic features selection and is robust against semantic channel noise. We further design a real-time wireless mobile semantic communication proof-of-concept prototype. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate that our proposed explainable semantic communications system can significantly improve transmission efficiency, and also verify the effectiveness of our proposed robust semantic transmission scheme.}

	abstract = {The time of arrival (TOA)-based localization techniques, which need to estimate the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path, have been widely employed in location-aware networks. To achieve a high-accuracy delay estimation, a number of multiband-based algorithms have been proposed recently, which exploit the channel state information (CSI) measurements over multiple non-contiguous frequency bands. However, to the best of our knowledge, there still lacks an efficient scheme that fully exploits the multiband gains when the phase distortion factors caused by hardware imperfections are considered, due to that the associated multi-parameter estimation problem contains many local optimums and the existing algorithms can easily get stuck in a “bad” local optimum. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage global estimation (TSGE) scheme for multiband delay estimation. In the coarse stage, we exploit the group sparsity structure of the multiband channel and propose a Turbo Bayesian inference (Turbo-BI) algorithm to achieve a good initial delay estimation based on a coarse signal model, which is transformed from the original multiband signal model by absorbing the carrier frequency terms. The estimation problem derived from the coarse signal model contains fewer local optimums and thus a more stable estimation can be achieved than directly using the original signal model. Then in the refined stage, with the help of coarse estimation results to narrow down the search range, we perform a global delay estimation using a particle swarm optimization-least square (PSO-LS) algorithm based on a refined multiband signal model to exploit the multiband gains to further improve the estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed TSGE significantly outperforms the benchmarks with comparative computational complexity.}

Machine learning techniques for channel prediction hold much promise, but current schemes are limited in their ability to adapt to changes in the environment because they require large training overheads. To accurately predict wireless channels for new environments with reduced training overhead, we propose a fast adaptive channel prediction technique based on a meta-learning algorithm for massive MIMO communications. We exploit the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm to achieve quick adaptation with a small amount of labeled data. Also, to improve the prediction accuracy, we adopt the denoising process for the training data by using deep image prior (DIP). Numerical results show that the proposed MAML-based channel predictor can improve the prediction accuracy with only a few fine-tuning samples in various scenarios. The DIP-based denoising process gives an additional gain in channel prediction, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes.}

	abstract = {Currently, the volume of communication by mobile terminals are increasing owing to 5G and other technologies. A robust network and appropriate routing control methods are requied to transmit information in unstable wireless communication environments and avoid congestion. Therefore, in recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on wireless mesh networks (WMNs), which provide a fault-tolerant communication environment by securing multiple communication paths and whose topology can be freely configured and extended. Additionally, machine learning routing is attracting attention as a new routing method for wireless communication environments. However, when performing machine learning on a large WMN, the learning time increases and rapid routing control may be impossible. In this study, we apply federated learning to machine learning and propose a machine-learning-based routing method that can be applied to large-scale WMNs. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various environments: congestion avoidance is achieved in a large-scale WMN by machine-learning routing using federated learning. This study is expected to serve as a basis for significant progress in the realization of large-scale WMNs as wireless communication infrastructure.}

The study on interference management in ISAC has been envisioned as one of key technologies to support ubiquitous sensing functions. Different from the current work, a communications-sensing-intelligence converged network architecture is proposed to coordinate interference in this paper. Each base station equips with the individual deep neural networks to allocate power and beamforming. On this basis, the interference management is transformed into a functional optimization with stochastic constraints. An unsupervised learning algorithm is proposed to allocate power for interference management. Furthermore, a transfer learning method is presented to obtain the interference management in terms of transmit beamforming. Finally, the distributed management is obtained from the local channel state information in the multi-cell scenario. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised learning interference management method in the ISAC systems.}

	abstract = {This work presents a machine learning approach to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) in a multi-cell wireless network. This optimization problem is non-convex and its global optimum is difficult to find. In the literature, either simple but suboptimal approaches or optimal methods with high complexity are proposed. In contrast, we propose an unsupervised machine learning framework to approach the global optimum. While the neural network (NN) training takes moderate time, application with the trained model requires very low computational complexity. In particular, we introduce a novel objective function based on stochastic actions to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Besides, we design a dedicated NN architecture SINRnet for the power allocation problems in the interference channel that is permutation-equivariant. We encode our domain knowledge into the NN design and shed light into the black box of machine learning. Training and testing results show that the proposed method without supervision and with reasonable computational effort achieves an EE close to the global optimum found by the branch-and-bound algorithm and outperform the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Hence, the proposed approach balances between computational complexity and performance.}

For a comprehensive Bayesian analysis, both near and far field regimes are considered. The Bayesian analysis views both the location of the RISs and previous information about the UE as a priori information for UE localization. With outdated a priori information, the position and orientation offsets of the RISs become parameters that need to be estimated and fed back to the BS for correction. We first show that when the RIS elements have a half wavelength spacing, this RIS orientation offset is a factor in the pathloss of the RIS paths. Subsequently, we show through the Bayesian equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) for the channel parameters that the RIS orientation offset cannot be corrected when there is an unknown phase offset in the received signal in the far-field regime. However, the corresponding EFIM for the channel parameters in the received signal observed in the near-field shows that this unknown phase offset does not hinder the estimation of the RIS orientation offset when the UE has more than one receive antenna. Furthermore, we use the EFIM for the UE location parameters to present bounds for UE localization in the presence of RIS uncertainty. We rigorously show that regardless of size and propagation regime, the RISs are only helpful for localization when there is a priori information about the location of the RISs. Finally, through numerical analysis of the EFIM and its smallest eigenvalue, we demonstrate the loss in information when the far-field model is incorrectly applied to the signals received at a UE experiencing near-field propagation.}

We focus on improving the overall system performance by designing deep neural network (DNN) architectures for both channel estimation and data demodulation. To accomplish this, we employ the basis expansion model to track the channel tap variations, and exploit convolutional neural networks’ learning abilities of local correlations together with a coarse least square solution for a robust and accurate channel estimation procedure. For data demodulation, we use a recurrent neural network for improved performance and robustness as single tap frequency-domain equalizers perform poorly, and more sophisticated equalization techniques such as band-limited linear minimum mean squared error equalizers are vulnerable to model mismatch and channel estimation errors. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed DNN architectures outperform the traditional algorithms. Specifically, the bit error rate results for a wide range of Doppler values reveal that the proposed DNN-based equalizer is robust, and it mitigates the ICI effectively, offering an excellent demodulation performance. We further note that the DNN-based channel estimator offers an improved performance with a reduced computational complexity.}

To limit the power consumption due to fronthaul signaling and processing, each UE should only be served by a subset of the APs, but it is hard to identify that subset. Previous works have tackled this combinatorial problem heuristically. In this paper, we propose a sparse distributed processing design for CF mMIMO, where the AP-UE association and long-term signal processing coefficients are jointly optimized. We formulate two sparsity-inducing mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problems and solve them by using efficient proximal approaches with block-coordinate descent. For the downlink, more specifically, we develop a virtually optimized large-scale fading precoding (V-LSFP) scheme using uplink-downlink duality. The numerical results show that the proposed sparse processing schemes work well in both uplink and downlink. In particular, they achieve almost the same spectral efficiency as if all APs would serve all UEs, while the energy efficiency is 2–4 times higher thanks to the reduced processing and signaling.}

	abstract = {The need for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services has significantly increased in the last few years. This integration imposes serious challenges such as joint system design, resource allocation, optimization, and analysis. Since sensing and telecommunication systems have different approaches for performance evaluation, introducing a unified performance measure which provides a perception about the quality of sensing and telecommunication is very beneficial. To this end, this paper provides performance analysis for ISAC systems based on the information theoretical framework of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). The considered system model consists of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base-station (BS) providing ISAC services to multiple communication user equipments (CUEs) and targets (or sensing-served users). The KLD framework allows for a unified evaluation of the error rate performance of CUEs, and the detection performance of the targets. The relation between the detection capability for the targets and error rate of CUEs on one hand, and the proposed KLD on the other hand is illustrated analytically. Theoretical results corroborated by simulations show that the derived KLD is very accurate and can perfectly characterize both subsystems, namely the communication and radar subsystems.}

	abstract = {With the accelerated popularization of 5G applications, accurate cellular traffic prediction is becoming increasingly important for efficient network management. Currently, the latest algorithms for cellular traffic prediction generally neglect extraction of the shallow features of cellular traffic and the prediction accuracy is hence limited. Therefore, we propose a global-local spatial-temporal transformer network (GLSTTN) that can fully excavate diverse spatial-temporal characteristics of cellular traffic for accurate cellular traffic prediction. Specifically, GLSTTN achieves this goal by constructing two modules: the global spatial-temporal module and the local spatial-temporal module. In the global spatial-temporal module, GLSTTN captures global correlations using stacked spatial-temporal blocks, where each block is composed of one spatial transformer and one temporal transformer. A skip connection is then used in each block to strengthen feature propagation. In the local spatial-temporal module, GLSTTN fully extracts the local spatial-temporal dependencies hidden in globally encoded features using densely connected convolutional neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLSTTN achieves more accurate cellular traffic prediction than existing approaches on a real-world cellular traffic dataset.}

	abstract = {For the target tracking problem where the number of targets fluctuates with time and the measurement is a point measurement, the random finite set (RFS) class filtering is an available solution. However, in direction of arrival (DOA) tracking, the array observation is a super-positional value, and the tracking performance can be severely impaired if the RFS-based filter approach is applied. As a result, a novel measurement association mapping (NMAP) approach has been presented to cope with the mapping problem between the array observations and sources. Nevertheless, the tracking performance is poor when the number of particles is small. In this paper, a modified delta-Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (\nδ\n-GLMB) DOA tracking particle filter is proposed in combination with the NMAP strategy, which can achieve the same tracking performance with a smaller number of particles by modifying the particles in the\nδ\n-GLMB prediction step. Furthermore, the approach is extended to a coprime array and can achieve better DOA tracking performance than a uniform linear array. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Under the organization of the base station (BS), wireless federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple devices. However, the BS is merely responsible for aggregating local updates during the training process, which incurs a waste of the computational resources at the BS. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) paradigm to leverage the computing capabilities of both the BS and devices for a hybrid implementation of centralized learning (CL) and FL. Specifically, each device sends both local gradients and data samples to the BS for training a shared global model. To improve communication efficiency over the same time-frequency resources, we integrate over-the-air computation for aggregation and non-orthogonal multiple access for transmission by designing a novel transceiver structure. To gain deep insights, we conduct convergence analysis by deriving a closed-form optimality gap for SemiFL and extend the result to two extra cases. In the first case, the BS uses all accumulated data samples to calculate the CL gradient, while a decreasing learning rate is adopted in the second case. Our analytical results capture the destructive effect of wireless communication and show that both FL and CL are special cases of SemiFL. Then, we formulate a non-convex problem to reduce the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmit power and receive beamformers. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage algorithm to solve this intractable problem, in which we provide closed-form solutions to the beamformers. Extensive simulation results on two real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical analysis, and show that the proposed SemiFL outperforms conventional FL and achieves 3.2% accuracy gain on the MNIST dataset compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.}

	abstract = {To realize ultra-reliable low latency communications with high spectral efficiency and security, we investigate a joint optimization problem for downlink communications with multiple users and eavesdroppers in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize a sum secrecy rate by developing a secure precoder and to minimize a maximum error probability and information leakage rate. The main challenges arise from the complicated multi-objective problem, non-tractable back-off factors from the FBL assumption, non-convexity and non-smoothness of the secrecy rate, and the intertwined optimization variables. To address these challenges, we adopt an alternating optimization approach by decomposing the problem into two phases: secure precoding design, and maximum error probability and information leakage rate minimization. In the first phase, we obtain a lower bound of the secrecy rate and derive a first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition to identify local optimal solutions with respect to the precoders. Interpreting the condition as a generalized eigenvalue problem, we solve the problem by using a power iteration-based method. In the second phase, we adopt a weighted-sum approach and derive KKT conditions in terms of the error probabilities and leakage rates for given precoders. Simulations validate the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {This paper studies reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted device activity detection for grant-free (GF) uplink transmission in wireless communication networks. In particular, we consider mobile devices located in an area where the direct link to an access point (AP) is blocked. Thus, the devices try to connect to the AP via a reflected link provided by an RIS. Therefore, for the RIS, a phase-shift design is desired that covers the entire blocked area with a wide reflection beam because the exact locations and times of activity of the devices are unknown in GF transmission. In order to study the impact of the phase-shift design on the device activity detection at the AP, we derive a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based detector and present an analytical expression for the probability of detection, which is a function of the channel statistics and the phase-shift design. Assuming knowledge of statistical channel state information (CSI), we formulate an optimization problem for the phase-shift design for maximization of the guaranteed probability of detection for all locations within a given coverage area. To tackle the non-convexity of the problem, we propose two different approximations of the objective function and an algorithm based on the majorization-minimization (MM) principle. The first approximation leads to a design that aims to reduce the variations of the end-to-end channel while taking system parameters such as transmit power, noise power, and probability of false alarm into account. The second approximation can be adopted for versatile RIS deployments because it only depends on the line-of-sight (LoS) component of the end-to-end channel and is not affected by system parameters. For comparison, we also consider a phase-shift design maximizing the average channel gain and a baseline analytical phase-shift design for large blocked areas. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed approximations result in phase-shift designs that guarantee a high probability of detection across the coverage area and outperform the baseline designs.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless network has been recognized as an effective technology to facilitate the formation of a super flexible low-altitude platform for relieving the strain on traditional ground cellular systems. However, the on-demand deployment of the UAV-assisted wireless networks (OWN) becomes an essential yet challenging issue, as the constraints of UAVs’ location, resource provisioning, and demand distribution should be jointly considered. In this work, we investigate the OWN problem by proposing an autonomous learning framework (ALF) consisting of three sequential stages: demand prediction, proactive deployment, and resource allocation fine-tuning, which can be capable of autonomous network planning without reliance on manual operations in an extremely dynamic environment. In the demand prediction stage, we first design a dual transformer network (DTN) to capture the temporal and spatial dependencies of wireless traffic. We further reduce the computational complexity of DTN from quadratic time complexity to log-linear time complexity. In the proactive deployment stage, we jointly optimize the UAVs’ location and resource provisioning by proposing a modified general benders decomposition algorithm with a\nΓ\n-optimal convergence, where a learning-based discerning module is designed to accelerate the algorithm. In the resource allocation fine-tuning stage, we propose a simulated annealing-based algorithm to minimize the transmission rate degradation of users to reduce the bias caused by traffic demand prediction. Extensive numerical results based on an open source dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison with existing baselines.}

To address this increased complexity, in this paper we first propose an unfolding-friendly iterative algorithm, which can efficiently address a family of non-convex and non-smooth problems. Then, we develop an efficient approach to unfold the iterative algorithm designed. Besides being applicable to important and typical iterative optimization algorithms, a pivotal advantage of the proposed unfolding approach is that the trainable parameters are scalars (rather than matrices). This, in turn, reduces the number of training samples required and makes it suitable for rapidly fluctuating wireless environments. We apply the algorithm unfolding (AU) techniques developed to our UPPiDO-based symbol-level precoding and block-level precoding. Our complexity analysis indicates that the computational complexity is scalable both with the numbers of served users and antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the number of outer iterations (or layers) required is about 1/3 of that of the original iterative algorithms.}

To support massive connectivity while fulfilling diverse requirements of both HTC and MTC, we present a device-to-device aided rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme by encoding both the MTC devices’ messages and HTC users’ common messages into a general common data stream in each cell (or group). Nevertheless, such deploying strategy may bring challenges in complex resource allocation and transmission modes selection. In view of this, we introduce a simple received signal strength (RSS) based transmission modes selection scheme, through which the RSS-threshold selection problem is formulated to maximize the HTC and MTC sum rates. Considering the computational complexity and scalability, we employ a multi-agent reinforcement learning based algorithm for each small base station to choose the optimal RSS threshold thus to achieve maximum sum rate while maintaining massive connectivity. Simulation results reveal our proposed RSMA deploying strategy outperforms non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in system coverage while maintaining high-level system rate. Besides, the proposed MARL based scheme can further improve the system sum rate and coverage for both the HTC and MTC.}

However, a densely connected network will cause large learning latency and energy consumption due to the limited computation and communication resources. In addition, link selection and aggregation weight have a significant impact on the learning performance. To cope with these challenges, we propose a joint computing power adjustment, wireless resource allocation, link selection, and aggregation weight adaptation mechanism to improve both communication and energy efficiencies. Specifically, the learning performances including the convergence rate, per-iteration learning latency, and per-iteration energy consumption are first analyzed. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total learning cost, which is defined as the weighted sum of total learning latency and energy consumption. Given a network topology, the computing power and wireless resource allocation are optimized by the alternating optimization algorithm. Moreover, the optimal aggregation weight is obtained by semidefinite programming. With respect to link selection, we propose a tabu search based meta-heuristic algorithm to approximately achieve feasible solutions with a low computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed link selection algorithm can significantly reduce the learning cost under the given learning accuracy requirement.}

To improve the spectral efficiency, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is introduced to obtain a potential performance gain by assigning the spectrum resources to different types of devices with diverse performance requirements in a coordinative and resource-sharing manner. Considering the performance diversity of heterogeneous devices, we provide two NOMA user grouping strategies: Mixed Block Strategy (MBS) and Uniform Block Strategy (UBS) which configure NOMA user groups as those consisting of different types of devices and those containing only a single type of device, respectively. Then, we propose a hybrid resource allocation protocol by switching between these two strategies. The performance of a special case with two time-sensitive devices and two throughput-sensitive devices is first optimized to evaluate the proposed strategies, and then extended to compare with traditional strategy in the multi-user scenarios. Simulation results illustrate that MBS and UBS outperform the traditional strategy, i.e., lower Age of Information (AoI) and higher throughput, and have their own advantages at different system parameters. On the basis, the hybrid protocol can further improve the system performance.}

	abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of defending against the jamming attack for the Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA). The problem is important due to the fact that jamming attacks can make the legitimate receiver reject a legitimate signal or accept an impersonating signal. In this paper, we propose two jamming detection schemes to defend against jamming attacks for the PLA. The first scheme is the Jamming-Attack Detection (JAD) scheme, which exploits the difference of noise variances between the handshaking and communication stages. The second scheme is the Composite Jamming-Attack Detection (CJAD) scheme, which exploits the difference of noise variances between Alice and Bob. Moreover, we provide the theoretical analysis of the proposed schemes over wireless fading channels and derive their closed-form expressions. We implement our schemes and conduct extensive performance comparisons. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that if security is the priority, the CJAD scheme is the best option. If we further consider the overhead, the JAD scheme is the best option under the strategy of jamming attacks and the CJAD scheme may be a better option under the strategy of enhanced jamming attacks, especially for the larger power of a jamming signal.}

	abstract = {Edge caching is a promising approach to reduce duplicate content transmission in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs). Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based edge caching methods have been proposed to improve the resource utilization and reduce the backhaul traffic load. However, they only obtain the local sub-optimal solution, as they neglect the influence from environments by other agents. This paper investigates the edge caching strategies with consideration of the content delivery and cache replacement by exploiting the distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). A hierarchical edge caching architecture for IoVs is proposed and the corresponding problem is formulated with the goal to minimize the long-term content access cost in the system. Then, we extend the Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the single agent RL to the context of a multi-agent system, and tackle the corresponding combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem based on the framework of a stochastic game. Specifically, we firstly propose a Distributed MARL-based Edge caching method (DMRE), where each agent can adaptively learn its best behaviour in conjunction with other agents for intelligent caching. Meanwhile, we attempt to reduce the computation complexity of DMRE by parameter approximation, which legitimately simplifies the training targets. However, DMRE is enabled to represent and update the parameter by creating a lookup table, essentially a tabular-based method, which generally performs inefficiently in large-scale scenarios. To circumvent the issue and make more expressive parametric models, we incorporate the technical advantage of the Deep- Q Network into DMRE, and further develop a computationally efficient method (DeepDMRE) with neural network-based Nash equilibria approximation. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Especially, DeepDMRE outperforms DMRE, Q -learning, LFU, and LRU, and the edge hit rate is improved by roughly 5%, 19%, 40%, and 35%, respectively, when the cache capacity reaches 1, 000 MB.}

	abstract = {The new generation satellite network is a comprehensive service system that can provide communication, observation, navigation, and other functions. Typically, a system with a specific service function is defined as a domain and the supply and demand relationship of resources, such as communication, storage, and energy resources, are unbalanced among domains. Therefore, it is nontrivial to accurately characterize the cross-domain resource state and coordinate the data transmission policy of interrelated satellites from different domains to make full use of the resources in each domain aiming at improving the resource utilization ratio (RUR) of the whole network. To this end, this paper investigates the cross-domain resource scheduling (CDRS) problem in satellite networks aiming at maximizing the total amount of downloaded transmitted data. We start with the orbit motion law of satellites and construct the satellite orbit feature matrix of each domain to design a hierarchical sparse resource representation (HSRR) scheme to accurately characterize the resource state of each domain in real-time with low complexity. Further, based on the HSRR, we develop a cross-domain dynamic multi-resource scheduling algorithm to solve the CDRS problem by introducing the advantage factor and policy-oriented hyper-parameter. The algorithm can make full use of the resources in each domain to achieve efficient CDRS by dynamically adjusting the data transmission policy of satellites among domains. Simulation results show that the greater the service demand and resource difference among domains, the more significant the performance improvement brought by CDRS, and compared with the existing algorithms, the RUR and resource utilization efficiency have been significantly improved.}

	abstract = {Incorporating deep learning (DL) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection has been deemed as a promising technique for future wireless communications. However, most of the DL-based MIMO detection algorithms are lack of interpretation on internal mechanisms. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the DL-based MIMO detection to better understand its strengths and weaknesses. We investigate and compare two different models: data-driven DL detector with neural networks activated by rectifier linear unit (ReLU) function and model-driven DL detector based on traditional detection algorithms. We show that the data-driven DL detector asymptotically approaches to the maximum a posterior (MAP) detector in various scenarios but requires a large amount of training samples to converge in time-varying channels. On the other hand, the model-driven DL detector utilizes the expert knowledge to alleviate the impact of channels and achieves relatively high detection accuracy with a small set of training data. Simulation results confirm our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DL-based MIMO detection for both linear and nonlinear signal systems.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) over mobile networks has attracted intensive attention recently. User mobility is a fundamental feature of mobile networks, which leads to dynamic network topology and wireless connectivity losses. As such, user mobility is usually considered a “trouble maker” and a great challenge to FL over mobile networks. Interestingly, we found that small user mobility can positively contribute to improving FL performance. This is because the total dataset size and the data diversity that the FL can utilize are increased by user mobility. Based on this observation, we aim to tame and exploit mobility instead of treating it as a hostile “trouble maker”. To this end, we first investigate how the FL performance changes with user mobility theoretically by jointly taking into account the positive and negative aspects of mobility. Specifically, a closed-form expression to quantify the impact of mobility on the FL loss is derived, which explains when negative or positive aspects of mobility dominate the FL performance. Next, a joint FL and communication optimization problem is formulated based on theoretical analyses to minimize the FL loss function by optimizing wireless resource allocation. Finally, we propose a two-step optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. The simulation results verify the theoretical analyses. It is also shown that the proposed method can significantly enhance learning performance considering users with high mobility. When the average velocity is larger than 150 km/h, the proposed method achieves more than 80% accuracy in the MNIST dataset, while the existing methods may fail during training.}

	abstract = {Featured by flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can form multi-tier networks in 3D space, enhancing the capacity, but this heterogeneity causes more unnecessary handovers (HOs), i.e., ping-pongs (PPs) and handover failures (HOFs). However, existing studies have not modeled the HO process in multi-tier UAV networks. This paper proposes an equivalent model for the HO process in K\n-tier UAV networks, where nonlinear mapping rules are established from the altitude and transmit power to equivalent horizontal distances specific to HO events, then HO status during time-to-trigger (TTT) is analyzed via the mapping rules. Specifically, each trigger condition of the HO events is transformed into a circular boundary centered on the projection of the target UAV with the corresponding trigger radii. Considering the practical HO process, the HO trigger location is tractably modeled as a random variable of the path length from the start, and the signal-to-interference ratio during TTT and the residence time are analyzed through equivalent geometric relations. The results show that there exists an altitude ratio that causes the most frequent HO, which increases by 25% to 150% under different configurations. Trade-offs between HOF and PP exist in the altitude ratio and transmit power ratio, besides the HO parameters.}

	abstract = {In emergency scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed to assist localization and communication services for ground terminals. In this paper, we propose a new integrated air-ground networking paradigm that uses dual-functional UAVs to assist the ground networks for improving both communication and localization performance. We investigate the optimization problem of deploying the minimal number of UAVs to satisfy the communication and localization requirements of ground users. The problem has several technical difficulties including the cardinality minimization, the non-convexity of localization performance metric regarding UAV location, and the association between user and communication terminal. To tackle the difficulties, we adopt\nD\n-optimality as the localization performance metric, and derive the geometric characteristics of the feasible UAV hovering regions in 2D and 3D based on accurate approximation values. We solve the simplified 2D projection deployment problem by transforming the problem into a minimum hitting set problem, and propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve it. Through numerical simulations, we compare our proposed algorithm with benchmark methods. The number of UAVs required by the proposed algorithm is close to the optimal solution, while other benchmark methods require much more UAVs to accomplish the same task.}

	abstract = {High-resolution fully digital transceivers are infeasible at millimeter-wave (mmWave) due to their increased power consumption, cost, and hardware complexity. The use of low-resolution converters is one possible solution to realize fully digital architectures at mmWave. In this paper, we consider a setting in which a fully digital base station with constant envelope quantized (CEQ) digital-to-analog converters on each radio frequency chain communicates with multiple single antenna users with individual signal-to-quantization-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SQINR) constraints over frequency selective channels. We first establish uplink downlink duality for the system with CEQ hardware constraints and OFDM-based transmission considered in this paper. Based on the uplink downlink duality principle, we present a solution to the multi-user multi-carrier beamforming and power allocation problem that maximizes the minimum SQINR over all users and sub-carriers. We then present a per sub-carrier version of the originally proposed solution that decouples all sub-carriers of the OFDM waveform resulting in smaller sub-problems that can be solved in a parallel manner. Our numerical results based on 3GPP channel models generated from Quadriga demonstrate improvements in terms of ergodic sum rate and ergodic minimum rate over state-of-the-art linear solutions. We also show improved performance over non-linear solutions in terms of the coded bit error rate with the increased flexibility of assigning individual user SQINRs built into the proposed framework.}

	abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems typically perform poorly in urban environments, where the likelihood of line-of-sight conditions between devices and satellites is low. Therefore, alternative location methods are required to achieve good accuracy. We present LocUNet: A convolutional, end-to-end trained neural network (NN) for the localization task, which is able to estimate the position of a user from the received signal strength (RSS) of a small number of Base Stations (BS). Using estimations of pathloss radio maps of the BSs and the RSS measurements of the users to be localized, LocUNet can localize users with state-of-the-art accuracy and enjoys high robustness to inaccuracies in the estimations of radio maps. The proposed method does not require generating RSS fingerprints of each specific area where the localization task is performed and is suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, two novel datasets that allow for numerical evaluations of RSS and ToA methods in realistic urban environments are presented and made publicly available for the research community. By using these datasets, we also provide a fair comparison of state-of-the-art RSS and ToA-based methods in the dense urban scenario and show numerically that LocUNet outperforms all the compared methods.}

Ultimately, our goal is to minimize the channel estimation error using the received signal at the base station and additional information acquired from a small number of active sensors at the IRS. Unlike recent works on channel estimation with semi-passive elements that require both uplink and downlink training signals to estimate the UE-IRS and IRS-BS links, we only use uplink training signals to estimate all the links. To compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimates of all the links, we propose a novel variational inference-sparse Bayesian learning (VI-SBL) channel estimator that performs approximate posterior inference on the channel using VI with the mean-field approximation under the SBL framework. The simulation results show that VI-SBL outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for IRS with passive reflecting elements in terms of the channel estimation accuracy and training overhead. Furthermore, VI-SBL with semi-passive elements is shown to be more spectral- and energy-efficient than the baselines with passive reflecting elements.}

However, excessive dimensions of UM-MIMO and IRS enlarge the near-field region, while strong THz channel sparsity in the far-field is detrimental to spatial multiplexing. Moreover, channel estimation (CE) requires recovering the large-scale channel from severely compressed observations due to limited RF-chains. To tackle these challenges, a hybrid spherical- and planar-wave channel model (HSPM) is introduced for the cascaded channel of the integrated system. The spatial multiplexing gains under near-field and far-field regions are analyzed, which are found to be limited by the segmented channel with a lower rank. Furthermore, a compressive sensing-based CE framework is developed, including a sparse channel representation method, a separate-side estimation (SSE) and a dictionary-shrinkage estimation (DSE) algorithms. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the HSPM, the capacity of which is only\n5×\n10\n−4\nbits/s/Hz deviated from that obtained by the ground-truth spherical-wave-model, with 256 elements. While the SSE achieves improved accuracy for CE than benchmark algorithms, the DSE is more attractive in noisy environments, with 1 dB lower normalized-mean-square error than SSE.}

	abstract = {Wireless federated learning (WFL) undergoes a communication bottleneck in uplink, limiting the number of users that can upload their local models in each global aggregation round. This paper presents a new multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple-access (MC-NOMA)-empowered WFL system under an adaptive learning setting of Flexible Aggregation. Since a WFL round accommodates both local model training and uploading for each user, the use of Flexible Aggregation allows the users to train different numbers of iterations per round, adapting to their channel conditions and computing resources. The key idea is to use MC-NOMA to concurrently upload the local models of the users, thereby extending the local model training times of the users and increasing participating users. A new metric, namely, Weighted Global Proportion of Trained Mini-batches (WGPTM), is analytically established to measure the convergence of the new system. Another important aspect is that we maximize the WGPTM to harness the convergence of the new system by jointly optimizing the transmit powers and subchannel bandwidths. This nonconvex problem is converted equivalently to a tractable convex problem and solved efficiently using variable substitution and Cauchy’s inequality. As corroborated experimentally using a convolutional neural network and an 18-layer residential network, the proposed MC-NOMA WFL can efficiently reduce communication delay, increase local model training times, and accelerate the convergence by over 40%, compared to its existing alternative.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the optimal problem of average age of information (AAoI) in grant-free massive access, and propose an age-critical frameless ALOHA (ACFA) random access protocol, where the AAoI is implicitly reduced by banning the transmission of activated user equipments (UEs) recovered successfully in the last frame. In particular, we analyze the dense and sparse access models according to the activation probability, and present these scenarios with time-stamped sampling either at the beginning of the frame or in the first slot transmitting the packet. In order to qualify the AAoI of proposed protocol, we define two virtual rates and establish an iterative framework to analyze the access successful probability (ASP) of the protocol in asymptotic regime, and derive the closed-form expressions of AAoI as a function of ASP and virtual rate in all cases. Further, we formulate the optimal problems of normalized AAoI in all cases, and obtain the selection of access parameters by asymptotic analysis and simulations, respectively. Finally, we compare our protocol with state-of-the-art schemes, and the simulation results show that the ACFA random access protocol outperforms these benchmark schemes, and has great potential of access-banned policy in minimizing AAoI for frame-based protocols.}

	abstract = {Estimation of transmission rates by a malicious user can serve as a stepping stone to further attacks on the network. In this paper, we aim to investigate the general problem of estimating traffic transmission rates in a CSMA/CA network using a class of passive eavesdropping methods. We consider the case where a single eavesdropper passively monitors all active network nodes but cannot observe all packet transmissions due to spatial-reuse collisions. To enable tractable analysis, we first propose an approximate statistical model that can help the eavesdropper estimate transmission rates with partial measurements under spatial reuse. We next consider a class of eavesdroppers that become increasingly more capable, and develop a framework to demonstrate that two classes of eavesdropper capabilities are sufficient to achieve a consistent transmission rate estimator. We provide numerical tests of our proposed estimators under practical network cases using the NS-3 simulator that validate the theoretical results.}

	abstract = {We present a decentralized feedback-aided Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA) scheme that improves energy efficiency. The scheme divides the IRSA MAC frame into several sub-frames, performs tentative decoding after each sub-frame, and uses limited feedback for users to detect whether their packet has been decoded at the receiver. Once a user detects that its packet is decoded, it stops transmitting its remaining replicas, resulting in a decrease in the expected number of transmitted packet replicas and an increase in energy efficiency. For analysis, we employ a graph-based representation of the successive interference cancellation decoding of IRSA. We prove several results for a fixed graph, and extend our analysis to a randomly selected graph to derive the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed feedback-aided IRSA solution outperforms standard IRSA and performs similarly to the best known Coded Slotted ALOHA (CSA) schemes. Also, the proposed scheme achieves efficiencies significantly larger than the threshold of 0.5 which is an upper bound for standard IRSA.}

	abstract = {Numerous studies claim that terahertz (THz) communication will be an essential piece of sixth-generation wireless communication systems. Its promising potential also comes with major challenges, in particular the reduced coverage due to harsh propagation loss, hardware constraints, and blockage vulnerability. To increase the coverage of THz communication, we revisit cooperative communication. We propose a new type of cooperative rate-splitting (CRS) called extraction-based CRS (eCRS). Furthermore, we explore two extreme cases of eCRS, namely, identical eCRS and distinct eCRS. To enable the proposed eCRS framework, we design a novel THz cooperative channel model by considering unique characteristics of THz communication. Through mathematical derivations and convex optimization techniques considering the THz cooperative channel model, we derive local optimal solutions for the two cases of eCRS and a global optimal closed form solution for a specific scenario. Finally, we propose a novel channel estimation technique that not only specifies the channel value, but also the time delay of the channel from each cooperating user equipment to fully utilize the THz cooperative channel. In simulation results, we verify the validity of the two cases of our proposed framework and channel estimation technique.}

	abstract = {Integrating sensing functionalities is envisioned as a distinguishing feature of next-generation mobile networks, which has given rise to the development of a novel enabling technology– Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). Portraying the theoretical performance bounds of ISAC systems is fundamentally important to understand how sensing and communication functionalities interact (e.g., competitively or cooperatively) in terms of resource utilization, while revealing insights and guidelines for the development of effective physical-layer techniques. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental performance tradeoff between the detection probability for target monitoring and the user’s achievable rate in ISAC systems. To this end, we first discuss the achievable rate of the user under sensing-free and sensing-interfered communication scenarios. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for the probability of false alarm (PFA) and the successful probability of detection (PD) for monitoring the target of interest, where we consider both communication-assisted and communication-interfered sensing scenarios. In addition, the effects of the unknown channel coefficient are also taken into account in our theoretical analysis. Based on our analytical results, we then carry out a comprehensive assessment of the performance tradeoff between sensing and communication functionalities. Specifically, we formulate a power allocation problem to minimize the transmit power at the base station (BS) under the constraints of ensuring a required PD for perception as well as the communication user’s quality of service requirement in terms of achievable rate. It indicates that, on the one hand, there exists an intrinsic tradeoff between sensing and communication performance under the mutual-interfered scenarios; On the other hand, with prior knowledge of the baseband waveform, these two functionalities might mutually assist each other to enhance the performance. Finally, simulation results corroborate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation solutions showing the advantages of the ISAC system over the conventional radar and communication coexistence counterpart.}

	abstract = {Locating mobile devices precisely in indoor scenarios is a challenging task because of the signal diffraction and reflection in complicated environments. One vital cause deteriorating the localization performance is the inevitable power dissipation along the propagation path of localization signals. In this paper, we propose a high-accuracy localization scheme based on the resonant beam system (RBS) and the binocular vision, i.e., binocular based resonant beam localization (BRBL). The BRBL system utilizes the energy-concentrated and self-aligned transmission of RBS to realize high-efficiency signal propagation and self-positioning for the mobile target (MT). The binocular method is combined with RBS to obtain the three-dimensional (3-D) coordinates of the MT for the first time. To exhibit the localization mechanism, we first elaborate on the binocular localization model, including the resonant beam transmission analysis and the geometric derivation of the binocular method with RBS. Then, we establish the power model of RBS, and the signal and noise models of beam spot imaging, respectively, to analyse the performance of the BRBL system. Finally, the results of numerical analysis and comparison show that BRBL balances system complexity and localization precision effectively, i.e., providing cm-level localization accuracy with its simplicity and ease of implementation.}

	abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are used in numerous fields, but their vulnerability is a global problem that has yet to be solved. A promising way to effectively address this problem is by integrating navigation into emerging dense nongeosynchronous orbit (NGSO) megaconstellations. To maximize the downlink efficiency for users, an integrated satellite navigation and communication (ISNAC) framework is proposed in this work, in which a necessary number of packetized bursty downlink satellite communication signals are used directly for navigation purposes. Then, the user terminal estimates the time of arrival (TOA) of these ISNAC signals regardless of their coding and modulation type. To this end, a TOA estimation algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the user terminal first constructs a template signal with demodulated data bits to replicate the transmitted ISNAC signal and then calculates the cross-correlation function (CCF) of the template and the received signal for TOA estimation, based on which the TOA is finally estimated. The performance bound of the proposed TOA estimation algorithm is analyzed. Simulations are conducted to corroborate the mathematical analysis and The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other TOA estimators for comparsion by approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with a much lower computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless powered heterogeneous network (WPHN) consisting of two heterogeneous groups of devices. Specifically, one group of devices, i.e., energy-harvesting devices (EHDs), are charged by external energy supplies, while the other group of devices, i.e., non-energy-harvesting devices (NEHDs), are powered by internal energy supplies. An IRS aims to participate in the wireless energy transfer (WET) in downlink and the wireless information transfer (WIT) in the uplink. A sum throughput maximization problem is formulated subject to the constraints of individual energy consumption, transmission time scheduling, and IRS phase shifts. To cope with the non-convexity of the problem, we first derive the optimal IRS phase shifts of the uplink WIT independently. Next, the semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation is adopted to recast this non-convex problem into the convex one, which can be numerically solved. Then, a novel low-complexity scheme is developed to gain more insights and mitigate the computational complexity induced by the SDP relaxation. In particular, the dual problem and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are first utilized to obtain the optimal transmission time scheduling. Then, we propose a method based on Riemannian manifold optimization to compute the optimal IRS phase shifts of the downlink WET in closed-form. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the optimality of our proposed scheme, and highlight the benefits induced by the IRS to coordinate these heterogeneous devices.}

	abstract = {The family of aeronautical communication systems is considered as one of the core technologies for the beyond-the-fifth-generation (B5G) networks, thus attracting rapidly increasing attention from both industry and academia. In this paper, a new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding scheme is proposed for aeronautical communication systems, where the transmit power for the aerial user equipment (UE) approaching the target cell is maximized based on the direction information. Specifically, we first transform the precoding optimization problem into a linear programming problem, and then develop two algorithms to derive the precoders for two transmission modes, namely the multi-stream and single-stream transmissions. For the multi-stream case, an algorithm based on manifold optimization is proposed, which guarantees the equal power allocation for each antenna. For the single-stream case, we derive a precoder by a numerically stable algorithm that extends the Newton-Raphson method. Simulation results show that the proposed precoding schemes can improve the link performance of the UEs with known directions, while ensuring that the performance of the UEs with unknown directions can still be close to that achievable by conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {While the millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is less susceptible against the conventional wiretapping attack due to its short transmission range and directivity, this paper proposes a new opportunistic wiretapping and jamming (OWJ) attack model in mmWave wireless networks. With OWJ, an attacker can opportunistically conduct wiretapping or jamming to initiate a more hazardous attack based on the instantaneous costs of wiretapping and jamming. We also provide three realizations of the OWJ attack, which are mainly determined by the cost models relevant to distance, path loss and received power, respectively. To understand the impact of the new attack on mmWave network security, we first develop novel approximation techniques to characterize the irregular distributions of wiretappers, jammers and interferers under three OWJ realizations. With the help of the results of node distributions, we then derive analytical expressions for the secrecy transmission capacity to depict the network security performance under OWJ. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to illustrate the effect of OWJ and to demonstrate that the new attack can more significantly degrade the network security performance than the pure wiretapping or jamming attack.}

This paper first provides an in-depth review of the standardized reference signals and time/ angle-based measurements that can be used for localization of user equipments in current 5G networks. Then, the paper details the development of a soft information (SI)-based approach that significantly improves localization accuracy for 5G and beyond 5G networks. Results are obtained in full conformity with 3GPP standards in two standardized scenarios, namely urban microcell and indoor open office, using time/angle-based measurements.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which have the potential to change the characteristics of incident electromagnetic waves with low power cost, can improve the performance for the MIMO mmWave wireless communications. Uniform circular array (UCA) is an effective antenna structure with low complexity transceiver. In this paper, UCA based RIS-assisted MIMO mmWave wireless communications with transmit UCA, the RIS UCAs, and receive UCA are investigated. Since the rotation angles between the transceiver make the channel matrix noncirculant, an algorithm is developed to derive the ranges of the rotation angles based on an acceptable error and reduce the impact of rotation angles on channel matrix. Then, we propose a low-complexity precoding scheme at the transmitter, phase designs at the RIS UCAs, and a phase compensation scheme at the receiver, which can convert the channel matrix into an equivalent circulant channel matrix with a small error. Then, a fast symbol-wise maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme is proposed to recover the signals with low computational complexity. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the theory.}
