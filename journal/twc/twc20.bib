	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has drawn a lot of attention recently as a promising new solution to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks. By utilizing massive low-cost passive reflecting elements, the wireless propagation environment becomes controllable and thus can be made favorable for improving the communication performance. Prior works on IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due to its passive operation and large number of reflecting elements. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser system under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the passive IRS phase shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI; while the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are then designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective fading channels with the optimized IRS phase shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training overhead and passive beamforming design complexity over the existing schemes based on the I-CSI of all channels. Besides, for ease of practical implementation, we consider discrete phase shifts at each reflecting element of the IRS. For the single-user case, an efficient penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase shifts are updated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case, we propose a general TTS stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) algorithm by constructing a quadratic surrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in closed-form. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and evaluate the impact of S-CSI and channel correlation on the system performance.}

	abstract = {This work analyzes the latency of the simplified successive cancellation (SSC) decoding scheme for polar codes proposed by Alamdar-Yazdi and Kschischang. It is shown that, unlike conventional successive cancellation decoding, where latency is linear in the block length, the latency of SSC decoding is sublinear. More specifically, the latency of SSC decoding is O(N 1-1/μ ), where N is the block length and μ is the scaling exponent of the channel, which captures the speed of convergence of the rate to capacity. Numerical results demonstrate the tightness of the bound and show that most of the latency reduction arises from the parallel decoding of subcodes of rate 0 or 1.}

	abstract = {The study of optimal properties of centralized dynamic-time-division-duplex (D-TDD) employed at a wireless network consisting of multiple nodes is a highly challenging and partially understood problem in the literature. In this paper, we develop an optimal centralized D-TDD scheme for a wireless network comprised of K full-duplex nodes impaired by self-interference and additive white Gaussian noise. As a special case, we also propose the optimal centralized D-TDD scheme when part or all nodes in the wireless network are half-duplex. Thereby, we derive the optimal adaptive scheduling of the reception, transmission, simultaneous reception and transmission, and silence at every node in the network in each time slot such that the rate region of the network is maximized. The performance of the optimal centralized D-TDD can serve as an upper-bound to any other TDD scheme, which is useful in qualifying the relative performance of TDD schemes. The numerical results show that the proposed centralized D-TDD scheme achieves significant rate gains over existing centralized D-TDD schemes.}

This heterogeneous node deployment problem is modeled as an optimization problem with the total power consumption of the network as its cost function. The necessary conditions of the optimal AP and FC node deployment are explored in this paper. We provide a variation of Voronoi Diagram as the optimal cell partition for this network and show that each AP should be placed between its connected FC and the geometric center of its cell partition. In addition, we propose a heterogeneous two-tier Lloyd algorithm to optimize the node deployment. Furthermore, we study the sensor deployment when the communication range is limited for sensors and APs. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing clustering methods like Minimum Energy Routing, Agglomerative Clustering, Divisive Clustering, Particle Swarm Optimization, Relay Node placement in Double-tiered Wireless Sensor Networks, and Improved Relay Node Placement, on average.}

This article presents a distributed user association algorithm that maximizes the network-wide energy efficiency (EE) in HetNets. A subset of BSs that support only a small number of users can be turned off to save the energy consumption. By turning off BSs in the HetNet and offloading serving users to adjacent active BSs, the network-wide energy consumption is minimized, while the sum throughput is maximized. To solve the problem efficiently, we introduce a new approach based on a message-passing framework and derive a distributed load balancing algorithm. The proposed method provides a very efficient solution with reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms other conventional load balancing strategies.}

	abstract = {In this article, delay and energy efficiency (EE) are investigated in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) with hybrid caching. With multiple caching and transmission strategies, hybrid caching offers great flexibility for file placement and file fetching. By using tools from stochastic geometry, we firstly derive tractable expressions of delay for coded cached, non-partitioned cached and uncached files. Then, we derive tractable expressions of EE by jointly considering power consumed in circuits, transmissions and fronthaul links. To balance delay and EE, the corresponding multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimal hybrid caching strategy. Furthermore, considering the NP-hard complexity of the problem, we first theoretically analyze the optimal structure of the caching result. Then, we convert the original problem into a classification problem. We further propose a gradual-replacement greedy algorithm to obtain a near optimal hybrid caching strategy, which ensures high accuracy with low complexity. Numerical results show a significant performance gain of the proposed near optimal hybrid caching strategy over baselines and flexibility in delay-sensitive and EE-sensitive scenarios.}

Here, the radar targets are considered as potential eavesdroppers which might eavesdrop the information from the communication transmitter to legitimate users. To ensure the transmission secrecy, we employ artificial noise (AN) at the transmitter and formulate optimization problems by minimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received at radar targets, while guaranteeing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at legitimate users. We first consider the ideal case where both the target angle and the channel state information (CSI) are precisely known. The scenario is further extended to more general cases with target location uncertainty and CSI errors, where we propose robust optimization approaches to guarantee the worst-case performance. Accordingly, the computational complexity is analyzed for each proposed method. Our numerical results show the feasibility of the algorithms with the existence of instantaneous and statistical CSI error. In addition, the secrecy rate of secure DFRC system grows with the increasing angular interval of location uncertainty.}

	abstract = {In cellular systems, the user equipment (UE) can request a change in the frequency band when its rate drops below a threshold on the current band. The UE is then instructed by the base station (BS) to measure the quality of candidate bands, which requires a measurement gap in the data transmission, thus lowering the data rate. We propose an online-learning based band switching approach that does not require any measurement gap. Our proposed classifier-based band switching policy instead exploits spatial and spectral correlation between radio frequency signals in different bands based on knowledge of the UE location. We focus on switching between a lower (e.g., 3.5 GHz) band and a millimeter wave band (e.g., 28 GHz), and design and evaluate two classification models that are trained on a ray-tracing dataset. A key insight is that measurement gaps are overkill, in that only the relative order of the bands is necessary for band selection, rather than a full channel estimate. Our proposed machine learning-based policies achieve roughly 30% improvement in mean effective rates over those of the industry standard policy, while achieving misclassification errors well below 0.5% and maintaining resilience against blockage uncertainty.}

	abstract = {In this article, the performance of UAV-based mmW links is investigated when UAVs are equipped with square array antennas. The 3GPP antenna propagation patterns are used to model the square array antenna. It is shown that the square array antenna is sensitive to both horizontal and vertical angular vibrations of UAVs. In order to explore the relationship between the vibrations of UAVs and their antenna pattern, the UAV-based mmW channels are characterized by considering the large scale path loss, small scale fading along with antenna patterns as well as the random effect of UAVs' angular vibrations. To enable effective performance analysis, tractable and closed-form statistical channel models are derived for aerial-to-aerial (A2A), ground-to-aerial (G2A), and aerial-to-ground (A2G) channels. The accuracy of analytical models is verified by employing Monte Carlo simulations. Analytical results are then used to study the effect of antenna pattern gain under different conditions for the UAVs' angular vibrations for establishing reliable UAV-assisted mmW links in terms of achieving minimum outage probability. Simulation results show that the performance of UAV-based mmW links with directional antennas is largely dependent on the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Moreover, UAVs with higher antenna directivity gains achieve better performance at larger link length. However, for UAVs with lower stability, lower antenna directivity gains result in a more reliable communication link. Finally, based on the geometrical properties of a given region, we investigate the optimal antenna pattern along with the optimal aerial position for UAV relay to attain minimum outage probability.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising technology for future wireless networks. Given that a large number of reflecting elements is typically used and that the surface has no signal processing capabilities, a major challenge is to cope with the overhead that is required to estimate the channel state information and to report the optimized phase shifts to the surface. This issue has not been addressed by previous works, which do not explicitly consider the overhead during the resource allocation phase. This work aims at filling this gap, by developing an overhead-aware resource allocation framework for wireless networks where reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are used to improve the communication performance. An overhead model is proposed and incorporated in the expressions of the system rate and energy efficiency, which are then optimized with respect to the phase shifts of the reconfigurable intelligent surface, the transmit and receive filters, the power and bandwidth used for the communication and feedback phases. The bi-objective maximization of the rate and energy efficiency is investigated, too. The proposed framework characterizes the trade-off between optimized radio resource allocation policies and the related overhead in networks with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.}

With a growing number of smart devices and infrastructure-free communication networks, it is necessary to legitimately monitor these networks to prevent crimes. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to exploit the flexibility of the UAV for legitimate monitoring via joint trajectory design and energy management. The system includes a suspicious transmission link with a terrestrial transmitter and a terrestrial receiver, and a UAV to monitor the suspicious link. The UAV can adjust its positions and send jamming signal to the suspicious receiver to ensure successful eavesdropping. Based on this model, we first develop an approach to minimize the overall jamming energy consumption of the UAV. Building on a judicious (re-)formulation, an alternating optimization approach is developed to compute a locally optimal solution in polynomial time. Furthermore, we model and include the propulsion power to minimize the overall energy consumption of the UAV. Leveraging the successive convex approximation method, an effective iterative approach is developed to find a feasible solution fulfilling the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Extensive numerical results are provided to verify the merits of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {The satellite data relay networks (SDRNs) hold great promise in 6G communications for the timely offloading of the global traffic. Since the delay performance is regarded as one of the most important metrics reflecting the offloading efficiency, studying its relationship with network parameters becomes really essential to the development and application of the SDRN. However, the complex data offloading process and heterogeneity of traffic arrivals and transmission links pose many challenges to the stochastic delay analysis. To accurately model the data offloading process in SDRNs, we build a series-parallel queuing model with through and cross traffic while considering the propagation delay. On this basis, we respectively propose a propagation delay embedded min-plus convolution method based on stochastic network calculus and a Markov chain method based on Monte Carlo to depict the leftover services of the heterogeneous links received by the per-flow traffic in an aggregate. To eliminate the impacts of the heterogeneity, we uniformly characterize the arrivals and leftover services by their moment generating functions (MGFs) which contain the full moment information, and shield the heterogeneity by deriving the envelopes of the arrivals and leftover services with the help of MGFs, Chernoff bound and union bound. Then, in the light of the geometric relationship between the envelopes of the arrivals and leftover services, we analyze the upper bounds of the stochastic delay, which provides the guidance to the network configuration. Eventually, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and further reveal maximum four times the delay difference between the heterogeneous links influenced by traffic type, burstiness, and access number.}

The street system, in turn, specifies the random intensity measure of a Cox process of vehicles, i.e., vehicles form independent 1D Poisson point processes on each street. Models in this Coxian framework can characterize streets of different lengths and orientations forming intersections or T-junctions. The lengths of the streets can be infinite or finite and mutually independent or dependent. We analyze the reliability of communication for different models, where reliability is the probability that a vehicle at an intersection, a T-junction, or a general location can receive a message successfully from a transmitter at a certain distance. Further, we introduce a notion of equivalence between vehicular models, which means that a representative model can be used as a proxy for other models in terms of reliability. Specifically, we prove that the Poisson stick process-based vehicular network is equivalent to the Poisson line process-based and Poisson lilypond model-based vehicular networks, and their rotational variants.}

	abstract = {Due to the benefits of small latency, low energy consumption and increased data rate, device-to-device (D2D) communication is recognized as one of the promising techniques in the 5G era. However, the distributed nature of D2D communication makes it non-trivial to generate symmetric keys for the involving parties. Many efforts have been devoted to dynamically generate cryptographic keys for D2D communication in mobile network. However, most of them have limited applicability to practical scenarios due to low key generation efficiency or limited compatibility with commercial mobile devices. In this paper, we design an ambient light based key generation approach, which works on commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices, and achieves high key generation efficiency. We observe that mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) are often equipped with ambient light sensors and devices sense different light intensities at different angles towards the light source. We conduct a set of measurement study, and the results show that the light sensor data have several nice properties, i.e., space-varying, sensitive to the angle of measuring device, and time varying. These properties demonstrate that the ambient light is a good medium for secret key generation. We implement a prototype on different mobile devices, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experiment results show that compared with the state-of-the-art key generation methods, our approach has a superior performance in key generation efficiency and robustness.}

	abstract = {In this article, we study the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) system so as to enhance the output DC power of the rectennas. To that end, we revisit the rectenna nonlinearity considering multiple receive antennas. Two combining schemes for multiple rectennas at the receiver, DC and RF combinings, are modeled and analyzed. For DC combining, we optimize the transmit beamforming, adaptive to the channel state information (CSI), so as to maximize the total output DC power. For RF combining, we compute a closed-form solution of the optimal transmit and receive beamforming. In addition, we propose a practical RF combining circuit using RF phase shifter and RF power combiner and also optimize the analog receive beamforming adaptive to CSI. We also analytically derive the scaling laws of the output DC power as a function of the number of transmit and receive antennas. Those scaling laws confirm the benefits of using multiple antennas at the transmitter or receiver. They also highlight that RF combining significantly outperforms DC combining since it leverages the rectenna nonlinearity more efficiently. Two types of performance evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and based on realistic and accurate rectenna circuit simulations, are provided. The evaluations demonstrate that the output DC power can be linearly increased by using multiple rectennas at the receiver and that the relative gain of RF combining versus DC combining in terms of the output DC power level is very significant, of the order of 240% in a one-transmit antenna ten-receive antenna setup.}

Differently from the bound proposed in Polyanskiy et al.

Numerical evaluation of our bound suggests that, for fixed latency and reliability constraints, noise in the feedback link may increase the minimum average service time for the VLSF scheme considered in this paper, to the extent that fixed-length codes without feedback may be preferable in some scenarios.}

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based pilot sequence selection scheme for GFMA systems to mitigate potential pilot sequence collisions. We formulate a pilot sequence selection problem for aggregate throughput maximization in GFMA systems with specific throughput constraints as a Markov decision process (MDP). By exploiting multiagent DRL, we train deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn near-optimal pilot sequence selection policies from the transition history of the underlying MDP without requiring information exchange between the users. While the training process takes advantage of global information, we leverage the technique of factorization to ensure that the policies learned by the DNNs can be executed in a distributed manner. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve an average aggregate throughput that is within 85% of the optimum, and is 31%, 128%, and 162% higher than that of acknowledgement-based GFMA, dynamic access class barring, and random selection GFMA, respectively. Our results also demonstrate the capability of the proposed scheme to support IoT devices with specific throughput requirements.}

The first layer is a wireless backhaul layer between MBs and SBs, and the second is the transmission layer between SBs and MTs. The layers use the same time/frequency resources for communication, limiting the maximum per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) to half, due to the half-duplex nature of the SBs. For linear network models, it is established that the optimal puDoF can be achieved by cooperation with an appropriate number of antennas that depends on the connectivity of the network. The proposed zero-forcing schemes achieve cooperation without overloading the backhaul, through each MB sending an appropriate linear combination of MTs' message signals to the SBs in the backhaul layer. The achievable schemes exploit the half-duplexity of the SBs, and schedule the SBs and MTs to be active in different time-slots to manage interference. These results are then extended to a more realistic hexagonal cellular network and it is shown that the optimal puDoF of half can be approached using only zero-forcing schemes.}

The content-aware multicast transmission strategies provide promising solutions to such use cases involving many mobile users trying to fetch the same data. In this work, we consider multigroup multicast transmission with a common message (e.g., multimedia content), in which different multicast groups are interested along with their private multicast messages. We further assume that a relay helps the cellular base station (BS) disseminate multicast content to the users experiencing high path loss and/or blockage. We propose superposition and concatenated coding schemes, denoted by SC and CC, respectively, to transmit the common and private multicast messages. In order to maximize max-min fair (MMF) rates, we design a novel low-complexity alternating-optimization algorithm to compute transmit and relay precoders. We also propose rate-splitting (RS) alternatives of SC and CC schemes together with an iterative algorithm to derive dedicated transmit and relay precoders so as to maximize MMF rates. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed transmission schemes and precoders, and verify the superiority of RS-based schemes in overloaded scenarios without any saturation with increasing signal-to-noise ratio.}

	abstract = {In this article, the problem of training federated learning (FL) algorithms over a realistic wireless network is studied. In the considered model, wireless users execute an FL algorithm while training their local FL models using their own data and transmitting the trained local FL models to a base station (BS) that generates a global FL model and sends the model back to the users. Since all training parameters are transmitted over wireless links, the quality of training is affected by wireless factors such as packet errors and the availability of wireless resources. Meanwhile, due to the limited wireless bandwidth, the BS needs to select an appropriate subset of users to execute the FL algorithm so as to build a global FL model accurately. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize an FL loss function that captures the performance of the FL algorithm. To seek the solution, a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm is first derived to quantify the impact of wireless factors on FL. Then, based on the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm, the optimal transmit power for each user is derived, under a given user selection and uplink resource block (RB) allocation scheme. Finally, the user selection and uplink RB allocation is optimized so as to minimize the FL loss function. Simulation results show that the proposed joint federated learning and communication framework can improve the identification accuracy by up to 1.4%, 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, compared to: 1) An optimal user selection algorithm with random resource allocation, 2) a standard FL algorithm with random user selection and resource allocation, and 3) a wireless optimization algorithm that minimizes the sum packet error rates of all users while being agnostic to the FL parameters.}

	abstract = {To maintain reliability of content-oriented wireless caching networks (CWCNs), repair mechanism is of necessity to be considered due to the natural that storage entities are individually unreliable and thus subject to failure on account of hardware error, network congestion or software updating. Meanwhile, recommendation is tunable for edge caching performance improvement. In this paper, we study the revenue maximization problem for CWCNs with both repair and recommendation considerations. The formulated problem is an integer non-convex and non-linear problem, and thus is difficult to be solved. The difficulties are intrinsically derived from the implicit weighted sum costs (WSCs) as regards storage and repair of each content and the coupling among the Boolean variables. For the sake of analytical tractability, a two-step methodology is developed. Specifically, we first explore the optimal storage and repair amount among the content providers to minimize the WSCs in terms of successfully fixing any occurred data corruption for the stored contents. Thereof, an explicit instance is provided to show how the contents can be coded, stored and then repaired in our network given that an error occurs. Based on the obtained storage and repair amount vectors, we solve the resultant joint caching and recommendation decision making problem (DMP). To be more specific, we decouple the DMP into a pair of subproblems, namely a cache placement and a recommendation optimization subproblems. For each subproblem, a globally optimal and a time-efficient suboptimal solutions are developed, respectively. Later, a versatile iterative paradigm is devised to do the decision making jointly. The convergence performance and the complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms are rigorously analyzed. Numerical results confirm the convergence performance of our iterative algorithms and illustrate their revenue improvements compared to various baseline schemes.}

Energy efficiency and device cost have played a significant role in the initial design of such wireless systems for industry automation. However, high reliability, high throughput, and low latency are also key for certain sectors such as the manufacturing industry. In this sense, existing wireless solutions for industrial settings are limited. Emerging technologies such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are highly promising to address this bottleneck. Still, the propagation characteristics at such high frequencies in harsh industrial settings are not well understood. Related work in this area is limited to isolated measurements in specific scenarios. In this work, we carry out an extensive measurement campaign in highly representative industrial environments. Most importantly, we derive the statistical link-level distributions of the channel parameters of widely accepted mmWave channel model of IEEE 802.11 ad that fit these environments. This model can be beneficial to understand the performance of mmWave systems in typical industrial settings.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a wireless communication protocol for industrial control systems that uses channel quality awareness to dynamically create network-device cooperation and assist the nodes in momentary poor channel conditions. To that point, channel state information is used to identify nodes with strong and weak channel conditions. We show that strong nodes in the network are best to be served in a single-hop transmission with transmission rate adapted to their instantaneous channel conditions. Meanwhile, the remainder of time-frequency resources is used to serve the nodes with weak channel condition using a two-hop transmission with cooperative communication among all the nodes to meet the target reliability in their communication with the controller. We formulate the achievable multi-user and multi-antenna diversity gain in the low-latency regime, and propose a new scheme for exploiting those on-demand, in favor of reliability and efficiency. The proposed transmission scheme is therefore dubbed adaptive network-device cooperation (ANDCoop), since it is able to adaptively allocate cooperation resources while enjoying the multi-user diversity gain of the network. We formulate the optimization problem of associating nodes to each group and dividing resources between the two groups. Numerical solutions show significant improvement in spectral efficiency and system reliability compared to the existing schemes in the literature. System design incorporating the proposed transmission strategy can thus reduce infrastructure cost for future private wireless networks.}

For sensing, highly accurate sensed information at IoT devices are sent to the base station (BS) by using non-orthogonal communication over wireless multiple access channels. Meanwhile, for computation, a novel technique, namely over-the-air computation (AirComp), is adopted to substantially reduce the latency of massive data aggregation via exploiting the superposition property of wireless multiple access channels. To coordinate the co-channel interference for enhancing the overall performance of B5G cellular IoT integrating SCC, two joint beamforming design algorithms are proposed from the perspectives of the computation error minimization and the weighted sum-rate maximization, respectively.

	abstract = {Pilot contamination attack (PCA) in a time division duplex wireless communication system is considered, where an eavesdropper (Eve) attacks the reverse pilot transmission phase in order to wiretap the data transmitted from a transmitter, Alice, to a receiver, Bob. We propose a new PCA scheme for Eve, wherein Eve does not emit any signal by itself but uses an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to reflect the pilot sent by Bob to Alice. The proposed new PCA scheme, referred to as IRS-PCA, increases the signal leakage from Alice to the IRS during the data transmission phase, which is then reflected by the IRS to Eve in order to improve the wiretapping capability of Eve. The proposed IRS-PCA scheme disables many existing countermeasures on PCA due to the fact that with IRS-PCA, Eve no longer needs to know the pilot sequence of Bob, and therefore, poses severe threat to the security of the legitimate wireless communication system. In view of this, the problems of 1) IRS-PCA detection and 2) secure transmission under IRS-PCA are considered in this paper. For IRS-PCA detection, a generalized cumulative sum (GCUSUM) detection procedure is proposed based on the framework of quickest detection, aiming at detecting the occurrence of IRS-PCA as soon as possible once it occurs. For secure transmission under IRS-PCA, a cooperative channel estimation scheme is proposed to estimate the channel of the IRS, based on which zero-forcing beamforming is designed to reduce signal leakage.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a new paradigm to assist low latency services by enabling computation offloading at the network edge. Nevertheless, human mobility can significantly impact the offloading decision and performance in MEC networks. In this context, we propose device-to-device (D2D) cooperation based MEC to expedite the task execution of mobile user by leveraging proximity-aware task offloading. However, user mobility in such distributed architecture results in dynamic offloading decision that instigates mobility-aware task scheduling in our proposed framework. We jointly formulate task assignment and power allocation to minimize the total task execution latency by taking account of user mobility, distributed resources, tasks properties, and energy constraint of the user device. We first propose Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based evolutionary scheme to solve our formulated mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Then we propose a heuristic named mobility-aware task scheduling (MATS) to obtain effective task assignment with low complexity.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless secure communication system, where an IRS is deployed to adjust its reflecting elements to secure the communication of multiple legitimate users in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. Aiming to improve the system secrecy rate, a design problem for jointly optimizing the base station (BS)'s beamforming and the IRS's reflecting beamforming is formulated considering different quality of service (QoS) requirements and time-varying channel conditions. As the system is highly dynamic and complex, and it is challenging to address the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based secure beamforming approach is firstly proposed to achieve the optimal beamforming policy against eavesdroppers in dynamic environments. Furthermore, post-decision state (PDS) and prioritized experience replay (PER) schemes are utilized to enhance the learning efficiency and secrecy performance. Specifically, a modified PDS scheme is presented to trace the channel dynamic and adjust the beamforming policy against channel uncertainty accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep PDS-PER learning based secure beamforming approach can significantly improve the system secrecy rate and QoS satisfaction probability in IRS-aided secure communication systems.}

Under the transmission power constraints at both source nodes and each relay node, the two-way sum mean-squared error (MSE) of the signal waveform estimation of all data streams is minimized. To solve the complicated nonconvex optimization problem with four groups of system parameters, this paper develops an iterative block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, which converges to at least a Nash point. On the basis of it, for mitigating the error propagation in MMSE-DFE receivers, a group of permutation matrix variables, determining the detection orders of all data streams, are further introduced in our system optimization. Moreover, in case there is no sufficiently precise channel state information (CSI), we also make an extension of the developed algorithms, yielding a robust design scheme, to handle the channel uncertainties. Numerical simulation results show that, compared with the existing linear MMSE receiving-based algorithm, our proposed nonlinear ones provide improved MSE and bit-error-rate (BER) performance as well as good robustness against the imperfect CSI, indicating a promising application prospect of this research.}

	abstract = {By deploying machine-learning algorithms at the network edge, edge learning can leverage the enormous real-time data generated by billions of mobile devices to train AI models, which enable intelligent mobile applications. In this emerging research area, one key direction is to efficiently utilize radio resources for wireless data acquisition to minimize the latency of executing a learning task at an edge server. Along this direction, we consider the specific problem of retransmission decision in each communication round to ensure both reliability and quantity of those training data for accelerating model convergence. To solve the problem, a new retransmission protocol called data-importance aware automatic-repeat-request (importance ARQ) is proposed. Unlike the classic ARQ focusing merely on reliability, importance ARQ selectively retransmits a data sample based on its uncertainty which helps learning and can be measured using the model under training. Underpinning the proposed protocol is a derived elegant communication-learning relation between two corresponding metrics, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data uncertainty. This relation facilitates the design of a simple threshold based policy for importance ARQ. The policy is first derived based on the classic classifier model of support vector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a data sample is measured by its distance to the decision boundary. The policy is then extended to the more complex model of convolutional neural networks (CNN) where data uncertainty is measured by entropy. Extensive experiments have been conducted for both the SVM and CNN using real datasets with balanced and imbalanced distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that importance ARQ effectively copes with channel fading and noise in wireless data acquisition to achieve faster model convergence than the conventional channel-aware ARQ. The gain is more significant when the dataset is imbalanced.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) comprised of tunable unit cells have recently drawn significant attention due to their superior capability in manipulating electromagnetic waves. In particular, RIS-assisted wireless communications have the great potential to achieve significant performance improvement and coverage enhancement in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner, by properly programming the reflection coefficients of the unit cells of RISs. In this article, free-space path loss models for RIS-assisted wireless communications are developed for different scenarios by studying the physics and electromagnetic nature of RISs. The proposed models, which are first validated through extensive simulation results, reveal the relationships between the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications and the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the size of the RIS, the near-field/far-field effects of the RIS, and the radiation patterns of antennas and unit cells. In addition, three fabricated RISs (metasurfaces) are utilized to further corroborate the theoretical findings through experimental measurements conducted in a microwave anechoic chamber. The measurement results match well with the modeling results, thus validating the proposed free-space path loss models for RISs, which may pave the way for further theoretical studies and practical applications in this field.}

	abstract = {Coalition structure is an efficient networking architecture for task implementation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, both the formation of coalition and the spectrum resource for intra-coalition communication affect the reconnaissance performance. In this paper, we investigate a cooperative reconnaissance and spectrum access (CRSA) scheme for task-driven heterogeneous coalition-based UAV networks by jointly optimizing task layer and resource layer. Specifically, coalition formation game (CFG) is formulated to jointly optimize task selection and bandwidth allocation. In addition to the traditional Pareto order and selfish order, coalition expected altruistic order maximizing coalitions' utility is proposed. The CFG under the proposed order is proved to be an exact potential game (EPG). Then the existence of stable coalition partition is guaranteed with the help of Nash equilibrium (NE). We propose a joint bandwidth allocation and coalition formation (JBACF) algorithm to achieve stable coalition partition wherein an efficient gradient projection (GP) based method is applied to solve bandwidth allocation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme and algorithms are demonstrated through in-depth numerical simulations. The results show that our proposed CRSA scheme is superior to non-joint optimization scheme. Also, the proposed order is superior to traditional Pareto order and selfish order.}

	abstract = {In federated learning (FL), devices contribute to the global training by uploading their local model updates via wireless channels. Due to limited computation and communication resources, device scheduling is crucial to the convergence rate of FL. In this paper, we propose a joint device scheduling and resource allocation policy to maximize the model accuracy within a given total training time budget for latency constrained wireless FL. A lower bound on the reciprocal of the training performance loss, in terms of the number of training rounds and the number of scheduled devices per round, is derived. Based on the bound, the accuracy maximization problem is solved by decoupling it into two sub-problems. First, given the scheduled devices, the optimal bandwidth allocation suggests allocating more bandwidth to the devices with worse channel conditions or weaker computation capabilities. Then, a greedy device scheduling algorithm is introduced, which selects the device consuming the least updating time obtained by the optimal bandwidth allocation in each step, until the lower bound begins to increase, meaning that scheduling more devices will degrade the model accuracy. Experiments show that the proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art scheduling policies under extensive settings of data distributions and cell radius.}

	abstract = {In this article, we address the scheduling problem in wireless ad hoc networks by exploiting the computational advantage that comes when scheduling problems can be represented by claw-free conflict graphs where we consider a wireless broadcast medium. It is possible to formulate a scheduling problem of broadcast transmissions as finding the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) in the conflict graph of the network. Finding the MWIS of a general graph is NP-hard leading to an NP-hard complexity of scheduling. In a claw-free conflict graph, MWIS may be found in polynomial time leading to a throughput-optimal scheduling. We show that the conflict graphs of certain wireless ad hoc networks are claw-free. In order to obtain claw-free conflict graphs in general networks, we suggest introducing additional conflicts (edges) with the aim of keeping the decrease in MWIS size minimal. To this end, we introduce an iterative optimization problem to decide where to introduce edges and investigate its efficient implementation. We conclude that the claw breaking method by adding extra edges can perform very close to optimal scenario and better than the polynomial time maximal independent set scheduling benchmark under the necessary assumptions.}

	abstract = {In emerging fifth generation and beyond wireless communication systems, communication nodes are expected to support information flows that are freshness-sensitive, along with broadband traffic having high data rate requirements. Freshness-sensitive flows, where freshness is quantified by a metric called the age of information (AoI), are naturally assigned priority over resources. Motivated by this, we consider long-term average throughput maximization in a single user fading channel, subject to constraints on average AoI and power, and knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which is the realization of channel power gains. We consider two scenarios: (i) when Perfect CSIT is available and (ii) when CSIT is not available. In both scenarios, the channel distribution information is available. We consider a generate-at-will model, in which update packets can be generated in any block of interest, at the transmitter. We propose simple age-independent stationary randomized policies (AI-SRP), which allocate powers at the transmitter based only on the channel state and/or distribution information, without any knowledge of the AoI. We show that the optimal long-term average throughputs achieved by the AI-SRPs are equal to at least half of the throughputs achieved by optimal policies, independent of all the parameters of the problem. Furthermore, we provide an expression that bounds the difference in throughputs achieved by the optimal policies and AI-SRPs. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to illustrate the performance of AI-SRPs.}

	abstract = {In this technical note, we present a new theoretical result for multi-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For multi-cell scenarios, a so-called load-coupling model has been proposed earlier to characterize the presence of mutual interference for NOMA, and the optimization process relies on the use of fixed-point iterations across cells. One difficulty here is that the order of decoding for successive interference cancellation (SIC) in NOMA is generally not known a priori. This is because the decoding order in one cell depends on interference, which, in turn, is governed by resource usage in other cells, and vice versa. To achieve convergence, previous works have used workarounds that pose restrictions to NOMA, such that the SIC decoding order remains throughout the fixed-point iterations. As a comment to the previous works, we derive and prove the following result: The convergence is guaranteed, even if the order changes over the iterations. The result not only waives the need of previous workarounds, but also implies that a wide class of optimization problems for multi-cell NOMA is tractable, as long as that for single cell is.}

Neyman-Pearson (NP) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based detectors are developed at the fusion center (FC) for known and unknown parameter detection scenarios, respectively. More explicitly, the GLRT detector also has to estimate the unknown parameter value. Closed-form expressions are derived for the probabilities of detection (P D ) and false alarm (P FA ) in order to characterize the performance of the proposed schemes. Furthermore, the optimal sensor transmit gains are determined for maximising the detection performance attained. An asymptotic performance analysis is carried out for determining the gain scaling laws for the massive MIMO WSN considered, when the number of antennas tends to infinity. The proposed framework is also extended to the realistic imperfect channel knowledge scenario at the FC, followed by the development of the associated fusion rules and analytical results to characterize the performance.

	abstract = {Millimeter wave communications show great potentials in many applications, one of which is the high-speed railway(HSR) communication system. However, a major challenge is the Doppler effect caused by the relative-movement between the train and the base station (BS), which leads to fast channel variation. To compensate for the Doppler shift, an accurate channel model is indispensable, and the far-field channel model is generally employed, which assumes that the dimensions of the antenna arrays are negligible compared to the distance between transmitter and receiver. This model is widely used in Cellular systems, but the underlining assumption is not always true for railway communication systems. In this paper, the modeling of the Doppler effect for millimeter wave in HSR communications is conducted, and data-aided Doppler estimation and compensation algorithms are designed based on the new model. We show that the conventional far-field channel model is based on the first-order Taylor expansion of the actually channel, and the second-order component cannot be ignored for HSR communications. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the validity of the new model and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

From the proposed model, a novel method, so-called correlated cluster based birth-death (BD) process method, is developed to efficiently and jointly mimic the 3D channel space-time-frequency non-stationarity. In this developed method, the frequency non-stationarity is properly captured by correlated clusters, which are obtained via an unsupervised learning algorithm in machine learning, i.e., K-Means clustering algorithm. Additionally, the developed method involves the cluster based space-time non-stationary modeling. Based on the correlation coefficient of clusters, the BD probabilities on the array and time axes are reasonably modified by the linear weight method and matrix iteration algorithm. Therefore, interactions among the space, time, and frequency non-stationary modeling are sufficiently considered. Important channel statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the channel non-stationarity in space-time-frequency domains can be sufficiently characterized. Finally, the excellent agreement between the simulation results and measurements further verifies the accuracy of the proposed model.}

	abstract = {NarrowBand-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new 3GPP radio access technology designed to provide better coverage for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks. To provide reliable connections with extended coverage, a repetition transmission scheme and up to three Coverage Enhancement (CE) groups are introduced into NB-IoT during both Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure and data transmission procedure, where each CE group is configured with different repetition values and transmission resources. To characterize the RACH performance of the NB-IoT network with three CE groups, this paper develops a novel traffic-aware spatio-temporal model to analyze the RACH success probability, where both the preamble transmission outage and the collision events of each CE group jointly determine the traffic evolution and the RACH success probability. Based on this analytical model, we derive the analytical expression for the RACH success probability of a randomly chosen IoT device in each CE group over multiple time slots with different RACH schemes, including baseline, back-off (BO), access class barring (ACB), and hybrid ACB and BO schemes (ACB&BO). Our results have shown that the RACH success probabilities of the devices in three CE groups outperform that of a single CE group network but not for all the groups, which is affected by the choice of the categorizing parameters.This mathematical model and analytical framework can be applied to evaluate the performance of multiple group users of other networks with spatial separations.}

	abstract = {For future wireless networks, applications such as Industrial Internet of Things are strictly delay-sensitive. Meanwhile, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is a promising means to provide ultra-high data rate and ultra-low latency services to massive number of devices. In order to minimize uplink end-to-end delay in such machine-to-machine (M2M) mmWave communications, we investigate buffer-aided multi-hop relaying networks and formulate the problem as a multi-tier queueing system. We propose a Minimum-Delay relaying scheme, and by leveraging stochastic geometry, we present a tractable analytical framework to investigate the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution of devices at each-tier, thereby computing the expected delay and delay outage probabilities using Lagrange optimization. A state-of-art max-SINR relaying scheme is analyzed for comparison, and the performance of Minimum-Delay relaying in 3-tier architecture is further analyzed. The derived average delay and delay outage probability are validated through simulations based on multiple cells in a dense urban scenario. Numerical results show that the proposed Minimum-Delay relaying scheme achieves significant lower average end-to-end delay than direct association or the max-SINR relaying scheme. Furthermore, results for Jain's fairness and spectral efficiency reveal that the Minimum-Delay relaying scheme has even greater performance improvement under high traffic loads.}

	abstract = {Spectral precoding is a promising technique to suppress out-of-band emissions and comply with leakage constraints over adjacent frequency channels and with mask requirements on the unwanted emissions. However, spectral precoding may distort the original data vector, which is formally expressed as the error vector magnitude (EVM) between the precoded and original data vectors. Notably, EVM has a deleterious impact on the performance of multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based systems. In this paper we propose a novel spectral precoding approach which constrains the EVM while complying with the mask requirements. We first formulate and solve the EVM-unconstrained mask-compliant spectral precoding problem, which serves as a springboard to the design of two EVM-constrained spectral precoding schemes. The first scheme takes into account a wideband EVM-constraint which limits the average in-band distortion. The second scheme takes into account frequency-selective EVM-constraints, and consequently, limits the signal distortion at the subcarrier level. Numerical examples illustrate that both proposed schemes outperform previously developed schemes in terms of important performance indicators such as block error rate and system-wide throughput while complying with spectral mask and EVM constraints.}

	abstract = {Real-time status update in future vehicular networks is vital to enable control-level cooperative autonomous driving. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), as one of the most promising vehicular wireless technologies, adopts a Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) based Medium-Access-Control (MAC) layer protocol for its sidelink communications. Despite the recent and ongoing efforts to optimize SPS, very few work has considered the status update performance of SPS. In this paper, Age of Information (AoI) is first leveraged to evaluate the MAC layer performance of C-V2X sidelink. Critical issues of SPS, i.e., persistent packet collisions and Half-Duplex (HD) effects, are identified to hinder its AoI performance. Therefore, a piggyback-based collaboration method is proposed accordingly, whereby vehicles collaborate to inform each other of potential collisions and collectively afford HD errors, while entailing only a small signaling overhead. Closed-form AoI performance is derived for the proposed scheme, optimal configurations for key parameters are hence calculated, and the convergence property is proved for decentralized implementation. Simulation results show that compared with the standardized SPS and its state-of-the-art enhancement schemes, the proposed scheme shows significantly better performance, not only in terms of AoI, but also of conventional metrics such as transmission reliability.}

	abstract = {Content popularity prediction plays an important role on proactive content caching. Different to most of the existing works which focus on improving the popularity prediction accuracy, in this article, we consider the content caching oriented popularity prediction through a weighted clustering approach in order to improve the caching performance. We formulate the loss of the cache hit ratio as the system regret to indicate the caching performance, and construct a clustering-based popularity prediction framework for overcoming the user request sparsity with considering the similarity of popularity evolution trends. For depicting the explicit relationship between the caching performance and the popularity prediction accuracy, we derive the popularity prediction error distribution of each content, and design the caching threshold. By extracting the insights in the relationship between the popularity prediction accuracy and the user clustering strategy, we develop a weighted clustering-based popularity prediction algorithm, which takes the caching regret probability of files as the weights. Based on two real-world datasets, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed popularity prediction scheme achieves better caching performance than the state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to enable a predictive deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as temporary base stations (BSs) to complement ground cellular systems in face of downlink traffic overload. First, a novel learning approach, based on the weighted expectation maximization (WEM) algorithm, is proposed to estimate the user distribution and the downlink traffic demand. Next, to guarantee a truthful information exchange between the BS and UAVs, using the framework of contract theory, an offload contract is developed, and the sufficient and necessary conditions for having a feasible contract are analytically derived. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to deploy an optimal UAV onto the hotspot area in a way that the utility of the overloaded BS is maximized. Simulation results show that the proposed WEM approach yields a prediction error of around 10%. Compared with the expectation maximization and k-mean approaches, the WEM method shows a significant advantage on the prediction accuracy, as the traffic load in the cellular system becomes spatially uneven. Furthermore, compared with two event-driven deployment schemes based on the closest-distance and maximal-energy metrics, the proposed predictive approach enables UAV operators to provide efficient communication service for hotspot users in terms of the downlink capacity, energy consumption and service delay. Simulation results also show that the proposed method significantly improves the revenues of both the BS and UAV networks, compared with two baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Physical layer security (PLS) has recently gained a lot of attention in the research and development of visible light communication (VLC). In this article, we study the designs of PLS in VLC systems in the presence of multiple unauthorized users (i.e. eavesdroppers) using artificial noise (AN)-aided precoding. The design objective focuses on minimizing the total transmit power subject to specific constraints on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the legitimate and unauthorized users. In particular, two design approaches are investigated considering the availability of unauthorized users' channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. In the case of unknown CSI, the AN is constructed to lie on the null-space of the legitimate user's channel. The design problem is convex, thus, can be effectively solved. When the CSI is available, the design additionally imposes constraints on the maximum allowable unauthorized users' SINRs. The design problem, in this case, is, nevertheless, non-convex. Therefore, instead of finding the optimal solution, we examine two different sub-optimal yet low-complexity approaches to solve the problem, namely: Concave-Convex Procedure (CCP) and Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR). Additionally, robust designs that take into account channel uncertainty are also investigated. Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of each design with practical parameters.}

This implies that heterogeneous service level agreements (SLAs) must be guaranteed per slice given the multitude of predefined requirements. In this paper, we pioneer a novel radio slicing orchestration solution that simultaneously provides latency and throughput guarantees in a multi-tenancy environment. Leveraging on a solid mathematical framework, we exploit the exploration-vs-exploitation paradigm by means of a multi-armed-bandit-based (MAB) orchestrator, LACO, that makes adaptive resource slicing decisions with no prior knowledge on the traffic demand or channel quality statistics. As opposed to traditional MAB methods that are blind to the underlying system, LACO relies on system structure information to expedite decisions. After a preliminary simulations campaign empirically proving the validness of our solution, we provide a robust implementation of LACO using off-the-shelf equipment to fully emulate realistic network conditions: near-optimal results within affordable computational time are measured when LACO is in place.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a mobile relaying system assisted by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a finite size of the buffer. Under the buffer size limit and delay constraints at the UAV relay, we consider a dual-hop mixed free-space optical/radio frequency (FSO/RF) relaying system (i.e., the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links employ FSO and RF links, respectively). Taking an imbalance in the transmission rate between RF and FSO links into consideration, we address the trajectory design of the UAV relay node to obtain the maximum data throughput at the ground user terminal. Specifically, we classify two relaying transmission schemes according to the delay requirements, i.e., i) delay-limited transmission and ii) delay-tolerant transmission. Accordingly, we propose an iterative algorithm to effectively obtain the locally optimal solution to our throughput optimization problems and further present the complexity analysis of this algorithm. Through this algorithm, we present the resulting trajectories over the atmospheric condition, the buffer size, and the delay requirement. In addition, we show the optimum buffer size and the throughput-delay tradeoff for a given system. The numerical results validate that the proposed buffer-aided and delay-considered mobile relaying scheme obtains 223.33% throughput gain compared to the conventional static relaying scheme.}

Since the MEC network involves both communication and computation, we first define the outage probability by taking into account the joint impact of latency and energy consumption. From this new definition, we then employ receiver antenna selection (RAS) or maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver, and apply selection combining (SC) or switch-and-stay combining (SSC) protocol to choose a CAP to accomplish the computational task from the source. For both protocols along with the RAS and MRC, we further analyze the network performance by deriving new and easy-to-use analytical expressions for the outage probability over Nakagami-m fading channels, and study the impact of the network parameters on the outage performance. Furthermore, we provide the asymptotic outage probability in the low regime of noise power, from which we obtain some important insights on the system design. Finally, simulations and numerical results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is shown that the number of transmit antenna and Nakagami parameter can help reduce the latency and energy consumption effectively, and the SSC protocol can achieve the same performance as the SC protocol with proper switching thresholds of latency and energy consumption.}

Accordingly, this paper investigates the feasibility of zero-feedback FDD massive MIMO systems based on channel extrapolation. We use the high-resolution parameter estimation (HRPE), specifically the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm, to extrapolate the DL CSI based on the extracted parameters of multipath components in the uplink channel. We apply the HRPE to two different channel models: the vector spatial signature (VSS) model and the direction of arrival (DOA) model. We verify these methods through real-world channel data acquired from channel measurement campaigns with two different types of channel sounders: a) a switched array-based, real-time, time-domain, outdoors setup at 3.5 GHz, and b) a virtual array-based, high-accuracy, frequency-domain, indoors setup at 2.4 and 5-7 GHz. The performance metrics of the extrapolated channels that we evaluate include the mean squared error, beamforming efficiency, and spectral efficiency in multiuser MIMO scenarios. The results show that the HRPE-based channel extrapolation performs best under the simple VSS model, which does not require array calibration, and if the BS is in an open outdoor environment having line-of-sight (LOS) paths to well-separated users.}

	abstract = {Future wearable and portable devices with multiple transmit antennas operating below 6 GHz are constrained by regulatory limitations on the level of electromagnetic radiation a user can be exposed to, measured using the specific absorption rate (SAR). Signaling designs that are optimized to include SAR constraints can improve the performance of uplink transmission. These signaling schemes could include closed-loop beamforming, closed-loop precoding, and space-time coding, which have all been shown to achieve increased rates when optimized as a function of SAR. Previous research addressed SAR constrained optimization only within a single coherence time block. In this paper, we present transmit policies that dynamically allocate user electromagnetic radiation exposure over time. We propose three exposure allocation methods - optimal, uniform, and asymptotic - in the practical case with causal channel state information (CSI), and an on-off transmission approach for the low SAR-to-noise ratio regime. Our results demonstrate that the performance of SAR-aware transmission can be further improved by exploiting frequency and time diversity.}

	abstract = {Recent research on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) suggests that RISs can perform passive beamforming and information transfer (PBIT) simultaneously via smart reflections. In this paper, we propose an RIS-enhanced multiple-input single-output system with reflection pattern modulation (RPM) to achieve PBIT, where the joint active and passive beamforming is carefully designed by taking into account the communication outage probability. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the access point (AP) and passive beamforming at the RIS under the assumption that the RIS's state information is statistically known by the AP, and propose a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization technique. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage probability of the proposed scheme in Rician fading is derived. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is also investigated under the assumption that the transmitted symbols are drawn from a finite constellation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and reveal the effect of various system parameters on the achievable rate. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms, in terms of achievable rate, the conventional RIS-assisted system without information transfer.}

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communications have many envisioned applications for ensuring traffic safety and for addressing traffic congestion. However, developing suitable communication systems and standards for this purpose requires developers to have accurate models for the V2V propagation channel. Likewise, the dynamic evolution of multipath components (MPCs) in V2V channels has not been well modeled in existing models. In this paper, we propose a geometry-based stochastic channel model for a lightly built-up urban environment and then parametrize the model from measurements. The MPCs are extracted based on a high-resolution parameter estimation; they are tracked and clustered through a joint algorithm. The identified clusters are classified as line-of-sight, reflections from static scatterers, reflections from mobile scatterers, multiple-bounce reflections, and diffuse scattering. Specifically, the multiple-bounce reflections are modeled as twin clusters that follow the COST 273/COST2100 approach. The paper gives a full parameterization of the channel model and supplies a step-by-step implementation recipe. We verify the model by comparing two second-order statistics, i.e., the root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread and the angular spreads of arrival/departure derived from the channel model, to the results obtained directly from the measurements. Furthermore, we also identify several key factors that strongly impact the synthetic channel performance.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel optimum combiner that raises the time-averaged signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for maximal-ratio combining (MRC) reception over spatially correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. By exploiting the principal component analysis (PCA) with eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the covariance matrix analytically evaluated offline, a complete set of orthonormal basis functions can be obtained. A decorrelation process analyzes and then projects the received signal into the space spanned by the basis functions. In accordance with the theorem of irrelevance, a principal component selection combining (PCSC) method is proposed to remove components in a few dimensions in which SINRs are considered low to raise the resulting time-averaged SINR on the subsequent MRC reception. The proposed technique also avoids noise enhancement occurring with MRC reception in the scenario where noises on different branches are correlated. The SINR distribution, level-crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) are derived. Based on a novel scattering model interpretation, a simulator consisting of spatially correlated Nakagami-m fading channels is developed according to the analytically evaluated covariance matrix. Computer simulations show that the proposed optimum combiner not only decreases interference and noise from the irrelevant subspace to achieve higher time-averaged SINR and lower AFD but also significantly reduces the complexity required for subsequent signal processing.}

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate multi-cell scheduling for massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications with only statistical channel state information (CSI). The objective of multi-cell scheduling is to activate a subset of users so as to maximize the ergodic sum rate subject to per-cell total transmit power constraint. By adopting beam division multiple access based on the statistical CSI, i.e., channel-coupling matrix (CCM), we simplify multi-cell scheduling as a power control problem in the beam domain, by which the ergodic sum rate is maximized. To reduce the computational burden on finding the ergodic sum rate, we propose a learning-to-compute strategy, which directly computes the complex ergodic rate function from CCMs via a deep neural network. Specifically, by modeling the probability density function of the ordered eigenvalues of the Hermitian CCM matrices as exponential family distributions, a properly designed hybrid neural network makes the ergodic rate computation feasible. With the learning-to-compute strategy, the online computational complexity of multi-cell scheduling is substantially reduced compared with the existing Monte Carlo or deterministic equivalent (DE) based methods while maintaining nearly the same performance.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a revolutionary solution to enhance wireless communications by changing propagation environment in a cost-effective and hardware-efficient fashion. In addition, symbol-level precoding (SLP) has attracted considerable attention recently due to its advantages in converting multiuser interference (MUI) into useful signal energy. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the employment of IRS in symbol-level precoding systems to exploit MUI in a more effective way by manipulating the multiuser channels. In this article, we focus on joint symbol-level precoding and reflecting designs in IRS-enhanced multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Both power minimization and quality-of-service (QoS) balancing problems are considered. In order to solve the joint optimization problems, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to decompose them into separate symbol-level precoding and block-level reflecting design problems. An efficient gradient-projection-based algorithm is utilized to design the symbol-level precoding and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)-based algorithm is employed to solve the reflecting design problem. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement introduced by the IRS and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {Hybrid analog/digital precoding in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-input multi-ouput (MIMO) systems is capable of achieving the near-optimal full-digital performance at reduced hardware cost and power consumption compared to its full-RF digital counterpart. However, having numerous phase shifters is still costly, especially when the phase shifters are of high resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel twin-resolution phase-shifter network for mmWave MIMO systems, which reduces the power consumption of an entirely high-resolution network, whilst mitigating the severe array gain reduction of an entirely low-resolution network. The connections between the twin phase shifters having different resolutions and the antennas are either fixed or dynamically configured. In the latter, we jointly design the phase-shifter network and the hybrid precoding matrix, where the phase of each entry in the analog precoding matrix can be dynamically designed according to the required resolution. This method is slightly modified for the fixed network's hybrid precoding matrix. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multi-user MIMO systems and provide its performance analysis. Our simulation results show that the proposed dynamic hybrid precoding method strikes an attractive performance vs. power consumption trade-off.}

	abstract = {Light-fidelity (LiFi) is a fully-networked bidirectional optical wireless communication (OWC) technology that is considered as a promising solution for high-speed indoor connectivity. Unlike in conventional radio frequency wireless systems, the OWC channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects the channel gain significantly. However, due to the lack of proper channel models for LiFi systems, many studies have assumed that the receiver is vertically upward and randomly located within the coverage area, which is not a realistic assumption from a practical point of view. In this paper, novel realistic and measurement-based channel models for indoor LiFi systems are proposed. Precisely, the statistics of the channel gain are derived for the case of randomly oriented stationary and mobile users. For stationary users, two channel models are proposed, namely, the modified truncated Laplace (MTL) model and the modified Beta (MB) model. For mobile users, two channel models are proposed, namely, the sum of modified truncated Gaussian (SMTG) model and the sum of modified Beta (SMB) model. Based on the derived models, the impact of random orientation and spatial distribution of users is investigated, where we show that the aforementioned factors can strongly affect the channel gain and the system performance.}

The objective is to maximize the system energy efficiency of both uplink and downlink transmissions by jointly optimizing the number of antennas at the base station, the number of served users, and the transmit power. Firstly, by considering the linear distortion due to hardware impairments, the resultant channel estimation error from both distortion and noise is analyzed, following which closed-form approximations for the average achievable uplink/downlink rates are derived. Then, a massive MIMO energy efficiency optimization problem considering hardware impairments is formulated. By applying the techniques of relaxation and change of variables, an alternative optimization with build-in bisection search (AO-BS) algorithm is proposed with the quasi-concavity of the transformed objective function theoretically proved. The performance of the proposed AO-BS algorithm is validated through numerical simulations, which shows fast convergence to near-optimal solutions. Compared with existing approaches, the proposed scheme improves the system energy efficiency greatly when the hardware impairments are considered. Furthermore, the system design guideline in terms of the number of antennas, the number of served users, and the transmit power is provided.}

We consider slow-fading multiple-input-single-output wiretap channels with multiple passive single-antenna eavesdroppers in which an independent transmitter side and correlated receiver side are assumed. Additionally, the source has accurate main channel information and statistical wiretap channel information. To reduce the secrecy loss due to receiver-side correlation, this paper proposes a channel-correlation-enabled transmission optimization scheme. In particular, the correlation is viewed as a resource to acquire more knowledge about wiretap channels. Based on this, the statistical distribution of wiretap channels is described more precisely, and an elaborate channel-correlation-enabled AN-aided beamformer is designed. Then, the achievable secrecy rate under transmit power and secrecy outage constraints is derived. Finally, the study is also extended to a specific scenario of multiple-antenna eavesdroppers. Simulation results show that the secrecy rate under transmit power and secrecy outage constraints can be improved under high correlation.}

To support different priorities due to various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, random access can be generalized with multiple pools, which may result in low spectral efficiency. In this paper, for high spectral efficiency, random access with layered preambles (RALP) is proposed to support devices with two different priorities based on the notion of power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In RALP, two groups of devices, namely type-1 and type-2 devices, are supported with different priorities, where type-1 devices have higher priority than type-2 devices. Closed-form expressions are derived for the detection performance of preambles transmitted by type-1 devices, which can be used for a certain performance guarantee of type-1 devices of high priority. Low-complexity preamble detection methods are also discussed.}

	abstract = {Optical wireless networks, especially those relying on visible light communications, suffer from severe deterioration in signal's quality when the line-of-sight (LOS) link is absent due to user's mobility. In order to enable efficient resource management within such networks, reliable prediction of LOS link outage is essential. Towards this objective, this article proposes a data-driven approach based on deep machine learning techniques to predict the outage events in an LOS link. First, we present a framework to generate sufficient data representing the channel gain in mobile optical wireless networks that consist of visible light communications in the downlink and infrared communications in the uplink. Using the developed dataset, we propose a channel predictor that forecasts the burst outages or signal recoveries in the upcoming frames using a deep recurrent neural network that implements long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units. To achieve this goal, we propose a low-complexity approach to reduce the data sparsity due to the user's mobility by abstracting and densifying the channel state sequence. For a one second prediction interval, the proposed prediction framework achieves an event hit rate of 91.55% for abrupt outages with an average event timing error of 79 ms, and 83.19% for recoveries from outages with 145 ms timing error. This timing error is on the same order of magnitude with the coherence time of the optical wireless channel. Therefore, this predictor is very useful in developing efficient resource management strategies in such optical networks.}

The heat generated by these devices can impact the performance as a result of a new type of outage called power-consumption outage. In this article, we propose a general definition of the power-consumption outage and describe its three features. Based on the heat transfer model in smartphones, the power-consumption outage probability is analyzed. Specifically, we derive the joint outage probability of channel and power-consumption outages in relation to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), communication duration, and initial temperature of the smartphone-back-plate. The joint outage probability is then used to obtain the upper bound of the maximum receiving rate of a typical smartphone. Furthermore, we propose and analyze the impact on the capacity of the power-consumption outage. Simulation results show that the power-consumption outage probability increases with an increase of SNR and with extension of the communication duration. The upper bound of the maximum receiving rate of a smartphone decreases with an extension of communication duration. Considering the joint outage probability, simulation results show that the outage capacities, i.e., channel and power-consumption outages, decrease with an increase of SNR after reaching a given capacity threshold.}

Our objective is to design a task scheduling policy that minimizes offloading and computing delay of all tasks given the UAV energy capacity constraint. To this end, we first formulate the online scheduling problem as an energy-constrained Markov decision process (MDP). Then, considering the task arrival dynamics, we develop a novel deep risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm evaluates the risk, which measures the energy consumption that exceeds the constraint, for each state and searches the optimal parameter weighing the minimization of delay and risk while learning the optimal policy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the task processing delay by up to 30% compared to probabilistic configuration methods while satisfying the UAV energy capacity constraint.}

	abstract = {Backscatter communication which enables wireless-powered backscatter devices (BDs) to transmit information by reflecting incident signals, is an energy- and cost-efficient communication technology for Internet-of-Things. This paper considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted backscatter communication network (UBCN) consisting of multiple BDs and carrier emitters (CEs) on the ground as well as a UAV. A communicate-while-fly scheme is first designed, in which the BDs illuminated by their associated CEs transmit information to the flying UAV in a time-division-multiple-access manner. Considering the critical issue of the UAV's limited on-board energy and the CEs' transmission energy, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UBCN by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the BDs' scheduling, and the CEs' transmission power, subject to the BDs' throughput constraints and harvested energy constraints, as well as other practical constraints. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the block coordinated decent method to solve the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, in each iteration of which the variables are alternatively optimized by leveraging the cutting-plane technique, the Dinkelbach's method and the successive convex approximation technique. Also, the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed communicate-while-fly scheme achieves significant EE gains compared with the hover-and-fly scheme, the state-of-the-art scheme, and the CE-relay scheme. Useful insights on the optimal trajectory design and resource allocation are also obtained.}

	abstract = {We investigate the viability of wireless energy transfer (WET) to multiple sensors using massive number of base station (BS) antennas based on estimates obtained through different uplink pilot signaling strategies, namely, orthogonal and shared. For the aforementioned strategies, we derive novel upper bounds on probability of outage in WET referred to as the probability that any sensor node fails to harvest a certain minimum amount of energy E u that it needs to send uplink pilots plus the energy E p that it needs to process its main tasks. We show how number of BS antennas scales with the number and position of sensor nodes, array transmit energy, channel estimation errors and nature of pilot signaling strategy employed. We prove when the sensor nodes are all equidistant relative to the BS, shared strategy gives identical outage probability as obtained through orthogonal strategy. However, when they are placed at different distances, shared strategy gives poorer outage performance than orthogonal strategy. To address this, we propose a simple location-dependent clustering and hybrid pilot assignment algorithm and also derive the corresponding probability of outage in WET. The proposed strategy elucidates an interesting trade-off between the outage performance that can be obtained and resources that must be spent on channel estimation.}

We present an asymptotic performance analysis of CRA and IRA on the collision channel for regular and irregular repetition rates. We also propose an improvement by merging the clean parts of packet replicas in partial collisions, and extend our analysis to this scenario as well. Specific designs of repetition distributions based on the new analysis show that the optimized solutions of irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) perform well in both IRA and the enhanced scheme, and they considerably outperform the regular repetition distributions. We also introduce energy harvesting (EH) to both schemes as a practical and sustainable adaptation, where users are able to harvest energy and store it in their finite-capacity batteries. We model the battery state by a discrete-time Markov chain and derive an optimal transmission policy to maximize the asymptotic performance of the system. We provide comprehensive numerical results for both practical and asymptotic scenarios to verify the validity of the proposed analyses, and illustrate the benefits of the proposed systems.}

	abstract = {Multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for the next generation mobile communication systems. However, there are still unsolved problems before such commercial MIMO networks are rolled out. One main issue is the hardware cost and power consumption which grow significantly as the number of radio frequency (RF) components increases. To tackle this issue, we consider to deploy one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the base station (BS), and study uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) channel estimation and DL precoding techniques for the associated MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs/DACs. Specifically, we first formulate the UL channel estimation as an one-bit compressed sensing problem, and then devise an efficient gridless generalized approximate message passing-based (GL-GAMP) algorithm to handle it. Additionally, we develop an exhaustive search based proximal gradient descent method (PGM) for DL channel estimation. Note that with slight modifications, we show that PGM can also be applied to solve the DL precoding problem. Simulation results showcase that our methods have advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques and are able to offer good trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity, which ultimately indicates their superiority in the application of mmWave MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs/DACs.}

Explicitly, we propose three different architectures based on IRSs for beam-index modulation in millimeter wave communication. Our schemes are capable of eliminating the detrimental line-of-sight blockage of millimeter wave frequencies.The schemes are termed as single-symbol beam index modulation, multi-symbol beam-index modulation and maximum-SNR single-symbol beam index modulation. The principle behind these is to embed the information both in classic QAM/PSK symbols and in the transmitter beam-pattern. Explicitly, we proposed to use a twin-IRS structure to construct a low-cost beam-index modulation scheme. We conceive both the optimal maximum likelihood detector and a low-complexity compressed sensing detector for the proposed schemes. Finally, the schemes designed are evaluated through extensive simulations and the results are compared to our analytical bounds.}

The targets are detected by binary wireless sensors which only have one or zero logical outputs, indicating a target's presence or absence. The goal is to simultaneously decode all sensors' data in one time slot at the receiver node, where all sensors transmit data simultaneously on the same frequency band. For this to happen, a specific geometric deployment of the sensors is presented in the paper. The concept in this work might have similarities to the bijective mappings in the superposition modulation. Different channel gains and the additive white Gaussian noise are included in the model. The system model is described in detail and the communication scheme to fulfill a simultaneous decoding is mathematically formulated. Then, the parametric solutions to this general digital modulation problem are studied step by step through several theorems, and the optimal solutions that minimize the detection error are found. The combined effects of the noise and the non-perfect channel state information on the signal constellations are both analytically and numerically investigated. In addition, two other detection scenarios with a priori information about the targets are studied.}

Recently, we evaluated the decoding reliability of various MC setups and different combining algorithms by analyzing the resulting outage probabilities. In this work, we are interested in how much the performance is affected by correlated fading. Specifically, we analyze the outage probability of MC systems with joint decoding reception operating over correlated quasi-static Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) deriving the exact outage probability in integral form and the asymptotic outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in closed form; (ii) deriving the correlation loss, which quantifies the extra SNR required under correlated fading as compared with the independent scenario; and (iii) evaluating frame-error rates of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes by Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that the correlation loss is marginal for a low to moderate level of correlation, whereas the diversity gain is not affected by correlation whatsoever. Furthermore, we find that the correlation loss is independent of the degrees of freedom encapsulated by the Nakagami-m fading parameter.}

A hybrid protocol is adopted at the relay, in which if the relay can successfully decode the signals, decode-and-forward (DF) protocol will be adopted to forward the signals to the users. Otherwise, amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol will be implemented. Assuming that the users adopt maximal ratio combining (MRC) to combine the received signals in the two cooperative phases, new explicit analytical expressions for the average sum-rate are derived when the relay works in, 1) AF mode, and 2) DF mode, in two scenarios when one user is the stronger in both cooperation phases, and when an alternative user is stronger in each phase. Then, the investigation is extended to the case where the relay is an untrusted node, and cooperative jamming technique is proposed to degrade the ability of the relay to decode the signals and enforce the relay to operate always in AF mode. For the untrusted relay scenario, new analytical expression for the average secrecy rate is derived. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to validate the analysis. The simulation results reveal that the location of the relay is the key parameter to achieve the best performance.}

In this framework, we also consider multiple-type mobile users with different sizes of computation tasks, and they offload the tasks to a MEC server, and receive the computation resulting data from the server. We derive the successful edge computing probability (SECP), defined as the probability that a user offloads and finishes its computation task at the MEC server within the target latency. We provide a closed-form expression of the approximated SECP for general case, and closed-form expressions of the exact SECP for special cases. This paper then provides the design insights for the optimal configuration of MEC-enabled HetNets by analyzing the effects of network parameters and bias factors, used in MEC server association, on the SECP. Specifically, it shows how the optimal bias factors in terms of SECP can be changed according to the numbers of user types and tiers of MEC servers, and how they are different to the conventional ones that did not consider the computing capabilities and task sizes.}

In this article, we consider a downlink millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an LIS is deployed to assist the downlink data transmission from a base station (BS) to a user equipment (UE). Both the BS and the UE are equipped with a large number of antennas, and a hybrid analog/digital precoding/combining structure is used to reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption. We aim to maximize the spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the LIS's reflection coefficients and the hybrid precoder (combiner) at the BS (UE). To tackle this non-convex problem, we reformulate the complex optimization problem into a much more friendly optimization problem by exploiting the inherent structure of the effective (cascade) mmWave channel. A manifold optimization (MO)-based algorithm is then developed. Simulation results show that by carefully devising LIS's reflection coefficients, our proposed method can help realize a favorable propagation environment with a small channel matrix condition number. Besides, it can achieve a performance comparable to those of state-of-the-art algorithms, while at a much lower computational complexity.}

In this paper, terrestrial network and satellite network synergistically provide complete coverage for ground users. A user association scheme on account of the channel gain and distance between the ground users and the BSs is proposed to identify the users to be associated by the BSs, and there is an upper limit for the number of users associated with each BS. Then calculate the channel condition ratio to select the users served by the satellite. The all BSs provide service for those unselected users, and the NOMA technology is applied to terrestrial network. Then, a user pairing scheme which maximize the minimum the ground user channel correlation coefficient is formulated to match the terrestrial users in a NOMA group. On account of multiple antennas equipped by the BSs and satellite, beamforming is performed among groups of BSs and among satellite users so as to reduce multi-user interference. In the power allocation scheme, we introduce the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algotithm so as to optimize system energy efficiency. In addition, the objective function is a non-convex function, so the Dinkelbach-style scheme is presented to convert non-convex function into the convex-form function. Eventually, the performance of the presented algorithm is simulated and compared with the existing NOMA-FTPA algorithm. The results indicate that the presented algorithm has high superiority in system energy efficiency and it can be applied to this network.}

In this paper, we investigate a novel multi-user NOMA system design for video delivery. Different from data delivery considered in existing NOMA systems, video distortion is taken into consideration for the design and optimization of the proposed scheme. We first propose a cross-layer scalable video delivery scheme over NOMA wireless networks based on given user grouping. By adopting a semi-analytical rate distortion model for encoded video sequences and investigating the physical layer model for the multi-carrier NOMA network, the distortion-aware power allocation problem is formulated with the goal to minimize the system end-to-end distortion with quality-of-service requirements. To solve such a non-convex problem, we design an efficient algorithm by exploiting its hidden monotonic property to approximate the optimal solution. Inspired by the decoding order in NOMA, a fast algorithm is developed by combining water-filling and greedy strategies to further tame the computational complexity. Simulations results have verified the advantages of the proposed cross-layer scheme with distortion-aware power allocation algorithms, against two existing NOMA schemes and an OMA scheme.}

The most promising system designs include a reduced number of radio-frequency (RF) chains with digital-to-analog converters (DACs) of lower sampling resolution. However, naive reduction of beamformer components to reduce power consumption typically leads to significant loss of spectral-efficiency (SE). In this paper, we focus on the transmit beamforming (precoding) and we introduce an architecture with low-end components that maximizes the EE while minimizing the effects on SE. This is achieved by the novel design of the analog part of the precoder, where the number of the RF chains is not reduced a priori, but deactivated based on an optimization algorithm. Thus, the problem becomes a subset selection one, where only the RF chains with the optimal SE-EE performance are being activated. The selection algorithm not only determines the optimal number of RF chains to activate but also selects optimally between DACs of randomly-allocated resolution.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multiuser wireless power transfer (WPT) network, where a UAV is responsible for providing wireless energy for a set of ground devices (GDs) deployed in an area. We focus on the design of UAV trajectory subject to the maximum flight speed limit, in order to maximize the minimum harvested energy among GDs over a particular charging duration. Different from prior works that considered simplified linear energy harvesting models, this paper for the first time takes into account the realistic nonlinear energy harvesting model for the UAV trajectory design. However, the formulated trajectory design problem is highly non-convex and has infinite number of variables, thus making it be challenging to be solved optimally. To tackle this difficulty, we adopt the following three-step approach to obtain an efficient solution. First, we rigorously characterize that the optimal trajectory follows a new successive-hover-and-fly (SHF) structure, where the UAV hovers at a certain set of points for efficiently transferring energy, and flies among these hovering points with the maximum speed following certain arcs (not necessarily straight lines). Next, based on this SHF structure, we transform the original problem to a new one for finding a set of turning point variables during the maximum-speed flight, at which the UAV changes the flight direction without hovering. Finally, we use the techniques of convex approximation to solve the transformed problem. According to the convexity of the nonlinear energy harvesting model, we iteratively solve a series of convex optimization problems to update the UAV trajectory towards a high-quality solution. Numerical results show the convergence of the proposed approach, and validate its performance gain over conventional designs.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) have exhibited considerable potential for efficiently balancing the performance and complexity of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) detectors. However, existing NN-based MIMO detectors are difficult to be deployed in practical systems because of their slow convergence speed and low robustness in new environments. To address these issues systematically, we propose a receiver framework that enables efficient online training by leveraging the following simple observation: although NN parameters should adapt to channels, not all of them are channel-sensitive. In particular, we use a deep unfolded NN structure that represents iterative algorithms in signal detection and channel decoding modules as multi layer deep feed forward networks. An expectation propagation (EP) module, called EPNet, is established for signal detection by unfolding the EP algorithm and rendering the damping factors trainable. An unfolded turbo decoding module, called TurboNet, is used for channel decoding. This component decodes the turbo code, where trainable NN units are integrated into the traditional max-log-maximum a posteriori decoding procedure. We demonstrate that TurboNet is robust for channels and requires only one off-line training. Therefore, only a few damping factors in EPNet must be re-optimized online. An online training mechanism based on meta learning is then developed. Here, the optimizer, which is implemented by long short-term memory NNs, is trained to update damping factors efficiently by using a small training set such that they can quickly adapt to new environments. Simulation results indicate that the proposed receiver significantly outperforms traditional receivers and that the online learning mechanism can quickly adapt to new environments. Furthermore, an over-the-air platform is presented to demonstrate the significant robustness of the proposed receiver in practical deployment.}

	abstract = {In a vehicular edge computing (VEC) system, vehicles can share their surplus computation resources to provide cloud computing services. The highly dynamic environment of the vehicular network makes it challenging to guarantee the task offloading delay. To this end, we introduce task replication to the VEC system, where the replicas of a task are offloaded to multiple vehicles at the same time, and the task is completed upon the first response among replicas. First, the impact of the number of task replicas on the offloading delay is characterized, and the optimal number of task replicas is approximated in closed-form. Based on the analytical result, we design a learning-based task replication algorithm (LTRA) with combinatorial multi-armed bandit theory, which works in a distributed manner and can automatically adapt itself to the dynamics of the VEC system. A realistic traffic scenario is used to evaluate the delay performance of the proposed algorithm. Results show that, under our simulation settings, LTRA with an optimized number of task replicas can reduce the average offloading delay by over 30% compared to the benchmark without task replication, and at the same time can improve the task completion ratio from 97% to 99.6%.}

	abstract = {Coded caching is effective in leveraging the accumulated storage size in wireless networks by distributing different coded segments of each file in multiple cache nodes. This paper aims to find a wireless coded caching policy to minimize the total discounted network cost, which involves both transmission delay and cache replacement cost, using tools from deep learning. The problem is known to be challenging due to the unknown, time-variant content popularity as well as the continuous, high-dimensional action space. We first propose a clustering based long short-term memory (C-LTSM) approach to predict the number of content requests using historical request information. This approach exploits the correlation of the historical request information between different files through clustering. Based on the predicted results, we then propose a supervised deep deterministic policy gradient (SDDPG) approach. This approach, on one hand, can learn the caching policy in continuous action space by using the actor-critic architecture. On the other hand, it accelerates the learning process by pre-training the actor network based on the solution of an approximate problem that minimizes the per-slot cost. Real-world trace-based numerical results show that the proposed prediction and caching policy using deep learning outperform the considered existing methods.}

Channel estimation methods can exploit the resulting sparsity to estimate parameters (delay and angles) of each propagation path, which in turn can be exploited for positioning and mapping. When paths exhibit significant spread in either angle or delay, these methods break down or lead to significant biases. We present a novel tensor-based method for channel estimation that allows estimation of mmWave channel parameters in a non-parametric form. The method is able to accurately estimate the channel, even in the absence of a specular component. This in turn enables positioning and mapping using only diffuse multipath.

In this work, we consider the issue of energy efficiency in D2D-enabled heterogeneous cellular networks. Specifically, communication mode selection and resource allocation are jointly considered with the aim to maximize the energy efficiency in the long term. And an Markov decision process (MDP) problem is formulated, where each user can switch between traditional cellular mode and D2D mode dynamically. We employ deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, to solve the MDP problem in continuous state and action space. The architecture of proposed method consists of one actor network and one critic network. The actor network uses deterministic policy gradient scheme to generate deterministic actions for agent directly, and the critic network employs value function based Q networks to evaluate the performance of the actor network. Simulation results show the convergence property of proposed algorithm and the effectiveness in improving the energy efficiency in a D2D-enabled heterogeneous network.}

	abstract = {This paper studies federated learning (FL) in a classic wireless network, where learning clients share a common wireless link to a coordinating server to perform federated model training using their local data. In such wireless federated learning networks (WFLNs), optimizing the learning performance depends crucially on how clients are selected and how bandwidth is allocated among the selected clients in every learning round, as both radio and client energy resources are limited. While existing works have made some attempts to allocate the limited wireless resources to optimize FL, they focus on the problem in individual learning rounds, overlooking an inherent yet critical feature of federated learning. This paper brings a new long-term perspective to resource allocation in WFLNs, realizing that learning rounds are not only temporally interdependent but also have varying significance towards the final learning outcome. To this end, we first design data-driven experiments to show that different temporal client selection patterns lead to considerably different learning performance. With the obtained insights, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for joint client selection and bandwidth allocation under long-term client energy constraints, and develop a new algorithm that utilizes only currently available wireless channel information but can achieve long-term performance guarantee. Experiments show that our algorithm results in the desired temporal client selection pattern, is adaptive to changing network environments and far outperforms benchmarks that ignore the long-term effect of FL.}

However, considerable performance gains can be accomplished by allowing coordination among the BSs. This paper proposes the first distributed framework for cooperative precoding design in cell-free massive MIMO (and, more generally, in joint transmission coordinated multi-point) systems that entirely eliminates the need for backhaul signaling for CSI exchange. A novel over-the-air (OTA) signaling mechanism is introduced such that each BS can obtain the same cross-term information that is traditionally exchanged among the BSs via backhaul signaling. The proposed distributed precoding design enjoys desirable flexibility and scalability properties, as the amount of OTA signaling does not scale with the number of BSs or user equipments. Numerical results show fast convergence and remarkable performance gains as compared with non-cooperative precoding design. The proposed scheme can also outperform the centralized precoding design under realistic CSI acquisition.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a new transmit diversity scheme is proposed for cooperative pseudo-non-orthogonal multiple access (Pseudo-NOMA) without assuming full channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To support two users under the near-far user pairing constraint, a distributed cyclic delay diversity (dCDD) scheme is adapted into NOMA by dividing a set of remote radio heads (RRHs) into two groups for multiple cyclic-prefixed single carrier transmissions. To maximize a far user’s rate and two users’ sum rate over independently but non-identically distributed frequency selective fading channels and under a near-far user pairing constraint, we first derive closed-form expressions for the rates of the two users with full CSIT. Considering that only partial CSIT is available, a new RRH assignment and power allocation scheme is proposed for dCDD-Pseudo-NOMA. For various simulation scenarios, the provided link-level simulations verify that higher rates can be achieved by dCDD-Pseudo-NOMA compared with the traditional orthogonal multiple access with dCDD and dCDD-Conventional-NOMA that uses the superimposed signals. Furthermore, the proposed RRH assignment and power allocation scheme makes dCDD-Pseudo-NOMA achieve almost the same rate as that of ideal dCDD-Pseudo-NOMA which requires full CSIT.}

	abstract = {Generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) is a globally optimal algorithm for mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are NP-hard and can be widely found in the area of wireless resource allocation. The main idea of GBD is decomposing an MINLP problem into a primal problem and a master problem, which are iteratively solved until their solutions converge. However, a direct implementation of GBD is time- and memory-consuming. The main bottleneck is the high complexity of the master problem, which increases over the iterations. Therefore, we propose to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate GBD aiming at decreasing the complexity of the master problem. Specifically, we utilize two different ML techniques, classification and regression, to deal with this acceleration task. In this way, a cut classifier and a cut regressor are learned, respectively, to distinguish between useful and useless cuts. Only useful cuts are added to the master problem and thus the complexity of the master problem is reduced. By using a resource allocation problem in device-to-device communication networks as an example, we validate that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity of GBD without loss of optimality and has good generalization ability. The proposed method is applicable for solving various MINLP problems in wireless networks since the designs are invariant for different problems.}

We establish a new primal-dual learning framework, which learns online the optimal proactive schedules to maximize the time-average throughput of all the devices. Batch gradient descent is designed to enable stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based dual learning to learn the network dynamics from the outdated reports. Replay memory is deployed to allow online convex optimization (OCO)-based primal learning to predict channel conditions and prevent over-fitting. We also decentralize the online learning between the BS and devices, and speed up learning by leveraging the instantaneous knowledge of the devices on their states. We prove that the proposed framework asymptotically converges to the global optimum, and the impact of the outdated knowledge of the BS diminishes.

However, the analysis of its performance remained elusive. In the sequel, we overcome these difficulties and provide rigorous results on its asymptotic optimality in the many-users regime. Specifically, we first establish its optimality in the neighborhood of a specific system's state. Next, we extend our proof to the global case under a recurrence assumption, which we verify numerically. These findings showcase that the Whittle's index policy has analytically provable optimality in the many-users regime for the AoI minimization problem.

To reduce the fronthaul capacity requirement, more digital function blocks are shifted from a central unit to a distributed unit. In this study, we consider separated delivery of data and pilot signals with different compression rates under time-varying channels to reduce fronthaul burden. By analyzing channel prediction error based on a Kalman filter, an achievable rate for uplink data is derived. The fronthaul rates for data and pilots are derived using rate-distortion theory. Both uplink rate maximization and fronthaul rate minimization are simultaneously designed by considering the data and pilot signal distortions as well as the frame structure. First, the optimization of signal distortion with a fixed pilot interval is investigated. Next, a sub-optimal algorithm to find the pilot interval with the fixed signal distortion is developed. Finally, an iterative algorithm to obtain the sub-optimal solution, which is the joint solution of signal distortion and pilot interval, is proposed. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide convergent solutions.}

	abstract = {Received signal strength (RSS)-based ranging is a promising distance estimation approach in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). However, the multipath-rich underwater environment complicates acoustic propagations and derails the RSS-based ranging. To address the challenges, this article provides a novel ranging method, called channel state information (CSI)-based ranging for UASNs (CRUN). Instead of RSS, the measured CSI is modeled as a set of power-loss-based equations. Then, the ranging process under multipath scenarios is transformed as a multivariate optimization problem which involves parameters of all propagation paths. This optimization problem aims to simultaneously realize distance estimation and multipath mitigation. Noticing the large number of variables makes the solution numerically unstable, a threshold-window-based algorithm is proposed to simplify the multivariate optimization problem. In specific, the proposed algorithm extracts relative amplitude attenuations and relative time delays between the line-of-sight (LOS) path and each of the non-line-of-sight paths from CSI. The extracted parameters, being as equality constraints, simplify the multivariate optimization problem to a univariate optimization problem only concerning the desired LOS distance. Then, the simplified problem can be efficiently solved by the gradient descent algorithm. Statistical-channel-model-based simulations and lake experiments demonstrate that CRUN significantly improves the ranging accuracy and robustness compared with RSS-based approaches.}

	abstract = {The ever-growing wireless applications and their diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements bring the challenge of tailored QoS provisioning with limited radio resources in future cellular networks. While resource constraint is ubiquitous, different communication equipment in cellular networks could experience very different constraints in the multi-dimensional resource domains. To achieve stringent yet diverse QoS with limited resources, a novel multi-dimensional intelligent multiple access (MD-IMA) scheme is proposed in this paper to exploit disparate resource constraints among heterogeneous equipment for 5G beyond and 6G networks. With the assist of real-time data analysis, real-time QoS requirements, and resource availability of the related equipment are first determined in the proposed MD-IMA. Based on this, multiple access (MA) scheme is then intelligently adapted accordingly for each equipment in multi-dimensional resource domain to maximize the overall system requirement with operational constraints. The resource allocation in the MD-IMA system is further formulated as an optimization problem. To solve this non-convexity optimization of high computational complexity, the overall optimization is divided into several sub-problems and a joint optimization algorithm is adopted. Simulation results demonstrate the system energy efficiency performance gain of proposed MD-IMA over traditional MA is around 15% - 18%.}

	abstract = {Providing ultra reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is considered one of the major challenges for wireless communication networks. This article considers a downlink URLLC system in which a base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users in the short blocklength regime. With the objective of maximizing the users' minimum rate, three different optimization problems are considered: (i) joint design of bandwidth and power allocation for the case of a single-antenna BS; (ii) beamforming design for the case of a multiple-antenna BS; and (iii) design of power allocation with regularized zero-forcing beamforming for the case of a multiple-antenna BS. In the short blocklength regime, the achievable rate is a complicated function of bandwidth and power allocation coefficients or beamforming vectors, which makes these max-min rate optimization problems challenging to solve. This work develops path-following algorithms, which generate a sequence of improved feasible points and converge at least to a locally optimal solution, to solve these three optimization problems. Performance of the proposed algorithms is analyzed through extensive simulations under various settings of transmit power budget, number of users, total bandwidth, transmission time, and number of transmit antennas at the BS. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms.}

	abstract = {Mobile data traffic has been largely generated indoors. However, indoor cellular networks have been studied either on a two-dimensional (2D) plane or as an intractable optimization problem for a multi-story building. In this paper, we develop a tractable three-dimensional small-cell network model for a multi-story building. On each story, the small-cell base stations (BS) are distributed following a 2D homogeneous Poisson point process. We analytically derive the downlink coverage probability, spectral efficiency (SE) and area spectral efficiency for the indoor network as functions of the story height, the penetration loss of the ceiling and the BS density. Our tractable expressions show that a higher penetration loss of the ceiling leads to a higher coverage probability and a higher SE. Meanwhile, with the increase of the story height or the BS density, the downlink coverage probability first decreases and then increases after reaching a minimum value, indicating that certain values of story height and BS density should be avoided for good indoor wireless coverage.}

	abstract = {Digital receivers are required to recover the transmitted symbols from their observed channel output. In multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups, where multiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted, accurate symbol detection is challenging. A family of algorithms capable of reliably recovering multiple symbols is based on interference cancellation. However, these methods assume that the channel is linear, a model which does not reflect many relevant channels, as well as require accurate channel state information (CSI), which may not be available. In this work we propose a multiuser MIMO receiver which learns to jointly detect in a data-driven fashion, without assuming a specific channel model or requiring CSI. In particular, we propose a data-driven implementation of the iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm which we refer to as DeepSIC. The resulting symbol detector is based on integrating dedicated machine-learning methods into the iterative SIC algorithm. DeepSIC learns to carry out joint detection from a limited set of training samples without requiring the channel to be linear and its parameters to be known. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that for linear channels with full CSI, DeepSIC approaches the performance of iterative SIC, which is comparable to the optimal performance, and outperforms previously proposed learning-based MIMO receivers. Furthermore, in the presence of CSI uncertainty, DeepSIC significantly outperforms model-based approaches. Finally, we show that DeepSIC accurately detects symbols in non-linear channels, where conventional iterative SIC fails even when accurate CSI is available.}

	abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) technology, which allows direct communications between proximal devices, is widely acknowledged as a promising candidate to alleviate the mobile traffic explosion problem. In this paper, we consider an overlay D2D network, in which multiple D2D pairs coexist on several orthogonal spectrum bands, i.e., channels. Due to spectrum scarcity, the number of D2D pairs is typically more than that of available channels, and thus multiple D2D pairs may use a single channel simultaneously. This may lead to severe co-channel interference and degrade network performance. To deal with this issue, we formulate a joint channel selection and power control optimization problem, with the aim to maximize the weighted-sum-rate (WSR) of the D2D network. Unfortunately, this problem is non-convex and NP-hard. To solve this problem, we first adopt the state-of-art fractional programming (FP) technique and develop an FP-based algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. However, the FP-based algorithm requires instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) for centralized processing, resulting in poor scalability and prohibitively high signalling overheads. Therefore, we further propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme, with which D2D pairs can autonomously optimize channel selection and transmit power by only exploiting local information and outdated nonlocal information. Compared with the FP-based algorithm, the DRL-based scheme can achieve better scalability and reduce signalling overheads significantly. Simulation results demonstrate that even without instantaneous global CSI, the performance of the DRL-based scheme can approach closely to that of the FP-based algorithm.}

Under this setup, we jointly optimize the coordinated transmit beamforming vectors at the BSs and the reflective beamforming vector (with both reflecting phases and amplitudes) at the IRS, for the purpose of maximizing the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the users, subject to the individual maximum transmit power constraints at the BSs and the reflection constraints at the IRS. To solve the non-convex min-weighted-SINR maximization problem, we first present an exact-alternating-optimization approach to optimize the transmit and reflective beamforming vectors in an alternating manner, in which the transmit and reflective beamforming optimization subproblems are solved exactly in each iteration by using the techniques of second-order-cone program (SOCP) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR), respectively. However, the exact-alternating-optimization approach has high computational complexity, and may lead to compromised performance due to the uncertainty of randomization in SDR. To avoid these drawbacks, we further propose an inexact-alternating-optimization approach, in which the transmit and reflective beamforming optimization subproblems are solved inexactly in each iteration based on the principle of successive convex approximation (SCA). In addition, to further reduce the computational complexity, we propose a low-complexity inexact-alternating-optimization design, in which the reflective beamforming optimization subproblem is solved more inexactly. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed three designs achieve significantly increased min-weighted-SINR values, as compared with benchmark schemes without the IRS or with random reflective beamforming. It is also shown that the inexact-alternating-optimization design outperforms the exact-alternating-optimization one in terms of both the achieved min-weighted-SINR value and the computational complexity, while the low-complexity inexact-alternating-optimization design has much lower computational complexity with slightly compromised performance. Furthermore, we show that our proposed design can be applied to the scenario with unit-amplitude reflection constraints, with a negligible performance loss.}

	abstract = {Optimization theory assisted algorithms have received great attention for precoding design in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Although the resultant optimization algorithms are able to provide excellent performance, they generally require considerable computational complexity, which gets in the way of their practical application in real-time systems. In this work, in order to address this issue, we first propose a framework for deep-unfolding, where a general form of iterative algorithm induced deep-unfolding neural network (IAIDNN) is developed in matrix form to better solve the problems in communication systems. Then, we implement the proposed deep-unfolding framework to solve the sum-rate maximization problem for precoding design in MU-MIMO systems. An efficient IAIDNN based on the structure of the classic weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) iterative algorithm is developed. Specifically, the iterative WMMSE algorithm is unfolded into a layer-wise structure, where a number of trainable parameters are introduced to replace the high-complexity operations in the forward propagation. To train the network, a generalized chain rule of the IAIDNN is proposed to depict the recurrence relation of gradients between two adjacent layers in the back propagation. Moreover, we discuss the computational complexity and generalization ability of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed IAIDNN efficiently achieves the performance of the iterative WMMSE algorithm with reduced computational complexity.}

Nevertheless, its performance is limited by the large overhead needed to obtain the high-dimensional channel information. To reduce the huge training overhead associated with conventional pilot-aided designs, we propose a novel blind data detection method by leveraging the channel sparsity and data concentration properties. Specifically, we propose a novel \\ell _{3}\n-norm-based formulation to recover the data without channel estimation. We prove that the global optimal solution to the proposed formulation can be made arbitrarily close to the transmitted data up to a phase-permutation ambiguity. We then propose an efficient parameter-free algorithm to solve the \\ell _{3}\n-norm problem and resolve the phase-permutation ambiguity.

We address this effect from the perspective of non-orthogonal sequence design in a two-cell multiple-antenna network. Specifically, we aim at designing pilot sequences to minimize the sum mean-squared-error (MSE) of channel estimation with a given sequence length\nτ\nwhere\nτ∈[K,2K]\nand\nK\nis the number of users per cell. Considering the strength disparity between channels originating from the home cell and the neighbor cell, this problem boils down to minimizing the sum of squares of weighted correlations among sequences, whose lower bound is obtained in closed form and can be regarded as a generalization of the well-known Welch bound (Welch, 1974). We prove this extended Welch bound is achievable, and design an algorithm based on the Davies-Higham method to generate the interference-minimizing sequences. Three fundamental properties of the proposed sequences are presented. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and rate for data transmission, based on which the optimal training duration can be found.}

	abstract = {The development of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems, where vehicle localization and tracking can be combined with vehicular communication, will lead to more efficient future vehicular networks. In this paper, we develop a predictive beamforming scheme in the context of DFRC systems. We consider a system model where the road-side unit estimates and predicts the motion parameters of vehicles based on the echoes of the DFRC signal. Compared to the conventional feedback-based beam tracking approaches, the proposed method can reduce the signaling overhead and improve the accuracy of the angle estimation. To accurately estimate the motion parameters of vehicles in real-time, we propose a novel message passing algorithm based on factor graph, which yields a near optimal performance achieved by the maximum a posteriori estimation. The beamformers are then designed based on the predicted angles for establishing the communication links. With the employment of appropriate approximations, all messages on the factor graph can be derived in a closed-form, thus reduce the complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed DFRC based beamforming scheme is superior to the feedback-based approach in terms of both estimation and communication performance. Moreover, the proposed message passing algorithm achieves a similar performance of the high-complexity particle filtering-based methods.}

	abstract = {The mobile crowdsensing paradigm facilitates a broad range of emerging sensing applications by leveraging ubiquitous mobile users to cooperatively perform certain sensing tasks with their smart devices. As this paradigm involves data collection from users, the issue of designing rewards to incentivize users is fundamentally important to ensure participation in crowdsensing. In this paper, we revisit this issue in the context of socially-aware crowdsensing which integrates crowdsensing into social networks. For example, in healthcare-based crowdsensing services, the fun of tracking daily nutrition information for a certain user can be promoted by comparing her nutritional information with that contributed and shared by her socially-connected friends. To be more general and practical, we study the incentive mechanisms in presence of multiple crowdsensing service providers and multiple users. Understanding the behaviors of users and service providers in socially-aware crowdsensing is of paramount importance for incentive mechanisms. With this focus, we propose a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game approach to model the strategic interactions among service providers and users, where the social influence of users and the strategic interconnections of service providers are jointly and formally integrated into the game modeling. Through backward induction methods, we theoretically prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. We conduct extensive simulations to investigate game equilibrium properties, and the real-world dataset is applied to evaluate and demonstrate the performance effectiveness of the proposed game model.}

	abstract = {Providing high-bandwidth and fast-speed links, wireless local area networks (WLANs) in the Terahertz (THz) band have huge potential for various bandwidth-intensive indoor applications. However, due to the specific phenomena in the THz band, including severe reflection loss, indoor blockage effects, multi-path fading, the analysis on the interference and coverage probability at a downlink is challenging. In this paper, indoor blockage effects caused by the walls and human bodies are analyzed. Next, a statistical THz channel model is proposed to characterize the THz indoor propagation. In light of these, the moment generating functions of the aggregated interference and theoretical expressions for the mean interference power are derived. As a result, the approximated coverage probability and average network throughput are derived. Extensive numerical results show that for the nearest access point (nearest-AP) user association scheme, the optimal AP density is 0.15/m 2 , which results in the coverage probability reaches 93% and the average network throughput is 30 Gbps/m 2 . In addition, by adopting a novel line-of-sight access point (LoS-AP) user association mechanism, the coverage probability and the average network throughput can be further improved by 3 percent and 2 Gbps/m 2 , respectively.}

	abstract = {Attracted by the advantages of multi-access edge computing (MEC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), this article studies the resource allocation problem of a NOMA-MEC system in an ultra-dense network (UDN), where each user may opt for offloading tasks to the MEC server when it is computationally intensive. Our optimization goal is to minimize the system computation cost, concerning the energy consumption and task delay of users. In order to tackle the non-convexity issue of the objective function, we decouple this problem into two sub-problems: user clustering as well as jointly power and computation resource allocation. Firstly, we propose a user clustering matching (UCM) algorithm exploiting the differences in channel gains of users. Then, relying on the mean-field game (MFG) framework, we solve the resource allocation problem for intensive user deployment, using the novel deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method, which is termed by a mean-field-deep deterministic policy gradient (MF-DDPG) algorithm. Finally, a jointly iterative optimization algorithm (JIOA) of UCM and MF-DDPG is proposed to minimize the computation cost of users. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits rapid convergence, and is capable of efficiently reducing both the energy consumption and task delay of users.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the downlink coverage probability and rate of an aerial user in vertical HetNets (VHetNets) comprising aerial base stations (aerial-BSs) and terrestrial-BSs. The locations of terrestrial-BSs are modeled as an infinite 2-D Poisson Point Process (PPP), while the locations of aerial-BSs are modeled as a finite 2-D Binomial Point Process (BPP). Our cellular-to-air (C2A) channel model incorporates line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS transmissions between terrestrial-BSs and a typical aerial user, while we assume LoS transmissions for all aerial links. We assume that the aerial user is associated with an aerial-BS or terrestrial-BS that provides the strongest average received power. Using stochastic geometry, we derive exact and approximate expressions of the coverage probability and rate in terms of interference power's Laplace transform. The expressions are simplified assuming only LoS transmissions for the C2A channels. This enables easy-to-compute equations with good accuracy at elevated aerial user heights. We find that aerial users hovering at low altitudes tend to connect to aerial-BSs in denser terrestrial environments. Employing directive beamforming at aerial-BSs guarantees an acceptable performance at the aerial user by reducing interference signals received from the aerial-BSs. In denser terrestrial networks, the performance at the aerial user degrades substantially despite beamforming.}

	abstract = {Mixed radio frequency (RF) and free space optical (FSO) communications are a promising alternative technology for backbone networks of next-generation wireless communications, but bottlenecks exist due to atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, the performance of amplified-and-forward dual-hop mixed RF/FSO systems with heterodyne detection and intensity modulation/direct detection techniques, in consideration of pointing errors, is investigated. In particular, an asymmetric fading environment is considered where the RF hop is assumed to follow κ-μ fading, which includes Nakagami-m and Rayleigh fading as special cases, while the FSO link is subjected to unified M-distribution fading, which has proven to be a general statistical distribution that accurately describes the fading model for the optical intensity under weak-to-strong turbulence conditions. More specifically, closed-form expressions for both the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability distribution function (PDF) of the end-to-end mixed RF/FSO system are derived in terms of the Meijer's G function. Capitalizing on the derived CDF and PDF expressions, novel closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the average bit error rate (BER), and the ergodic capacity under various modulation schemes are presented. Additionally, we present tight asymptotic formulae for the outage probability and the average BER at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime in terms of some elementary functions under various modulation schemes, which offer helpful insights into the influence of the channel parameters and system parameters on the performance of the mixed RF/FSO system. Finally, both Monte-Carlo simulation and numerical results are provided to corroborate our derived expressions.}

IEEE 802.11ax standard for the next generation WLAN introduces the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) mechanism that supports downlink and uplink multi-user transmissions over multiple resource units (RUs). In this paper, we, integrating the multi-user transmissions with the target wake time (TWT) mechanism, propose the Scheduling Channel Access with TWT (SCAT) scheme. The SCAT wakes up stations (STAs) no more than the number of RUs in each target beacon so that the channel can be accessed on schedule without contention. Additionally, we develop a mathematical model to derive the throughput and delay arising from sleeping (DAFS) under the SCAT, which are used to formulate the throughput maximization problem (TMP) subject to delay constraint. Then, the TMP is solved by the genetic algorithm in which a tree is chosen as a chromosome. The solution to the TMP enables the SCAT to assign the optimal listen intervals and the next target beacons to the STAs so that the maximum throughput is achieved. Simulation results show the SCAT outperforms the existing schemes in throughput, channel utilization, and energy efficiency.}

This receiver exhibits substantial interference rejection abilities, yet it does not involve any matrix inversions; rather, its structure hinges on the pairwise projections of the users' channel vectors. Its performance is markedly superior to that of matched-filter beamforming, while the computational cost is decidedly inferior to that of an MMSE filter, altogether constituting an attractive alternative in terms of performance vs cost. Furthermore, with a proper sparsification of the channel matrix that it estimates and processes, the proposed receiver can be rendered scalable in the sense of its computational cost per access point not growing with size of the network. Uplink power control is also readily accommodated.}

We first show that the performance of massive MIMO based grant-free random access is mainly decided by the probability of preamble collision. The implication of this is that although the number of antennas can be arbitrarily large, the (average) number of successful packet transmissions can be limited by the number of preambles. Then, we propose an approach to preamble collision reduction without increasing the number of preambles using the notion of superpositioned preambles (S-preambles). Since the channel estimation for conjugate beamforming can be carried out when unused S-preambles are known, a simple approach is derived to detect unused S-preambles and its performance is analyzed for a special case (superpositions with 2 preambles). Based on analysis and simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed approach with S-preambles can increase the success probability with the same spectral efficiency as the conventional approach.}

	abstract = {In the existing cellular networks, it remains a challenging problem to communicate with and control an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm with both high reliability and low latency. Due to the UAV swarm's high working altitude and strong ground-to-air channels, it is generally exposed to multiple ground base stations (GBSs), while the GBSs that are serving ground users (occupied GBSs) can generate strong interference to the UAV swarm. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel two-phase transmission protocol by exploiting cellular plus device-to-device (D2D) communication for the UAV swarm. In Phase I, one swarm head is chosen for ground-to-air channel estimation, and all the GBSs that are not serving ground users (available GBSs) transmit a common control message to the UAV swarm simultaneously, using the same cellular frequency band. Both the swarm head and other swarm members can utilize the high power gain from multiple available GBSs' transmission, to combat the strong interference from occupied GBSs, while some UAVs may fail to decode the message due to uncorrelated ground-to-air channels. In Phase II, all the UAVs that have decoded the message in Phase I further relay it to the other UAVs in the swarm via D2D communication, by exploiting the less interfered D2D frequency band and the proximity among UAVs. In this paper, we aim to characterize the reliability performance of the above two-phase transmission protocol, i.e., the expected percentage of UAVs in the swarm that can decode the common control message, which is a non-trivial problem due to the complex system setup and the intricate coupling between the two transmission phases. Nevertheless, we manage to obtain an approximated expression of the reliability performance of interest, under reasonable assumptions and with the aid of the Pearson distributions. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our analytical results and show the effectiveness of our proposed protocol over other benchmark protocols. We also study the effect of key system parameters on the reliability performance, to reveal useful insights on the practical design of cellular-connected UAV swarm communication.}

However, the complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) based ECSAM receiver increases exponentially with required spectral efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive performance evaluation of ECSAM for the indoor visible light communication (VLC) channel with multipath propagation under realistic illumination constraints and imperfect channel estimation. A sub-optimal receiver that employs a slot-by-slot detection algorithm followed by a slot-correction mechanism for reducing the receiver complexity is proposed. Additionally, the method for optimal selection of parameters when designing the signal waveform is presented. The analytical upper bound on the symbol error rate of ECSAM is derived using the union-bound technique. The results show that the error performance of the sub-optimal receiver are comparable to that of the optimal ML receiver. Compared with conventional power or bandwidth efficient VLC modulation techniques such as multiple pulse position modulation (MPPM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), ECSAM provides complete flexibility in modifying the signal constellation for a desired dimming level to maximise the spectral efficiency and provide a robust bit error rate performance especially in the multipath propagation channel induced intersymbol interference.}

	abstract = {Sum of fading signals arises in several communication applications such as maximal-ratio combining (MRC) used in multiple antenna systems and eliminating the inter-symbol interference in high speed wireless networks. The exact formulation of the statistics of the sum is known to be very complicated. This article presents two simple closed-form approximations to the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the sum of \\alpha -\\mu\nvariates, resembling an urban mobile communication environment. By direct integration, it is demonstrated that the PDF of the sum of \\alpha -\\mu\nrandom variables can be approximated by a weighted sum of few identical \\alpha -\\mu\ndistributions including order one coefficients. The proposed approximations are of variable-order to achieve the desired accuracy and also have specific parameters using which, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) diversity systems can be explicitly analyzed as simply as a single-input single-output (SISO) system. In addition, a MIMO wireless system utilizing orthogonal space-time block coding technique (OSTBC-MIMO) in an \\alpha -\\mu\nfrequency nonselective fading environment is analyzed, and expressions for outage probability (OP) and bit error rate (BER) of digital binary modulations as well as the capacity are obtained. Moreover, the asymptotic OP and BER expressions are derived from the declared approximate expressions. The asymptotic OP and BER performances clearly indicate a diversity order equal to the product of the \\frac {\\alpha }{2}\nparameter, the \\mu\nparameter, the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. Analytical results are verified by simulation.}

	abstract = {Tag signal detection is one of the key tasks in ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. However, obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is challenging and costly, which makes AmBC systems suffer from a high bit error rate (BER). To eliminate the requirement of channel estimation and to improve the system performance, in this paper, we adopt a deep transfer learning (DTL) approach to implicitly extract the features of channel and directly recover tag symbols. To this end, we develop a DTL detection framework which consists of offline learning, transfer learning, and online detection. Specifically, a DTL-based likelihood ratio test (DTL-LRT) is derived based on the minimum error probability (MEP) criterion. As a realization of the developed framework, we then apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to intelligently explore the features of the sample covariance matrix, which facilitates the design of a CNN-based algorithm for tag signal detection. Exploiting the powerful capability of CNN in extracting features of data in the matrix formation, the proposed method is able to further improve the system performance. In addition, an asymptotic explicit expression is also derived to characterize the properties of the proposed CNN-based method when the number of samples is sufficiently large. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the BER performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the optimal detection method with perfect CSI.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing is considered as a promising method to release the computation burden of mobile devices (MDs) by transferring the computation tasks to the nearby edge server. In this paper, we address the computation offloading problem by jointly optimizing offloading-decision making, multi-user multiple input and multiple output (MU-MIMO) precoding and computation resource allocation. The optimization problem is formulated as the minimization of the weighted sum of energy consumption and time delay of MDs, which is a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. Due to the complexity of offloading time delay, we consider two special cases namely, the lower bound and upper bound of offloading time delay for the original problem, and exploit semidefinite relaxation and rounding methods to obtain the offloading decisions. Specially, we adopt the quadratic transform based fractional programming and the weighted minimum mean square error methods to solve the MU-MIMO precoding design problem for the two cases of offloading time delay, respectively. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that the application of multi-antenna MU-MIMO communication into MEC can sufficently reduce the energy consumption and time delay during computation offloading.}

	abstract = {The burgeoning network traffic imposes a huge burden on the network backbone. Caching popular files at the wireless network edge is promising to address the problem. In practice, file popularity is very unlikely to know in advance. Online learning algorithms are effective to learn this uncertainty in a sequential way. In each slot, the learning agent generates a caching policy (i.e., the to-be-cached files) and can observe users' feedback about the caching policy within the same slot. This method implicitly requires that all of the users are able to provide feedback promptly. However, in practice, the availability of each individual user is affected by many factors, e.g., users are moving out of the service area temporarily, or they may still consume files in the previous slots, which may result in the feedback delay. In this paper, we propose a delay-tolerant wireless caching system that takes both the feedback delay and users' availability into consideration. We frame the content caching problem as a stochastic combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem with delayed feedback and forced-to-sleep arms, and devise an intelligent caching algorithm called CFAUD to solve the problem. Also, we show that CFAUD is effective and efficient both theoretically and practically. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other well-known algorithms.}

	abstract = {To develop sustainable fifth generation (5G) wireless networks and utilize the unused spectrum, this paper focuses on cognitive radio (CR) based wireless information and energy transmissions from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to multiple low-power ground terminals (GTs). By practically considering the location-dependent air-to-ground (A2G) channel states and the non-linear energy harvesting (EH), we propose a dynamic fly-hover-transmit scheme, where the UAV successively flies between GTs, and hovers close to each GT for efficient wireless energy transfer (WET) or wireless information transfer (WIT) when the primary user (PU) is idle. By causally and optimally determining the UAV's mobility and transmit power for each selected transmission mode (WIT, WET, or being silent), we formulate the UAV's sum-throughput maximization over all GTs as a constrained Markov decision process (MDP) problem with battery energy constraints at all GTs and the UAV. Due to the infinitely large MDP system state space, this problem is difficult to solve. We then decompose this problem into two subproblems, by first deciding the UAV's transmission mode and power above a given GT, and then optimizing the UAV movement policy over multiple GTs. In the first subproblem, we propose an approximate to the complicated MDP value function of low complexity in closed-form, and then analytically derive the threshold-based suboptimal transmission policies. In the second subproblem, we optimally solve a simple-but-fundamental two-GT case, and then extend the general location-dependent GT weight design to an efficient suboptimal UAV movement policy. Simulation results show the significantly improved system performance under the proposed suboptimal policies over various benchmarks in dynamic networks.}

	abstract = {Among the new types of connectivity unleashed by the emerging 5G wireless systems, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is perhaps the most innovative, yet challenging one. Ultra-reliability requires high levels of diversity, however, the reactive approach based on packet retransmission in HARQ protocols should be applied carefully to conform to the stringent latency constraints. The main premise of this paper is that the NOMA principle can be used to achieve highly efficient retransmissions by allowing concurrent use of wireless resources in the uplink. We introduce a comprehensive solution that accommodates multiple intermittently active users, each with its own HARQ process. The performance is investigated under two different assumptions about the Channel State Information (CSI) availability: statistical and instantaneous. The results show that NOMA can indeed lead to highly efficient system operation compared to the case in which all HARQ processes are run orthogonally.}

	abstract = {Channel capacity bounds are derived for a point-to-point indoor visible light communications (VLC) system with signal-dependent Gaussian noise. Considering both illumination and communication, the non-negative input of VLC is constrained by peak and average optical intensity constraints. Two scenarios are taken into account: one scenario has both average and peak optical intensity constraints, and the other scenario has only average optical intensity constraint. For both two scenarios, we derive closed-from expressions of capacity lower and upper bounds. Specifically, the capacity lower bound is derived by using the variational method and the property that the output entropy is invariably larger than the input entropy. The capacity upper bound is obtained by utilizing the dual expression of capacity and the principle of “capacity-achieving source distributions that escape to infinity”. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis shows that the asymptotic performance gap between the capacity lower and upper bounds approaches zero. Finally, all derived capacity bounds are confirmed using numerical results.}

The general codebook design criteria and the construction of these codes using integer linear program (ILP) is formulated. Specifically, two different variations are presented: i) minimizing the union bound of probability of word error (PWE), which is a tighter bound but has high computational complexity and ii) minimizing an analytical closed form approximation to the PWE, which has much lower complexity but is a looser bound on the exact PWE. By leveraging the highly non-uniform a-priori probabilities of the different messages being transmitted in these two fields, the proposed nonlinear codes provide coding gains of about 2-3 dB in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). When compared to checksum codes with the same rate, the nonlinear codes offer performance advantages of about 1-2 dB for the DST notification field. In the presence of impulsive noise, simulations and analysis show that the probability of word error when employing the proposed nonlinear code is lower by many orders of magnitude compared with that of the uncoded system.}

In this paper, we present the first large-scale outdoor mm-wave measurement study using a phased antenna array in a typical European town. We systematically collect fine-grained 3D angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD) data, totaling over 50,000 received signal strength measurements. We study the impact of phased antenna arrays in terms of number of link opportunities, achievable data rate and robustness under small-scale mobility, and compare this against reference horn antenna measurements. Our results show a limited number of 2-4 distinct spatial link opportunities per receiver location, indicating that the mm-wave multipath richness in a European town is surprisingly similar to that of dense urban metropolises. The results for the phased antenna array reveal that significant losses in estimated data rate occur for beam misalignments in the order of the half-power beamwidth, with significant and irregular variations for larger misalignments. By contrast, the loss for horn antennas is monotonically increasing with the misalignment. Our results strongly suggest that the effect of non-ideal phased antenna arrays must be explicitly considered in the design of agile beamsteering algorithms.}

Existing deep learning based approaches to predict beamforming rely on the assumption that the training and testing channels follow the same distribution which may not hold in practice. As a result, a trained model may lead to performance deterioration when the testing network environment changes. To deal with this task mismatch issue, we propose two offline adaptive algorithms based on deep transfer learning and meta-learning, which are able to achieve fast adaptation with the limited new labelled data when the testing wireless environment changes. Furthermore, we propose an online algorithm to enhance the adaptation capability of the offline meta algorithm in realistic non-stationary environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive algorithms achieve much better performance than the direct deep learning algorithm without adaptation in new environments. The meta-learning algorithm outperforms the deep transfer learning algorithm and achieves near optimal performance. In addition, compared to the offline meta-learning algorithm, the proposed online meta-learning algorithm shows superior adaption performance in changing environments.}

We consider Rician fading and maximum ratio processing based on either linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) or least-squares (LS) channel estimation. We derive the average harvested energy by using a practical non-linear energy harvesting circuit model for both coherent and non-coherent transmission schemes. Furthermore, the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) is derived for all the considered methods and the max-min fairness problem is cast where the optimization variables are the AP and UE power control coefficients together with the large-scale fading decoding vectors. The objective is to maximize the minimum SE of the UEs' under APs' and UEs' transmission power constraints. A novel alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence and improvement at each step is proposed to solve the highly-coupled non-convex problem.}

	abstract = {Battery-Free Wireless Sensor Networks (BF-WSNs) have been attracting increasing interests in the recent years. To reduce the latency in BF-WSNs, the Minimum Latency Aggregation Scheduling (MLAS) problem with coverage requirement q is proposed recently, which tries to choose q percent of nodes for communication and aggregation. In the existing method, the authors try to select nodes adaptively according to their energy status and schedule these nodes to achieve the minimum latency. Unfortunately, it cannot guarantee the distribution of the aggregated nodes and may result in these nodes being squeezed in a small area and a poor aggregation quality. Thus, we re-investigate the q-coverage MLAS problem in this article, which can guarantee that the aggregated nodes are distributed evenly. Firstly, the 1-coverage MLAS problem, in which each node can be covered by at least one aggregated node, is studied. To reduce the latency, we intertwine the selection of aggregated nodes and the computation of a collision-free communication schedule simultaneously. Two algorithms are proposed by scheduling the communication tasks in the bottom-up and top-down manner respectively. Secondly, to satisfy the arbitrary coverage requirement q, three algorithms are proposed to guarantee the aggregated nodes are evenly distributed in the network with a low latency. Additionally, the method to extend the proposed algorithms for the BF-WSNs with multiple channels is also studied. The theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of latency.}

	abstract = {Despite the promising high-data rate features of visible light communications (VLC), they still suffer from unbalanced services due to blockages and channel fluctuation among users. This paper introduces and evaluates a new transmission scheme which adopts cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (Co-NOMA) in hybrid VLC/radio-frequency (RF) systems, so as to improve both system sum-rate and fairness. Consider a network consisting of one VLC access point (AP) and multiple strong and weak users, where each weak user is paired with a strong user. Each weak user can be served either directly by the VLC AP, or via the strong user which converts light information received through the VLC link, and forwards the information to the weak user via the RF link. The paper then maximizes a network-wide weighted sum-rate, so as to jointly determine the strong-weak user-pairs, the serving link of each weak user (i.e., either direct VLC or hybrid VLC/RF), and the power of each user message, subject to user connectivity and transmit power constraints. The paper tackles such a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem using an iterative approach. Simulations show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the VLC network performance (i.e., sum-rate and fairness) as compared to the conventional NOMA scheme.}

The formulated optimization problem is further shown to be non-convex, so that its global optimization is non-trivial.

Sojourn time, the time duration that a mobile user stays within a cell, is a mobility-aware parameter that can significantly impact the performance of mobile users and it can also be exploited to improve resource allocation and mobility management methods in the network. In this paper, we derive the distribution and mean of the sojourn time in multi-tier cellular networks, where spatial distribution of base stations (BSs) in each tier follows an independent homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). To obtain the sojourn time distribution in multi-tier cellular networks with maximum biased averaged received power association, as the first step, we derive the area of contact, based on which we then derive the linear contact distribution function and chord length distribution of each tier. We also study the relation between mean sojourn time and other mobility-related performance metrics. We show that the mean sojourn time is inversely proportional to the handoff rate, and the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of sojourn time is bounded from above by the complement of the handoff probability. Moreover, we study the impact of user velocity and network parameters on the sojourn time.}

	abstract = {In next-generation wireless networks, providing secure transmission and delay guarantees are two critical goals. However, either of them requires a concession on the transmission rate. In this article, we consider a visible light network consisting of multiple access points and multiple users. Our first objective is to mathematically evaluate the achievable rate under constraints on delay and security. The second objective is to provide a cell formation with customized statistical delay and security guarantees for each user. First, we propose a user-centric design called secure cell formation, in which artificial noise is considered, and flexible user scheduling is determined. Then, based on the effective capacity theory, we derive the statistical-delay-constrained secrecy rate and formulate the cell formation problem as a stochastic optimization problem (OP). Further, based on the Lyapunov optimization theory, we transform the stochastic OP into a series of evolutionary per-slot drift-plus-penalty OPs. Finally, a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm and an interference graph-based user-centric scheduling algorithm are proposed to solve the OPs. We obtain a dynamic independent set of scheduled users as well as secure cell formation parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better delay-constrained secrecy rate than the existing cell formation approaches.}

	abstract = {Hybrid Transmit Precoding (TPC) is one of the most compelling solutions for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems. However, most attention has been focused on narrow-band scenarios. Hence, we dedicate our efforts to the design of hybrid TPC for wideband mmWave MIMO systems, where the beam squint dramatically affects the system performance. We firstly show that the channel matrices of the different subcarriers possess distinct subspaces in case of high bandwidths, hence traditional hybrid TPC schemes suffer from an eroded performance. Therefore, we propose novel hybrid TPC schemes exploiting the full channel state information (CSI), which project all frequencies to the central frequency and construct the common analog TPC matrix for all subcarriers. Moreover, we propose several low-complexity array-vector based hybrid TPC schemes. The high-complexity manifold optimization based hybrid TPC method and the fully digital TPC operating with and without considering beam squint are provided as benchmarks. Our extensive numerical simulations show that the proposed hybrid TPC schemes are capable of achieving similar performance to the excessive-complexity fully digital TPC, when the bandwidth tends to 0.5 GHz and always outperform the traditional hybrid TPC schemes.}

We find an analytical expression for the average freshness of the files at the user. Next, we generalize our setting to the case where there are multiple caches in between the source and the user, and find the average freshness at the user. We provide an alternating maximization based method to find the update rates for the cache(s), c i , and for the user, u i , to maximize the freshness of the files at the user. We observe that for a given set of update rates for the user (resp. for the cache), the optimal rate allocation policy for the cache (resp. for the user) is a threshold policy, where the optimal update rates for rapidly changing files at the source may be equal to zero. Finally, we consider a system where multiple users are connected to a single cache and find update rates for the cache and the users to maximize the total freshness over all users.}

	abstract = {To achieve physical layer security (PLS) with a flexible implementation, a novel design named security-oriented trellis coded spatial-modulation (SO-TCSM) is proposed in this article, where the transmitter does not know the channel state information (CSI) of wiretapping channels and relies on the legitimate CSI to vary the mapping patterns for the antenna information and the radiated information, aiming at the optimisation of free Euclidean distances between the resultant SO-TCSM symbols. Eavesdroppers cannot decode the confidential information delivered in the legitimate link, as they do not know the legitimate CSI and, hence, have no basis to acquire the transmitter's mapping pattern of the moment. Moreover, the SO-TCSM symbols are then compensated to maximise their Euclidean distances, which further improves the legitimate receiver's decoding performance while enhancing the PLS. However, the compensation results in high transmit power when the legitimate channels are in deep fades. To boost the energy efficiency, a constraint is set to limit the transmit power. Under this constraint, the SO-TCSM performance is investigated in terms of bit error rate and transmit power consumption. The outcome of these investigations substantiates that, compared to conventional TCSM designs, our SO-TCSM achieves better performance in the legitimate link with lower decoding complexity.}

	abstract = {The grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) system, in which users autonomously transmit uplink data signals without carrying out a complicated random access process, offers significant advantages for increasing the efficiency of resource usage with low signaling overhead. In the proposed GF-NOMA system, since the collision resolution process is omitted and resources are not pre-assigned to users, multiple users may use same resource, without the base station (BS) being able to identify these collided users. In addition, in the absence of the UL synchronization procedure generally performed in the random access process, multiple users’ signals are received asynchronously. To solve these problems, we have developed a new transceiver structure for the GF-NOMA system consisting of a secondary preamble and a multiuser-multisymbol (MUMS) detector. The purpose of the secondary preamble is to successfully detect user access and estimate channel information even when no collision resolution process is being performed. The MUMS receiver is then proposed as a way to effectively mitigate the severe interference caused by the asynchronous transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed preamble structure and the receiver structure are superior to the conventional schemes. Furthermore, we show that the GF-NOMA system with the proposed transceiver structure achieves much better performance than other GF-NOMA systems in terms of reliability and successfully detected bits.}

	abstract = {Spatial modulation (SM) is a particularly important form of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), which uses both modulation symbols and antenna indices to carry information. In this paper, to avoid the high cost and circuit complexity of SM, we consider the hybrid SM system with a hybrid precoding transmitter architecture, combining a digital precoder and an analog precoder. In such a system, we carried out secure hybrid precoding and transmit antenna subarray selection (TASS) methods. Two hybrid precoding methods, called maximizing approximate secrecy rate (SR) via gradient ascent (Max-ASR-GA) and maximizing approximate SR via alternating direction method of multipliers (Max-ASR-ADMM), are proposed to improve the SR performance. As for TASS, a high-performance method of maximizing the approximate SR (Max-ASR) is first presented. To reduce its high complexity, two low-complexity TASS methods, namely maximizing eigenvalue (Max-EV) and maximizing product of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and artificial noise-to-signal-plus-noise ratio (Max-P-SINR-ANSNR), are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Max-ASR-GA and Max-ASR-ADMM hybrid precoders harvest substantial SR performance gains over existing method. For TASS, the proposed three methods Max-ASR, Max-EV, and Max-P-SINR-ANSNR perform better than existing leakage method. Particularly, the proposed Max-EV and Max-P-SINR-ANSNR are of low-complexity at the expense of a little performance loss compared with Max-ASR.}

	abstract = {Millimetre wave (mmWave) beam tracking is a challenging task because tracking algorithms are required to provide consistent high accuracy with low probability of loss of track and minimal overhead. To meet these requirements, we propose in this article a new cost-effective analog beam tracking framework namely Adaptive Tracking with Stochastic Control (ATSC). Under this framework, beam direction updates are made using a novel mechanism based on measurements taken from only two beam directions perturbed from the current data beam. To achieve high tracking accuracy and reliability, we provide a systematic approach to jointly optimise the algorithm parameters. The complete framework includes a method for adapting the tracking rate together with a criterion for realignment (perceived loss of track). ATSC adapts the amount of tracking overhead that matches well to the mobility level, without incurring frequent loss of track, as verified by an extensive set of experiments under both representative statistical channel models as well as realistic urban scenarios simulated by ray-tracing software. In particular, numerical results show that ATSC can track dominant channel directions with high accuracy for vehicles moving at 72 km/hour in complicated urban scenarios, with an overhead of less than 1%.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of energy efficient transmission and computation resource allocation for federated learning (FL) over wireless communication networks is investigated. In the considered model, each user exploits limited local computational resources to train a local FL model with its collected data and, then, sends the trained FL model to a base station (BS) which aggregates the local FL model and broadcasts it back to all of the users. Since FL involves an exchange of a learning model between users and the BS, both computation and communication latencies are determined by the learning accuracy level. Meanwhile, due to the limited energy budget of the wireless users, both local computation energy and transmission energy must be considered during the FL process. This joint learning and communication problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system under a latency constraint. To solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed where, at every step, closed-form solutions for time allocation, bandwidth allocation, power control, computation frequency, and learning accuracy are derived. Since the iterative algorithm requires an initial feasible solution, we construct the completion time minimization problem and a bisection-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution, which is a feasible solution to the original energy minimization problem. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can reduce up to 59.5% energy consumption compared to the conventional FL method.}

	abstract = {Over the past decades, multiple antenna technologies have appeared in many different forms, most notably as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), that have transformed wireless communications for extraordinary diversity and multiplexing gains. The various MIMO technologies have been based on placing a number of antennas at some fixed locations which dictate the fundamental limit on the achievable performance. By contrast, this paper envisages the scenario in which the physical position of an antenna can be switched freely to one of the N positions over a fixed-length line space to pick up the strongest signal in the manner of traditional selection diversity. We refer to this system as a fluid antenna system (FAS) for tremendous flexibility in its possible shape and position. The aim of this paper is to study the achievable performance of a single-antenna FAS system with a fixed length and N in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading channels. Our contributions include exact and approximate closed-form expressions for the outage probability of FAS. We also derive an upper bound for the outage probability, from which it is discovered that a single-antenna FAS given any arbitrarily small space can outperform an L-antenna maximum ratio combining (MRC) system if N is large enough. Our analysis also reveals the minimum required size of the FAS, and how large N is considered enough for the FAS to surpass MRC.}

	abstract = {Malicious jamming launched by smart jammers can attack legitimate transmissions, which has been regarded as one of the critical security challenges in wireless communications. With this focus, this paper considers the use of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance anti-jamming communication performance and mitigate jamming interference by adjusting the surface reflecting elements at the IRS. Aiming to enhance the communication performance against a smart jammer, an optimization problem for jointly optimizing power allocation at the base station (BS) and reflecting beamforming at the IRS is formulated while considering quality of service (QoS) requirements of legitimate users. As the jamming model and jamming behavior are dynamic and unknown, a fuzzy win or learn fast-policy hill-climbing (WoLF-CPHC) learning approach is proposed to jointly optimize the anti-jamming power allocation and reflecting beamforming strategy, where WoLF-CPHC is capable of quickly achieving the optimal policy without the knowledge of the jamming model, and fuzzy state aggregation can represent the uncertain environment states as aggregate states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed anti-jamming learning-based approach can efficiently improve both the IRS-assisted system rate and transmission protection level compared with existing solutions.}

To exploit the location-dependent and spatially varying channel as well as interference over the 3D space, we propose a new radio map based path planning framework for the UAV. Specifically, we consider the channel gain map of each GBS that provides its large-scale channel gains with uniformly sampled locations on a 3D grid, which are due to static and large-size obstacles (e.g., buildings) and thus assumed to be time-invariant. Based on the channel gain maps of GBSs as well as their loading factors, we then construct an SINR map that depicts the expected SINR levels over the sampled 3D locations. By leveraging the obtained SINR map, we proceed to derive the optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent shortest path problem (SPP) in graph theory. We further propose a grid quantization approach where the grid points in the SINR map are more coarsely sampled by exploiting the spatial channel/interference correlation over neighboring grids. Then, we solve an approximate SPP over the reduced-size SINR map (graph) with reduced complexity. Numerical results show that the proposed solution can effectively minimize the flying distance/time of the UAV subject to its communication quality constraint, and a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity can be achieved by adjusting the grid quantization ratio in the SINR map. Moreover, the proposed solution significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes without fully exploiting the channel/interference spatial distribution in the network.}

In this paper, we present a compressive sensing approach for federated learning over massive multiple-input multiple-output communication systems in which the central server equipped with a massive antenna array communicates with the wireless devices. One major challenge in system design is to reconstruct local gradient vectors accurately at the central server, which are computed-and-sent from the wireless devices. To overcome this challenge, we first establish a transmission strategy to construct sparse transmitted signals from the local gradient vectors at the devices. We then propose a compressive sensing algorithm enabling the server to iteratively find the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimate of the transmitted signal by exploiting its sparsity. We also derive an analytical threshold for the residual error at each iteration, to design the stopping criterion of the proposed algorithm. We show that for a sparse transmitted signal, the proposed algorithm requires less computationally complexity than LMMSE. Simulation results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms conventional linear beamforming approaches and reduces the performance gap between federated learning and centralized learning with perfect reconstruction.}

The proposed software exploits few samples of the received signal to estimate the AoA of the direct and reflected paths in an intensive multipath environment. The LoRay system has been validated in outdoor urban environments. The experimental results show that the proposed system provides stable and accurate AoA estimates for both the line-of-sight (LoS) and the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. The AoA of 80% of the received signals have been estimated within an estimation error below 2° and 10° for the LoS and the NLoS locations, respectively.}

	abstract = {LoRaWAN (Long 1 Range Wide Area Network) is an attractive network infrastructure and protocol suite for ultra low power Internet of Things devices. Even if the technology itself is quite mature and specified, the currently deployed wireless resource allocation strategies are still coarse and based on rough heuristics. This paper proposes an innovative “sequential waterfilling” strategy for assigning spreading factors to End Devices. Our design relies on three complementary approaches: i) equalize the Time-on-Air of packets transmitted by the system's End Devices in each spreading factor's group; ii) balance the spreading factors across multiple gateways and iii) keep into account the channel capture, which our experimental results show to be very substantial in LoRa. While retaining an extremely simple and scalable implementation, this strategy yields a significant improvement (up to 38%) in the network capacity over the Adaptive Data Rate used by many network operators on the basis of the design suggested by Semtech, and appears to be extremely robust to different operating/load conditions and network topology configurations.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave communications, equipped with large-scale antenna arrays, are able to provide Gbps data rates by exploring abundant spectrum resources. However, the use of a large number of antennas along with narrow beams causes a large overhead in obtaining channel state information (CSI) via beam training, especially for fast-changing channels. To reduce beam training overhead, in this paper we develop an interactive learning design paradigm (ILDP) that makes full use of domain knowledge of wireless communications (WCs) and adaptive learning ability of machine learning (ML). Specifically, the ILDP is fulfilled via deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which yields DRL-ILDP, and consists of communication model (CM) module and adaptive learning (AL) module, which work in an interactive manner. Then, we exploit the DRL-ILDP to design efficient beam training algorithms for both multi-user and user-centric cooperative communications. The proposed DRL-ILDP based algorithms enjoy three folds of advantages. Firstly, ILDP takes full advantages of the existing WC models and methods. Secondly, ILDP integrates powerful ML elements, which facilitates extracting interested statistical and probabilistic information from environments. Thirdly, via the interaction between the CM and AL modules, the algorithms are able to collect samples and extract information in real-time and sufficiently adapt to the ever-changing environments. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the designed algorithms.}

	abstract = {Content caching has limitations on achieving cache gains (e.g., cache hit ratio) in small cell networks, due to limited storages of small base stations (SBSs) and inherent user demand patterns (i.e., initial content preferences). Two effective approaches have been proposed to exploit the potential of content caching: SBS cooperation to utilize cache storage, and proactive content recommendation to shape user demand. In this paper, we investigate cooperative content caching and recommendation to maximize cache gains, while guaranteeing users' satisfaction by recommending appealing content items. We propose a generic framework for cooperative content caching and recommendation, based on which we propose an online and distributed scheme by designing a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In particular, online content caching (a.k.a., content replacement) is implemented by hopping from one cache state to another in the CTMC, while content recommendation is performed heuristically through sequential fixing at each cache state. Besides, we characterize the performance gap between our proposed scheme and the theoretical optimum in terms of cache hit ratio. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better cache hit ratios than other schemes in single-BS scenarios, and provides a competitive solution in multiple-BS scenarios.}

	abstract = {The Terahertz (THz) band is envisioned as a promising technique to support bandwidth-hungry and secure applications. Although the significant path loss and strong directivity make THz communications secure naturally, the information security is still imperfect at near regions along the beam propagation path. In this paper, a novel distance-adaptive absorption peak modulation (DA-APM) is developed for THz covert communications, by exploring the unique spectrum features of frequency-dependent molecular absorption. Although high-attenuation molecular absorption is unfavored for communications, the main principle to enhance covertness or equivalently, minimize the eavesdroppable distance, is dynamically modulating signals under the molecular absorption peaks in the THz spectrum, where the eavesdroppable distance is defined as the threshold distance within which an eavesdropper can wiretap the transmission. Furthermore, an optimization framework is proposed to minimize the eavesdroppable distance, to which the sub-optimal solutions are derived for the multi-wideband waveform by controlling carrier frequencies, power allocation, and rate distribution on each sub-band. Extensive numerical results show that the THz-spectrum-based DA-APM approach can reduce the eavesdroppable distance by 60% compared with random spectrum selection methods, which significantly reduce the insecure area and enhance the covertness of THz wireless transmission.}

	abstract = {The use of bivariate Fox H-functions (BFHFs) in performance analyses of wireless communication systems has gained considerable attention in past few decades. However, the non-existence of robust built-in routines for evaluating such functions in standard computing systems poses numerous challenges in numerical experiments and simulations. Motivated by the apparent need to circumvent these difficulties in performance analyses of cooperative wireless communications, this work presents an alternative method for obtaining the exact, approximate and asymptotic BFHF-free cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the end-to-end (e2e) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying wireless communication systems. As an illustration, the e2e performance analysis of an all-optical dual-hop free-space optical (FSO) transmission system over Gamma-Gamma turbulence in the presence of pointing errors is revisited. Specifically, new mathematical formulae for the statistical characteristics of the e2e SNR for systems with AF fixed-gain relaying as well as channel-state-information(CSI)-assisted using heterodyne detection (HD) or intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) are derived in terms of mathematically malleable and uniformly convergent infinite series of weighted Meijer G-functions. The usefulness of the derived CDFs is illustrated through derivation of traditional system performance metrics. The accuracy of the derived analytical formulae is verified via Monte Carlo simulations in MATLAB ® . Finally, based on results observed in this paper, useful expansions of common BFHFs in terms of easily computable univariate hypergeometric functions are proposed.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently received a significant interest to assist terrestrial wireless networks thanks to their strong line-of-sight links and flexible/instant deployment. However, UAVs' assistance is limited by their battery lifetime and wireless backhaul link capacity. At the expense of limited mobility, tethered UAVs (T-UAVs) can be a viable alternative to provide seamless service over a cable that simultaneously supplies power and data from a ground station (GS). Accordingly, this paper presents a comparative performance analysis of T-UAV and regular/untethered UAV (U-UAV)-assisted cellular traffic offloading from a geographical area that undergoes heavy traffic conditions. By using stochastic geometry tools, we first derive joint distance distributions between the hot-spot users, the terrestrial base station (TBS), and the UAV. To maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, a user association policy is developed, and corresponding association regions are analytically identified. Then, the overall coverage probability of the U-UAV/T-UAV-assisted system is derived for given locations of the TBS and the U-UAV/T-UAV. Moreover, we analytically prove that optimal UAV location falls within a partial surface of the spherical cone centered at the GS. Numerical results show that T-UAV outperforms U-UAV given that sufficient GS locations accessibility and tether length are provided.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-aided multicarrier (MC) system operating on fading channels, where both modulation and demodulation blocks are modeled by deep neural networks (DNNs), regarded as the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder (AE) architecture, respectively. Unlike existing AE-based systems, which incorporate domain knowledge of a channel equalizer to suppress the effects of wireless channels, the proposed scheme, termed as MC-AE, directly feeds the decoder with the channel state information and received signal, which are then processed in a fully data-driven manner. This new approach enables MC-AE to jointly learn the encoder and decoder to optimize the diversity and coding gains over fading channels. In particular, the block error rate of MC-AE is analyzed to show its higher performance gains than existing hand-crafted baselines, such as various recent index modulation-based MC schemes. We then extend MC-AE to multiuser scenarios, wherein the resultant system is termed as MU-MC-AE. Accordingly, two novel DNN structures for uplink and downlink MU-MC-AE transmissions are proposed, along with a novel cost function that ensures a fast training convergence and fairness among users. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the superiority of the proposed DL-based schemes over current baselines, in terms of both the error performance and receiver complexity.}

	abstract = {Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a popular framework for model training at an edge server using data distributed at edge devices (e.g., smart-phones and sensors) without compromising their privacy. In the FEEL framework, edge devices periodically transmit high-dimensional stochastic gradients to the edge server, where these gradients are aggregated and used to update a global model. When the edge devices share the same communication medium, the multiple access channel (MAC) from the devices to the edge server induces a communication bottleneck. To overcome this bottleneck, an efficient broadband analog transmission scheme has been recently proposed, featuring the aggregation of analog modulated gradients (or local models) via the waveform-superposition property of the wireless medium. However, the assumed linear analog modulation makes it difficult to deploy this technique in modern wireless systems that exclusively use digital modulation. To address this issue, we propose in this work a novel digital version of broadband over-the-air aggregation, called one-bit broadband digital aggregation (OBDA). The new scheme features one-bit gradient quantization followed by digital quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) at edge devices and over-the-air majority-voting based decoding at edge server. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of wireless channel hostilities (channel noise, fading, and channel estimation errors) on the convergence rate of the proposed FEEL scheme. The analysis shows that the hostilities slow down the convergence of the learning process by introducing a scaling factor and a bias term into the gradient norm. However, we show that all the negative effects vanish as the number of participating devices grows, but at a different rate for each type of channel hostility.}

The status is modeled as a time-varying Gauss-Markov Random Field (GMRF), whereby the estimation error of status update at the fusion center is analyzed. The transmission latency introduced by wireless networks is modeled as exponentially distributed random variables. We extend the existing queuing analysis results for Age of Information (AoI) with uncorrelated sources to GMRF in the considered scenario. Closed-form expressions of average remote estimation error are obtained for both one- and two-dimensional GMRFs assuming the exponential time-correlation function, both First-Come First-Served (FCFS) and Last-Come First-Served (LCFS) service disciplines, and a single wireless link. The analytical results are then extended to scenarios wherein multi-packet reception, i.e., multiple concurrent wireless links, is enabled; the difficulty of analyzing obsolete updates in this case is addressed leveraging a reasonable approximation validated by theoretical analysis in the regime where the number of sensors is far more than that of wireless links. Monte-Carlo simulation results are also presented which agree with our theoretical analysis. Based on the results, optimal time and spatial domain sampling rates (e.g., sensor density) can be obtained, providing helpful guidance to wireless sensor deployment.}

Although rate improvements due to channel bonding has been shown in sparse wireless LAN environments, its effectiveness in dense scenarios requires further exploration due to increased sensitivity to interference from overlapping co-channel basic service sets. With the newly finalized 802.11ax standard supporting enhanced spatial reuse feature, its impact on the expected gains from channel bonding needs careful analysis. In this work, we propose a new analytical framework that accurately models the performance of channel bonding as a function of both PHY and MAC parameters for a dense network scenario. A new channel bonding algorithm that is robust to overlapped co-channel interference is described, i.e. it preserves channel bonding gains by intelligently choosing the channel bonding bandwidth based on network conditions and parameters that are readily available to all stations, critically the modulation scheme chosen for packet transmission. The predicted gains of the proposed algorithm are verified via comprehensive simulations conducted with the open source network simulator ns-3.}

Moreover, the channel has to be tracked and the antenna arrays regularly reconfigured to obtain appropriate beamforming gains when a mobile setting is considered. In this paper, we focus on the problem of channel tracking for frequency-selective mmWave channels, and propose two novel channel tracking algorithms. One of them exploits the sparsity of the mmWave channel, while the other one leverages prior statistical information about the channel parameters. We also propose a hybrid precoder and combiner design method to increase the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during channel tracking, such that near-optimum data rates can be obtained with low-overhead. In our numerical results, we analyze the performance of our proposed algorithms for different system parameters. Simulation results show that our proposed channel tracking algorithms are able to achieve near-optimum data rates outperforming state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {In order to make device-to-device (D2D) content sharing give full play to its advantage of improving local area services, one of the important issues is to decide the channels that D2D pairs occupy. Most existing works study this issue in static environment, and ignore the guidance for D2D pairs to select the channel adaptively. In this paper, we investigate this issue in dynamic environment where D2D pairs’ activeness and wireless channel are dynamic. Specifically, we propose a pricing-based approach to guide D2D pairs to select different channels according to the spectrum resource states adaptively. Then, we formulate the pricing-based channel selection problem as an expected global price-to-performance ratio minimum problem. In order to solve it in a tractable manner, we make an approximately equivalent transformation to it. After that, we model the transformed problem as a stochastic game and prove it to be an exact potential game, which has at least one pure strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) point. In order to reach the pure strategy NE points in dynamic environment, we design a channel selection learning algorithm based on stochastic learning automata, which only requires little information exchange. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems enable simultaneous uplink and downlink communications by dynamically allocating the numbers of uplink and downlink remote antenna units (RAUs), which potentially improve the spectral efficiency in wireless communications. In such systems, channel state information (CSI) plays a critical role in uplink reception and downlink transmission, as well as the cross link interference cancelation caused by downlink RAUs to uplink RAUs. Moreover, downlink terminals need to estimate CSI to reliably decode the received signals due to the reduced channel hardening effect. However, high training overhead makes it generally impossible to directly estimate CSI. This paper proposes to estimate effective CSI (inner products of beamforming and channel vectors) instead based on beamforming training scheme. Under this scheme, we derive closed-form expressions for uplink and downlink achievable rates with different receivers and beamforming. Given these expressions, we propose an efficient power allocation scheme which is only dependent on slowly varying large-scale fading from the perspective of multi-objective optimization. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and effectiveness of beamforming training based CSI estimation. Moreover, trade-off regions between the considered optimization objectives under various system parameters offer numerous flexibilities for system optimization.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel nonlinear digital self-interference canceller algorithm, its implementation details on a software-defined radio (SDR) platform, and performance results of real-time full-duplex experiments on both device and link level. The canceller algorithm is based on an augmented Hammerstein model, with a nonlinear part modeling the transmitter non-idealities followed by a linear filter to model the self-interference (SI) channel. The nonlinear part includes a spline-based model for the nonlinear power amplifier, a polynomial model for baseband nonlinearities, as well as models for I/Q mismatch and LO leakage. The canceller is implemented on an FPGA as a part of an OFDM transceiver testbed for real-time measurements. Extensive real-time measurements show excellent performance: (1) the digital canceller, together with an RF isolator, can suppress the SI to within 1-2 dB's of the receiver noise floor, with total SI suppression of up to 103 dB; (2) digital cancellation of up to 46 dB is evidenced, which is among the highest real-time cancellations in literature; (3) system-level measurements with OFDM signals demonstrate the benefit of utilizing the proposed canceller in a two-way communication scenario, showing up to 90 % increase in sum-rate compared to half-duplex communication.}

	abstract = {Multi-point vehicular positioning is an essential operation for autonomous vehicles. However, the state-of-the-art positioning technologies, relying on reflected signals from a target (i.e., RADAR and LIDAR), cannot work without line-of-sight (LoS). Besides, it takes significant time for environment scanning and object recognition with potential detection inaccuracy, especially in complex urban situations. Some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles further expose such limitations. In this article, we aim at overcoming these limitations by proposing a novel relative positioning approach, called Cooperative Multi-point Positioning (COMPOP). The COMPOP establishes cooperation between a target vehicle (TV) and a sensing vehicle (SV) if a LoS path exists, where a TV explicitly lets an SV to know the TV’s existence by transmitting positioning waveforms. This cooperation makes it possible to remove the time-consuming scanning and target recognizing processes, facilitating real-time positioning. One prerequisite for the cooperation is a clock synchronization between a pair of TV and SV. To this end, we use a phase-differential-of-arrival (PDoA) based approach to remove the TV-SV clock difference from the received signal. With clock difference correction, the TV’s position can be obtained via peak detection over a 3D power spectrum constructed by a Fourier transform (FT) based algorithm. The COMPOP also incorporates nearby vehicles, without knowing their locations, into the above cooperation for the case without a LoS path. Specifically, several strong non-LoS (NLoS) links from the TV to the SV can be generated via mirror-like reflections over the neighboring vehicles’ metal surfaces. Following the same procedures in the LoS case, virtual TVs mirrored by nearby vehicles can be detected. By exploiting the geometric relation between the virtual and actual TVs, COMPOP can be achieved by intelligently combining the virtual TVs to position the actual TV. The effectiveness of the COMPOP is verified by several simulations concerning practical channel parameters.}

This article proposes a dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) wideband geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for HSR cooperative mMIMO channels. The proposed GBSM employs a sphere model and two elliptic-cylinder models to describe common and uncommon clusters for different links, and integrates the dynamic cluster evolution in both time and array domains. Statistical properties of the cooperative mMIMO model are investigated, such as multi-link spatial cross-correlation function and sum rate capacity. A corresponding dynamic 3-D wideband simulation model for the HSR cooperative mMIMO channel is also proposed. Finally, numerical results of the statistical properties are analyzed, and the proposed model is validated by realistic HSR channel measurement data, in terms of dual-link spatial cross-correlation and channel capacity. This model is more practical and will be helpful for facilitating the design and performance evaluation of future intelligent HSR communication systems.}

	abstract = {Virtualized radio access networks (vRAN) are emerging as a key component of wireless cellular networks, and it is therefore imperative to optimize their architecture. vRANs are decentralized systems where the Base Station (BS) functions can be split between the edge Distributed Units (DUs) and Cloud computing Units (CUs); hence they have many degrees of design freedom. We propose a framework for optimizing the number and location of CUs, the function split for each BS, and the association and routing for each DU-CU pair. We combine a linearization technique with a cutting-planes method to expedite the exact problem solution. The goal is to minimize the network costs and balance them with the criterion of centralization, i.e., the number of functions placed at CUs. Using data-driven simulations we find that multi-CU vRANs achieve cost savings up to 28% and improve centralization by 77%, compared to single-CU vRANs. Interestingly, we see non-trivial trade-offs among centralization and cost, which can be aligned or conflicting based on the traffic and network parameters. Our work sheds light on the vRAN design problem from a new angle, highlights the importance of deploying multiple CUs, and offers a rigorous optimization tool for balancing costs and performance.}

	abstract = {Distributed learning plays a key role in reducing the training time of modern deep neural networks with massive datasets. In this article, we consider a distributed learning problem where gradient computation is carried out over a number of computing devices at the wireless edge. We propose hierarchical broadcast coding, a provable coding-theoretic framework to speed up distributed learning at the wireless edge. Our contributions are threefold. First, motivated by the hierarchical nature of real-world edge computing systems, we propose a layered code which mitigates the effects of not only packet losses at the wireless computing nodes but also straggling access points (APs) or small base stations. Second, by strategically allocating data partitions to nodes in the overlapping areas between cells, our technique achieves the fundamental lower bound on computational load to combat stragglers. Finally, we take advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless networks by which wireless devices in the overlapping cell coverage broadcast to more than one AP. This further reduces the overall training time in the presence of straggling APs. Experimental results on Amazon EC2 confirm the advantage of the proposed methods in speeding up learning. Our design targets any gradient descent based learning algorithms, including linear/logistic regressions and deep learning.}

	abstract = {Link scheduling in device-to-device (D2D) networks is usually formulated as a non-convex combinatorial problem, which is generally NP-hard and difficult to get the optimal solution. Traditional methods to solve this problem are mainly based on mathematical optimization techniques, where accurate channel state information (CSI), usually obtained through channel estimation and feedback, is needed. To overcome the high computational complexity of the traditional methods and eliminate the costly channel estimation stage, machine leaning (ML) has been introduced recently to address the wireless link scheduling problems. In this article, we propose a novel graph embedding based method for link scheduling in D2D networks. We first construct a fully-connected directed graph for the D2D network, where each D2D pair is a node while interference links among D2D pairs are the edges. Then we compute a low-dimensional feature vector for each node in the graph. The graph embedding process is based on the distances of both communication and interference links, therefore without requiring the accurate CSI. By utilizing a multi-layer classifier, a scheduling strategy can be learned in a supervised manner based on the graph embedding results for each node. We also propose an unsupervised manner to train the graph embedding based method to further reinforce the scalability and develop a K-nearest neighbor graph representation method to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that the proposed method is near-optimal compared with the existing state-of-art methods but is with only hundreds of training network layouts. It is also competitive in terms of scalability and generalizability to more complicated scenarios.}

	abstract = {By means of random multiple access (RMA), there is a prevailing tendency for massive machine-type terminals to have access into networks without numerous signaling interactions and frequent resource scheduling. Being one of the promising techniques to fulfill this requirement, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is anticipated to notably broaden connections for the communication system. However, when applying RMA in the SCMA uplink, as massive terminals would randomly transmit their packets in an uncoordinated way, it is quite possible for some terminals to share an identical codebook so as to introduce the codebook collision problem. In this case, an indefinite number of terminals with possible codebook collisions would competitively share a same block of channel resources, resulting in an overloading status and deteriorated performance. To deal with this problem, we illustrate first the potential utilization of codebook collisions for RMA and propose then a partial Gaussian tree approximation (PGTA) detector to relieve heavy computational burden due to overloading conditions. With approximate decomposition of likelihood functions that has rarely been discussed, the proposed PGTA detector with proper message passing rules is able to approach the performance of a traditional message passing detector with considerably lower complexity.}

	abstract = {To accommodate diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements in 5th generation cellular networks, base stations need real-time optimization of radio resources in time-varying network conditions. This brings high computing overheads and long processing delays. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework to approximate the optimal resource allocation policy that minimizes the total power consumption of a base station by optimizing bandwidth and transmit power allocation. We find that a fully-connected neural network (NN) cannot fully guarantee the QoS requirements due to the approximation errors and quantization errors of the numbers of subcarriers. To tackle this problem, we propose a cascaded structure of NNs, where the first NN approximates the optimal bandwidth allocation, and the second NN outputs the transmit power required to satisfy the QoS requirement with given bandwidth allocation. Considering that the distribution of wireless channels and the types of services in the wireless networks are non-stationary, we apply deep transfer learning to update NNs in non-stationary wireless networks. Simulation results validate that the cascaded NNs outperform the fully connected NN in terms of QoS guarantee. In addition, deep transfer learning can reduce the number of training samples required to train the NNs remarkably.}

Meanwhile, the transmissions from small-cell base stations (SBSs) are subject to the aggregate interference constraints of macro-cell users (MUEs). In particular, we consider two-fold information uncertainties in small cells, i.e., the uncertainties regarding the eavesdroppers and interference channels to the MUEs. As such, the SBSs compete for robust secrecy rate with robust protection for the MUEs. We adopt the generalized robust Nash equilibrium problem (GRNEP) formulation, for which we confirm the existence of equilibrium and analyze the condition for the uniqueness with variational inequality-assisted analysis. Furthermore, to solve for the equilibrium, we introduce the pricing mechanism and decompose the original GRNEP as a nonlinear complementarity problem with a priced NEP, where the former provides solution of price coefficients and the latter for resource allocation strategies based on given prices. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the impacts of the interference constraint and uncertainties upon the security performance of an individual SUE and the overall network, which also corroborate the effectiveness of our proposal in security provisioning for the SUEs and interference protection for the MUEs.}

	abstract = {Media access control (MAC) plays a pivotal role in ensuring proper operation in wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, current solutions still cannot satisfy the stringent requirements of low power and low delay for emergency data reporting. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and emergency-aware MAC (EEEA-MAC) protocol for meeting such a rigorous demand. First, we design a node-different channel access scheme, in which source nodes use the CSMA/CA pattern while relay nodes adopt the hybrid CSMA/CA-TDMA pattern. Second, we devise an emergency-first time-slot allocation scheme, in which channel sensing is performed and the emergency data is handled by relay nodes according to different cases. EEEA-MAC has two striking features. One is that, source nodes adopt the CSMA/CA scheme instead of the conventional CSMA/CA-TDMA scheme, ensuring the requirement because there are almost no collisions and no confirmation messages in this scheme. The other is that, relay nodes use a sensing-based emergency data handling mechanism instead of the traditional empty-slot occupying mechanism, further guaranteeing the requirement owing to the immediate handling of emergency data and the short time of channel sensing. Extensive simulations demonstrate the advantages of EEEA-MAC in terms of energy dissipation and latency.}

	abstract = {A systematic method based on the Theory of Characteristic Modes (TCM) for finding orthogonal radiation patterns of any electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) is described. This method can be useful for designing single-RF front-end multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in which orthogonal patterns can be utilized as a basis set for space modulation (SM) or full multiplexed MIMO systems. The method is based on the\nN\n-port formulation of TCM and is not restricted to antenna type or array configuration. It can also provide closed formed solutions for the antenna element currents required to generate the orthogonal patterns. In addition an approach to finding the required load reactances in ESPAR for generating the orthogonal patterns is provided and is based on the quasi-Newton method utilizing a closed form expression for the initial approximate solution. Approximate estimation of the effective aerial degrees of freedom of the ESPARs is also discussed. Two simulation examples of ESPARs, a 4-element linear dipole array and an 8-element rectangular planar inverted-F antenna array, using SM as well as full multiplexed MIMO are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {In this work, we study the UAV-enabled data collection problem for high information freshness in wireless sensor networks, where one UAV is dispatched to collect information of ground Sensor Nodes (SNs). The information freshness is measured by the Age of Information (AoI) of each SN, which is defined as the sum of the SN's data uploading time and the UAV's flight time after leaving this SN. Two optimization problems of age-optimal data collection are formulated to minimize the SNs' maximal AoI and average AoI, respectively. An iterative SN association and trajectory planning policy is proposed to seek the age-optimal solutions via an iterative two-step procedure. Firstly, SN association is performed based on the affinity propagation clustering method with an appropriate weight to find a set of data Collection Points (CPs) at which the UAV hovers to collect data and schedules which SNs to upload in what order. Based on this result, trajectory planning is performed to find the max-AoI-optimal and ave-AoI-optimal trajectories of the UAV along the CPs using dynamic programming or genetic algorithm. With the optimized clustering weight, the proposed scheme can always strike a balance between the SNs' uploading time and the UAV's flight time in various scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can improve the freshness of information collected from all the SNs.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm connected to millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks is emerging as a new promising solution to provide ubiquitous high-speed and long distance wireless communication services for supporting various applications. To satisfy different quality of service (QoS) requirements in future large-scale applications of such networks, this article investigates the rate performance, fairness and their tradeoff in the networks with directional antennas in terms of sum-rate maximization, fairness index maximization, max-min fair rate and proportional fairness. We first consider a more realistic mmWave 3D directional antenna array model for UAVs and base station (BS), where the antenna gain depends on the radiation angle of the antenna array. Based on this antenna array model, we formulate the performance, fairness and their tradeoff as four constrained optimization problems, and propose corresponding iterative algorithm to solve these problems by jointly optimizing elevation angle, azimuth angle and height of antenna array at BS in the downlink transmission scenario. Furthermore, we also explore them in uplink transmission scenario, where the interference issue among links is carefully considered. Finally, according to the sum rate, minimum rate and fairness index under each optimization problem, numerical results are provided to illustrate the impacts of network parameters on the performance, fairness and their tradeoff, and also to reveal new findings under both downlink and uplink transmission scenarios, respectively.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has emerged as an effective tool for channel estimation in wireless communication systems, especially under some imperfect environments. However, even with such unprecedented success, DL methods are often regarded as black boxes and are lack of explanations on their internal mechanisms, which severely limits their further improvement and extension. In this paper, we present preliminary theoretical analysis on DL based channel estimation for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems to understand and interpret its internal mechanisms. As deep neural network (DNN) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is mathematically equivalent to a piecewise linear function, the corresponding DL estimator can achieve universal approximation to a large family of functions by making efficient use of piecewise linearity. We demonstrate that DL based channel estimation does not restrict to any specific signal model and asymptotically approaches to the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation in various scenarios without requiring any prior knowledge of channel statistics. Therefore, DL based channel estimation outperforms or is at least comparable with traditional channel estimation, depending on the types of channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed interpretation and demonstrate the effectiveness of DL based channel estimation under both linear and nonlinear signal models.}

	abstract = {We study age of information in a multiple source-multiple destination setting with a focus on its scaling in large wireless networks. There are n nodes uniformly and independently distributed on a fixed area that are randomly paired with each other to form n source-destination (S-D) pairs. Each source node wants to keep its destination node as up-to-date as possible. To accommodate successful communication between all n S-D pairs, we first propose a three-phase transmission scheme which utilizes local cooperation between the nodes along with what we call mega update packets to serve multiple S-D pairs at once. We show that under the proposed scheme average age of an S-D pair scales as O(n 1/4 logn) as the number of users, n, in the network grows. Next, we observe that communications that take place in Phases I and III of the proposed scheme are scaled-down versions of network-level communications. With this along with scale-invariance of the system, we introduce hierarchy to improve this scaling result and show that when hierarchical cooperation between users is utilized, an average age scaling of O(n α(h) logn) per-user is achievable, where h denotes the number of hierarchy levels and α(h) = 1/3·2 h +1. We note that α(h) tends to 0 as h increases, and asymptotically, the average age scaling of the proposed hierarchical scheme is O(logn). To the best of our knowledge, this is the best average age scaling result in a status update system with multiple S-D pairs.}

	abstract = {We study distributed user association in 5G and beyond millimeter-wave enabled heterogeneous networks using matching theory. We propose a novel and efficient distributed matching game, called early acceptance (EA), which allows users to apply for association with their ranked-preference base station in a distributed fashion and get accepted as soon as they are in the base station’s preference list with available quota. Several variants of the EA matching game with preference list updating and reapplying are compared with the original and stability-optimal deferred acceptance (DA) matching game, which implements a waiting list at each base station and delays user association until the game finishes. We show that matching stability needs not lead to optimal performance in other metrics such as throughput. Analysis and simulations show that compared to DA, the proposed EA matching games achieve higher network throughput while exhibiting a significantly faster association process. Furthermore, the EA games either playing once or multiple times can reach closely the network utility of a centralized user association while having much lower complexity.}

	abstract = {The use of directional transmission in millimeter-Wave (mmWave) frequencies results in limited channel coherence time. In this paper, we take the limited channel coherence time into account for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in mmWave hybrid beamforming systems. Due to the limited coherence time, the beamwidth of the hybrid beamformer affects the beam-training time, which in turn directly impacts the data transmission rate. To investigate this trade-off, we utilize a combined beam-training algorithm. Then, we formulate a sum-rate expression which considers the channel coherence time and beam-training time as well as users' power and other system parameters. Further, a joint power and beamwidth optimization problem is solved by iterating between the power allocation and the beamwidth optimization. When allocating the power, we use the log-exponential reformulation and the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) methods to solve the non-convex problem. Since beamwidth optimization involves too many variables, we propose an algorithm which iterates between clusters of users. Numerical results show that the optimized mmWave hybrid beamforming-NOMA system can achieve much higher sum-rates compared to NOMA with analog beamforming and traditional multiple access techniques.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the convergence time of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless network, is studied. In particular, a wireless network is considered in which wireless users transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS, acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number of resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network, only a subset of users can be selected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each learning step. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS prefers to include all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL model. Hence, the FL training loss and convergence time will be significantly affected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to design an appropriate user selection scheme that can select the users who can contribute toward improving the FL convergence speed more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the FL convergence time and the FL training loss. To solve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is proposed such that the BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects on the global FL model with high probabilities. Given the user selection policy, the uplink RB allocation can be determined. To further reduce the FL convergence time, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to estimate the local FL models of the users that are not allocated any RBs for local FL model transmission at each given learning step, which enables the BS to improve the global model, the FL convergence speed, and the training loss. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce the FL convergence time by up to 56% and improve the accuracy of identifying handwritten digits by up to 3%, compared to a standard FL algorithm.}

	abstract = {Battery-powered wireless IoT devices are now widely seen in many critical applications. Given the limited battery capacity and inaccessibility to external power recharge, optimizing energy efficiency (EE) plays a vital role in prolonging the lifetime of these IoT devices. However, a sheer amount of existing works only focus on the EE design at the infrastructure level such as base stations (BSs) but with little attention to the EE design at the device level. In this paper, we propose a novel idea that aims to shift energy consumption to a grid-powered cognitive radio mesh network thus preserving energy of battery-powered devices. Under this line of thinking, we cast the design into a cross-layer optimization problem with an objective to maximize devices’ energy efficiency. To solve this problem, we propose a parametric transformation technique to convert the original problem into a more tractable one. A baseline scheme is used to demonstrate the advantage of our design. We also carry out extensive simulations to exhibit the optimality of our proposed algorithms and the network performance under various settings.}

In particular, a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a single-antenna legitimate receiver in the presence of multiple single-antenna eavesdroppers, where the artificial noise (AN) is transmitted to enhance the security performance. Besides, we assume that the cascaded AP-IRS-user channels are imperfect due to the channel estimation error. To minimize the transmit power, the beamforming vector at the transmitter, the AN covariance matrix, and the IRS phase shifts are jointly optimized subject to the outage rate probability constraints under the statistical cascaded channel state information (CSI) error model. To handle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we first approximate the outage rate probability constraints by using the Bernstein-type inequality. Then, we develop a suboptimal algorithm based on alternating optimization, the penalty-based and semidefinite relaxation methods. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the transmit power compared to other benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {In order to meet the ever-increasing traffic demands, the combination of fiber and Millimeter Wave (mmWave) is expected to play a key role for 5G Centralized-Radio Access Networks (C-RANs). Due to the inefficiency of the Common Public Radio Interface for the Baseband Unit (BBU)-Remote Radio Head (RRH) communication, analog-Radio-over-Fiber (a-RoF) technology is considered a promising solution, mainly due to the RRH simplification and lower fronthaul requirements it imposes. In such mmWave a-RoF C-RANs, efficient Medium Transparent-Medium Access Control (MT-MAC) protocols are needed able to meet the challenging 5G requirements. To this end, in this paper, we propose a gated service MT-MAC protocol which authorizes each user to transmit the amount of data it requested. A detailed delay model is proposed, which is validated through simulations for different fiber lengths, network load conditions and number of available optical wavelengths. Moreover, the proposed protocol is compared with the state-of-the-art (SoA) and is shown to achieve up to 20 times higher throughput, 2 times lower delay with 100% lower blocking probability and 5 times higher data wavelength utilization, while being able to adapt to varying network traffic conditions. Our proposal also attains sub-ms latency in most cases, constituting it a promising candidate for 5G mmWave a-RoF C-RANs.}

	abstract = {Full-duplex (FD)-enabled relay networks represent a relevant solution to two critical needs of next-generation networks, namely, radio coverage extension and high spectral efficiency of wireless communications. Under practical conditions, however, the FD mode may not be the best operational setting for the relay; rather, operating in half-duplex may be more convenient when harsh channel conditions add up to self-interference. One of the fundamental challenges in the design of FD relay networks is thus how to determine the relay operational mode and the value of transmit power at both the relay and the data source, so that the achievable data rate is maximized as time varies. We address this problem in a two-hop, MIMO network, accounting for practical operational conditions in which the source is unaware of the symbols that the relay is transmitting. In light of the problem complexity, we also derive a lower-bound to the maximum achievable rate, which proves to be tight, especially for low-medium SNR values. We then tackle massive MIMO networks, and exploit our asymptotic analysis in the number of antennas to derive a low-complexity, yet highly efficient, operational mode and transmit power allocation scheme for a finite-size scenario.}

The joint design of UAV's trajectory, IRS scheduling, and communication resource allocation for the proposed system is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate while taking into account the heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirement of each user. The existence of an IRS introduces both frequency-selectivity and spatial-selectivity in the fading of the composite channel from the UAV to ground users. To facilitate the design, we first derive the expression of the composite channels and propose a parametric approximation approach to establish an upper and a lower bound for the formulated problem. An alternating optimization algorithm is devised to handle the lower bound optimization problem and its performance is compared with the benchmark performance achieved by solving the upper bound problem. Simulation results unveil the small gap between the developed bounds and the promising sum-rate gain achieved by the deployment of an IRS in UAV-based communication systems.}

	abstract = {We consider a typical heterogeneous network (HetNet), in which multiple access points (APs) are deployed to serve users by reusing the same spectrum band. Since different APs and users may cause severe interference to each other, advanced power control techniques are needed to manage the interference and enhance the sum-rate of the whole network. Conventional power control techniques first collect instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) and then calculate sub-optimal solutions. Nevertheless, it is challenging to collect instantaneous global CSI in the HetNet, in which global CSI typically changes fast. In this article, we exploit deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to design a multi-agent power control algorithm, which has a centralized-training-distributed-execution framework. To be specific, each AP acts as an agent with a local deep neural network (DNN) and we propose a multiple-actor-shared-critic (MASC) method to train the local DNNs separately in an online trial-and-error manner. With the proposed algorithm, each AP can independently use the local DNN to control the transmit power with only local observations. Simulations results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional power control algorithms in terms of both the converged average sum-rate and the computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a three-layer distributed multi-access edge computing (MEC) network where multiple clouds, MEC servers, and edge devices (EDs) are deployed at the top layer, middle layer, and bottom layer, respectively. Each cloud center (CC) is associated with an independent service provider and publishes an application-driven computing task. To deliver the tasks, CCs rely on EDs to generate the raw data and offload part of the computing tasks to both EDs and MEC servers such that their computing and transmission resources can be fully utilized to reduce the system latency. However, in such a three-layer network, the distributed deployment of tasks leads to inevitable resource competition among CCs. To address this issue, we propose a distributed scheme based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each CC jointly determines the task offloading and resource allocation strategy based on its inference of other CCs' decisions. Simulation results indicate that a lower system latency is achieved via our proposed scheme compared with the existing schemes. In addition, the influence of the number of CCs, MEC servers, and EDs on latency performance is also discussed.}

	abstract = {Differential channel quality indicator (CQI) and wideband CQI are key components of the reduced feedback schemes employed in the 5G New Radio (NR) and 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standards. They enable a base station (BS) to acquire channel state information that is essential for rate adaptation and frequency-domain scheduling without overwhelming the uplink. We present a novel throughput-optimal rate adaptation rule that exploits the correlation between the differential and wideband CQIs to improve throughput without any additional feedback. It also shows that the prevalent conventional method that adds the two CQIs is sub-optimal. We then propose a novel flexible-overhead differential CQI feedback scheme, in which the number of bits for differential CQI can be different across the subbands. This provides a new flexibility to the BS to control the feedback overhead. It differs from the current rigid parameterization, in which a user always feeds back a 2-bit differential CQI for each subband. In various single-user and multi-user deployment scenarios involving small-scale fading, large-scale shadowing, and co-channel interference, the proposed approach achieves nearly the same throughput as the feedback scheme employed in 5G and LTE, but with much less overhead.}

	abstract = {Energy-efficient design and secure communications are of crucial importance in wireless communication networks. However, the energy efficiency achieved by using physical layer security can be limited by the channel conditions. In order to tackle this problem, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted multiple input single output (MISO) network with independent cooperative jamming is studied. The energy efficiency is maximized by jointly designing the transmit and jamming beamforming and IRS phase-shift matrix under both the perfect channel state information (CSI) and the imperfect CSI. In order to tackle the challenging non-convex fractional problems, an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is proposed for solving energy efficiency maximization problem under the perfect CSI case while an alternate optimization algorithm based on S -procedure is used for solving the problem under the imperfect CSI case. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms the benchmark schemes in term of energy efficiency. Moreover, the tradeoff between energy efficiency and the secrecy rate is found in the IRS-assisted MISO network. Furthermore, it is shown that IRS can help improve energy efficiency even with the uncertainty of the CSI.}

Generally, the blind channel estimation method can identify the channel impulse response or channel frequency response up to scalar ambiguity. For coherent detection, the ambiguity should also be estimated. Exploiting the multiple modulation scheme, we estimate the scalar ambiguity for zero forcing equalization by maximum likelihood (ML). We also detect some equalized symbols fed into the ML estimation, which reduces the computational complexity of the proposed scalar ambiguity estimation. To efficiently reduce the complexity, we derive the Bayesian Cramér Rao lower bound (BCRB) of the ambiguity estimation. When evaluated in computational simulations, the performance of the proposed method achieved the BCRB performance at high signal-to-noise ratios. We also confirmed that when the proposed method is combined with the existing blind channel estimation, coherent detection is possible without any pilot symbols.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems require downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) to achieve spatial diversity and multiplexing gains. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) multiuser massive MIMO network, each user needs to compress and feedback its downlink CSI to the BS. The CSI overhead scales with the number of antennas, users and subcarriers, and becomes a major bottleneck for the overall spectral efficiency. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based CSI compression scheme, called DeepCMC , composed of convolutional layers followed by quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous DL-based CSI reduction structures, DeepCMC proposes a novel fully-convolutional neural network (NN) architecture, with residual layers at the decoder, and incorporates quantization and entropy coding blocks into its design. DeepCMC is trained to minimize a weighted rate-distortion cost, which enables a trade-off between the CSI quality and its feedback overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that DeepCMC outperforms the state of the art CSI compression schemes in terms of the reconstruction quality of CSI for the same compression rate. We also propose a distributed version of DeepCMC for a multi-user MIMO scenario to encode and reconstruct the CSI from multiple users in a distributed manner. Distributed DeepCMC not only utilizes the inherent CSI structures of a single MIMO user for compression, but also benefits from the correlations among the channel matrices of nearby users to further improve the performance in comparison with DeepCMC. We also propose a reduced-complexity training method for distributed DeepCMC, allowing to scale it to multiple users, and suggest a cluster-based distributed DeepCMC approach for practical implementation.}

	abstract = {Recently, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as an efficient solution for access points (APs) to aggregate distributed data from many edge devices (e.g., sensors) by exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple access (uplink) channels. While prior work focuses on the single-cell setting where inter-cell interference is absent, this article considers a multi-cell AirComp network limited by such interference and investigates the optimal policies for controlling devices' transmit power to minimize the mean squared errors (MSEs) in aggregated signals received at different APs. First, we consider the scenario of centralized multi-cell power control. To quantify the fundamental AirComp performance tradeoff among different cells, we characterize the Pareto boundary of the multi-cell MSE region by minimizing the sum MSE subject to a set of constraints on individual MSEs. Though the sum-MSE minimization problem is non-convex and its direct solution intractable, we show that this problem can be optimally solved via equivalently solving a sequence of convex second-order cone program (SOCP) feasibility problems together with a bisection search. This results in an efficient algorithm for computing the optimal centralized multi-cell power control, which optimally balances the interference-and-noise-induced errors and the signal misalignment errors unique for AirComp. Next, we consider the other scenario of distributed power control, e.g., when there lacks a centralized controller. In this scenario, we introduce a set of interference temperature (IT) constraints, each of which constrains the maximum total inter-cell interference power between a specific pair of cells. Accordingly, each AP only needs to individually control the power of its associated devices for single-cell MSE minimization, but subject to a set of IT constraints on their interference to neighboring cells. By optimizing the IT levels, the distributed power control is shown to provide an alternative method for characterizing the same multi-cell MSE Pareto boundary as the centralized counterpart. Building on this result, we further propose an efficient algorithm for different APs to cooperate in iteratively updating the IT levels to achieve a Pareto-optimal MSE tuple, by pairwise information exchange. Last, simulation results demonstrate that cooperative power control using the proposed algorithms can substantially reduce the sum MSE of AirComp networks compared with the conventional single-cell approaches.}

However, the serious quantization error caused by 1-bit ADCs will potentially limit the feasibility of high order modulations. This paper focuses on the analysis of the high order phase-shift keying (PSK) signal transmission in the 1-bit ADC massive MIMO system. Firstly, assuming ideal channel estimation and a single mobile station (MS), we theoretically prove that with an asymptotically large number of antennas at the base station, PSK signals with arbitrary modulation order can be recovered in the 1-bit ADC massive MIMO system. Secondly, we analyze the impact of pilot based channel estimation on the recovery of the high order PSK signals, which leads to a periodic asymptotic detection phase error (ADPE) at high signal to noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, we also propose to optimize the pilot sequence for minimizing the cumulative absolute ADPE. Finally, the analysis is extended to the multi-MS case and the performance with different pilot patterns is discussed. Simulation results validate our analysis and show that using our proposed optimized pilot sequence can significantly improve the detection performance for both single-MS and multi-MS 1-bit ADC massive MIMO systems.}

The proposed strategy firstly estimates the channel parameters by using a modified parameter estimation via interpolation based on a DFT grid (PREIDG) algorithm. In a second step, high-resolution channel parameter estimation is achieved even in the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) using the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. The proposed modified PREIDG algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the auxiliary beam pair (ABP) method while the SAGE algorithm achieves the derived Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Numerical results demonstrate that excellent estimation performance can be achieved for angle of departure (AoD) azimuth and elevation with addition to delay and complex path gain of each path even in the low SNR regime.}

	abstract = {Wireless caching networks have been extensively researched as a promising technique for supporting the massive data traffic of multimedia services. Many of the existing studies on real-data traffic have shown that users of a multimedia service consecutively request multiple contents and this sequence is strongly dependent on the related list of the first content and/or the top referrer in the category. This paper thus introduces the notion of “temporary preference”, characterizing the behavior of users who are highly likely to request the next content from a certain target category (i.e., related content list). Based on this observation, this paper proposes both probabilistic caching and dynamic delivery policies for categorized contents and consecutive user demands. The proposed caching scheme maximizes the minimum of the cache hit rates for all users. In the delivery phase, a dynamic helper association policy for receiving multiple contents in a row is designed to reduce the delivery latency. By comparing with the content placement optimized for one-shot requests, numerical results verify the effects of categorized contents and consecutive user demands on the proposed caching and delivery policies.}

Most of those applications rely on a communications system between a terrestrial base station and the UAV. Due to the UAV movement, time-variant channel models are required. In this article, we propose a geometrical model for the channel Multipath Components (MPCs) evolution with the UAV flight that supports MPCs that are born and die in several occasions due to blockages. Based on this model, the novel Geometry-Based Spatial-Consistent MPC Tracking Method (GSTM) is proposed and its performance on channel MPCs tracking was shown both by simulations and by an Air-to-Ground (A2G) low-height UAV measurement campaign. The GSTM also provides the parameters of a geometrical model of the evolution of the main MPCs of the channel, which allows to identify the scatterers that lead to the MPCs and greatly contributes to the understanding of the propagation mechanisms in A2G environments. The correctness of the MPC tracking is proven to be higher than 90% and the results show that the model obtained by the GSTM includes more than 95% of the received power.}

	abstract = {Free space optical communication has been applied in many scenarios because of its security, low cost and high rates. In such scenarios, a tracking system is necessary to ensure an acceptable signal power. Free space optical links were considered unable to support fast moving nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, cars or pedestrians, in optical mobile communication because existing tracking schemes fail to track the nodes accurately and rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking system exploiting multiple beacon lasers. Each beacon laser's power is measured to estimate the orientation of the target. Unlike existing schemes which drive servo motors multiple times based on consecutive measurements and feedback, our scheme can directly estimate the next optimal targeting shift for the servo motors based on a single measurement, allowing the tracking system to converge much faster. Closed-form outage probability expression is derived for the optical mobile communication system with ideal tracking, where pointing error and moving statistics are considered. To maintain sufficient average power and reduce the outage probability, the recommended beam divergence of the main laser is expressed in closed form as a function of the target's statistics of random shift, providing insights to the system design.}

We propose computationally efficient soft-output detectors based on two forms of channel puncturing: augmented and two-sided. The augmented WL detector (AWLD) employs a punctured channel derived by triangularizing the true channel in augmented form, followed by left-sided Gaussian elimination. The two-sided WL detector (dubbed WLZ) employs right-sided reduction and left-sided elimination to puncture the channel. We prove that augmented channel puncturing is optimal in maximizing the lower-bound on the achievable information rate (AIR) based on a new mismatched detection model. We show that the AWLD decomposes into an MMSE prefilter and channel gain compensation stages, followed by a regular WL detector (WLD) that computes least-squares soft-decision estimates. Similarly, WLZ decomposes into a pre-processing reduction step followed by WLD. AWLD attains the same performance as the existing AIR-based partial marginalization (PM) detector, but with less computational complexity. We empirically show that WLZ attains the best complexity-performance tradeoff among tree-based detectors.}

	abstract = {Elliptic localization where a transmitter actively sending out a signal to locate an object from its echo appears in many practical systems including multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars and wireless communications. In this article, the elliptic localization problem when the transmitter position is not known is addressed. We propose an effective method for joint estimation of the object and transmitter positions. Using the range measurements from the direct paths between the transmitter and the receivers together with the indirect paths through the object, we formulate a non-convex weighted least squares (WLS) minimization problem. The non-convex nature of this problem makes it difficult for an iterative search algorithm to reach the optimal solution, implying that good estimate is not guaranteed. To handle this difficulty, we propose to solve the formulated WLS localization problem by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, resulting in a convex semidefinite program (SDP). The proposed SDR method is then extended to the more general case when multiple transmitters at unknown positions are used and the receiver positions are subject to errors. Simulation results show that the proposed method can attain the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) accuracy under Gaussian noise and has superior performance over the existing method.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) mixed radio frequency (RF)/free-space optical (FSO) transmissions with partial relay selection (PRS) based on outdated channel state information (CSI) estimates. Turbulence-induced fading, path loss, and pointing errors, are all considered in the FSO channel modeling. Both the fading and the path loss are described through general models which encompass the commonly used models. Novel expressions for the cumulative distribution function, probability density function, moment generating function, and moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are obtained in closed-form. Thereafter, novel closed-form expressions for key performance metrics, namely, outage probability, average bit error probability and spectral efficiency, are derived. The analysis is unified, applying to both types of detection techniques, intensity modulation/direct direction and heterodyne detection. Asymptotic analysis is further conducted, which open the door to additional important results. Monte Carlo simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed analysis, and attest that in AF RF/FSO systems with PRS based on outdated CSI estimates, where implementing higher number of relays is highly difficult and costly, the low SNR regime may be prohibitive because it hinders the diversity advantages promised by the use of more relays in PRS systems.}

	abstract = {Although millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can well support high-data-rate transmissions, the inherent shortcomings, e.g., high path loss and sensitivity to blockage, may cause severe outage problems if the network is not configured properly. This paper aims to minimize the long-term outage probability of an mmWave communication network by optimizing the base station (BS) deployment and user association. For the BS deployment problem, existing works usually assumed that the positions of users are fixed and formulated it as a deterministic optimization problem. With the time-varying nature of positions of user equipments (UEs) taken into account, we establish a stochastic optimization framework for BS deployment optimization. The objective is to maximize the average number of physically accessible BSs of each UE under an inaccessible probability constraint, and a cooperative stochastic approximation (CSA)-based algorithm is developed to effectively search the optimal positions of BSs. For user association, our focus is to properly associate UEs with BSs to minimize the outage probability with balanced workloads among BSs. Combined with the proposed user association scheme, the proposed BS deployment scheme can significantly improve the network outage probability in the long term, especially when the aggregation degree of UEs is large.}

	abstract = {With the evolution of 5G, 6G and beyond, device-to-device (D2D) communications have been developed as an energy-, and spectrum-efficient solution. However, D2D links are allowed to share the same spectrum resources with cellular links, which will bring significant interference to those cellular links. Fortunately, an emerging technique called reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), can mitigate aggravated interference caused by D2D links by adjusting phase shifts of the surface to create favorable beam steering. In this paper, we study an RIS-assisted single cell uplink communication scenario, where a cellular link and multiple D2D links share the same spectrum and an RIS is adopted to mitigate the mutual interference. The problem of maximizing total system rate is formulated by jointly optimizing transmission powers of all links and discrete phase shifts of the surface. To obtain practical solutions, we capitalize on alternating maximization and the problem is decomposed into two sub-problems. For the power allocation, the problem is a difference of concave functions (DC) problem, which is solved with the gradient descent method. For the phase shift optimization, a local search algorithm is utilized. Simulation results show that deploying the RIS with optimized phase shifts can effectively eliminate the interference in D2D networks.}

To efficiently probe the channel, we form multiple directional beams simultaneously at the transmitter and steer them towards different directions. The objective is to devise the beam training sequence and develop an efficient algorithm to estimate the channel. By exploiting the sparse scattering nature of mmWave channels, the above problem is formulated as one of sparse encoding and signal recovery, which involves finding a sparse sensing matrix to compress the sparse channel and an efficient channel estimation algorithm to recover the sparse channel from compressive measurements. In this article, we propose a sparse bipartite graph code-based algorithm, where a set of bipartite graphs are employed to encode the sparse channel and a simple decoding procedure that relies on the presence of a No-Multiton-graph (NM-graph) is used to reconstruct the sparse channel. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed method can help achieve a substantial training overhead reduction. Simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its performance advantage over compressed sensing-based methods.}

There exists a body of literature in which the inspectors follow a deterministic trajectory to conduct surveillance, which results in a predictable environment for malicious entities. Thus, introducing randomness to the surveillance is of particular interest. In this work, we propose a novel framework for stochastic UAV-assisted surveillance that i) inherently considers the battery constraints of the UAVs, ii) proposes random moving patterns modeled via random walks, and iii) adds another degree of randomness to the system via considering probabilistic inspections. We formulate the problem of interest, i.e., obtaining the energy-efficient random walk and inspection policies of the UAVs subject to probabilistic constraints on inspection criteria of the sites and battery consumption of the UAVs, which turns out to be signomial programming that is highly non-convex. To solve it, we propose a centralized and a distributed algorithm along with their performance guarantee. This work contributes to both UAV-assisted surveillance and classic random walk literature by designing random walks with random inspection policies on weighted graphs with energy limited random walkers.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we aim at interference mitigation in 5G millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) communications by employing beamforming and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques with the aim of improving network's aggregate rate. Despite the potential capacity gains of mm-Wave and NOMA, many technical challenges might hinder that performance gain. In particular, the performance of Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) diminishes rapidly as the number of users increases per beam, which leads to higher intra-beam interference. Furthermore, intersection regions between adjacent cells give rise to inter-beam inter-cell interference. To mitigate both interference levels, optimal selection of the number of beams in addition to best allocation of users to those beams is essential. In this paper, we address the problem of joint user-cell association and selection of number of beams for the purpose of maximizing the aggregate network capacity. We propose three machine learning-based algorithms; transfer Q-learning (TQL), Q-learning, and Best SINR association with Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (BSDC) algorithms and compare their performance under different scenarios. Under mobility, TQL and Q-learning demonstrate 12% rate improvement over BSDC at the highest offered traffic load. For stationary scenarios, Q-learning and BSDC outperform TQL, however TQL achieves about 29% convergence speedup compared to Q-learning.}

In this paper, we proposed a unary coding based SWIPT encoder by considering a practical M-QAM. Markov chains are exploited for characterising coherent binary information source and for modelling the generation process of modulated symbols. Therefore, both mutual information and the average energy harvesting performance at the SWIPT receiver are analysed in semi-closed-form. With the aid of the genetic algorithm, the sub-optimal codeword distribution of the coded information source is obtained by maximising the average energy harvesting performance, while satisfying the requirement of the mutual information. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the SWIPT encoder. Moreover, a higher-level unary code and a lower-order M-QAM results in higher WPT performance, when the maximum transmit power of the modulated symbol is fixed.}

	abstract = {Determining which users to simultaneously schedule on the uplink and the downlink in a full-duplex (FD) system is crucial to control the inter-user interference between them and achieve a high spectral efficiency. The user-pair scheduling algorithm and the efficacy of FD is, thus, closely linked to the availability of channel state information and the feedback scheme that conveys it to the base station (BS). We consider a reduced feedback scheme in which a user that is scheduled feeds back only a limited number of quantized inter-user interferences that are below a pre-specified threshold. For it, we propose a novel user-pair scheduling and mode selection algorithm (UPSMA). We analyze the uplink and downlink spectral efficiencies of UPSMA for two channel models that highlight the different influences of small-scale fading and large-scale shadowing. We derive insightful asymptotic scaling laws that quantify the dependence of the threshold and the uplink and downlink spectral efficiencies on the number of users. UPSMA with limited feedback achieves a higher sum spectral efficiency than a half-duplex system and conventional FD resource allocation algorithms. Its performance is close to the exhaustive search algorithm in which the BS knows all the inter-user interferences.}

Traditionally, NOMA user grouping is non-overlapping, leading to a waste of power resources within each NOMA group. Motivated by this, in this paper we propose a novel generalized user grouping (GuG) concept for NOMA from an overlapping perspective, which allows each user to participate in multiple user groups but subject to individual maximum power constraint. In order to achieve effective GuG and maximize the system sum rate, we formulate a joint power control and GuG optimization problem. Then we further provide a machine learning-based GuG scheme to obtain the optimized feasible GuG and the optimal power control solutions efficiently, in which the established machine learning-based model is exploited to explore the relative relationships of channel gains of users and obtain several fixed grouping patterns via Merge operation. Simulation results verify the efficiency of GuG in NOMA systems and indicate that compared with traditional NOMA user grouping schemes, our proposed GuG scheme achieves significant performance gains in terms of system sum rate.}

We formulate a generic BA relaying protocol that is based on both the channel and buffer states and that can be parameterized by two parameters. Through a Markov chain analysis, we show how these parameters can be selected for the sake of minimizing the outage probability (OP) and average packet delay (APD) for asymptotic values of the signal-to-noise ratio. The performed optimization sheds more light on the impact of the buffer sizes on the triad of diversity order, coding gain and APD that can be contemplated. In particular, we prove that equipping the relay with two buffers of size three each is sufficient for extracting the full capabilities of two-way BA relaying. Depending on the network setup, one or both buffer sizes can be further reduced to two at the expense of a reduced coding gain without affecting the diversity order and asymptotic APD. Simulations under the generalized κ-μ fading demonstrate the appropriateness of the performed optimization of the relaying parameters and buffer sizes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with one static base station (BS) serving a fast-moving user, both equipped with a very large array. The transmitted signal arrives at the user through multiple paths, each with a different angle-of-arrival (AoA) and hence Doppler frequency offset (DFO), thus resulting in a fast time-varying multipath fading MIMO channel. In order to mitigate the Doppler-induced channel aging for reduced pilot overhead, we propose a new angular-domain selective channel tracking and Doppler compensation scheme at the user side. Specifically, we formulate the joint estimation of partial angular-domain channel and DFO parameters as a dynamic compressive sensing (CS) problem. Then we propose a Doppler-aware-dynamic variational Bayesian inference (DD-VBI) algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we propose a practical DFO compensation scheme which selects the dominant paths of the fast time-varying channel for DFO compensation and thereby converts it into a slow time-varying effective channel. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed scheme can enjoy the huge array gain provided by the massive MIMO and also balance the tradeoff between the CSI signaling overhead and spatial multiplexing gain. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed scheme over various baseline schemes.}

In this highly dynamic situation, it is crucial to design efficient random access (RA) procedures to cope both with the flood of simultaneous access requests and with the potential access failures. In this article, by exploiting the large sequence space, the excellent correlation property and especially the elegant nested structure of Reed-Muller (RM) sequences, we propose a new RA scheme, which facilitates both instantaneous access for newly active users and incremental access for the existing users who suffer from detection failures. In particular, when a failure occurs, the user continues accessing the channel employing an expanded RM sequence, which is combined with the previously received ones at the access point (AP) to form a longer sequence so as to attain potentially better detection probability. Furthermore, a recursive detection algorithm is designed for jointly detecting the resultant RM sequences and the channel coefficients of both the newly active users and the existing ones. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in detail. Our simulation results validate the analysis and show the scheme's superior access probability, access latency and computational complexity.}

Then, as an alternative to mechanically rotating ULAs, we propose to electronically select among multiple ULAs having a radial disposition at either transmitter or receiver, and we bound the shortfall from capacity as a function of the number of such ULAs. With only three ULAs, properly angled, 96% of the capacity can be achieved. Finally, we further introduce reduced-complexity precoders and linear receivers that capitalize on the structure of the channels spawned by these configurable ULA architectures.}

	abstract = {Incorporating short-packet communications with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks is able to achieve both low communication delay and high spectral efficiency. In this article, a wireless NOMA downlink short-packet communication system is studied. The system includes a base station, an entrusted central user, and an untrusted cell-edge user. The untrusted cell-edge user may eavesdrop the signals from the base station to the central user. We theoretically derive the average secure block error rate (BLER) of the central user in flat Rayleigh fading channels by utilizing the linear approximations on BLER and secure BLER. We also present the asymptotic average secure BLER at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). From numerical results, it is shown that our derived analytical average secure BLER matches the simulated one. Numerical results also illustrate that at high SNR, error floors occur. Furthermore, at high SNR, it is found that when the average secure BLER is not one, the power allocation factors for the central and cell-edge users have almost no impact on the average secure BLER.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) communications are one of the enabling technologies of 5G and beyond networks. While prior work indicates that mMIMO networks employing time division duplexing have a significant capacity growth potential, deploying mMIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD) networks remains problematic. The two main difficulties in FDD networks are the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead associated with the required uplink feedback for channel state information (CSI) acquisition. To address these difficulties, most existing methods utilize assumptions on the radio environment such as channel sparsity or angular reciprocity. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method for a scalable and low-overhead approach to FDD mMIMO under the so-called grid-of-beams architecture. The key idea behind our scheme lies in the exploitation of the near-common signal propagation paths that are often found across several mobile users located in nearby regions, through a coordination mechanism. In doing so, we leverage the recently specified device-to-device communications capability in 5G networks. Specifically, we design beam selection algorithms capable of striking a balance between CSI acquisition overhead and multi-user interference mitigation. The selection exploits statistical information, through so-called covariance shaping. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which prove particularly well-suited to rapidly-varying channels with short coherence time.}

	abstract = {With the rapid deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G networks are required to support massive access of a huge number of devices over limited radio spectrum radio. In wireless networks, different devices have various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, ranging from ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) to high transmission data rates. In this context, we present a joint energy-efficient subchannel assignment and power control approach to manage massive access requests while maximizing network energy efficiency (EE) and guaranteeing different QoS requirements. The latency constraint is transformed into a data rate constraint which makes the optimization problem tractable before modelling it as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. A distributed cooperative massive access approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to address the problem while meeting both reliability and latency constraints on URLLC services in massive access scenario. In addition, transfer learning and cooperative learning mechanisms are employed to enable communication links to work cooperatively in a distributed manner, which enhances the network performance and access success probability. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed distributed cooperative learning approach outperforms other existing approaches in terms of meeting EE and improving the transmission success probability in massive access scenario.}

	abstract = {To provide efficient networking services at the edge of Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV), Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) has been a promising technology to enable intelligent data exchange without giving additional duties to the resource constrained vehicles. Compared with conventional centralized SDVNs, hybrid SDVNs combine the centralized control of SDVNs and self-organized distributed routing of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) to mitigate the burden on the central controller caused by the frequent uplink and downlink transmissions. Although a wide variety of routing protocols have been developed, existing protocols are designed for specific scenarios without considering flexibility and adaptivity in dynamic vehicular networks. To address this problem, we propose an efficient online sequential learning-based adaptive routing scheme, namely, Penicillium reproduction-based Online Learning Adaptive Routing scheme (POLAR) for hybrid SDVNs. By utilizing the computational power of edge servers, this scheme can dynamically select a routing strategy for a specific traffic scenario by learning the pattern from network traffic. Firstly, this paper applies Geohash to divide the large geographical area into multiple grids, which facilitates the collection and processing of real-time traffic data for regional management in controller. Secondly, a new Penicillium Reproduction Algorithm (PRA) with outstanding optimization capabilities is designed to improve the learning effectiveness of Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM). Finally, POLAR is deployed in control plane to generate decision-making model (i.e., routing policy). Based on the real-time featured data, this scheme can choose the optimal routing strategy for a specific area. Extensive simulation results show that POLAR is superior to a single traditional routing protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and latency.}

	abstract = {High frequency (HF) radio communications offer latency advantages over fiber-optics in certain long-distance communication applications. As a result, there is interest in using HF for high-frequency trading (HFT), to make trans-continental market decisions that leverage the lower latency path of HF channels. The HF skywave channel is a dynamic medium and is one of the most challenging communication channels. Latencies in existing HF modems from coding and interleaving over several packets are prohibitive for HFT, which motivates the development of receivers that provide good performance given a delay constraint. In this paper, we present receiver designs that can be employed for low-latency reliable communication. We introduce a multitrellis adaptive Viterbi algorithm (MAVA) for sparse and time-varying intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, where the conventional Viterbi algorithm would lead to a large trellis. While multitrellis receiver designs have previously been considered, MAVA also incorporates real-time channel tracking, which is necessary for a practical HF receiver. We combine the MAVA algorithm with maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection to obtain a hybrid receiver with high-fidelity, low-delay performance. Finally, we conduct an asymptotic efficiency analysis of the hybrid receiver to gain insight into how deferring decisions improves performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.}

The methodology is based on a worst-case interference scenario, and consists of three investigating steps. This methodology is then applied to a measurement setup to practically study the case of 100 bps UNB signals interfering with an IEEE 802.11n transmission in the 2.4GHz band. Five different Wi-Fi devices are tested. The UNB signal is generated in two modulation schemes, the on-off-keying (OOK) and the Gaussian minimum-shift-keying. Both single and multiple simultaneous UNB interferers are considered. An analysis of the measurement results shows that three of the tested Wi-Fi devices cannot coexist with the considered non-listen-before-talk UNB communication system. The throughput performance analysis of the other tested devices shows that the OOK-modulated UNB signal has the least interfering impact, and the Wi-Fi pilot subcarriers are the most vulnerable to UNB interference. However, if a single UNB interferer avoids these subcarriers and employs the OOK-modulation scheme, then wireless coexistence is possible as long as the signal-to-interference ratio of Wi-Fi to UNB is greater than 30dB, given that a drop to 75% of the maximum Wi-Fi throughput is acceptable.}

	abstract = {Achieving high-rate communication with accurate localization and wireless environment sensing has emerged as an important trend of beyond-fifth and sixth generation cellular systems. Extension of the antenna array to an extremely large scale is a potential technology for achieving such goals. However, the super massive operating antennas significantly increases the computational complexity of the system. Motivated by the inherent advantages of lens antenna arrays in reducing system complexity, we consider communication and localization problems with an extremely large lens antenna array, which we call “ExLens”. Since radiative near-field property emerges in the setting, we derive the closed-form array response of the lens antenna array with spherical wave, which includes the array response obtained on the basis of uniform plane wave as a special case. Our derivation result reveals a window effect for energy focusing property of ExLens, which indicates that ExLens has great potential in position sensing and multi-user communication. We also propose an effective method for location and channel parameters estimation, which is able to achieve the localization performance close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Finally, we examine the multi-user communication performance of ExLens that serves coexisting near-field and far-field users. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation method and show that ExLens with a minimum mean square error receiver achieves significant spectral efficiency gains and complexity-and-cost reductions compared with a uniform linear array.}

	abstract = {Communication at high carrier frequencies such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) requires channel estimation for very large bandwidths at low SNR. Hence, allocating an orthogonal pilot tone for each coherence bandwidth leads to excessive number of pilots. We leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately estimate frequency selective channels with few pilots at low SNR. The proposed estimator first learns to produce channel samples from the true but unknown channel distribution via training the generative network, and then uses this trained network as a prior to estimate the current channel by optimizing the network's input vector in light of the current received signal. Our results show that at an SNR of -5 dB, even if a transceiver with one-bit phase shifters is employed, our design achieves the same channel estimation error as an LS estimator with SNR = 20 dB or the LMMSE estimator at 2.5 dB, both with fully digital architectures. Additionally, the GAN-based estimator reduces the required number of pilots by about 70% without significantly increasing the estimation error and required SNR. We also show that the generative network does not appear to require retraining even if the number of clusters and rays change considerably.}

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with slicing a radio access network (RAN) for simultaneously serving two 5G-and-Beyond typical use cases, i.e., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). Although many researches have been conducted to tackle this issue, few of them have considered the impact of bursty URLLC. The bursty characteristic of URLLC traffic may significantly increase the difficulty of RAN slicing in terms of ensuring an ultra-low packet blocking probability. To reduce the probability, we re-visit the structure of physical resource blocks orchestrated for URLLC traffic based on theoretical results. Meanwhile, we formulate the problem of slicing a RAN enabling coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmissions for multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC service multiplexing as a multi-timescale optimization problem aiming at maximizing eMBB and URLLC slice utilities, subject to physical resource constraints. To mitigate this problem, we transform it into multiple single timescale problems by exploring sample average approximations. An iterative algorithm with provable performance guarantees is developed to obtain solutions to these single timescale problems and aggregate obtained solutions into those of the multi-timescale problem. We also design a CoMP-enabled RAN slicing system prototype and compare the iterative algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithm to verify its effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) is a promising solution for powering massive Internet of Things deployments. An important question is whether the costly Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition procedure is necessary for optimum performance. In this paper, we shed some light into this matter by evaluating CSI-based and CSI-free multi-antenna WET schemes in a setup with WET in the downlink, and periodic or Poisson-traffic Wireless Information Transfer (WIT) in the uplink. When CSI is available, we show that a maximum ratio transmission beamformer is close to optimum whenever the farthest node experiences at least 3 dB of power attenuation more than the remaining devices. On the other hand, although the adopted CSI-free mechanism is not capable of providing average harvesting gains, it does provide greater WET/WIT diversity with lower energy requirements when compared with the CSI-based scheme. Our numerical results evidence that the CSI-free scheme performs favorably under periodic traffic conditions, but it may be deficient in case of Poisson traffic, specially if the setup is not optimally configured. Finally, we show the prominent performance results when the uplink transmissions are periodic, while highlighting the need of a minimum mean square error equalizer rather than zero-forcing for information decoding.}

To improve information freshness over fading channels, efficient scheduling methods are highly desired for wireless transmissions. However, due to the channel instability and arrival randomness, optimizing AoI is very challenging. In this paper, we are interested in the AoI-optimal transmissions with rate-adaptive transmission schemes in a buffer-aware system. More specifically, we utilize a probabilistic scheduling method to minimize the AoI while satisfying an average power constraint. By characterizing the probabilistic scheduling policy with a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), we formulate a Linear Programming (LP) problem. Further, a low complexity algorithm is presented to obtain the optimal scheduling policy, which is proved to belong to a set of semi-threshold-based policies. Numerical results verify the reduction in computational complexity and the optimality of semi-threshold-based policy, which indicates that we can achieve well real-time service with a low computational complexity.}

Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as distinctly important integrated components to extend services coverage. In order to provide users with higher and satisfied quality of services, edge computing resources need to be allocated between edge computing stations (ECSs) and UAVs in mobile networks. However, there are significant security and privacy problems due to the open environments of ECSs and UAVs. In this paper, we propose a resource pricing and trading scheme based on Stackelberg dynamic game to optimally allocate edge computing resources between ECSs and UAVs, and blockchain technology is applied to record the entire resources trading process to protect the security and privacy. The ECSs control the resources price of the allocated edge computing resources, where the UAVs follow the price announced by the ECSs and make optimal decisions on the edge computing resources demands. Blockchain is integrated in the resource trading process to ensure the security and privacy. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is one viable solution to support Gbps sensor data sharing in vehicular networks. The use of large antenna arrays at mmWave and high mobility in vehicular communication make it challenging to design fast beam alignment solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns the channel angle-of-departure (AoD) statistics at a base station (BS) and uses this information to efficiently acquire channel measurements. Our framework integrates online learning for compressive sensing (CS) codebook learning and the optimized codebook is used for CS-based beam alignment. We formulate a CS matrix optimization problem based on the AoD statistics available at the BS. Furthermore, based on the CS channel measurements, we develop techniques to update and learn such channel AoD statistics at the BS. We use the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to learn the AoD statistics and the CS matrix. Numerical results show that the CS matrix in the proposed framework provides faster beam alignment than standard CS matrix designs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed beam training technique can reduce overhead by 80% compared to exhaustive beam search, and 70% compared to standard CS solutions that do not exploit any AoD statistics.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology to achieve spectrum-, energy-, and cost-efficient wireless networks. This paper considers an RIS-assisted downlink non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) system. To optimize the rate performance and ensure user fairness, we maximize the minimum decoding signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (equivalently the rate) of all users, by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and the phase shifts (i.e., passive beamforming) at the RIS. A combined-channel-strength based user-ordering scheme for NOMA decoding is first proposed to decouple the user-ordering design and the joint beamforming design. Efficient algorithms are further proposed to solve the non-convex problem, by leveraging the block coordinated descent and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. For the single-antenna BS setup, the optimal power allocation at the BS and the asymptotically optimal phase shifts at the RIS are obtained in closed forms. For the multiple-antenna BS setup, it is shown that the rank of the SDR solution of the transmit beamforming design is upper bounded by two. Also, the proposed algorithms are analyzed in terms of convergence and complexity. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted NOMA system can enhance the rate performance significantly, compared to traditional NOMA without RIS and traditional orthogonal multiple access with/without RIS.}

The traditional MUSIC-based algorithms can estimate either the DOA and polarization for circular signals or the DOA for non-circular signals by using spectrum search. By contrast, based on the quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion non-circular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed for parameter estimation of non-circular signals with high estimation accuracy. Moreover, only the DOA estimation needs spectrum search, and the polarization estimation has a closed-form expression. First, the DOA estimation can be achieved based on the derivation principle. Then the closed-form expression of the polarization estimation can be obtained based on the chain rule of the derivation w.r.t. the polarization parameters. In addition, the computational complexity analysis shows that compared with the conventional DOA and polarization estimation algorithms, our proposed QNC-MUSIC has much lower computational complexity, especially when the source number is large. The stochastic Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the 2-D DOA and polarization parameters of the non-circular signals is derived as well. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve the parameter estimation performance when large-scale/massive MIMO systems are employed.}

	abstract = {In this article, a new relay-aided secure communication system is investigated, where a transmitter sends signals to a destination via an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay in the presence of an eavesdropper. We consider a general system configuration, where the source, relay, destination, and eavesdropper are all equipped with multiple antennas. In the practical scenarios of unknown eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and uncertainty of the eavesdropper's location, we aim to maximize the expected value of the system secrecy rate over the presumed distribution of the eavesdropper's channels, by exploiting the artificial noise (AN) transmitted by the source and relay nodes. The system design issue is formulated as a nonconvex stochastic optimization problem with a source transmission power constraint and a nonconvex relay transmission power constraint. A novel computational method is proposed to solve this challenging problem. The new method is developed based on an exact penalty function method together with a parallel stochastic decomposition algorithm. Numerical simulations are performed to study the effectiveness of the proposed scheme at various locations of the eavesdropper. Simulation results show that for most cases, secure communication can be achieved without the CSI knowledge of eavesdropper's channels, and the achievable secrecy rate follows the trend of a benchmark system where the eavesdropper's full CSI is available. In particular, the achievable system secrecy rate increases with the number of antennas at the legitimate users. Moreover, the optimal power allocated for the transmission of the AN increases with the system signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed computational method achieves a higher system secrecy rate than a conventional penalty function based approach.}

To describe the non-stationarity of multi-mobility V2X channels, the proposed model employs a time-varying acceleration model and a random walk process to describe the motion of the communication terminals and that of the scattering clusters, respectively. The evolution of the model parameters over time and the stochastic characteristics of the phase shift caused by the time-varying Doppler frequency are derived. The proposed model is sufficiently general and suitable for characterizing various V2X communication scenarios. Under two-dimensional (2D) non-isotropic scattering scenarios, the important channel statistical properties of the proposed model are derived and thoroughly investigated. The impact of the random walk process of the clusters and the velocity variations of the communication terminals on these statistical properties is studied. The simulation results verify that the proposed model is useful for characterizing V2X channels.}

	abstract = {The notion of age-of-information (AoI) is investigated in the context of large-scale wireless networks, in which transmitters need to send a sequence of information packets, which are generated as independent Bernoulli processes, to their intended receivers over a shared spectrum. Due to interference, the rate of packet depletion at any given node is entangled with both the spatial configurations, which determine the path loss, and temporal dynamics, which influence the active states, of the other transmitters, resulting in the queues to interact with each other in both space and time over the entire network. To that end, variants in the packet update frequency affect not just the inter-arrival time but also the departure process, and the impact of such phenomena on the AoI is not well understood. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework to characterize the AoI performance in the aforementioned setting. Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for both the peak and average AoI under two different transmission protocols, namely the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and the last-come-first-serve with preemption (LCFS-PR). Additionally, our analysis also accounts for the effects of channel access controls such as ALOHA on the AoI. The accuracy of the analysis is verified via simulations, and based on the theoretical outcomes, we find that: i) networks operating under LCFS-PR are able to attain smaller values of peak and average AoI than that under FCFS, whereas the gain is more pronounced when the infrastructure is densely deployed, ii) in sparsely deployed networks, ALOHA with a universally designed channel access probability is not instrumental in reducing the AoI, thus calling for more advanced channel access approaches, and iii) when the infrastructure is densely rolled out, there exists a non-trivial ALOHA channel access probability that minimizes the peak and average AoI under both FCFS and LCFS-PR.}

In this paper, we propose an efficient downlink channel characterization scheme based on passive sounding in sub-6 GHz 5G commercial network. We first introduce the framework of passive sounding system containing a space-time-division multiplexing (STDM) sounder. Then we elaborate the extraction procedure for 5G downlink signals including synchronization signal block (SSB) and channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) according to New Radio (NR) technical specifications proposed by 3GPP. Through a pilot test in the anechoic chamber, we also demonstrate the practice of signal extraction. Besides, we derive a dual-polarimetric space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm which matches with the passive sounding system for multi-dimensional channel parameter estimation. The estimator performance is analyzed by synthetic channel simulation, and results reveal its high accuracy and robustness. Finally, we verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme through analyzing channel characteristics derived from passive sounding in stationary field measurements respectively conducted in industrial park and parking lot with the 5G commercial network built by China Unicom Communications Corporation (CUCC).}

The shape and size of cells vary from BS to BS, since the large-scale signal propagation conditions differ in different geographical regions. This work proposes and studies a joint spatial-propagation (JSP) model, which considers the correlation between cell radii and the large-scale signal propagation (captured by shadowing). We first introduce the notion of the directional radius of Voronoi cells, which has applications in cellular networks and beyond. The directional radius of a cell is defined as the distance from the nucleus to the cell boundary at an angle relative to the direction of a uniformly random location in the cell. We study the distribution of the radii in two types of cells in the Poisson Voronoi tessellations: the zero-cell, which contains the origin, and the typical cell. The results are applied to analyze the JSP model. We show that, even though the Poisson point process (PPP) is often considered as a pessimistic spatial model for BS locations, the JSP model with the PPP achieves coverage performance close to the most optimistic one-the standard triangular lattice model. Further, we show that the network performance depends critically on the variance of the large-scale path loss along the cell boundary.}

Prior to UD localization, signal propagation model (SPM) is required to calibrate using training samples from a number of location grids. However, SPM usually suffers from measurement noise and inevitable error in calibration grid (CG) locations. This will significantly degrade UD localization performance. Nevertheless, the impact of CG location error, CG layout and the number of CGs on SPM calibration performance has not been characterized. Furthermore, the effect of SPM calibration error on UD localization performance has not been developed. In this paper, we aim to provide a unified framework for performance analysis of SPM calibration and UD localization. Firstly, we establish a closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bound on SPM calibration error and UD localization error, respectively. Secondly, the impact of measurement noise, CG location error and the number of CGs on SPM calibration performance is revealed. Thirdly, the influence of SPM calibration error, CG location error and measurement noise on UD localization performance is studied. The effect of modeling mismatch is also studied.

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a promising way to build the programmable wireless transmission environments in the future. Owing to the large number of reflecting elements used at the RIS, joint optimization for the active beamforming at the transmitter and the passive reflector at the RIS is usually complicated and time-consuming. To address this problem, this article proposes a low-complexity joint beamforming and reflecting algorithm based on fractional programing (FP). Specifically, we first consider a RIS-aided multi-user communication system with perfect channel state information (CSI) and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of all users. Since the problem is nonconvex, we decompose the original problem into three disjoint subproblems. By introducing favorable auxiliary variables, we derive the closed-form expressions of the beamforming vectors and reflecting matrix in each subproblem, leading to a joint beamforming and reflecting algorithm with low complexity. We then extend our approach to handle the case when transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels are not perfect and develop corresponding low-complexity joint beamforming and reflecting algorithm with practical channel estimation. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms as compared to various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Charging scheduling plays a significant role in wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), which benefit from stable and reliable energy supplements via wireless charging. This paper proposes an importance-different charging scheduling (IDCS) strategy for improving charging utility as well as reducing the data loss. The unique feature of IDCS is that, it distinguishes nodes by means of different importance of data delivery. The Matroid theory is used to achieve our goals. First, two important factors are determined in the Matroid model, i.e., the deadline of the task and the penalty value of the task. Moreover, a greedy algorithm of task classification is designed to minimize the data loss. All tasks are divided into the early tasks and the delayed tasks, and the node with greater importance and shorter deadline has a higher priority of being included into the early tasks. In addition, a charging sequence adjustment approach is proposed to maximize the charging utility. This approach aims to exchange the sequence of different nodes in the trajectory of the mobile charger for exploring a shorter path. Several simulations verified the effectiveness and advantages of our charging scheduling strategy in terms of the node failure rate and total data loss.}

We show that, with an appropriate design of the metaprism, it is possible to control that each data stream in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is reflected in the desired direction by properly assigning subcarriers to users without the need of control channels and dedicated channel state information (CSI) estimation schemes. Furthermore, the metaprism can also be designed so that it focuses the signal towards a specific position depending on the subcarrier, provided that the user is in the near-field region of the metaprism, with consequent path-loss reduction. A critical discussion is also presented about the path-loss reduction obtainable from metaprisms and, more generally, from metasurfaces. The numerical results show that this solution is effective in extending the coverage in areas experiencing severe non line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions, thus making it an interesting alternative to reconfigurable metasurfaces when low-cost, no energy consumption, and backward compatibility with existing wireless standards are required.}

	abstract = {This article proposes an opportunistic scheduling scheme based on adaptive modulation for users in a mixed noise environment, where some users are under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and other users are exposed to impulsive noise. Unlike the scenario, where all the users are in an AWGN environment, the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scheduler does not provide the maximum capacity if users are in a mixed noise environment. In the proposed scheduling scheme, called maximum rate scheduler, the user with the highest rate (or highest modulation order), instead of highest SNR, is selected. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduling scheme, the analyses of average spectral efficiency, outage probability and system capacity are provided along with a simple calculation of SNR thresholds for adaptive modulation in an impulsive noise environment satisfying target symbol error rate (SER). Simulation results illustrate that system capacity with the proposed scheduling given target SER = 10 -2 and the average spectral efficiency are improved by 156% and 124%, respectively, at SNR = 5 dB when a strong impulsive noise is present.}

	abstract = {Spoofing attacks pose a serious threat to wireless communications. Exploiting physical-layer features to counter spoofing attacks is a promising solution. Although various physical-layer spoofing attack detection (PL-SAD) techniques have been proposed for conventional 802.11 networks in the sub-6GHz band, the study of PL-SAD for 802.11ad networks in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) 60GHz band is largely open. In this paper, to achieve efficient PL-SAD in 5G networks, we propose a unique physical layer feature in IEEE 802.11ad networks, i.e., the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) trace obtained at the receiver in the sector level sweep (SLS) process. The SNR trace is readily extractable from the off-the-shelf device, and it is dependent on both transmitter location and intrinsic hardware impairment. Therefore, it can be used to achieve an efficient detection no matter the attacker is co-located with the legitimate transmitter or not. To achieve spoofing attack detection, we provide two methods based on different machine learning models. For the first method, the detection problem is formulated as a machine learning classification problem. To tackle the small sample learning and fast model construction challenges, we propose a novel neural network framework consisting of a backpropation network, a forward propagation network, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Another method involves a Siamese network, in which the similarity between sample pairs from one device is used to achieve PL-SAD. It can tackle the training problem that the historical data cannot support the identification of the same device in a new communication session. We conduct experiments using off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices, Talon AD7200s and MG360, to evaluate the performance of the proposed PL-SAD schemes. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PL-SAD schemes, and the detection accuracy can reach 99% using small sample sizes under different scenarios.}

	abstract = {Multi-path TCP (MPTCP) is increasingly popular with the widespread usage of multihomed devices. MPTCP allows data streams to be delivered across multiple simultaneous connections, providing higher bandwidth aggregation and throughput in comparison with single-path TCP. However, due to the path heterogeneity and packet losses, the occurrence of Out-of-Order (OFO) packets is inevitable for MPTCP. Although many approaches have been proposed to mitigate OFO, most of them focused on compensating path delay differences but not considered the impact of packet loss. In this paper, we take the first step towards analyzing the impact of packet loss on OFO, and propose Loss-Aware Throughput Estimation scheduler, LATE. LATE comprehensively considers each subflow's path characteristics and protocol parameters including Round Trip Time (RTT), congestion window (cwnd), and loss rate, to predict the data amount that can be sent over each subflow at a given time and determine wisely which segments should be allocated to which subflows. Experimental results show that LATE achieves a gain of 5.13% in mean goodput with long-lasting flows while reducing the completion time of short flows by about 26.68% compared to the state-of-the-art scheduler for MPTCP.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned to create ultra-secure wireless networks. Previous works on the RIS-assisted security provisioning techniques assumed wiretap channel information at the transmitter, which is practically unavailable in a passive eavesdropping scenario. In this article, we consider a point-to-point anti-eavesdropping system in which a RIS is used to enable the secure transmission from a multi-antenna transmitter to a multi-antenna legitimate receiver. A passive eavesdropper, whose channel state information is completely unknown, attempts to decode the secret messages. We propose a security approach by using the reflection at the RIS as multiplicative randomness against the wiretapper. Specifically, the reflection coefficients in terms of amplitude and phase are updated in each transmission and kept private at the RIS. Through the reflection designs, the effective channel matrix is diagonalized at the legitimate receiver. In contrast, the eavesdropper receives coupled signals with the weights of the randomness at RIS. The main contributions of this article are three reflection designs and correspondingly three secure transmission schemes, which fulfills diverse requirements of the balance amongst performance metrics including the degrees of randomness, spectral efficiency, and reliability. The main benefits of the proposed secure transmission schemes are four-fold. First, the transmitter does not need to know the eavesdropper's channel states. Second, closed-form solutions for the reflection coefficients are provided. Third, the legitimate receiver has a linear decoding complexity. Fourth, the unauthorized wiretapper is unable to cancel out the multiplicative randomness and thus cannot extract much useful information. Numerical results show that exploiting the RIS as a source of multiplicative randomness provides a new perspective to improve the security of the wireless networks.}

	abstract = {Cyclic block filtered multi-tone (CB-FMT) is a waveform that can be efficiently synthesized through a filter-bank in the frequency domain. Although the main principles have been already established, channel estimation has not been addressed yet. This is because of assuming that the existing techniques based on pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM), implemented in OFDM-like schemes, can be reused. However, PSAM leads to an undesirable loss of data-rate. In this paper, an alternative method inspired by the superimposed training (ST) concept, namely pilot pouring ST (PPST), is proposed. In PPST, pilots are superimposed over data taking advantage of the particular spectral characteristics of CB-FMT. Exploiting the sub-channel spectrum, the pilot symbols are poured in those resources unused for data transmission. This spectral shaping of pilots is also exploited at the receiver to carry out channel estimation, by enhancing those channel estimates that exhibit a low data interference contribution. Furthermore, a frequency domain resource mapping strategy for the data and poured pilot symbols is proposed to enable an accurate estimation in strongly frequency-selective channels. The parameters of the proposed scheme are optimized to minimize the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE). Finally, several numerical results illustrate the performance advantages of the proposed technique as compared to other alternatives.}

We propose novel uplink and downlink precoding and detection schemes that lower the decoding complexity at the receiver by decomposing the MIMO-NOMA channels of the users into multiple single-input single-output (SISO)-NOMA channels via simultaneous triangularization (ST) of the MIMO channels of the users and low-complexity self-interference cancellation at the receivers. The proposed ST MIMO-NOMA schemes avoid channel inversion at transmitter and receiver and take advantage of the null spaces of the MIMO channels of the users, which is beneficial for the ergodic achievable rate performance. We characterize the maximum ergodic achievable rate regions of the proposed uplink and downlink ST MIMO-NOMA schemes, and compare them with respective upper bounds, baseline MIMO-NOMA schemes, and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Our results illustrate that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the considered baseline MIMO-NOMA schemes and OMA, and have a small gap to the respective upper bounds for most channel conditions and user rates. Moreover, we show that a hybrid scheme, which performs time sharing between the proposed uplink and downlink ST MIMO-NOMA and single-user MIMO, can improve performance even further.}

	abstract = {We propose a decentralized caching policy for wireless heterogeneous networks that makes content placement decisions based on pairwise interactions between cache nodes. We call our proposed scheme γ-exclusion cache placement (GEC), where a parameter γ controls an exclusion radius that discourages nearby caches from storing redundant content. GEC takes into account item popularity and the nodes' caching priorities and leverages negative dependence to relax the classic 0-1 knapsack problem to yield spatially balanced sampling across caches. We show that GEC guarantees a better concentration (reduced variance) of the required cache storage size than the state of the art, and that the cache size constraints can be satisfied with high probability. Given a cache hit probability target, we compare the 95% confidence intervals of the required cache sizes for three caching schemes: (i) independent placement, (ii) hard exclusion caching (HEC), and (iii) the proposed GEC approach. For uniform spatial traffic, we demonstrate that GEC provides approximately a 3x and 2x reduction in required cache size over (i) and (ii), respectively. For non-uniform spatial traffic based on realistic peak-hour variations in urban scenarios, the gains are even greater.}

Due to hardware characteristics and connecting structures, millimeter-wave communication systems may experience device faults which result in performance degradation or even failure. Therefore, system diagnosis techniques for fault detection and localization are essential to system monitoring and maintenance. In this paper, two compressed sensing based diagnosis techniques are proposed, which can jointly detect and locate faulty antennas, phase shifters, and RF chains. The first technique is applicable to the diagnosis in a multipath-free environment where the channel state information can be obtained based on spatial coordinates. Furthermore, we propose the second technique that does not require the channel state information, which is suitable for outdoor online diagnosis in a multipath scattering environment. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed techniques can jointly detect all faulty devices with high probability.}

	abstract = {With numerous ongoing deployments owned by private companies and startups, dense satellite constellations deployed in low Earth orbit (LEO) will play a major role in the near future of wireless communications. In addition, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has ongoing efforts to integrate satellites into 5G and beyond-5G networks. Nevertheless, numerous challenges must be overcome to fully exploit the connectivity capabilities of satellite constellations. These challenges are mainly a consequence of the low capabilities of individual small satellites, along with their high orbital speeds and small coverage due to the low altitude of deployment. In particular, inter-plane inter-satellite links (ISLs), which connect satellites from different orbital planes, are greatly dynamic and may be considerably affected by the Doppler shift. In this paper, we present a framework and the corresponding algorithms for the dynamic establishment of the inter-plane ISLs in LEO constellations. Our results show that the proposed algorithms increase the sum of rates in the constellation 1) by up to 115% with respect to the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in an interference-free environment and 2) by up to 71% when compared to random resource allocation in a worst-case scenario for interference.}

To further enhance the channel estimation performance, we consider an angular-domain channel model and introduce a hybrid approach (referred to as 1bLR-RELAX), which combines 1bMM-LR with an existing parametric algorithm called 1bRELAX, to recover the angular-domain channel parameters.

The key idea is to backscatter the surplus power of the received downlink signals at one user to enhance the reception of the user who cannot recover its information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed BC-NOMA scheme, three benchmark schemes are introduced, which include the non-cooperation (NC)-NOMA scheme, the conventional relaying (CR)-NOMA scheme, and the incremental relaying (IR)-NOMA scheme. For all these schemes, the outage performance, the expected rate, and the diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) performance are analyzed. Additionally, the optimal power allocation to maximize the expected rate of the BC-NOMA scheme in the high signal-to-noise ratio region is derived. The theoretical results show that the proposed BC-NOMA can enhance both transmission reliability (outage performance) and transmission effectiveness (expected rate) compared with NC-NOMA. Furthermore, representative numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical results. It is shown that unlike the two relaying-based cooperative schemes (CR/IR-NOMA), which improve the outage performance at the cost of transmission rate, the proposed BC-NOMA scheme can enhance the transmission reliability without impairing the spectrum efficiency, which makes backscattering an appealing solution to cooperative NOMA downlinks.}

In this work, we employ the tools of stochastic geometry and queuing theory as well as rely on 3GPP cluster-based propagation modeling to formulate a mathematical framework, which captures session-level service dynamics of user equipment (UE) that supports multi-band operation. Accordingly, the sub-6 GHz NR base station (BS) is used to temporarily serve the sessions with strict throughput requirements that experience an outage at the mmWave NR BSs. We derive user- and system-centric key performance indicators, including new and ongoing session drop probabilities as well as radio resource utilization. Our numerical results confirm that the use of microwave BSs to serve mmWave sessions is only feasible in light traffic conditions. Particularly, the presence of throughput-hungry mmWave traffic increases the session drop probability at the sub-6 GHz band as well as decreases its utilization. Further, the support of sub-6 GHz radio may not improve the mmWave BS resource utilization, as many mmWave sessions are dropped during their service as a consequence of frequent blockage-induced outage situations.}

	abstract = {In high-speed optical wireless communication (OWC) systems, timing errors can blur the edges of the received symbols, defined by the deviation of a signal’s timing event from its intended occurrence. The timing errors introduce the inter-symbol interference (ISI) to the neighboring symbols. In order to mitigate the degradation, a maximum likelihood (ML) based Timing Error Viterbi Equalization (TEVE) algorithm is proposed, in which the probability density functions (PDF) of the channel conditions and the timing errors are priori information. The mathematical form of each branch metric (BM) is deduced by those statistics in different situations of neighboring signs of timing errors. The summations of BMs form the cumulative metrics (CM). By adopting the add-compare-select iterations, we are able to detect symbols with the largest CMs. The theoretical closed-form average bit error rates (BER) are also deduced and compared in the cases whether the TEVE algorithm is utilized. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method can reduce timing errors’ impairment significantly with an acceptable complexity.}

	abstract = {We propose a mechanism for distributed resource management and interference mitigation in wireless networks using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL). We equip each transmitter in the network with a deep RL agent that receives delayed observations from its associated users, while also exchanging observations with its neighboring agents, and decides on which user to serve and what transmit power to use at each scheduling interval. Our proposed framework enables agents to make decisions simultaneously and in a distributed manner, unaware of the concurrent decisions of other agents. Moreover, our design of the agents’ observation and action spaces is scalable, in the sense that an agent trained on a scenario with a specific number of transmitters and users can be applied to scenarios with different numbers of transmitters and/or users. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to decentralized baselines in terms of the tradeoff between average and 5 th percentile user rates, while achieving performance close to, and even in certain cases outperforming, that of a centralized information-theoretic baseline. We also show that our trained agents are robust and maintain their performance gains when experiencing mismatches between train and test deployments.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate online learning-based MIMO-OFDM symbol detection strategies focusing on a special recurrent neural network (RNN) - reservoir computing (RC). We first introduce the Time-Frequency RC to take advantage of the structural information inherent in OFDM signals. Using the time domain RC and the time-frequency RC as building blocks, we provide two extensions of the shallow RC to RCNet: 1) Stacking multiple time domain RCs; 2) Stacking multiple time-frequency RCs into a deep structure. The combination of RNN dynamics, the time-frequency structure of MIMO-OFDM signals, and the deep network enables RCNet to handle the interference and nonlinear distortion of MIMO-OFDM signals to outperform existing methods. Unlike most existing NN-based detection strategies, RCNet is also shown to provide a good generalization performance even with a limited online training set (i.e, similar amount of reference signals/training as standard model-based approaches). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the introduced RCNet can offer a faster learning convergence and as much as 20% gain in bit error rate over a shallow RC structure by compensating for the nonlinear distortion of the MIMO-OFDM signal, such as due to power amplifier compression in the transmitter or due to finite quantization resolution in the receiver.}

The proposed 3D point process is devised based on a 2D marked Poisson point process in which each point and its random mark uniquely correspond to the projection and the altitude of each point in the 3D point process, respectively. We study some of the important statistical properties of the proposed 3D point process and shed light on some crucial insights into them that facilitate the analyses of a UAV-enabled cellular network wherein all UAVs equipped with multiple antennas are deployed by the proposed 3D point process to serve as aerial base stations. The salient features of the proposed 3D point process lie in its suitability in practical 3D channel modeling and tractability in analysis. The downlink coverages of the UAV-enabled cellular network are found and their closed-form results for some special cases are also derived. Most importantly, their fundamental limits achieved by cell-free massive antenna array are characterized when coordinating all the UAVs to jointly perform non-coherent downlink transmission. These key findings and observations are numerically validated in this paper.}

Existing computation offloading schemes usually neglected time-varying characteristics of channels and their corresponding secrecy rates, resulting in an inappropriate task partition ratio and a large secrecy outage probability. To address these issues, we utilize an ergodic secrecy rate to determine how many tasks are offloaded to the edge, where ergodic secrecy rate represents the average secrecy rate over all realizations in a time-varying wireless channel. Adaptive wiretap code rates are proposed with a secrecy outage constraint to match time-varying wireless channels. In addition, the proposed secure beamforming and artificial noise (AN) schemes can improve the ergodic secrecy rates of uplink and downlink channels even without eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes have a shorter system delay than the strategies neglecting time-varying characteristics.}

In this paper, we investigate the possibility to infer the position of a single antenna transmitter using a single asynchronous receiving node by retrieving information from the incident spherical wavefront. To this end, we consider the adoption of a suitable mix of processing at electromagnetic (EM) and signal levels, as a lower complexity alternative to classical massive array systems where the processing is done entirely at signal level. Thus, we first introduce a dedicated general model for different EM processing architectures, entailing the use or not of a lens that can have either a reconfigurable or a fixed phase profile, and successively we investigate their attainable positioning performance. The effect of the interference is also investigated to evaluate the robustness of the considered system to the presence of multiple simultaneous transmitting sources. Results, obtained for different apertures of the exploited lens/array, confirm the possibility to achieve interesting positioning performance using a single antenna array with a limited aperture.}

	abstract = {Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a critical algorithm for the identification of modulation types so as to enable more accurate demodulation in the non-cooperative scenarios. Deep learning (DL)-based AMC is believed as one of the most promising methods with great classification accuracy. However, the conventional CNN-based methods are lack of generality capabilities under time-varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, because these methods are merely trained on specific datasets and can only work under the corresponding condition. In this paper, a novel multi-task learning (MTL)-based generalized AMC method is proposed, and a more realistic scenario is considered, including white non-Gaussian noise and synchronization error. Its generalization capability stems from knowledge-sharing-based MTL in varying noise scenarios. In detail, multiple CNN models with the same structure are trained for multiple SNR conditions, but they share their knowledge (e.g. model weight) with each other. Thus, MTL can extract the general features from datasets in different noise scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed architecture can achieve higher robustness and generalization than the conventional ones.}

The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated in terms of outage and symbol error probability in Rician fading channels, where closed-form expressions are derived and demonstrated to be accurate for several cases of interest. The analytical results corroborated by simulation, show that the IRS-mesh backhauling architecture has several desired features that can be exploited to overcome some of the backhauling challenges, particularly the severe attenuation at high frequencies. For example, using IRS with four elements, N=4, provides a symbol error rate of about 10 -5 at a signal-to-noise ratio of about 0 dB, even for a large number of hops. Moreover, the obtained analytical results corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation show that the gain obtained by increasing N decreases significantly for N > 5. For example, increasing N from 1 to 2 provides about 8dB of gain, while the increase from 3 to 4 provides about 4dB. Moreover, the degradation caused by the relaying process becomes negligible when the number of IRS elements N= 3.}

Particularly, we propose the continuous connection probability over at least τ seconds, termed as τ-connectivity, for the ground-centric link and aircraft-centric link respectively, which are derived in the expression of several key parameters such as the aircraft/ground station density, the aircraft velocity, and the connectable elevation angle threshold. Theoretical tradeoff between ergodic outage capacity and the number of connected aircraft is analyzed for low and high transmit power regimes. The hypotheses in the ground-centric τ-connectivity model are tested, and we observe a good match between the theoretic probability and the real world data-based probability although some real world aircraft statistic characters do not match the ideal assumption perfectly. Next, the aircraft-centric τ-connectivity is analyzed theoretically. Approximate yet practically accurate closed form aircraft-centric connection probabilities are derived and verified with Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, considering atmospheric gas and cloud attenuation, we compare the link budget and capacity between the ground-centric ground-to-aircraft link and the ground-to-satellite link under the τ-connectivity and demonstrate the advantage of ground-aircraft communication.}

	abstract = {Transfer learning algorithms (TLAs) are often used to solve the distribution discrepancy issue in fingerprint-based indoor localization. However, existing TLAs cannot react well to real time changes in the environmental dynamics of the target space due to three remarkable shortcomings: a) redundant knowledge in source domain may lead to “negative transfer”; b) the required target domain samples to calculate the distributions are unrealistically feasible for real-time positioning; c) they cannot transfer knowledge efficiently across domains with heterogeneous feature spaces. In this paper, we propose TransLoc, a heterogeneous knowledge transfer framework for fingerprint-based indoor localization, which can perform knowledge transfer efficiently even with only one sample in the target domain. Specifically, we first refine the source domain according to the target domain by removing redundant knowledge in the source domain. Then, we derive a cross-domain mapping, which transfers the specific knowledge of one domain to another domain, to construct a homogeneous feature space. In this new feature space, the transfer weights are computed for training a classifier for target location prediction. To further train the framework efficiently, we combine the mapping and weights learning into a joint objective function and solve it by a three-step iterative optimization algorithm. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results verify that TransLoc not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but is also very robust to changing environment.}

	abstract = {We study federated learning (FL) at the wireless edge, where power-limited devices with local datasets collaboratively train a joint model with the help of a remote parameter server (PS). We assume that the devices are connected to the PS through a bandwidth-limited shared wireless channel. At each iteration of FL, a subset of the devices are scheduled to transmit their local model updates to the PS over orthogonal channel resources, while each participating device must compress its model update to accommodate to its link capacity. We design novel scheduling and resource allocation policies that decide on the subset of the devices to transmit at each round, and how the resources should be allocated among the participating devices, not only based on their channel conditions, but also on the significance of their local model updates. We then establish convergence of a wireless FL algorithm with device scheduling, where devices have limited capacity to convey their messages. The results of numerical experiments show that the proposed scheduling policy, based on both the channel conditions and the significance of the local model updates, provides a better long-term performance than scheduling policies based only on either of the two metrics individually. Furthermore, we observe that when the data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across devices, selecting a single device at each round provides the best performance, while when the data distribution is non-i.i.d., scheduling multiple devices at each round improves the performance. This observation is verified by the convergence result, which shows that the number of scheduled devices should increase for a less diverse and more biased data distribution.}

Specifically, we firstly analyze the distribution characteristics of demodulated OQAM symbols at the receiver, and derive an intrinsic interference free relation between the real and imaginary parts of demodulated OQAM symbols. Then, based on the above derivation, we design a pilot structure of arbitrary columns of pilot symbols without guard symbols between pilot symbols and data symbols. Finally, the distribution lines can be fitted by utilizing the distribution characteristics of demodulated OQAM symbols and the channel frequency response can be estimated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method with one column of pilot symbols outperforms the interference approximation method (IAM) in high signal-to-noise (SNR) regions and outperforms the pair of pilots (POP) method in all SNR regions in terms of bit error ratio (BER), and the proposed method with two columns of pilot symbols outperforms both IAM and POP in all SNR regions in terms of both BER and complexity.}

The system cost includes the cost of UEs' power consumption and the penalty of unaccomplished tasks, and the system cost is minimized by jointly optimizing binary offloading decisions, the computational frequencies, and the offloading transmit power. To solve the formulated mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, three efficient algorithms are proposed, i.e., integer constraints relaxation-based iterative algorithm (ICRBI), heuristic matching algorithm, and the decentralized algorithm. The ICRBI algorithm achieves the best performance at the cost of the highest complexity, while the heuristic matching algorithm significantly reduces the complexity while still providing reasonable performance. As the previous two algorithms are centralized, the decentralized algorithm is also provided to further reduce the complexity, and it is suitable for the scenarios that cannot provide the central controller. The simulation results are provided to validate the performance gain in terms of the total system cost obtained by the proposed cooperative computation framework.}

	abstract = {To satisfy future wireless network's requirements of huge capacity, ultra low delay and supermassive connectivity, it is urgent to study novel wireless communication network architecture and technology. Fog-computing radio access network (F-RAN) is a newly developed network paradigm, in which the edge devices perform the storage, communication, control, configuration and management. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered to be a hopeful multiple access mechanism for future radio access networks (RANs). The distinctive feature of NOMA is to assign the same channel for various users simultaneously by utilizing the power domain. With the deployment of NOMA, F-RAN can further promote system throughput, time latency, access capability and spectrum efficiency. The coordination between NOMA and F-RAN provides powerful support to extensive application of augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), vehicular networking, intelligent medical and other emerging applications. In this paper, we focus on a noncooperative game resource optimization to decrease the complexity while the dynamic optimization problem is decoupled to subchannel assignment and power allocation. Matching theory is applied to propose a subchannel assignment scheme. Then, we convert and decouple the power allocation problem into three subproblems and solve them separately at each slot. Simulation results illustrate the potency of the proposed noncooperative resource allocation scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the hybrid precoding design with quantized phase shifters (PSs) for full-duplex millimeter-wave relaying systems, in which the relay node is equipped with PSs of different resolution levels. The joint optimization of relay hybrid precoding and discrete PSs is a high-dimensional non-convex problem with both higher-order polynomial and modulus constraints. To solve this challenging problem, the optimization function under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) is reformulated into a low-complexity norm-minimization form equation. Then, a relaxed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers and quantization steps is proposed to obtain the coupling approximate solutions for the above optimized equation. And the optimality of analytical solutions is guaranteed based on the imposed termination criterion and necessary conditions. Furthermore, given the requirement of arbitrary quantization, the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) is investigated under the imperfect CSI. Numerical results verify that the hybrid precoding with low-resolution PSs can achieve excellent SE close to the full-resolution one but with a considerably lighter burden of energy consumption. Moreover, the transmission power plays a positive role in compensating quantization loss, but the excessive value will bring the reduction of EE.}

	abstract = {We investigate the performance of multi-user multiple-antenna downlink systems in which a base station (BS) serves multiple users via a shared wireless medium. In order to fully exploit the spatial diversity while minimizing the passive energy consumed by radio frequency (RF) components, the BS is equipped with $M$ RF chains and $N$ antennas, where $M < N$ . Upon receiving pilot sequences to obtain the channel state information (CSI), the BS determines the best subset of $M$ antennas for serving the users. We propose a joint antenna selection and precoding design (JASPD) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate subject to a transmit power constraint and quality of service (QoS) requirements. The JASPD algorithm overcomes the non-convexity of the formulated problem via a doubly iterative algorithm, in which an inner loop successively optimizes the precoding vectors, followed by an outer loop that tests all valid antenna subsets. Although approaching (near) global optimality, the JASPD suffers from a combinatorial complexity, which may limit its application in real-time network operations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a learning-based antenna selection and precoding design algorithm (L-ASPA), which employs a deep neural network (DNN) to establish underlaying relations between key system parameters and the selected antennas. The proposed L-ASPD algorithm is robust against the number of users and their locations, the transmit power of the BS, as well as the small-scale channel fading. With a well-trained learning model, it is shown that the L-ASPD algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes based on the block diagonalization and a learning-assisted solution for broadcasting systems and achieves a better effective sum rate than that of the JASPA under limited processing time. In addition, we observed that the proposed L-ASPD algorithm can reduce the computation complexity by 95% while retaining more than 95% of the optimal performance.}

	abstract = {In the Fog Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), the local storage and computing capability of Fog Access Points (FAPs) provide new communication resources to address the latency and computing constraints for delay-sensitive applications. To achieve the ultra-low latency, a novel joint user association and channel allocation scheme is proposed in this paper, where the FAPs are clustered from a user-centric perspective. The delay performance is improved regarding both the control signaling procedure and the data transmission procedure. Specifically, the multiple access interference (MAI) between users is analyzed, where the closed-form expression for the effective rate of a typical user with multiple FAP connections and arbitrary interfering users is obtained. With the consideration of MAI, the proposed distributed joint user association and channel allocation algorithm provides a guaranteed delay violation probability. Moreover, the distributed algorithm can be conducted on individual FAPs, whose calculation is simplified by look-up tables. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of providing statistical delay performance guarantee including both average delay and delay bound violation probability, which demonstrates its superiority in supporting delay-sensitive applications in F-RANs.}

	abstract = {Predictive power allocation is conceived for energy-efficient video streaming over mobile networks using deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to minimize the accumulated energy consumption of each base station over a complete video streaming session under the constraint that avoids video playback interruptions. To handle the continuous state and action spaces, we resort to deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for solving the formulated problem. In contrast to previous predictive power allocation policies that first predict future information with historical data and then optimize the power allocation based on the predicted information, the proposed policy operates in an on-line and end-to-end manner. By judiciously designing the action and state that only depend on slowly-varying average channel gains, we reduce the signaling overhead between the edge server and the base stations, and make it easier to learn a good policy. To further avoid playback interruption throughout the learning process and improve the convergence speed, we exploit the partially known model of the system dynamics by integrating the concepts of safety layer, post-decision state, and virtual experiences into the basic DDPG algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed policies converge to the optimal policy that is derived based on perfect large-scale channel prediction and outperform the first-predict-then-optimize policy in the presence of prediction errors. By harnessing the partially known model, the convergence speed can be dramatically improved. The code for reproducing the results of this article is available at https://github.com/fluidy/twc2020.}

	abstract = {While Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) gains growing popularity during the last two decades, it faces several new challenges in meeting the requirements of emerging applications due to spectrum shortage, complicated network management and inefficient radio resource allocation (RRA) in densely deployed scenarios. The operating band has evolved from microwave band (a.k.a. sub-6 GHz) to millimeter-wave band (mmWave for short) or even multi-band to provide higher data rates. However, the existing distributed WLAN architecture works in different bands separately and doesn't support the coordination among access points (APs), making it difficult for efficient network management and improved quality of service (QoS) provisioning. In overcoming these challenges, a centralized control architecture for WLAN with decoupled control and data planes can be used to orchestrate the RRA within the whole network while achieving improved communication performance. Therefore, a new control/data plane decoupled WLAN architecture is designed in this paper to realize efficient network management and optimized RRA by separating the control plane and data plane into sub-6 GHz and mmWave respectively. Then, we propose the sub-6 GHz assisted mmWave beamforming protocol, which can significantly reduce the overhead of beamforming training (BFT). Last, we investigate joint RRA for the control/data plane decoupled WLAN since the control plane affects the RRA in the data plane. Performance analysis and simulation show that the joint RRA mechanism in the control/data plane decoupled network can significantly improve the number of successfully scheduled users and the sum-rate compared with the traditional RRA.}

With sub-space dimension larger than that of the null-space of the self-interference channels, the precoding error is reduced but the interference suppression ratio (ISR) is degraded, resulting in a trade-off between multibeam communication and MIMO SIC. An analytical approach for the ISR evaluation is proposed assuming known eigenvalue distribution of the self-interference channels, and a closed-form ISR expression is derived after applying a uniform distribution approximation. The ISR and precoding error trade-off curves are also formulated. Joint SIC by transmit beamforming and beam-based analog adaptive filters over both propagation and analog domains is proposed to achieve better SIC performance and enable more flexible receive antenna selection.

To avoid the inherent estimation ambiguities of the two-hop channels from mobile stations (MS) to the base station (BS), we adopt a hybrid IRS architecture composed of passive reflectors and active sensors, and establish two independent subproblems of estimating the MS-to-IRS and BS-to-IRS channels. By leveraging the sparse characteristics of high-frequency propagation, we model the training signals as multi-dimensional canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) tensors with missing fibers or slices. We develop algebraic algorithms to solve the tensor completion problems and recover channel multipath parameters, i.e., angles of arrival, time delays and path gains. Our methods require neither random initialization nor iterative operations, and for these reasons they can perform robustly with a low computational complexity. Moreover, we investigate the uniqueness condition of CPD tensor completion, which can be utilized to inform both the physical design of hybrid IRSs and the time-frequency resource allocation of training strategies. Simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes outperform the traditional counterparts in terms of accuracy, robustness and complexity, especially for the case of low-complexity IRSs with limited number of active sensing elements.}

	abstract = {Traditional WiFi positioning relies on a predefined radio map, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming for professionals. Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising solution for facilitating WiFi positioning. To crowdsense a radio map, traces collected from normal users are merged to recover the original walking paths. In this work, we design a robust iterative trace merging algorithm called WiFi-RITA based on WiFi access points as signal-marks. The algorithm formulates the trace merging problem as an optimization problem in which each trace is translated and rotated to minimize the limitation of distances among traces defined by WiFi access points. WiFi-RITA is further enhanced by removing outliers. WiFi-RITA is robust to the rotation errors of traces and efficient for a large number of short traces. According to the crowdsensed radio map, a sensor fusion approach based on particle filter by fusing inertial sensors and a multivariate Gaussian fingerprinting is proposed to enhance the accuracy of crowdsourcing indoor positioning. The experiment results in two large-scale environments demonstrate that WiFi-RITA positioning with zero-effort calibration achieves high positioning accuracy, which outperforms Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) and fingerprinting with K Nearest Neighbor.}

Signals for two users, each of which selected from a high-dimensional modulation constellation matrix, are superimposed on the same time-frequency resource for transmissions. While inter-user interference is treated as noise at the receiver of the far user, successive interference cancellation is used at the receiver of the near user. By analyzing the upper bounds of the detection errors, the power allocation factor is derived, which depends only on the relative power gain of the two users, i.e., the ratio between the squared of the two channel gains, but not on the operating signal-to-noise ratio. This nice feature allows us to perform user pairing easily for a system with more than two users. The optimal user pairing strategy that minimizes the total power consumption is analytically derived.

However, such a scheme requires the central processing unit (CPU) to collect received signals from all APs, which may enable the CPU to infer the private information of user locations. We therefore develop and analyze privacy-preserving channel estimation schemes under the framework of differential privacy (DP). As the key ingredient of the channel estimator, two joint differentially private noisy matrix completion algorithms based respectively on Frank-Wolfe iteration and singular value decomposition are presented. We provide an analysis on the tradeoff between the privacy and the channel estimation error. In particular, we show that the estimation error can be mitigated while maintaining the same privacy level by increasing the payload size with fixed pilot size; and the scaling laws of both the privacy-induced and privacy-independent error components in terms of payload size are characterized. Simulation results are provided to further demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and channel estimation performance.}

For D2D-aided F-RAN, we develop a framework that exploits the cached contents at eRRHs, their transmission rates/powers, and previously received contents by different users to deliver the requesting contents to users with a minimum completion time. Given the intractability of the completion time minimization problem, we formulate it at each transmission by approximating the completion time and decoupling it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we minimize the possible completion time in eRRH downlink transmissions, while in the second subproblem, we maximize the number of users to be scheduled on D2D links. We design two theoretical graphs, namely interference-aware instantly decodable network coding (IA-IDNC) and D2D conflict graphs to reformulate two subproblems as maximum weight clique and maximum independent set problems, respectively. Using these graphs, we heuristically develop joint and coordinated scheduling approaches. Simulation results show that the proposed two approaches achieve a considerable performance gain in terms of the completion time minimization.}

	abstract = {As the enabling technologies move up to the mmWave and even to the TeraHertz bands for the next-generation wireless systems, the signal processing of high-bandwidth orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) becomes increasingly power-thirsty, owing to the following OFDM deficiencies: (1) the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); (2) the bandwidth efficiency loss due to the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead; (3) the sensitivity to carrier frequency offset; (4) the complex out-of-band (OOB) filtering. Over the past six decades, a variety of waveforms have been developed in order to mitigate these deficiencies, which are generally achieved at the cost of compromising some of OFDM’s beneficial properties, such as its subcarrier (SC) orthogonality, its high throughput and its straighforward adoption to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Against this background, we propose a new waveform termed as multi-band discrete Fourier transform spread-OFDM with index modulation (MB-DFT-S-OFDM-IM), where the component multi-carrier techniques are conceived to constructively function together in order to mitigate the OFDM deficiencies without compromising the beneficial OFDM properties . More explicitly, first of all, the PAPR is reduced by the DFT-precoding. Secondly, thanks to the IM design, MB-DFT-S-OFDM-IM is capable of achieving a high throughput that is strictly equal to or higher than the OFDM throughput. Thirdly, MB-DFT-S-OFDM-IM achieves a beneficial frequency diversity gain, which leads to a higher tolerance to carrier frequency offset. Fourthly, the OOB filters are placed in each sub-band before DFT, so that the SC orthogonality remains intact, which is unique to the proposed MB-DFT-S-OFDM-IM structure. Last but not least, we extend the proposed MB-DFT-S-OFDM-IM to support a variety of MIMO schemes, where the IM philosophy is integrated with the space-, time- and frequency-domains within a single unified platform.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a new technology that can shape the radio wave propagation in wireless networks and offers a great variety of possible performance and implementation gains. Motivated by this, we study the achievable rate optimization for multi-stream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems equipped with an RIS, and formulate a joint optimization problem of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal and the RIS elements. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm that is based on the projected gradient method (PGM). We derive the step size that guarantees the convergence of the proposed algorithm and we define a backtracking line search to improve its convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce the total free space path loss (FSPL) ratio of the indirect and direct links as a first-order measure of the applicability of RISs in the considered communication system. Simulation results show that the proposed PGM achieves the same achievable rate as a state-of-the-art benchmark scheme, but with a significantly lower computational complexity. In addition, we demonstrate that the RIS application is particularly suitable to increase the achievable rate in indoor environments, as even a small number of RIS elements can provide a substantial achievable rate gain.}

	abstract = {Timely vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a key component of intelligent transportation systems to improve driving safety and efficiency. Although many results have been produced for vehicular networks, most of them focused on improving vehicular communication capacity and reliability. Very limited progress has been made so far in the design of practical V2V communication schemes for large-scale vehicular networks. In this paper, we present VehCom, a fully distributed message broadcast scheme for V2V communication networks. VehCom offers a delay guarantee for each vehicle's message broadcast while minimizing the packet loss rate. The enabler of VehCom is an asynchronous packet reception technique, which leverages a vehicle's multiple antennas to decode asynchronous collided packets from its neighboring vehicles. We have implemented the asynchronous packet reception technique on a vehicular wireless testbed, and examined the performance of VehCom in a large-scale vehicular network where i) each vehicle is equipped with four antennas, ii) each vehicle has 240 vehicles in its communication range, and iii) each vehicle broadcasts a 624-bit packet over 10 MHz spectrum in every 100 ms (guaranteed delay). Our experimental and analytical results show that the packet loss rate is less than 3.9% on parking lots, less than 4.1% on local roads, and less than 6.2% on highways.}

	abstract = {The paper presents upper and lower bounds on the per-sector degrees of freedom (DoF) of a sectorized hexagonal cellular model when neighboring base stations (BSs) can cooperate during at most Δ interaction rounds over rate-limited backhaul links. The lower bound is based on practically implementable beamforming and adapts the way BSs cooperate to the sectorization of the cells. It improves over the naive approach that ignores this sectorization in terms of the sum-rate, both at finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and in the high-SNR limit. For moderate SNR, the new scheme improves also over an opportunistic cooperation strategy where each message is decoded based on the signals received at the three adjacent sectors with the best SNR. The upper bound is information-theoretic and holds for all possible coding schemes, including for example interference alignment with unlimited symbol extensions whose practical implementation currently seems out of reach. Lower and upper bounds show that the complexity constraint, imposed by limiting the number of interaction rounds Δ, indeed limits the largest achievable sum-rate and DoF. In particular, irrespective of the backhaul capacity μ, the per-sector DoF cannot exceed a threshold which depends on Δ.}

	abstract = {In the context of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), this paper first presents an improved index modulation (IIM) technique to address the well-known low spectral efficiency problem of IM techniques in general and OFDM-IM in particular. OFDM-IIM is realized by deriving the minimum required number of subcarriers per group, and the minimum number of active subcarriers in each group, of the conventional OFDM-IM technique. It is proven that OFDM-IIM can deliver higher spectral and energy efficiencies than classical OFDM and OFDM-IM. The gains come at the expense of increased detection complexity. Therefore, a proposal of OFDM with generalized IM (OFDM-GIM) technique is presented, where a variable number of subcarriers per group are allowed to be activated. Two variants of OFDM-GIM are designed based on the activation pattern of the subcarriers: the first achieves superior spectral efficiency with reduced detection complexity as compared to OFDM-IIM, and the second is tailored for low data rate communications with higher energy efficiency requirements. Besides optimal maximum likelihood detection, a less-complex sub-optimal detector is proposed. A closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) of OFDM-IIM and the two variants of OFDM-GIM is derived, considering transmissions over Nakagami fading channels and multiple-antenna reception. Finally, OFDM-IIM and OFDM-GIM are compared with state-of-the-art techniques to validate their superiority in terms of BER, achievable rate, and energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has solved many problems that are out of reach of heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though the current radio systems are well-understood and optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepRx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5G-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols. Also, DeepRx outputs soft bits that are compatible with the channel coding used in 5G systems. Using 3GPP-defined channel models, we demonstrate that DeepRx outperforms traditional methods. We also show that the high performance can likely be attributed to DeepRx learning to utilize the known constellation points of the unknown data symbols, together with the local symbol distribution, for improved detection accuracy.}

	abstract = {Primary-secondary spectrum sharing is limited in terms of design space, and may not be sufficient to meet the ever-increasing demand of connectivity and high signal quality. The next step to increase spectrum sharing efficiency is to design markets where sharing takes place among primary providers rather than leaving it to the limited case where the primary licensee is idle. Attaining contractual spectrum sharing among primary providers, a.k.a. co-primary or inter-provider sharing, involves additional costs for the users, e.g., roaming fee. Co-primary spectrum sharing without additional charge to the users poses two major challenges: a) regulatory approaches must be introduced to incentivize providers to share spectrum resources, and b) small providers in co-primary spectrum sharing markets may freeride on large providers' networks as the customers of the small providers may be using the spectrum and infrastructure resources of large providers. Such freeriding opportunities must be minimized to realize the benefits of primary-level sharing. We consider a subsidy-based spectrum sharing (SBSS) market to facilitate co-primary spectrum sharing where providers are explicitly incentivized to share spectrum resources. We focus on minimizing freeriding in SBSS markets and introduce a game-theoretic model to regulate the freeriding. We use the model to explore operational regimes with minimal freeriding.}

To mitigate the impact of TSAs, we consider the task of joint target localization and attack detection. We show that this task can be formulated as a mix-integer programming problem with the number of optimization variables proportional to the number of multipaths, and hence is formidable when the multipath effect is severe. We show that if the magnitude of the correlation between multipath signals is upper bounded by some constant, which can be easily satisfied in practice, then the mix-integer programming can be simplified, and the number of optimization variables can be reduced and does not depend on the number of multipaths anymore. Next, we employ two computationally efficient algorithms to solve the simplified problem. The numerical results show that as the signal-to-noise ratio increases, the attack detection error of our approaches decreases to zero rapidly, and the target localization performance of our approaches is very close to that of the clairvoyant algorithm which is assumed to know the set of attacked sensors.}

This paper aims to design UAV trajectories that simultaneously perform multiple tasks. We aim to design UAV trajectories that efficiently perform some transportation operation (e.g., package delivery), and at the same time provide uniform coverage over a neighborhood area which is needed for applications such as network coverage, Internet of Things (IoT) devices data collection, wireless power transfer, and surveillance. We first consider multi-task UAVs for a simplified scenario where the neighborhood area is a circular region where UAV missions start from the center and the destinations are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the circle boundary. We propose a trajectory process such that if according to which the UAV's move, a uniform coverage can be achieved while the transport (delivery) efficiency is still preserved. We then consider a more practical scenario in which the transport destinations are arbitrarily distributed in an arbitrarily-shaped region. We show that simultaneous uniform coverage and efficient transport trajectory (e.g. package delivery) is possible for such realistic scenarios. This is shown using both rigorous analysis as well as simulations.}

In this paper, both downlink and uplink IRS-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) networks are studied, in which an IRS is deployed to enhance the coverage by assisting a cell-edge user device (UD) to communicate with the base station (BS). To characterize system performance, new channel statistics of the BS-IRS-UD link with Nakagami-\nm\nfading are investigated. For each scenario, the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and ergodic rate are derived. To gain further insight, the diversity order and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slope for each scenario are obtained according to asymptotic approximations in the high-SNR regime. It is demonstrated that the diversity order is affected by the number of IRS reflecting elements and Nakagami fading parameters, but the high-SNR slope is not related to these parameters. Simulation results validate our analysis and reveal the superiority of the IRS over the full-duplex decode-and-forward relay.}

For applications such as user-cell site association and device-to-device link scheduling, an accurate knowledge of the pathloss function for all pairs of transmitter-receiver locations is very important. Commonly used statistical models approximate the pathloss as a decaying function of the distance between transmitter and receiver. However, in realistic propagation environments characterized by the presence of buildings, street canyons, and objects at different heights, such radial-symmetric functions yield very misleading results. In this paper we show that properly designed and trained deep neural networks are able to learn how to estimate the pathloss function, given an urban environment, in a very accurate and computationally efficient manner. Our proposed method, termed RadioUNet, learns from a physical simulation dataset, and generates pathloss estimations that are very close to the simulations, but are much faster to compute for real-time applications. Moreover, we propose methods for transferring what was learned from simulations to real-life. Numerical results show that our method significantly outperforms previously proposed methods.}

To account for the propagation delay across the antenna array, which cannot be neglected in wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems, the discrete time channel that models the spatial wideband effect is developed. Also, the training signal design that addresses inter-frame, inter-user, and inter-symbol interferences is investigated when the spatial wideband effect is not negligible. To estimate the channel parameters over the continuum based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the Newtonized fully corrective forward greedy selection-cross validation-based (NFCFGS-CV-based) channel estimator is proposed. NFCFGS-CV is a gridless compressed sensing (CS) algorithm, whose termination condition is determined by the CV technique. The CV-based termination condition is proved to achieve the minimum squared error (SE). The simulation results show that NFCFGS-CV outperforms state-of-the-art on-grid CS-based channel estimators.}

However, a thorough analysis of OCDM for wireless channels has not been conducted. Thus, this paper investigates the performance of OCDM affected by different impairments that are typical in a wireless channel and shows that uncoded OCDM performs better than OFDM and similar to single carrier block transmissions in multipath channels. Building on previous results, this study also shows that OCDM is more robust to time-burst interference (TBI) than its competitors and to narrow band interference (NBI) than OFDM because of spreading. However, OCDM is shown to suffer because of the loss of orthogonality caused by carrier frequency offset (CFO) and is analytically shown to have the same peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) as OFDM.}

	abstract = {This paper shows that deep neural network (DNN) can be used for efficient and distributed channel estimation, quantization, feedback, and downlink multiuser precoding for a frequency-division duplex massive multiple-input multiple-output system in which a base station (BS) serves multiple mobile users, but with rate-limited feedback from the users to the BS. A key observation is that the multiuser channel estimation and feedback problem can be thought of as a distributed source coding problem. In contrast to the traditional approach where the channel state information (CSI) is estimated and quantized at each user independently, this paper shows that a joint design of pilots and a new DNN architecture, which maps the received pilots directly into feedback bits at the user side then maps the feedback bits from all the users directly into the precoding matrix at the BS, can significantly improve the overall performance. This paper further proposes robust design strategies with respect to channel parameters and also a generalizable DNN architecture for varying number of users and number of feedback bits. Numerical results show that the DNN-based approach with short pilot sequences and very limited feedback overhead can already approach the performance of conventional linear precoding schemes with full CSI.}

	abstract = {Ultra-dense network (UDN) is one of the most important techniques to support massive number of different types of user equipments (UEs). It is essential to understand the impact of densification on various system performance metrics in future cellular networks. Two contradictory conclusions were made from the existing research works. Some works indicated that the network densification has reached its upper limit and deploying more UEs may only reduce UDN performance; whereas the others claimed that more UEs can still be supported by deploying more small cell base stations (SBSs). The existence of above different conclusions is due mainly to the difficulties to find an effective means to take into account different path loss models in UDNs. In this paper, we aim to propose a unified analytical approach, which is effective to simplify UDN performance analysis based on different path loss models with a low computation complexity. Using the proposed approach with idle mode of SBSs enabled, we can identify the impact of the densities of SBSs and UEs on various performance metrics, i.e., coverage probability and average area spectral efficiency (ASE). The conclusions will be supported by the analytical and simulation results verifying the effectiveness of the proposed unified analytical approach.}

	abstract = {The recent emergence of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation as a novel PHY-layer mechanism is more suitable in high-mobility wireless communication scenarios than traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Although multiple studies have analyzed OTFS performance using theoretical and ideal baseband pulseshapes, a challenging and open problem is the development of effective receivers for practical OTFS systems that must rely on non-ideal pulseshapes for transmission. This work focuses on the design of practical receivers for OTFS. We consider a fractionally spaced sampling (FSS) receiver in which the sampling rate is an integer multiple of the symbol rate. For rectangular pulses used in OTFS transmission, we derive a general channel input-output relationship of OTFS in delay-Doppler domain without the common reliance on impractical assumptions such as ideal bi-orthogonal pulses and on-the-grid delay/Doppler shifts. We propose two equalization algorithms: iterative combining message passing (ICMP) and turbo message passing (TMP) for symbol detection by exploiting delay-Doppler channel sparsity and the channel diversity gain via FSS. We analyze the convergence performance of TMP receiver and propose simplified message passing (MP) receivers to further reduce complexity. Our FSS receivers demonstrate stronger performance than traditional receivers and robustness to the imperfect channel state information knowledge.}

More precisely, we analyze the broadcast of safety-related V2X communications in cellular networks where base stations and vehicles are assumed to share the same spectrum and vehicles broadcast their safety messages to neighboring users. We model the locations of vehicles as a Poisson line Cox point process and the locations of users as a planar Poisson point process. We assume that users are associated with their closest base stations when there is no vehicle within a certain distance ρ. On the other hand, users located within a distance ρ from vehicles are associated with the vehicles to receive their safety messages. We quantify the properties of this vehicle-prioritized association using the stochastic geometry framework. We derive the fractions of users that receive safety messages from vehicles. Then, we obtain the expression for the signal-to-interference ratio of the typical user evaluated on each association type. To address the impact of vehicular broadcast on the cellular network, the paper also derives the effective rate offered to the typical user in this setting.}

	abstract = {In fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks, users feed back to the base station the index of the precoder (from a codebook) to be used for downlink transmission. The precoder is strongly related to the user channel and in turn to the user position within the cell. We propose a method by which an external attacker determines the user position by passively overhearing this unencrypted layer-2 feedback signal. The attacker first builds a map of fed back precoder indices in the cell. Then, by overhearing the precoder index fed back by the victim user, the attacker finds its position on the map. We focus on the type-I single-panel codebook, which today is the only mandatory solution in the 3GPP standard. We analyze the attack and assess the obtained localization accuracy against various parameters. We analyze the localization error of a simplified precoder feedback model and describe its asymptotic localization precision. We also propose a mitigation against our attack, wherein the user randomly selects the precoder among those providing the highest rate. Simulations confirm that the attack can achieve a high localization accuracy, which is significantly reduced when the mitigation solution is adopted, at the cost of a negligible rate degradation.}

It formulates an optimization problem that enables exploiting available uncorrelated paths between the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) to enhance the system throughput. In the proposed approach, antenna arrays at Tx/Rx are modeled as a Bipartite graph. Next, two bi-clustering algorithms are applied to the graph to simultaneously cluster antenna elements at Tx and Rx. In addition, the paper shows how the selection of subchannels and their corresponding subantenna arrays can be reduced to a variant of the graph coloring problem, based on which, two algorithms are proposed to find the optimum subchannels and subantenna arrays. Moreover, the paper defines two new beamforming methods and proves that those methods satisfy constant modulus and total power constraints. The first modified beamforming method uses singular vectors (SVs) of subchannels between Tx/Rx and incorporates the Power Iteration algorithm to decrease singular value decomposition complexity. The second newly proposed beamforming method finds precoders/combiners without using SVs which reduces the computational complexity. Performance evaluations in terms data streaming sum-rate demonstrate that the proposed technique increases the throughput using a low processing complexity.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to reconfigure wireless channels, which brings a new degree of freedom for the design of future wireless networks. This article proposes a new three-dimensional (3D) wireless system architecture enabled by aerial IRS (AIRS). Compared to the conventional terrestrial IRS, AIRS enjoys more deployment flexibility as well as wider-view signal reflection, thanks to its high altitude and thus more likelihood of establishing line-of-sight (LoS) links with ground source/destination nodes. We aim to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations in a target area by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming for the source node, as well as the placement and 3D passive beamforming for the AIRS. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case of maximizing the SNR at a given target location, for which the optimal solution is obtained in closed-form. The result shows that the optimal horizontal AIRS placement only depends on the ratio between the source-destination distance and the AIRS altitude. Then for the general case of AIRS-enabled area coverage, we propose an efficient solution by decoupling the AIRS passive beamforming design to maximize the worst-case array gain, from its placement optimization by balancing the resulting angular span and the cascaded channel path loss. Our proposed solution is based on a novel 3D beam broadening and flattening technique, where the passive array of the AIRS is divided into sub-arrays of appropriate size, and their phase shifts are designed to form a flattened beam pattern with adjustable beamwidth catering to the size of the coverage area. Both uniform linear array (ULA)-based and uniform planar array (UPA)-based AIRSs are considered in our design, which enable two-dimensional (2D) and 3D passive beamforming, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed designs achieve significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.}

In addition to viewing them as a class of algorithms operating on graphical models, this article unifies them under an optimization framework, namely, Bethe free energy minimization with differently and appropriately imposed constraints. This new perspective in terms of constraint manipulation can offer additional insights on the connection between different message passing algorithms and is valid for a generic statistical model. It also founds a theoretical framework to systematically derive message passing variants. Taking the sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem as an example, a low-complexity EP variant can be obtained by simple constraint reformulation, delivering better estimation performance with lower complexity than the standard EP algorithm. Furthermore, we can resort to the framework for the systematic derivation of hybrid message passing for complex inference tasks. Notably, a hybrid message passing algorithm is exemplarily derived for joint SSR and statistical model learning with near-optimal inference performance and scalable complexity.}

	abstract = {The logical separation of control signaling from data transmission in a mobile cellular network has been shown to have significant energy saving potential compared with the legacy systems. As a result, there has been a lot of focus in recent years on development and realization of separation architectures. Our study, however, shows that the energy savings of separation architecture remain under 16-17% when compared with legacy systems and this gain falls to a mere 7% when both architectures are realized under a CloudRAN (CRAN) setting. Moreover, when we strategically place some small base-stations (SBSs) to cover the area in a densely deployed scenario and allow all other base-stations (BSs) to be used only on-demand, the system consumes much less energy than the separation architecture. While we expected that most equipment would be shut down during nights, our study shows that around 70% of the small cells are required to be active to serve randomly distributed minimum data load, i.e., active mobile equipment. Contemporary mobile traffic is predominantly data which does not go to extremely low levels during nights. We discuss, in detail, the assumptions, their implications, and the effects of system parameter values on our conclusions.}

This article addresses key challenges in this context, namely how to invest an available budget in cache space in order to match spatio-temporal fluctuations of demand, wireless environment and storage prices. Specifically, we jointly consider dynamic cache rental, content placement, and request-cache association in wireless scenarios in order to provide just-in-time CDN services. The goal is to maximize the an aggregate utility metric for the CP that captures both service benefits due to caching and fairness in servicing different end users. We leverage the Lyapunov drift-minus-benefit technique and Jensen's inequality to transform our infinite horizon problem into hour-by-hour subproblems which can be solved without knowledge of future file popularity and transmission rates. For the case of non-overlapping small cells, we provide an optimal subproblem solution. However, in the general overlapping case, the subproblem becomes a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP). In this case, we employ a randomized cache lease method to derive a scalable solution. We show that the proposed algorithm guarantees the theoretical performance bound by exploiting the submodularity property of the objective function and pick-and-compare property of the randomized cache lease method. Finally, via real dataset driven simulations, we find that the proposed algorithm achieves 154% utility compared to similar static cache storage-based algorithms in a representative urban topology.}

	abstract = {The frequency diverse array (FDA)-based directional modulation (DM) technology plays an important role in the physical-layer security (PLS) transmission of 5G and beyond communications. In order to meet the tremendous increase in mobile data traffic, a new memory-efficient design for the FDA-DM-based PLS transmission is urgently demanded. In this article, an analytical symmetrical multi-carrier FDA model is proposed in three dimensions, namely, range, azimuth angle, and elevation angle, differing from the conventional analytical approach with only range and azimuth angle considered. Then, a single-point (SP) artificial noise (AN) aided FDA-DM scheme is proposed, which reduces the memory consumption significantly compared with the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) and singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches. Moreover, the PLS performance of the proposed FDA-DM scheme is analyzed in fluctuating two-ray (FTR) fading channels for the first time, including the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and the secrecy outage probability (SOP). More importantly, the closed-form expressions for the lower bound on ASC and the upper bound on SOP are derived, respectively. The effectiveness of the analytical expressions is verified by numerical simulations. This work opens a way to lower the memory requirements for DM-based PLS transmission of 5G and beyond communications.}

	abstract = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising technology to unlock the full potential of UAVs in the future by reusing the cellular base stations (BSs) to enable their air-ground communications. However, how to achieve ubiquitous three-dimensional (3D) communication coverage for the UAVs in the sky is a new challenge. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by a new coverage-aware navigation approach, which exploits the UAV's controllable mobility to design its navigation/trajectory to avoid the cellular BSs' coverage holes while accomplishing their missions. To this end, we formulate an UAV trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of its mission completion time and expected communication outage duration, which, however, cannot be solved by the standard optimization techniques due to the lack of an accurate and tractable end-to-end communication model in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, by leveraging the state-of-the-art dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) with multi-step learning, we first propose a UAV navigation algorithm based on direct RL, where the signal measurement at the UAV is used to directly train the action-value function of the navigation policy. To further improve the performance, we propose a new framework called simultaneous navigation and radio mapping (SNARM), where the UAV's signal measurement is used not only for training the DQN directly, but also to create a radio map that is able to predict the outage probabilities at all locations in the area of interest. This enables the generation of simulated UAV trajectories and predicting their expected returns, which are then used to further train the DQN via Dyna technique, thus greatly improving the learning efficiency.}

The vast majority of the NOMA literature has adopted the ideal information rate as performance metric assuming perfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) without any error propagation, which, however, may lead to NOMA designs adverse to SIC. In this paper, we take into account imperfect SIC and practical modulation schemes for power-domain NOMA design. To characterize the error propagation, we derive the bit error rates (BERs) of the users for arbitrary-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. Then, we propose a minimum error probability NOMA (MEP-NOMA) design, minimizing the average BER of the users via power allocation. Considering the complicated error probability expressions of the MEP-NOMA design, we derive lower and upper bounds on the average BER, based on which a simple closed-form power allocation is obtained. We show that the proposed power allocation minimizes both the lower and upper bounds on the average BER for a sufficiently large power budget and provides near-optimal error performance. On this basis, we theoretically prove the superiority of MEP-NOMA over existing OMA and NOMA schemes in terms of error performance. Comprehensive numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of the error probability analysis of the considered practical NOMA scheme with imperfect SIC and to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MEP-NOMA design.}

	abstract = {The fundamental challenge of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band is the sensitivity of the radio channel to blockages, which gives rise to unstable connectivity and impacts the reliability of a system. To this end, multi-point connectivity is a promising approach for ensuring the desired rate and reliability requirements. A robust beamformer design is proposed to improve the communication reliability by exploiting the spatial macro-diversity and a pessimistic estimate of rates over potential link blockage combinations. Specifically, we provide a blockage-aware algorithm for the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem with parallel beamformer processing across distributed remote radio units (RRUs). Combinations of non-convex and coupled constraints are handled via successive convex approximation (SCA) framework, which admits a closed-form solution for each SCA step, by solving a system of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. Unlike the conventional coordinated multi-point (CoMP) schemes, the proposed blockage-aware beamformer design has, per-iteration, computational complexity in the order of RRU antennas instead of system-wide joint transmit antennas. This leads to a practical and computationally efficient implementation that is scalable to any arbitrary multi-point configuration. In the presence of random blockages, the proposed schemes are shown to significantly outperform baseline scenarios and result in reliable mmWave communication.}

	abstract = {This article proposes a novel framework of resource allocation in multi-cell intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where an IRS is deployed to enhance the wireless service. The problem of joint user association, subchannel assignment, power allocation, phase shifts design, and decoding order determination is formulated for maximizing the achievable sum rate. The challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem is decomposed into an optimization subproblem (P1) with continuous variables and a matching subproblem (P2) with integer variables. In an effort to tackle the non-convex optimization problem (P1), iterative algorithms are proposed for allocating transmission power, designing reflection matrix, and determining decoding order by invoking relaxation methods such as convex upper bound substitution, successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation. In terms of the combinational problem (P2), swap matching-based algorithms are developed for achieving a two-sided exchange-stable state among users, BSs and subchannels. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the sum rate of multi-cell NOMA networks is capable of being increased by 35% with the aid of the IRS; ii) the proposed algorithms for multi-cell IRS-aided NOMA networks can enjoy 22% higher energy efficiency than conventional NOMA counterparts; iii) the trade-off between spectrum efficiency and coverage area can be tuned by judiciously selecting the location of the IRS.}

	abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) is emerging, while the spectrum is at a premium. To enhance spectrum efficiency, a promising solution is Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) that enables users to communicate with the same resource at the same time, while decoding the superimposed signal at the receiver. Existing NOMA technologies, however, rely on strict power control to decode the superimposed signal, infeasible for heterogeneous and low-cost IoT devices. In contrast, we propose I-Talk, a new NOMA scheme that is designed for IoT and can decode the superimposed signals from two transmitters without power control. Importantly, considering the IoT systems in the wild, both the hardware imperfections and mobility are unavoidable, which can cause severe signal variations, resulting in an unreliable decoding performance. To solve this problem, we design a synthesis channel coefficient to track all signal offsets caused by the hardware imperfection. Meanwhile, we propose a diversity transmission and smart combining scheme to achieve high reliable decoding performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of this new NOMA approach in practical systems, we implement I-Talk with USRP devices and the experimental results illustrate that I-Talk achieves a one-order lower bit-error-rate and a 1.47× higher throughput gain than the state-of-the-art superimposed signal decoding scheme.}

	abstract = {We consider a multi-user multi-server mobile edge computing (MEC) network with time-varying fading channels and formulate an offloading decision and resource allocation problem. To solve this mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose two hybrid approaches that learn offloading strategy with DQN (opt-DQN) or Q-table (opt-QL) at each user equipment (UE). The communication resources are allocated with an optimization algorithm at each computational access point (CAP). We also propose a pure DQN method that learns both the offloading strategy and resource allocation via Q-learning (QL). We analyze the convergence behavior of the QL-based algorithms from a game-theoretical perspective and demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid approaches for different network sizes. The simulation results show that the hybrid approaches reach lower costs than other baseline algorithms and the pure-DQN approach. Moreover, the performance of the pure-DQN approach degrades severely as the network size increases, while opt-DQN still performs the best, followed by opt-QL. These observations demonstrate that the hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both QL and convex optimization is a promising design for a multi-user MEC network, wherein complicated offloading and resource allocation strategies need to be determined in a timely and accurate fashion.}

	abstract = {With the emerging of the massive Machine Type Communication usage scenario, the legacy Random Access (RA) procedures need to be fully renewed to meet the huge number of accesses and the energy-constrained device requirements. In this context, the strategy of transmitting tagged preambles as access requests is gaining importance. In fact, it can reduce the number of signaling transmissions per access attempt, the overall number of phases in the access procedure, and, accordingly, energy consumption per device. However, the effectiveness of detection strategies of tagged preambles by the gNB receiver plays a fundamental role on the RA procedure performance. Up to now, the performance of these advanced detection procedures has been obtained only by running a large number of simulations that are typically highly time-consuming. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first analytical model to analyze the correct detection of both the preamble and the tag transmitted by each device in the presence of interference, due to other preambles and tags, and of noise. The high accuracy of the proposed model is verified through simulations. In addition, we show how our analytical study can be a good tool to investigate and derive innovative detection strategies.}

	abstract = {Device-to-device communication (D2D) is expected to accommodate high data rates and to increase the spectral efficiency of mobile networks. The D2D pairs can opportunistically exploit channels that are not allocated to conventional users in a dedicated mode. To increase the sum capacity of D2D pairs in the dedicated mode, we propose a novel solution that allows the reuse of multiple channels by multiple D2D pairs. In the first step, the bandwidth is split among D2D pairs so that each pair communicates at a single channel that guarantees a minimal capacity for each pair. Then, the channel reuse is facilitated via a grouping of the D2D pairs into coalitions. The D2D pairs within one coalition mutually reuse the channels of each other. We propose two approaches for the creation of the coalitions. The first approach reaches an upper-bound capacity by optimal coalitions determined by the dynamic programming. However, such approach is of a high complexity. Thus, we also introduce a low-complexity algorithm, based on the sequential bargaining, reaching a close-to-optimal capacity. Moreover, we also determine the transmission power allocated to each reused channel. Simulations show that the proposed solution triples the sum capacity of the state-of-the-art algorithm with the highest performance.}

	abstract = {Coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) is a promising strategy to extend cell coverage. However, higher spectral efficiency (SE) cannot be guaranteed in CDRT due to the cooperative process. Thus, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based CDRT is investigated, where a relaying user assists a base station (BS) in communicating with a cell-edge user (CEU) while the BS directly communicates with a cell-center user (CCU). Specifically, a novel joint downlink-uplink adaptive scheme is proposed for NOMA-based CDRT to improve the SE further. The proposed scheme jointly designs uplink and downlink via NOMA and adaptive transmission to implement bidirectional communication. First, we study the performance of the proposed scheme under both perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), and closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability, diversity order, outage throughput (OT), ergodic sum rate (ESR), and energy efficiency (EE). Then, an optimal power allocation algorithm using the segment optimization and a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm are proposed to maximize the ESR under perfect and imperfect SIC, respectively. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the ESR, OT, EE, and the outage performance of CEU. The effectiveness of the proposed power allocation algorithms is also validated.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently emerged as a promising technology that can achieve high spectrum and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by integrating a massive number of low-cost and passive reflecting elements. An RIS can manipulate the properties of an incident wave, such as the frequency, amplitude, and phase, and, then, reflect this manipulated wave to a desired destination, without the need for complex signal processing. In this paper, the asymptotic optimality of achievable rate in a downlink RIS system is analyzed under a practical RIS environment with its associated limitations. In particular, a passive beamformer that can achieve the asymptotic optimal performance by controlling the incident wave properties is designed, under a limited RIS control link and practical reflection coefficients. In order to increase the achievable system sum-rate, a modulation scheme that can be used in an RIS without interfering with existing users is proposed and its average symbol error rate is asymptotically derived. Moreover, a new resource allocation algorithm that jointly considers user scheduling and power control is designed, under consideration of the proposed passive beamforming and modulation schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes are in close agreement with their upper bounds in presence of a large number of RIS reflecting elements thereby verifying that the achievable rate in practical RISs satisfies the asymptotic optimality.}

We derive the corresponding capacity-regions, applicable to a wide range of pulse shaping methods. We analytically prove that asynchronous transmission enlarges the capacity-region of MACs. Although successive interference cancellation (SIC) can achieve the optimal sum-rate for the conventional uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) methods, it is unable to achieve the boundary of the capacity-region for the asynchronous transmission. We demonstrate that for the asynchronous transmission, the optimal SIC decoding order to achieve the maximum sum-rate is based on the users' channel strengths. This optimal ordering is in contrast to the conventional uplink NOMA, where various decoding orders can result in the maximum sum-rate. Furthermore, we provide practical transceiver designs to approach the capacity-region. The memory induced by asynchronous transmission enables the use of the trellis-based detection methods which improves the performance. In addition, we propose a transceiver design, based on channel diagonalization to exploit the frequency-selectivity introduced by timing offsets. The proposed transceiver design, joint with the turbo principle, enables us to achieve a rate pair that is not achievable by the synchronous transmission.}

	abstract = {Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is one of the main services delivered by the fifth Generation (5G) mobile network. The traditional cellular architecture where all devices connect to the base station is not energy efficient. For this reason, the use of device-to-device (D2D) communications is considered to reduce the energy consumption of mMTC devices. The main idea is to use nearby user equipment (UE) as a relay and establish with it D2D communication. However, the relay selection process also consumes energy, and this consumption can be significant compared to the energy consumed during the data transmission phase. In this paper, we propose a distributed energy-efficient D2D relaying mechanism for mMTC applications. This mechanism favors the selection of the UEs with low path loss with the mMTC device. Through mathematical analysis and simulations, we show that our mechanism allows a reduction of the total energy consumption of mMTC devices (up to 75% compared to direct transmission) when they have an unfavorable link budget. Moreover, our mechanism achieves almost constant energy consumption for a large range of UE densities and distances between the mMTC device and the base station.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous cellular networks with hybrid energy supplies can relieve traffic pressure and reduce grid energy consumption. In heterogeneous cellular networks, rational resource management can help improve system performances. In general, more than one performance is expected to do well, but there can exist a trade-off among different performance metrics, thus making resource management a multi-objective problem. The existing solution usually transforms a multi-objective problem into another single-objective problem by assigning weights for various objectives. However, it is difficult to know the exact weights in advance, and different systems call for different requirements for objectives. Hence, a multi-objective optimization approach based on the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is proposed to find a series of Pareto optimal solutions. The decision-makers can select an appropriate solution according to the system requirement. In this work, three different multi-objective GSA-based algorithms are proposed to determine user association and power control, with the goal to optimize the traffic load balancing among small base stations and grid energy consumption per unit throughput simultaneously. The complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, and simulations compare the performances of the proposed algorithms and the benchmark algorithm. Experimental results reveal the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.}

	abstract = {Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control is one of the major research interests in UAV-based networks. Yet few existing works focus on how the network should optimally react when the UAV lineup and user distribution change. In this work, proactive self-regulation (PSR) of UAV-based networks is investigated when one or more UAVs are about to quit or join the network, with considering dynamic user distribution. We target at an optimal UAV trajectory control policy which proactively relocates the UAVs whenever the UAV lineup is about to change, rather than passively dispatches the UAVs after the change. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based self-regulation approach is developed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction (US) score for a certain period within which at least one UAV will quit or join the network. To handle the changed dimension of the state-action space before and after the lineup changes, the state transition is deliberately designed. To accommodate continuous state and action space, an actor-critic based DRL, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is applied with better convergence stability. To effectively promote learning exploration around the timing of lineup change, an asynchronous parallel computing (APC) learning structure is proposed. Referred to as PSR-APC, the developed approach is then extended to the case of dynamic user distribution by incorporating time as one of the agent states. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and superiority of PSR-APC over a passive reaction method, and its capability in jointly handling the dynamics of both UAV lineup and user distribution.}

The problem is formulated as the identification of an unknown number of active subspaces in a large family of subspaces, accounting for the possible positions of potential targets in the delay-Doppler domain: the resulting testing problem is composite and multi-hypothesis. At first, we derive a solution based on the generalized information criterion (GIC), whose complexity is however prohibitive; then, we propose an approximated form of the GIC-based receiver and derive two iterative data-adaptive strategies, both extracting and eliminating the superimposed back-scattered subspace signals one-by-one. Leveraging the IEEE 802.11ad standard, a short-range low-mobility application is discussed to validate the merits of the proposed procedures in terms of detection and localization capabilities, robustness to multi-target interference, and achievable resolution.}

	abstract = {Ultra-dense HetNets (UDN)-based Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) massive MIMO is considered a promising technology for 5th generation (5G) wireless communications systems since it can offer massively available bandwidth and improve energy efficiency (EE) substantially. However, in UDN, the power consumption of the system increases sharply with the increase of network density. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of the EE in the mmWave massive MIMO systems with UDN. To develop the functions of massive MIMO, we first propose a system model where the massive MIMO harvests electromagnetic energy from the environment employing simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology, implemented at the base station (BS). Then, the EE optimization problem is formulated for 5G mmWave massive MIMO systems within the UDN. Considering the nonconcave feature of the objective function, an iterative EE algorithm is developed, based on Dinkelbach method. To utilize the role of coordinated multi-point transmission and reception (CoMP) for improving the EE, a coordinated user(UE)-BS association algorithm-based CoMP with maximum energy efficiency (MaxEE) is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a substantially faster convergence rate and is very effective, compared with existing methods.}

	abstract = {Phase Modulation on the Hypersphere (PMH) is a power efficient modulation scheme for the load-modulated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitters with central power amplifiers (CPA). However, it is difficult to obtain the precise channel state information (CSI), and the traditional optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme incurs high complexity which increases exponentially with the number of transmitting antennas and the number of bits carried per antenna in the PMH modulation. To detect the PMH signals without knowing the prior CSI, we first propose a signal detection scheme, termed as the hypersphere clustering scheme based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with maximum likelihood detection (HEM-ML). By leveraging machine learning, the proposed detection scheme can accurately obtain information of the channel from a few of the received symbols with little resource cost and achieve comparable detection results as that of the optimal ML detector. To further reduce the computational complexity in the ML detection in HEM-ML, we also propose the second signal detection scheme, termed as the hypersphere clustering scheme based on the EM algorithm with KD-tree detection (HEM-KD). The CSI obtained from the EM algorithm is used to build a spatial KD-tree receiver codebook and the signal detection problem can be transformed into a nearest neighbor search (NNS) problem. The detection complexity of HEM-KD is significantly reduced without any detection performance loss as compared to HEM-ML. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed detection schemes.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a large-scale wireless network consisting of source-destination (SD) pairs, where the sources send time-sensitive information, termed status updates, to their corresponding destinations in a time-slotted fashion. We employ age of information (AoI) for quantifying the freshness of the status updates measured at the destination nodes under the preemptive and non-preemptive queueing disciplines with no storage facility. The non-preemptive queue drops the newly arriving updates until the update in service is successfully delivered, whereas the preemptive queue replaces the current update in service with the newly arriving update, if any. As the update delivery rate for a given link is a function of the interference field seen from the receiver, the temporal mean AoI can be treated as a random variable over space. Our goal in this paper is to characterize the spatial distribution of the mean AoI observed by the SD pairs by modeling them as a bipolar Poisson point process (PPP). Towards this objective, we first derive accurate bounds on the moments of success probability while efficiently capturing the interference-induced coupling in the activities of the SD pairs. Using this result, we then derive tight bounds on the moments as well as the spatial distribution of peak AoI (PAoI). Our numerical results verify our analytical findings and demonstrate the impact of various system design parameters on the mean PAoI.}

The messages intended for different receivers are transmitted in mutually orthogonal frequency bands. An adversary observes all these frequency bands aiming at detecting whether or not communication occurs, while the friendly jammer broadcasts jamming signals to degrade the detection performance of the adversary. We consider a block Rayleigh fading channel model and evaluate the performance of covert communication in two situations: 1) the wireless channels vary slowly such that the transmission ends within one channel coherent time block, and 2) the wireless channels vary fast such that the wireless channels have changed several times before the whole transmission is finished. In the former case, subject to a covertness constraint, we maximize the sum of the effective rates by optimizing the transmit power allocation and the transmission rate for each receiver. In the latter case, we take the channel training process into consideration, and subject to a covertness constraint, we maximize the sum of the ergodic rates by optimizing the power allocation and the pilot length. Though both of the two optimization problems are non-convex, we presented methods to find their global optimal solutions. Besides, we also present methods to find sub-optimal solutions with lower computational complexities. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the performance under the two situations.}

	abstract = {Provided with mobile edge computing (MEC) services, wireless devices (WDs) no longer have to experience long latency in running their desired programs locally, but can pay to offload computation tasks to the edge server. Given its limited storage space, it is important for the edge server at the base station (BS) to determine which service programs to cache by meeting and guiding WDs' offloading decisions. In this article, we propose an MEC service pricing scheme to coordinate with the service caching decisions and control WDs' task offloading behavior in a cellular network. We propose a two-stage dynamic game of incomplete information to model and analyze the two-stage interaction between the BS and multiple associated WDs. Specifically, in Stage I, the BS determines the MEC service caching and announces the service program prices to the WDs, with the objective to maximize its expected profit under both storage and computation resource constraints. In Stage II, given the prices of different service programs, each WD selfishly decides its offloading decision to minimize individual service delay and cost, without knowing the other WDs' desired program types or local execution delays. Despite the lack of WD's information and the coupling of all the WDs' offloading decisions, we derive the optimal threshold-based offloading policy that can be easily adopted by the WDs in Stage II at the Bayesian equilibrium. In particular, a WD is more likely to offload when there are fewer WDs competing for the edge server's computation resource, or when it perceives a good channel condition or low MEC service price. Then, by predicting the WDs' offloading equilibrium, we jointly optimize the BS' pricing and service caching in Stage I via a low-complexity algorithm. In particular, we first study the differentiated pricing scheme and prove that the same price should be charged to the cached programs of the same workload. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a low-complexity uniform pricing heuristics.}

Prior works on IRS mainly consider its passive beamforming design and performance optimization without the inter-IRS signal reflection, which thus do not unveil the full potential of multi-IRS assisted wireless networks. In this paper, we study a double-IRS assisted multi-user communication system with the cooperative passive beamforming design that captures the multiplicative beamforming gain from the inter-IRS channel. Under the general channel setup with the co-existence of both double- and single-reflection links, we jointly optimize the (active) receive beamforming at the base station (BS) and the cooperative (passive) reflect beamforming at the two distributed IRSs (deployed near the BS and users, respectively) to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all users. Moreover, for the single-user and multi-user setups, we analytically show the superior performance of the double-IRS cooperative system over the conventional single-IRS system in terms of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and multi-user effective channel rank, respectively. Simulation results validate our analytical results and show the practical advantages of the proposed double-IRS system with cooperative passive beamforming designs.}

	abstract = {We consider the design of a uniform circular array (UCA) system under array misalignment over line-of-sight (LoS) channels. UCAs have been considered as useful array structures since their LoS channels can be diagonalized without the channel state information at the transmitter (Tx). However, such a characteristic holds only when transceiver arrays are perfectly aligned. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an optimal design method and transceiver architectures for UCA systems under array misalignment that achieve channel capacity without knowledge of misalignment angles. To this end, we first verify that the singular values of the misaligned UCA system are independent of tilting and center-shift and small relative array rotation, but fluctuate with the Radii Product to Distance Ratio (RPDR). Using the result, we present an optimal design method for UCA systems that performs an one-dimensional search for the RPDR to maximize channel capacity, and we show that a simple zero-forcing (ZF) receiver can achieve the maximum channel capacity because of the channel characteristic at the optimal design criteria. Additionally, we propose a low-complexity precoding scheme for UCA systems in which the optimal design criteria cannot be fulfilled. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed design method and transceiver architectures.}

A novel grant-free massive random access (MRA) strategy is proposed, considering both the sporadic user traffic and short packet features. Specifically, the notions of active detection time (ADT) and active detection period (ADP) are introduced so that active user detection can be performed multiple times within one coherence time. By taking sporadic user traffic and short packet features into consideration, we model the joint active user detection and channel estimation issue into a dynamic compressive sensing (CS) problem with the underlying sparse signals exhibiting substantial temporal correlation. This paper builds a probabilistic model to capture the temporal structure and establishes a corresponding factor graph. A novel sequential approximate message passing (S-AMP) algorithm is designed to sequentially perform inference and recover sparse signal from one ADT to the next. The Bayes active user detector and the corresponding channel estimator are then derived. Numerical results show that the proposed S-AMP algorithm enhances active user detection and channel estimation performances over competing algorithms under our scenario.}

Taking advantage of the UPA geometry and wide bandwidth, we advocate the use of the angle-delay channel power matrix (ADCPM) as a new type of fingerprint to replace the traditional ones. The ADCPM embeds the stable and stationary multipath characteristics, e.g., delay, power, and angles in the vertical and horizontal directions, which are beneficial to positioning. We further exploit the sparsity of the ADCPM to reduce the noise contamination in the ADCPM. Taking ADCPM fingerprints as the inputs, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) convolution neural network (CNN) enabled learning method to localize the 3D positions of the mobile terminals (MTs). In particular, such a 3D CNN model consists of a convolution refinement module to refine the elementary feature maps from the ADCPM fingerprints, three extended Inception modules to extract the advanced feature maps, and a regression module to estimate the 3D positions. By intensive simulations, the proposed 3D CNN-enabled positioning method is demonstrated to achieve higher positioning accuracy than the traditional searching-based ones, with reduced computational complexity and storage overhead, and robust to noise contamination.}

	abstract = {Quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) based millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system design using frequency diverse array (FDA) is proposed in this article. Since spatial modulation techniques (SMT) employ maximum likelihood (ML) based detector at receiver, the computational complexity increases vastly. Moreover, numerous existing SMT methods utilize phased array (PA), where only angle dependent communication is possible. In this article, we propose to use a standard FDA that exploits a small linearly increasing frequency offset across the array for range-angle dependent QSM wireless communications. That is, the in-phase and quadrature components of transmission vector utilize slightly different frequencies to deliver the information. Furthermore, we propose a suboptimal multi-stage (MS) detector in the receiver, which applies a matched filtering (i.e., bandpass filters matched to the corresponding frequency offsets) approach to decode the index bits at first step, whereas, merely, two most probable estimated indices are utilized further to decode associated data bits using a standard ML method. Adhering an improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to an FDA based range-angle dependent transmission, simulation and numerical results show the improved performance of the proposed design over existing SM and QSM based schemes, while MS approach reduces the receiver’s computational complexity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the resource slicing problem in a dynamic multiplexing scenario of two distinct 5G services, namely Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB). While eMBB services focus on high data rates, URLLC is very strict in terms of latency and reliability. In view of this, the resource slicing problem is formulated as an optimization problem that aims at maximizing the eMBB data rate subject to a URLLC reliability constraint, while considering the variance of the eMBB data rate to reduce the impact of immediately scheduled URLLC traffic on the eMBB reliability. To solve the formulated problem, an optimization-aided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework is proposed, including: 1) eMBB resource allocation phase, and 2) URLLC scheduling phase. In the first phase, the optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems and then each subproblem is transformed into a convex form to obtain an approximate resource allocation solution. In the second phase, a DRL-based algorithm is proposed to intelligently distribute the incoming URLLC traffic among eMBB users. Simulation results show that our proposed approach can satisfy the stringent URLLC reliability while keeping the eMBB reliability higher than 90%.}

	abstract = {Herein, a precoding scheme is developed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that use one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the transmitter and receiver, respectively, as a means to reduce the power consumption. Two different one-bit architectures are presented. In the first, a single user MIMO system is considered where the DACs and ADCs of the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to be one-bit and in the second, a network of analog phase shifters is added at the receiver as an additional analog-only processing step with the view to mitigate some of the effects of coarse quantization. The precoding design problem is formulated and then split into two NP-hard optimization problems, which are solved by an algorithmic solution based on the Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) framework. The design of the analog post-coding matrix for the second architecture is decoupled from the precoding design and is solved by an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Numerical results show that the proposed precoding scheme successfully mitigates the effects of coarse quantization and the proposed systems achieve a performance close to that of systems equipped with full resolution DACs/ADCs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security based on space shift keying (SSK) in which bit-to-spatial mapping of antenna indices dynamically adapts according to the partial channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate channel at the transmitter (Tx). Further, the Tx also adapts transmit power allocation to each transmit antenna according to partial CSI. Since an eavesdropper (Eve) is not (usually) aware of the legitimate CSI, it cannot successfully decode the antenna index; thus, transmission over the legitimate channel is secured from the wiretapping of Eve. An important virtue of the proposed scheme is that the Tx does not require full CSI of the legitimate and eavesdropper channels to secure the confidential information. The proposed work focuses on the secrecy rate (SR) and bit error rate (BER) of the considered multiple-input single-output system over Rayleigh fading channels. Approximate expressions of Bob's data rate for 2-ary and 4-ary SSK modulations are derived in closed-form. Furthermore, an upper-bound of Bob's data rate for N a -ary SSK modulation is also derived. In order to obtain the secrecy rate for the proposed scheme, we also evaluate Eve's data rate. Analytical results of SR and BER demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme. All numerical results are thoroughly verified by using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {Accurate channel parameter estimation is challenging for wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) large-scale hybrid arrays, due to beam squint and much fewer radio frequency (RF) chains than antennas. This article presents a novel joint angle and delay estimation (JADE) approach for wideband mmWave fully-connected hybrid uniform cylindrical arrays. We first design a new hybrid beamformer to reduce the dimension of received signals on the horizontal plane by exploiting the convergence of the Bessel function, and to reduce the active beams in the vertical direction through preselection. The important recurrence relationship of the received signals needed for subspace-based angle and delay estimation is preserved, even with substantially fewer RF chains than antennas. Then, linear interpolation is generalized to reconstruct the received signals of the hybrid beamformer, so that the signals can be coherently combined across the whole band to suppress the beam squint. As a result, efficient subspace-based algorithm algorithms can be developed to estimate the angles and delays of multipath components. The estimated delays and angles are further matched and correctly associated with different paths in the presence of non-negligible noises, by putting forth perturbation operations. Simulations show that the proposed approach can approach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimation with a significantly lower computational complexity than existing techniques.}

	abstract = {Referring to the system equipped with single-bit converters, 1-bit mmWave communications is gaining increasing attention for its superb cost efficiency. However, the inherent non-linear distortion renders the detectors designed for classical transparent communications inapplicable, leading to an urgent need for novel detecting solutions dedicated to 1-bit systems. Although a few endeavours have been made towards learning-based (as opposed to the traditional model-based) detectors for multi-user (MU) 1-bit systems, they are exclusively limited to narrowband channels and fail to cope with the multi-path effects inevitable to mmWave systems. In this paper, we first design a learning-based detector (LeaD) for general wideband multi-user (wMU) scenarios. Though stemming from block-based detection, the classic workhorse for transparent systems, LeaD faces either unaffordable complexity or unacceptable data rate in 1-bit systems. Given the impracticability of block-based detection, we resort to the serial detection mechanism and henceforth devise a so-termed model-enhanced (Me-)LeaD by utilizing the channel delay-domain information. Me-LeaD can be further augmented by exploiting the channel angular-domain information. Underpinned by a judiciously tailored method for extracting tbe model information, the proposed Me-LeaD demonstrates a decent overall performance in general 1-bit wMU scenarios.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a multi-user full-duplex (FD) two-way relaying system with decode-and-forward protocol is considered where all the nodes are assumed to be mobile and to have FD abilities. The residual self-interference (RSI) at each node is modeled as a Rician distributed random variable and the effect of mobility is incorporated by adopting the first order auto-regressive (AR) model. Then, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) based scheduling schemes namely random scheduling, absolute channel power-based (CPB) scheduling, hybrid scheduling, and normalized CPB scheduling, are modified and the user pair selection is carried out on the basis of instantaneous channel statistics. The performance of the considered framework is analyzed for the modified scheduling schemes in terms of error probability and average rate. Next, the closed-form expressions for the symbol error probability (SEP) and average rate are derived for independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. Also, the numerical analysis highlighting the impact of user mobility and imperfect channel estimation on the scheduling strategies, fairness is presented. Furthermore, the impacts of the degree of traffic asymmetry, scheduling fairness, user mobility, channel estimation errors and RSI on the system performance are investigated. Numerical results are validated through the Monte Carlo simulations.}

	abstract = {5G mmWave MIMO systems enable accurate estimation of the user position and mapping of the radio environment using a single snapshot when both the base station (BS) and user are equipped with large antenna arrays. However, massive arrays are initially expected only at the BS side, likely leaving users with one or very few antennas. In this paper, we propose a novel method for single-snapshot localization and mapping in the more challenging case of a user equipped with a single-antenna receiver. The joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem is formulated and its solution formally derived. To avoid the burden of a full-dimensional search over the space of the unknown parameters, we present a novel practical approach that exploits the sparsity of mmWave channels to compute an approximate joint ML estimate. A thorough analysis, including the derivation of the Cramér-Rao lower bounds, reveals that accurate localization and mapping can be achieved also in a MISO setup even when the direct line-of-sight path between the BS and the user is severely attenuated.}

	abstract = {We investigate the feasibility of second-order statistics-based blind channel estimation in the context of two-hop full-duplex relay systems. To that end, the performance of blind and traditional pilot-based (training sequence based) channel estimation approaches are compared. This is accomplished by deriving the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) expressions for both blind and pilot-based schemes, and comparing them to each other and to the mean-squared error (MSE) values measured via simulation. Post-equalization SINR expressions are also derived for both blind and pilot-based methods. Furthermore, a modified post-equalization SINR expression, where the channel estimation error is replaced by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is proposed, providing an upper bound for the post-equalization SINR. These analytically-predicted SINR values for the blind approach are compared to the SINR measured via link simulation. The performance of the two channel estimation methods is analyzed by comparing the CRLB, post-equalization SINR, and BER performance for two significantly different transmission packet sizes. All of the above metrics indicate that blind estimation provides clear performance advantages relative to the pilot-based counterpart. Additionally, the blind approach eliminates the overhead associated with the pilot-based method, where a portion of the system resources is allocated to the pilot sequence. To quantify this, the spectral efficiency of the FD relay system employing blind and pilot-based channel estimation methods are compared, indicating that at high SNR, the blind approach provides around 2-bps/Hz spectral efficiency gain relative to a typical pilot-based method. Finally, the computational complexity of the two channel estimation techniques are evaluated and compared. The blind approach has a clear computational advantage for larger packet sizes.}

	abstract = {As a means to achieve thousand-fold throughput improvements of future wireless communications, ultra-dense network (UDN) where a large number of small cells are densely deployed on top of the macro cells has received great deal of attention in recent years. While UDN offers number of benefits, intensive deployment of small cells may pose a serious concern in the energy consumption. Over the years, to reduce the energy consumption of UDN, an approach that turns off the lightly loaded base stations (BSs) has been proposed. However, determining the proper on/off modes of BSs is a challenging problem due to the huge computational overhead and inefficiency caused by the delayed decision. An aim of this paper is to propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based framework to achieve reduction of energy consumption in UDN. By exploiting the long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract the temporally correlated features from the channel information and the feedforward network to make BS on/off mode decision, we can control the on/off modes of BSs, thereby achieving a considerable reduction of the cumulative energy consumption. From the extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed technique is effective in reducing the energy consumption of UDN.}

	abstract = {Integrating robots into cellular networks creating connected robotic users has emerged as a promising technology for future smart cities and smart factories due to their low cost and high maneuverability. However, the requirement of establishing stable and high-quality communication links to the robotic users greatly restricts their applicability, especially in indoor environments where obstacles may block the wireless link. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, an indoor robot navigation system is investigated, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is employed to enhance the connectivity between the access point (AP) and robotic users. Both single-user and multiple-user scenarios are considered. In the single-user scenario, one mobile robotic user (MRU) communicates with the AP. In the multiple-user scenario, the AP serves one MRU and one static robotic user (SRU) employing either non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) or orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission. The considered system is optimized for minimization of the travelling time/distance of the MRU from a given starting point to a predefined final location, while satisfying constraints on the communication quality of the robotic users. To this end, a radio map based approach is proposed to exploit location-dependent channel propagation knowledge. For the single-user scenario, a channel power gain map is constructed, which characterizes the spatial distribution of the maximum expected effective channel power gain of the MRU for the optimal IRS phase shifts. Based on the obtained channel power gain map, the communication-aware robot path planing problem is solved by exploiting graph theory. For the multiple-user scenario, a communication rate map is constructed, which characterizes the spatial distribution of the maximum expected rate of the MRU for the optimal power allocation at the AP and the optimal IRS phase shifts subject to a minimum rate requirement for the SRU. The joint optimization problem is efficiently solved by invoking bisection search and successive convex approximation methods. Then, a graph theory based solution for the robot path planning problem is derived by exploiting the obtained communication rate map. Our numerical results show that: 1) the required travelling distance of the MRU can be significantly reduced by deploying an IRS; 2) NOMA yields a higher communication rate for the MRU than OMA; 3) the IRS performance gain is significantly more pronounced for NOMA than for OMA.}

We take a comparative approach to study two types of overloaded CD-NOMA, i.e., sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and dense code multiple access (DCMA), which are distinctive from each other in terms of their codebooks having sparsity or not. By analysing their individual diversity orders (DO) in Rayleigh fading channels, it is found that DCMA can be designed with the aid of generalized sphere decoder (i.e., a nonlinear multiuser detector) to enjoy full DO which is equal to the maximum number of resource nodes in the system. This is in contrast to SCMA whose error rate suffers from limited DO equal to the codebook sparsity (i.e., the effective number of resource nodes occupied by each user). We conduct theoretical analysis for the codebook design criteria and propose to use generalized sphere decoder for DCMA detection. We numerically evaluate two types of multiple access schemes under “ 4×6” (i.e., six users communicate over four subcarriers) and “ 5×10” NOMA settings and reveal that DCMA gives rise to significantly improved error rate performance in Rayleigh fading channels, whilst having decoding complexity comparable to that of SCMA.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate three different concepts for robust link-level performance under doubly-dispersive wireless channels, namely, i) channel estimation, ii) cyclic prefix (CP)-free transmission, and iii) waveform design. We employ a unique word-based channel estimation, where we decouple the channel related errors into channel estimation error (CEE) and Doppler error (DE). Then, we show that a trade-off between CEE and DE emerges in the frame design, where the system can be optimized to achieve the minimum composite channel error. Another strategy to improve the link-level performance is to suppress the CP of the sub-blocks. This allows for better channel estimation due to the reduced transmission time, with the penalty of requiring the CP-restoration processing at the receiver. Furthermore, we propose the waveform design based on the equal-reliability criterion (ERC), leading to the block multiplexing-orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (BM-OCDM). This waveform is advantageous in the CP-free transmission mode, where the data symbols have equally distributed interference from adjacent sub-blocks. Our framework is a generalization of the recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), which fails to achieve the ERC. The link-level simulations show that at high modulation and coding scheme, the proposed BM-OCDM provides superior link-level performance than OTFS.}

	abstract = {We consider a cache-aided interference network which consists of a library of N files, K T transmitters and K R receivers (users), each equipped with a local cache of size M T and M R files respectively, and connected via a discrete-time additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Each receiver requests an arbitrary file from the library. The objective is to design a cache placement without knowing the receivers' requests and a communication scheme such that the sum Degrees of Freedom (sum-DoF) of the delivery is maximized. This network model with one-shot transmission was firstly investigated by Naderializadeh et al., who proposed a scheme achieving an order-optimal one-shot sum-DoF of min {M T K T +K R M R /N, K R }. One of the biggest limitations of this scheme is the requirement of high subpacketizations. This paper attempts to design new algorithms to reduce the file subpacketization in such a network without hurting the sum-DoF. In particular, we propose a new approach for both prefetching and linearly coded delivery based on a combinatorial design called hypercube. The proposed approach reduces the subpacketization exponentially in terms of K R M/N ( M=M T or M R represents the transmitter/receiver cache size) and achieves the identical one-shot sum DoF when M T K T +K R M R /N ≤ K R .}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of decentralized sensor selection in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network-based Internet-of-Things, for monitoring a spatio-temporally varying process. To do so, an adaptive edge computing framework and its variants are proposed which distributedly optimize a critical trade-off between sensing quality and remaining energy of the sensor nodes (SNs). Unlike the existing distributed sensing approaches, the proposed one aims to maintain energy balance among the SNs. The original sensor selection problem is decoupled into multiple sub-problems, each solvable at an edge node elected as head of a coverage region containing a set of SNs. The sub-problem in each coverage region is adapted to variations of the underlying process. In each region, the process is estimated using PCA-SBL (principal component analysis-sparse Bayesian learning) on noisy signal measured by the respective active SNs. Further, to correctly adapt to the process and estimate the signal, a novel logic is designed that indicates requirement of network retraining in the next measurement cycle. The results from extensive simulation studies illustrate improved energy efficiency and network energy balance of the proposed framework over the existing closest competitive centralized and decentralized approaches. The proposed framework is tested on synthetic as well as real data-sets of a sensor network.}

	abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA), which helps improve spectrum efficiency (SE) and enhance connectivity, has been proposed as a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for 5G systems. In SCMA, codebook design determines system overload ratio and detection performance at a receiver. In this paper, an SCMA codebook design approach is proposed based on uniquely decomposable constellation group (UDCG). We show that there are N+1 ( N ≥ 1) constellations in the proposed UDCG, each of which has M (M ≥ 2) constellation points. These constellations are allocated to users sharing the same resource. Combining the constellations allocated on multiple resources of each user, we can obtain UDCG-based codebook sets. Bit error ratio (BER) performance will be discussed in terms of coding gain maximization with superimposed constellations and UDCG-based codebooks. Simulation results demonstrate that the superimposed constellation of each resource has large minimum Euclidean distance (MED) and meets uniquely decodable constraint. Thus, BER performance of the proposed codebook design approach outperforms that of the existing codebook design schemes in both uncoded and coded SCMA systems, especially for large-size codebooks.}

In this paper, we consider an ultra-dense LEO-based terrestrial-satellite network where terrestrial users can access the network through the LEO-assisted backhaul. We aim to minimize the number of satellites in the constellation while satisfying the backhaul requirement of each user terminal (UT). We first derive the average total backhaul capacity of each UT, based on which a three-dimensional constellation optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize the number of satellites in the constellation. Simulation results verify our theoretical capacity analysis and show that for any given coverage ratio requirement, the corresponding optimized LEO satellite constellation can be obtained by the proposed three-dimensional constellation optimization algorithm. Given the same number of deployed LEO satellites, the average coverage ratio of the proposed LEO satellite constellation is at least 10 percentage points higher than that of Telesat constellation.}

In this paper, joint multi-user cooperative partial offloading, transmission scheduling and computation allocating is discussed for device-to-device (D2D) underlay mobile edge computing (MEC). By considering stochastic application requests, unpredictable MTs states, time-varying channel states and computation resources, a customized application offloading model, which aims to minimize the network-wide response latency and energy consumption simultaneously, is formulated. In order to solve this non-convex and non-smooth optimization problem, an online resource coordinating and allocating scheme (ORCAS) is proposed by exploiting Lyapunov optimization theory, variable substitution technique and resource provisioning priority mechanism. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ORCAS can 1) drive the application response cost converge to the minimum; 2) achieve superior performance (e.g., the average network-wide response cost under ORCAS is approximately 19.14% lower than that under partial offloading directly); 3) adapt to dynamic situations in terms of stochastic user demands and channel states.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that can deal with the distributed issue in machine learning and still guarantee high learning performance. However, it is impractical that all users will sacrifice their resources to join the FL algorithm. This motivates us to study the incentive mechanism design for FL. In this paper, we consider a FL system that involves one base station (BS) and multiple mobile users. The mobile users use their own data to train the local machine learning model, and then send the trained models to the BS, which generates the initial model, collects local models and constructs the global model. Then, we formulate the incentive mechanism between the BS and mobile users as an auction game where the BS is an auctioneer and the mobile users are the sellers. In the proposed game, each mobile user submits its bids according to the minimal energy cost that the mobile users experiences in participating in FL. To decide winners in the auction and maximize social welfare, we propose the primal-dual greedy auction mechanism. The proposed mechanism can guarantee three economic properties, namely, truthfulness, individual rationality and efficiency. Finally, numerical results are shown to demonstrate the performance effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on designing a high-data-rate noncoherent chaotic communication scheme to satisfy the demand of the explosive growth in data traffic. To achieve this goal, a joint time-frequency index modulation assisted multiple-mode DCSK (JTFIM-MM-DCSK) system is proposed, where a pair of distinguished signal modes are modulated into the selected subcarriers and another signal mode is transmitted by the unselected subcarriers. In this configuration, besides the modulated bits used for physical transmission, the carrier index bits and time slot index bits, conveyed by the state of whether subcarriers and time slots are selected or not, are also transmitted implicitly to achieve higher data rate. Moreover, the design of multiple-mode signals ensures that it is taking full advantage of all subcarriers and time slots to transmit the information bits, thereby improving the data rate significantly. The bit error rate (BER) expressions of the JTFIM-MM-DCSK system are derived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels, which are checked by computer simulations. Finally, the advantage of the JTFIM-MM-DCSK system over other up-to-date noncoherent chaotic communication systems is demonstrated in terms of BER performance through extensive computer simulations.}

We first provide theoretical modeling for a given route to reveal how its end-to-end security/QoS performance is related to the transmitting power of legitimate nodes along the route and the jamming power of jammers in the network. We then design an incentive mechanism that stimulates jammers to generate artificial jamming for security enhancement, and also develop a non-cooperative game framework to resolve the jamming power setting issue here. Based on the security/QoS performance modeling of the route and jamming power setting, we further propose a theoretical framework to determine the optimal transmitting power of nodes along the route such that its optimal transmission security can be achieved under a QoS constraint. Finally, with the help of the power setting results of the given route, we formulate a shortest weighted path-finding problem to identify the optimal route for data delivery in the network, which can be solved by employing the Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra's algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed routing scheme is individually rational, stable, distributed and computationally efficient.}

Resonant beam communications (RBCom) is an OWC technology which simultaneously satisfies the needs of non-mechanical mobility and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It has the self-alignment feature and therefore avoids positioning and pointing operations. However, RBCom undergoes echo interference. Here we propose an echo-interference-free RBCom system design based on second harmonic generation. The transmitter and the receiver constitute a spatially separated laser resonator, in which the retro-reflective resonant beam is formed and tracks the receiver automatically. This structure provides the channel with adaptive capability in beamforming and alignment, which is similar to the concept of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enhanced communications, but without hardware and software controllers. Besides, we establish an analytical model to evaluate the beam radius, the beam power, and the channel capacity. The results show that our system achieves longer distance and smaller beam diameter for the transmission beyond 10 Gbit/s, compared with the existing OWC technologies.}

Notably, joint maximization of the energy-efficiency (EE) and spectrum-efficiency (SE) and interference management are investigated for distributing contents from the cache-enabled fog access points (F-APs) and cloud base station (CBS) to the user devices (UDs). In our envisioned system, the UDs are grouped into multiple non-overlapping device-clusters based on their locations. A rate-splitting with common message decoding based transmission strategy is applied to enable UDs of each device-cluster to receive data from a suitably selected F-AP and CBS over the same radio resource blocks. To maximize system EE and SE jointly, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated and it is solved in three stages. At first, by employing the\nϵ\n-constraint method, the MOOP is converted to an EE-SE trade-off optimization problem. Then, by leveraging iterative function evaluation based power control and generalized 3D-resource matching, the EE-SE trade-off optimization problem is solved and a novel resource allocation algorithm is proposed to obtain near-optimal Pareto-front for the proposed MOOP. To reduce the complexity of obtaining near-optimal Pareto-front, a sub-optimal resource allocation algorithm is proposed as well. Finally, a low-complexity algorithm is devised to select a suitable operating EE-SE pair from the obtained Pareto-front. The conducted simulations demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation schemes achieve substantial improvement of system EE and SE over the benchmark schemes.}

To be specific, we first introduce a Unitary transformation method to estimate the propagation delay of the proposed channel model for the first tap in the preliminary stage before the mobile transmitter (MT) and mobile receiver (MR) move. Then, we estimate the real-time angular parameters based on the estimated delay and moving time/directions/velocities of the MT and MR. Furthermore, we estimate the expressions of the real-time complex channel impulse responses (CIRs), which can be used to characterize the physical properties of the proposed channel model, by substituting the estimates of the time-varying AoD and AoA and model parameters into the complex CIRs. Numerical results of the channel characteristics fit the theory results very well, which validate that the proposed channel model is practical for characterizing the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) V2V communication systems.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a promising solution to reconfigure the wireless environment in a controllable way. To compensate for the double-fading attenuation in the RIS-aided link, a large number of passive reflecting elements (REs) are conventionally deployed at the RIS, resulting in large surface size and considerable circuit power consumption. In this paper, we propose a new type of RIS, called active RIS, where each RE is assisted by active loads (negative resistance), that reflect and amplify the incident signal instead of only reflecting it with the adjustable phase shift as in the case of a passive RIS. Therefore, for a given power budget at the RIS, a strengthened RIS-aided link can be achieved by increasing the number of active REs as well as amplifying the incident signal. We consider the use of an active RIS to a single input multiple output (SIMO) system. However, it would unintentionally amplify the RIS-correlated noise, and thus the proposed system has to balance the conflict between the received signal power maximization and the RIS-correlated noise minimization at the receiver. To achieve this goal, it has to optimize the reflecting coefficient matrix at the RIS and the receive beamforming at the receiver. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the receive beamforming is obtained with a closed-form solution based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion, while the reflecting coefficient matrix is obtained by solving a series of sequential convex approximation (SCA) problems. Simulation results show that the proposed active RIS-aided system could achieve better performance over the conventional passive RIS-aided system with the same power budget.}

A basis set for the desired signal is then learnt over the SUR, via dictionary learning techniques. In the final signal recovery stage, a novel constrained sparse coding (CSC) process is proposed. The CSC reforms the conventional sparse coding (SC) via incorporating signal-specific constraints. Unlike existing SAIC algorithms, the proposed scheme is completely independent of a prior knowledge on the interferences. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above proposed schemes under varied interference intensities and environmental noise levels. The proposed scheme outperformed competing SAIC schemes by about 5dB signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement. The proposed CSC scheme outperformed the conventional SC by about 9dB SINR improvement, besides the superior recovery fidelity of signal property.}

	abstract = {Employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks as relays has emerged as an appealing solution to assist remote or blocked communication nodes. In this case, the network security becomes a great challenge due to the presence of malicious eavesdroppers. In this paper, we perform a secrecy analysis for a UAV-based mmWave relaying network. We first investigate the relaying scheme without jamming where the UAV decodes and forwards the information from the source to the destination with malicious eavesdropping. Furthermore, to enhance the secrecy performance, we propose a cooperative jamming scheme via utilizing the destination and an external UAV to cooperatively disrupt the eavesdroppers at the two stages of relaying, respectively. Using the probability of line-of-sight (LoS) between the UAV and ground nodes, the three-dimensional (3D) antenna gain, and the Nakagami-m small-scale fading model, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the two schemes with and without jamming is analyzed. Closed-form expressions for the SOP of the two schemes are obtained by employing the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical expressions of SOP and to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {To achieve an efficient and reliable data transmission in time-varying conditions, a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission scheme based on rateless codes (NOMA-RC) is proposed in the multicast system in this paper. Using rateless codes at the packet level, the system can generate enough encoded data packets according to users' requirements to cope with adverse environments. The performance of the NOMA-RC multicast system with delay constraints is analyzed over Rayleigh fading channels. The closed-form expressions for the frame error ratio and the average transmission time are derived for two cases which are a broadcast communication scenario (Scenario 1) and a relay communication scenario (Scenario 2). Under the condition that the quality of service for the edge user is satisfied, an optimization model of power allocation is established to maximize the sum rate. Simulation results show that Scenario 2 can provide better block error ratio performance and exhibit less transmission time than Scenario 1. When compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) with rateless codes system, the proposed system can save on the transmission time and improve the system throughput.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a wireless-powered two-way communication, called transmit-harvest-respond, with co-channel interference. The two-way communication considered here comprises three steps: i) transmitters send data signals, ii) receivers decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the received signals using a policy of time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS), and iii) receivers transmit responses back to transmitters using this harvested energy. We aim to find the transmit power and energy harvesting ratios that maximize the sum rate of the forward links while ensuring a minimum rate requirement for each backward link. Due to the non-convexity and NP hardness of the optimization problem considered here, we first derive suboptimal solutions using an iterative algorithm (IA) on the basis of asymptotic strong duality. In view of the high computation time of the IA, we then design an efficient deep neural network (DNN) framework and novel training strategy as a means of combining supervised and unsupervised training. Specifically, DNNs are pre-trained using the suboptimal solutions obtained by the IA in a supervised manner, as a means of initialization; further training is then applied to DNNs using a well-designed loss function in an unsupervised manner to enhance performance. Simulation results reveal that the pre-training technique using IA solutions is beneficial for improving the performance of the DNN. The proposed hybrid scheme thus achieves near-optimal performances with a lower computation time, compared with the use of IA or DNN alone.}

Then, we prove that the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of any IG-based composite fading model are directly expressed in terms of a Laplace-domain statistic of the underlying fast fading model and, in some relevant cases, as a mixture of well-known state-of-the-art distributions. Also, exact and asymptotic expressions for the outage probability are provided, which are valid for any choice of baseline fading distribution. Finally, we exemplify our approach by presenting several application examples for IG-based composite fading models, for which their statistical characterization is directly obtained in a simple form.}

	abstract = {The user-centric cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is promising for significantly reducing the channel training overhead because only the intra-cluster channel state information (CSI) is required. However, the inter-cluster interference may degrade the network performance. To address this problem, we present a novel framework for the uplink of user-centric C-RANs where the interference cancellation is posed as a system of bi-unknown vectors linear equations. To solve this unusual system of equations, we propose a quasi-least squares (QLS) algorithm and analyze its robustness by exploiting the random matrix theory. We reveal the fact that QLS is very sensitive to the channel estimation error due to involving the inverse of an ill-conditioned matrix. It is well known that truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) is an effective regularization scheme that can mitigate this ill-conditioning effect. Accordingly, we employ TSVD to further improve the robustness of QLS against the imperfect channel estimation. In addition, since the performance of the TSVD based algorithm strongly depends on the truncation parameter, a parameter-choice method using the constant modulus (CM) feature is also provided. Finally, simulation results are presented to examine the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.}

Although blind AoA estimation has been extensively studied for digital array, few results were reported for hybrid array. Well known subspace-based methods such as MUSIC and ESPRIT have been successfully developed. However, their efficacy is reduced in hybrid array due to the loss of spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this article, we propose a method to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm uses an augmented beamspace approach and a precoding scheme such that the lost spatial DoFs can be recovered. As a result, MUSIC and ESPRIT can be used with full capacity. Theoretical analysis is conducted to obtain lower bounds of the estimation-error variances. Simulations with an OFDM system show that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory performance and the theoretical bounds are tight.}

Due to time-varying communication channels, dynamic user clustering is a promising method to increase the throughput of NOMA-IoT networks. This article develops an intelligent resource allocation scheme for uplink NOMA-IoT communications. To maximise the average performance of sum rates, this work designs an efficient optimization approach based on two reinforcement learning algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and SARSA-learning. For light traffic, SARSA-learning is used to explore the safest resource allocation policy with low cost. For heavy traffic, DRL is used to handle traffic-introduced huge variables. With the aid of the considered approach, this work addresses two main problems of fair resource allocation in NOMA techniques: 1) allocating users dynamically and 2) balancing resource blocks and network traffic. We analytically demonstrate that the rate of convergence is inversely proportional to network sizes. Numerical results show that: 1) Compared with the optimal benchmark scheme, the proposed DRL and SARSA-learning algorithms have lower complexity with acceptable accuracy and 2) NOMA-enabled IoT networks outperform the conventional orthogonal multiple access based IoT networks in terms of system throughput.}

To reduce interference and increase capacity, this work proposes a new resource allocation optimization and network management framework for wireless networks using neighborhood-based optimization rather than fully centralized or fully decentralized methods. We first utilize hierarchical clustering with a minimax linkage criterion for forming the virtual cells. Once the virtual cells are formed we consider two cooperation models: the interference coordination model and the coordinated multi-point decoding model. In the first model, base stations in a virtual cell decode their signals independently but allocate the communication resources cooperatively. In the second model, base stations in the same virtual cell allocate the communication resources and decode their signals cooperatively. We address the resource allocation problem for each of these cooperation models. Our numerical results indicate that the proper design of the neighborhood-based optimization leads to significant gains in sum rate over fully decentralized optimization. Nonetheless, they may have a significant sum rate penalty compared to fully centralized optimization. In particular, neighborhood-based optimization has a significant sum rate penalty compared to fully centralized optimization in the coordinated multi-point model, but not in the interference coordination model.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique that enables many edge devices to train a machine learning model collaboratively in wireless networks. By exploiting the superposition nature of wireless waveforms, over-the-air computation (AirComp) can accelerate model aggregation and hence facilitate communication-efficient FL. Due to channel fading, power control is crucial in AirComp. Prior works assume that the signals to be aggregated from each device, i.e., local gradients have identical statistics. In FL, however, gradient statistics vary over both training iterations and feature dimensions, and are unknown in advance. This paper studies the power control problem for over-the-air FL by taking gradient statistics into account. The goal is to minimize the aggregation error by optimizing the transmit power at each device subject to average power constraints. We obtain the optimal policy in closed form when gradient statistics are given. Notably, we show that the optimal transmit power is continuous and monotonically decreases with the squared multivariate coefficient of variation (SMCV) of gradient vectors. We then propose a method to estimate gradient statistics with negligible communication cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed gradient-statistics-aware power control achieves higher test accuracy than the existing schemes for a wide range of scenarios.}

	abstract = {We study federated edge learning (FEEL), where wireless edge devices, each with its own dataset, learn a global model collaboratively with the help of a wireless access point acting as the parameter server (PS). At each iteration, wireless devices perform local updates using their local data and the most recent global model received from the PS, and send their local updates to the PS over a wireless fading multiple access channel (MAC). The PS then updates the global model according to the signal received over the wireless MAC, and shares it with the devices. Motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose an analog `over-the-air' aggregation scheme, in which the devices transmit their local updates in an uncoded fashion. However, unlike recent literature on over-the-air FEEL, here we assume that the devices do not have channel state information (CSI), while the PS has imperfect CSI. On the other hand, the PS is equipped with multiple antennas to alleviate the destructive effect of the channel, exacerbated due to the lack of perfect CSI. We design a receive beamforming scheme at the PS, and show that it can compensate for the lack of perfect CSI when the PS has a sufficient number of antennas. We also derive the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm highlighting the impact of the lack of perfect CSI, as well as the number of PS antennas. Both the experimental results and the convergence analysis illustrate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm with the number of PS antennas, where the wireless fading MAC becomes deterministic despite the lack of perfect CSI when the PS has a sufficiently large number of antennas.}

However, both primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) undertake the risk of location information leakage: a malicious PU may illegally collect SUs' location information to manipulate market decisions; a malicious SU would threat a PU's operational privacy by inferring the PU's location through seemingly inoffensive queries. To protect both PUs' and SUs' location information in spectrum trading, a bilateral privacy preservation framework is introduced in this paper. A game-theoretic approach based on the Stackelberg model is proposed to achieve the tradeoff between the privacy-preserving level and user utility. With the proposed approach, both PUs and SUs can maximize their utilities while maintaining their location privacy to desired levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively enhance user utility gain and strengthen user privacy guarantee by flexibly adjusting their privacy levels in practice.}

Considering that the reader needs to collect information from multiple IoT devices in practice, and the traditional multiple access schemes that require coordination among users are unaffordable for the passive devices, we propose a random code assisted multiple access scheme, in which each backscatter device (BD) independently chooses a random code to spread its signal and the incident signal is backscattered. To avoid the need of the instantaneous information, including the specific codes and the instantaneous channel state information of the backscatter links, and to optimize the transmit power and the BD reflection coefficients, we derive the asymptotic BD signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by employing the large-dimension random matrix theory. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum asymptotic SINR among BDs with guaranteeing the primary target rate. By investigating the property of the problem, the original problem is transformed and solved by the proposed iterative-based algorithm. Extensive simulations are executed to verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {During the last few years, with the decrease of their sizes and costs, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) became more feasible for their use in general-purpose applications. As an important basis for UAV applications, the Air-to-Ground (A2G) radio propagation channel has gained attention in the channel modeling literature. However, whereas the A2G propagation channel is inherently dynamic (time-varying), the majority of the available models do not consider such a time-variability. This paper proposes a channel multi-path component (MPC) tracking algorithm and shows its ability to analyze the data collected by a real A2G measurement campaign in a suburban environment. Based on the obtained results, a time-varying statistical channel model for A2G communications in realistic suburban scenarios is proposed. The model is able to stochastically characterize parameters related to the birth and time-of-life of the multi-path components (MPCs), as well as their evolution in terms of delay, Doppler frequency or magnitude. Correlation coefficients to relate different channel characteristics are also obtained. Our work shows that the MPCs evolution over time for the UAV A2G channel can be described by simple regular patterns.}

	abstract = {Improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) has shown its capability of improving the rate of interference-limited networks by exploiting the additional degrees of freedom in signal processing. This article considers a system of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) cellular network coexisting with device-to-device (D2D) communication, where the former employs proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) but the latter employs IGS to improve D2D’s rate and also to mitigate interference to the former. Both non-orthogonal and orthogonal bandwidth sharing between cellular users (CUs) and D2D pairs are considered. The problems of joint bandwidth allocation and signal beamforming to maximize the minimum CUs’ rate subject to the transmit power budget and D2D’s rate threshold are addressed, which pose critical computational challenges. Path-following algorithms of low complexity are developed for computational solutions. Two distinct scenarios, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled networks, and MISO cellular networks are simulated to give insight into the superiority of using IGS over PGS. Our results reveal that in UAV-enabled networks, orthogonal sharing produces a higher D2D’s rate, while non-orthogonal sharing offers better CUs’ rate under practical levels of D2D’s rate. In MISO systems, IGS is a game-changer, which enables the orthogonal sharing to uniformly outperform the non-orthogonal sharing in terms of CUs’ rate.}

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications face a great challenge in delivering not only the low-latency and ultra-reliable safety-related services but also the minimum throughput required entertainment services, due to the channel uncertainties caused by high mobility. This paper focuses on the robust resource management of V2X communications with the consideration of channel uncertainties. First, we formulate a transmit power minimization problem, whilst guaranteeing the different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To achieve the robustness of QoS provisions against channel uncertainties, a statistical leaning approach is developed to learn the uncertainties from the data samples of the random channel coefficients as a convex ellipsoid set, which is also called high-probability-region (HPR). Then, the highly intractable power minimization problem is converted into a second-order cone program by the robust optimization approach. Afterwards, we propose a joint set partitioning and reconstruction mechanism to further reduce the total transmit power by pruning the rough HPR into a more precise uncertainty set, which leads to a trackable second-order cone program and a linear program. Finally, we prove that the network performance can be effectively enhanced by the improvement mechanism. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the robust resource allocation approaches over the non-robust one.}

	abstract = {The employment of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) is a potential and promising solution to increase the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless communication networks. Despite their many advantages, IRS-aided communications have limitations as they are subject to high propagation losses. To overcome this, the phase rotation (shift) at each element needs to be designed in such a way as to increase the channel gain at the destination. However, this increases the system's complexity as well as its power consumption. In this article, we present an analytical framework for the performance of random rotation-based IRS-aided communications. Under this framework, we propose four low-complexity and energy efficient schemes, based on a coding or a selection approach. Both of these approaches employ random phase rotations and require limited knowledge of channel state information. Specifically, the coding-based schemes use time-varying random phase rotations to produce an equivalent time-varying channel. On the other hand, the selection-based schemes select a partition of the IRS elements based on the received signal power at the destination. Analytical expressions for the achieved outage probability and energy efficiency of each scheme are derived. It is demonstrated that all schemes can provide significant performance gains as well as full diversity order.}

	abstract = {The current literature on intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) focuses on optimizing the IRS phase shifts to yield coherent beamforming gains, under the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) of individual IRS-assisted links, which is highly impractical. This work, instead, considers the random rotations scheme at the IRS in which the reflecting elements only employ random phase rotations without requiring any CSI. The only CSI then needed is at the base station (BS) of the overall channel to implement the beamforming transmission scheme. Under this framework, we derive the sum-rate scaling laws in the large number of users regime for the IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel, with optimal dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme and the lower-complexity random beamforming (RBF) and deterministic beamforming (DBF) schemes at the BS. The random rotations scheme increases the sum-rate by exploiting multi-user diversity, but also compromises the gain to some extent due to correlation. Finally, energy efficiency maximization problems in terms of the number of BS antennas, IRS elements and transmit power are solved using the derived scaling laws. Simulation results show the proposed scheme to improve the sum-rate, with performance becoming close to that under coherent beamforming for a large number of users.}

A key challenge is to avoid signal propagation blockage due to obstacles. Much prior work uses probabilistic terrain models with model parameters learned from the statistics over a large area, and therefore, the optimization for a specific user in a small local area is poor. In contrast, this paper seeks the optimal UAV position over actual and fine-grained terrain, and develops efficient UAV positioning strategy adaptive to the degree of location-dependent line-of-sight (LOS) condition measured on the fly. It is proven that the globally optimal UAV position in 3D can be determined from the proposed search trajectory which has merely linear length in the diameter of the target area. Therefore, the proposed strategy can be practically implemented. Numerical experiments are performed over a real-world urban topology and demonstrate superior performance gain over existing strategies based on probabilistic models.}

	abstract = {Introducing cooperative coded caching into small cell networks is a promising approach to reducing traffic loads. By encoding content via maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, coded fragments can be collectively cached at small-cell base stations (SBSs) to enhance caching efficiency. However, content popularity is usually time-varying and unknown in practice. As a result, cached content is anticipated to be intelligently updated by taking into account limited caching storage and interactive impacts among SBSs. In response to these challenges, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to intelligently update cached content in dynamic environments. With the goal of minimizing long-term expected fronthaul traffic loads, we first model dynamic coded caching as a cooperative multi-agent Markov decision process. Owing to the use of MDS coding, the resulting decision-making falls into a class of constrained reinforcement learning problems with continuous decision variables. To deal with this difficulty, we custom-build a novel DRL algorithm by embedding homotopy optimization into a deep deterministic policy gradient formalism. Next, to empower the caching framework with an effective trade-off between complexity and performance, we propose centralized, and partially and fully decentralized caching controls by applying the derived DRL approach. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed multi-agent framework.}

	abstract = {This paper considers Gaussian half-duplex diamond n-relay networks, where a source communicates with a destination by hopping information through one layer of n non-communicating relays that operate in half-duplex. The main focus consists of investigating the following question: What is the contribution of a single relay on the approximate capacity of the entire network? In particular, approximate capacity refers to a quantity that approximates the Shannon capacity within an additive gap which only depends on n, and is independent of the channel parameters. This paper answers the above question by providing a fundamental bound on the ratio between the approximate capacity of the highest-performing single relay and the approximate capacity of the entire network, for any number n. Surprisingly, it is shown that such a ratio guarantee is f = 1/(2+2cos(2π/(n+2))), that is a sinusoidal function of n, which decreases as n increases. It is also shown that the aforementioned ratio guarantee is tight, i.e., there exist Gaussian half-duplex diamond n-relay networks, where the highest-performing relay has an approximate capacity equal to an f fraction of the approximate capacity of the entire network.}

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) brings abundant cloud resources to the edge of the network and provides great opportunities to improve user's quality of experience. While many recent studies have investigated the problem of computation offloading, service caching is also an important design topic of MEC. Service caching stores application-related databases or libraries in advance and enables corresponding user tasks to be offloaded. Due to the limited resources in the edge server, service caching decisions have to be made judiciously to maximize the system performance. In this paper, we study the problem of joint service caching, computation offloading, transmission and computing resource allocation in a general scenario of multiple users with multiple tasks. We aim to minimize the overall computation and delay costs for all users and formulate the optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) which is non-convex and NP-hard. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an efficiently approximate algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach and alternating optimization which always computes a locally optimal solution. Moreover, we extend the study to the scenario where each user has a computation cost constraint. Simulation results show that our algorithm can minimize the system cost effectively by utilizing the available system resources.}

Specifically, with a (practical) hybrid beamforming transceiver architecture at both the BS and UE, a multistage angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation based beamtraining algorithm that provides fast acquisition of the best beam pairs for the BS-UE link is developed. In addition, a novel joint beamtracking and data-symbols detection algorithm, equipped with an adaptive equalizer, is also developed. The algorithm can simultaneously track the best receiving beams, and produce the data estimates that are easy to extract soft bit information for soft decoding; also, it can tackle the dynamic changes of the baseband effective channel. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed receiver performs well over a broad range of SNR-it can rapidly acquire the most dominant AoAs for beamforming and constantly track the best moving beams due to UE's mobility or device rotation-and in particular, it achieves near-optimal spectral efficiency for a mobile UE with a single RF chain or very few RF chains.}

In this paper, we propose a general wideband non-stationary channel model for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication scenarios, which aims at capturing the underlying propagation characteristics of IRS-assisted communication systems. By properly adjusting the key system parameters, the proposed channel model can be used to describe various IRS-assisted communication scenarios. Furthermore, we separate the channel between the mobile transmitter (MT) and mobile receiver (MR) into the subchannel between the MT and IRS, the subchannel between the IRS and MR, and the subchannel between the MT and MR. The physical properties of each subchannel are investigated accordingly; then, we develop an equivalent channel model to study the key characteristics of the proposed IRS-assisted channel model, such as the time-varying spatial-temporal (ST) cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), and frequency CCFs. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed channel model is practical for describing the IRS-assisted MIMO wireless communication scenarios.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge caching can effectively reduce service delay but may introduce information staleness, calling for timely content refreshing. However, content refreshing consumes additional transmission resources and may degrade the delay performance of mobile systems. In this work, we propose a freshness-aware refreshing scheme to balance the service delay and content freshness measured by Age of Information (AoI). Specifically, the cached content items will be refreshed to the up-to-date version upon user requests if the AoI exceeds a certain threshold (named as refreshing window). The average AoI and service delay are derived in closed forms approximately, which reveals an AoI-delay tradeoff relationship with respect to the refreshing window. In addition, the refreshing window is optimized to minimize the average delay while meeting the AoI requirements, and the results indicate to set a smaller refreshing window for the popular content items. Extensive simulations are conducted on the OMNeT++ platform to validate the analytical results. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can restrain frequent refreshing as the request arrival rate increases, whereby the average delay can be reduced by around 80% while maintaining the AoI below one second in heavily-loaded scenarios.}

	abstract = {With excellent flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as airborne computing servers to assist smart terminals (STs) with their computationally-intense and delay-sensitive tasks. This paper presents a new UAV-assisted edge computing framework, which jointly optimizes the trajectory and CPU frequency of a fixed-wing UAV, and the offloading schedule to minimize the energy consumption of the UAV. The key idea is that we reveal the condition for the convexity of the optimization, when the UAV flies a linear trajectory. Under the condition, alternating optimization- and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithms are developed to efficiently achieve the globally optimal linear trajectory, CPU configuration, and offloading schedule. Another important aspect is that we prove the SCA-based algorithm can achieve a local optimum satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, when the revealed condition is unmet or the UAV flies horizontally in two dimensions. By analyzing the KKT conditions, we also unveil the underlying patterns for the optimal CPU frequency and offloading schedule. Extensive simulations validate the patterns and corroborate the merits of our schemes.}

	abstract = {Space-time coded generalized spatial modulation-aided sparse code division multiple access (STC/GSM-SCDMA) is proposed, which exploits the two-dimensional transmit diversity potential of both the spatial and of the frequency domain. Hence, it constitutes a promising solution for the pervasive connectivity of devices in next-generation nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. More explicitly, our STC/GSM scheme achieves diversity in the spatial-domain, while the sparse signal-spreading action of SCDMA results in frequency-domain (FD) diversity. A single-user bit error rate (BER) bound is derived as the benchmark of the BER performance of our STC/GSM-SCDMA system. Furthermore, a pair of novel detectors, namely a bespoke message passing aided (MPA) detector and a tailor-made approximate message passing (AMP) detector are conceived by designing a new factor graphs for our proposed STC/GSM-SCDMA system. The performance of these detectors is characterized in terms of their BER vs. complexity. Our simulation results show that the proposed AMP detector is capable of operating within 2 dB of the MPA detector's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement, while supporting a normalized user load of 150%, despite its appealing low complexity, which is about 1000 times lower than the MPA detector.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the performance of cooperative millimeter wave (mmWave) networks with hybrid precoding architectures. Considering joint transmissions and BS silence strategy, we propose hybrid precoding algorithms which minimize the sum power consumption of the base stations (BSs), for both fully- and partially-connected hybrid precoding (FHP and PHP, respectively) schemes, for single-carrier and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. We reformulate the analog precoding part as an equal-gain transmission problem, which only depends on the channel information, and the digital precoding part as a relaxed convex semidefinite program subject to per-user quality-of-service constraints that gives the optimal sum power consumption in terms of the BS silence strategy. In order to reduce the complexity of the hybrid precoding algorithm with optimal BS silence strategy, we propose a sub-optimal hybrid precoding algorithm that iteratively put BSs with small power into the silent mode. The simulation results show that, depending on the parameter settings, the power consumption of the PHP may be dominated by the RF transmit power and it may result in a larger power consumption than the FHP. For the cases with 2 BSs and 4 users, implementation of the FHP and the PHP in cooperative networks reduces the required RF transmit power, compared to the case in a non-cooperative network, by 71% and 56%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) has been recognized as a promising technique to provide both enhanced computational capability and sustainable energy supply to massive low-power wireless devices. However, its energy consumption becomes substantial, when the transmission link used for wireless energy transfer (WET) and for computation offloading is hostile. To mitigate this hindrance, we propose to employ the emerging technique of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in WP-MEC systems, which is capable of providing an additional link both for WET and for computation offloading. Specifically, we consider a multi-user scenario where both the WET and the computation offloading are based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Built on this model, an innovative framework is developed to minimize the energy consumption of the IRS-aided WP-MEC network, by optimizing the power allocation of the WET signals, the local computing frequencies of wireless devices, both the sub-band-device association and the power allocation used for computation offloading, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients. The major challenges of this optimization lie in the strong coupling between the settings of WET and of computing as well as the unit-modules constraint on IRS reflection coefficients. To tackle these issues, the technique of alternating optimization is invoked for decoupling the WET and computing designs, while two sets of locally optimal IRS reflection coefficients are provided for WET and for computation offloading separately relying on the successive convex approximation method. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is capable of monumentally outperforming the conventional WP-MEC network without IRSs. Quantitatively, about 80% energy consumption reduction is attained over the conventional MEC system in a single cell, where 3 wireless devices are served via 16 sub-bands, with the aid of an IRS comprising of 50 elements.}

In this analysis, we use the power metric \\mathscr P, defined as the ratio of throughput and mean delay, to understand the compromise between these two metrics. We show that, when the users' transmit power levels are adjusted to maximize \\mathscr P, two transmission regimes emerge. When the coupling degree between the queues is strong, but the traffic is not heavy, there will be plenty of opportunities for non-concurrent transmissions. Our analysis shows that, in this case, the best strategy is to prioritize one user over the other through appropriate transmit powers adjustment and to use the highest modulation order available. On the other hand, for heavy traffic, none of the users should be prioritized, and there is an optimum combination of robust modulation orders and transmit power ratio to achieve the best performance.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the massive connectivity problem in an asynchronous grant-free random access system, where a huge number of devices sporadically transmit data to a base station (BS) with imperfect synchronization. The goal is to design algorithms for joint user activity detection, delay detection, and channel estimation. By exploiting the sparsity on both user activity and delays, we formulate a hierarchical sparse signal recovery problem in both the single-antenna and the multiple-antenna scenarios. While traditional compressed sensing algorithms can be applied to these problems, they suffer high computational complexity and often require the perfect statistical information of channel and devices. This paper solves these problems by designing the Learned Approximate Message Passing (LAMP) network, which belongs to model-driven deep learning approaches and ensures efficient performance without tremendous training data. Particularly, in the multiple-antenna scenario, we design three different LAMP structures, namely, distributed, centralized and hybrid ones, to balance the performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LAMP networks can significantly outperform the conventional AMP method thanks to their ability of parameter learning. It is also shown that LAMP has robust performance to the maximal delay spread of the asynchronous users.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) cloud radio access networks (CRANs) provide new opportunities for accurate cooperative localization, in which large bandwidths and antenna arrays and increased densities of base stations enhance the delay and angular resolution. This study considers the joint location and velocity estimation of user equipment (UE) and scatterers in a three-dimensional mmWave CRAN architecture. Several existing works have achieved satisfactory results by using neural networks (NNs) for localization. However, the black box NN localization method has limited robustness and accuracy and relies on a prohibitive amount of training data to increase localization accuracy. Thus, we propose a model-based learning network for localization to address these problems. In comparison with the black box NN, we combine NNs with geometric models. Specifically, we first develop an unbiased weighted least squares (WLS) estimator by utilizing hybrid delay and angular measurements, which determine the location and velocity of the UE in only one estimator, and can obtain the location and velocity of scatterers further. The proposed estimator can achieve the Cramér-Rao lower bound under small measurement noise and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Second, we establish a NN-assisted localization method called NN-WLS by replacing the linear approximations in the proposed WLS localization model with NNs to learn the higher-order error components, thereby enhancing the performance of the estimator, especially in a large noise environment. The solution possesses the powerful learning ability of the NN and the robustness of the proposed geometric model. Moreover, the ensemble learning is applied to improve the localization accuracy further. Comprehensive simulations show that the proposed NN-WLS is superior to the benchmark methods in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and required time resources.}

	abstract = {Covert communication can hide the information transmission process from the warden to prevent adversarial eavesdropping. However, it becomes challenging when the location of warden is uncertain. In this paper, we propose a covert communication scheme against a warden with uncertain locations, which maximizes the connectivity throughput between a multi-antenna transmitter and a full-duplex jamming receiver with the limit of covert outage probability (the probability of the transmission found by the warden). First, we analyze the monotonicity of the covert outage probability to obtain the optimal location for the warden. Then, under this worst situation, we optimize the transmission rate, the transmit power and the jamming power of covert communication to maximize the connection throughput. This problem is solved in two stages. First, we derive the transmit-to-jamming power ratio limit from the maximum allowed covert outage probability. With this constraint, the connection probability is maximized over the transmit-to-jamming power ratio for a fixed transmission rate. Since the connection probability and the transmission rate are coupled, the bisection method is applied to maximize the connectivity throughput via optimizing the transmission rate iteratively. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) hybrid analog-digital beamforming is a promising approach to satisfy the low-latency constraint in multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) systems, which serve as network infrastructure for flexible deployment. However, in highly dynamic multi-UAV environments, analog beam tracking becomes a critical challenge. The overhead of additional pilot transmission at the price of spectral efficiency is shown necessary to achieve high resilience in operation. An efficient method to deal with high dynamics of UAVs applies machine learning, particularly Q-learning, to analog beam tracking. The proposed Q-learning-based beam tracking scheme uses current/past observations to design rewards from environments to facilitate prediction, which significantly increases the efficiency of data transmission and beam switching. Given the selected analog beams, the goal of digital beamforming is to maximize the SINR. The received pilot signals are utilized to approximate the desired signal and interference power values, which yield the SINR measurements as well as the optimal digital weights. Since the selected analog beams based on the received power do not guarantee the hybrid beamforming achieving the maximization SINR, we therefore reserve additional analog beams as candidates during the beam tracking. When the candidates include the ideal beams, the combination of analog beams with their digital weights achieving the maximum SINR consequently provides the optimal solution to the hybrid beamforming.}

	abstract = {Although spectral precoding is a propitious technique to suppress out-of-band emissions, it has a detrimental impact on the system-wide throughput performance, notably, in high data-rate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), because of (spatially-coloured) transmit error vector magnitude (TxEVM) emanating from spectral precoding. The first contribution of this paper is to propose two mask-compliant spectral precoding schemes, which mitigate the resulting TxEVM seen at the receiver by capitalizing on the immanent degrees-of-freedom in (massive) MIMO systems and consequently improve the system-wide throughput. Our second contribution is an introduction to a new and simple three-operator consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, referred to as TOP-ADMM, which decomposes a large-scale problem into easy-to-solve subproblems. We employ the proposed TOP-ADMM-based algorithm to solve the spectral precoding problems, which offer computational efficiency. Our third contribution presents substantial numerical results by using an NR release 15 compliant simulator. In case of perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, the proposed methods render similar block error rate and throughput performance as without spectral precoding yet meeting out-of-band emission (OOBE) requirements at the transmitter. Further, no loss on the OOBE performance with a graceful degradation on the throughput is observed under channel uncertainty.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is envisioned as a promising hardware solution to hardware cost and energy consumption in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication network. It exhibits great advantages in enhancing data transmission, but may suffer from performance degradation caused by inherent hardware impairment (HWI). For analysing the achievable rate (ACR) and optimizing the phase shifts in the IRS-aided wireless communication system with HWI, we consider that the HWI appears at both the IRS and the signal transceivers. On this foundation, first, we derive the closed-form expression of the average ACR and the IRS utility. Then, we formulate optimization problems to optimize the IRS phase shifts by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver side, and obtain the solution by transforming non-convex problems into semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. Subsequently, we compare the IRS with the conventional decode-and-forward (DF) relay in terms of the ACR and the utility. Finally, we carry out simulations to verify the theoretical analysis, and evaluate the impact of the channel estimation errors and residual phase noises on the optimization performance. Our results reveal that the HWI reduces the ACR and the IRS utility, and begets more serious performance degradation with more reflecting elements. Although the HWI has an impact on the IRS, it still leaves opportunities for the IRS to surpass the conventional DF relay, when the number of reflecting elements is large enough or the transmitting power is sufficiently high.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel end-to-end learning approach, namely JTRD-Net, is proposed for uplink multiuser single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) joint transmitter and non-coherent receiver design (JTRD) in fading channels. The basic idea lies in the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace traditional communication modules at both transmitter and receiver sides. More specifically, the transmitter side is modeled as a group of parallel linear layers, which are responsible for multiuser waveform design; and the non-coherent receiver is formed by a deep feed-forward neural network (DFNN) so as to provide multiuser detection (MUD) capabilities. The entire JTRD-Net can be trained from end to end to adapt to channel statistics through deep learning. After training, JTRD-Net can work efficiently in a non-coherent manner without requiring any levels of channel state information (CSI). In addition to the network architecture, a novel weight-initialization method, namely symmetrical-interval initialization, is proposed for JTRD-Net. It is shown that the symmetrical-interval initialization outperforms the conventional method (e.g. Xavier initialization) in terms of well-balanced convergence-rate among users. Simulation results show that the proposed JTRD-Net approach takes significant advantages in terms of reliability and scalability over baseline schemes on both i.i.d. complex Gaussian channels and spatially-correlated channels.}

	abstract = {In distributed random access (RA), each device should consider its own information as well as the influence from others, which is difficult to obtain with diverse capabilities of devices. In this paper, we study the RA problem for massive devices with heterogeneous device capabilities in large-scale energy harvesting IoT networks. To deal with the overload issue for massive devices with different capabilities, we propose an optimal RA policy by improving the conventional mean field games (MFG) via exchanging the mean field terms (MFT) among devices. Specifically, we formulate the delay optimal problem as a two-dimensional Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem involving both energy and data states. For distributed deployment of massive RA, we divide the MDP into multiple per-device subproblems, and propose the distributed RA scheme by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation using stochastic learning. Considering the deviation of MFT estimation induced by heterogeneous device capabilities, we design an MFT consensus scheme based on stochastic approximation by information exchange among neighbor devices. For reducing the state space and exchanging the MFT efficiently, we adopt the number of simultaneous access devices instead of the conventional MFT. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the proposed scheme with coupling MFT and Q-factor. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RA scheme outperforms baseline schemes on delay performance, especially in the heavy traffic load regime.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a novel orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver architecture, which uses a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to oversample the received signal in time domain. Although attractive in terms of power consumption and hardware cost, low-resolution ADC incurs severe nonlinear quantization distortion and thus destroys the orthogonality between the OFDM subcarriers. The loss of orthogonality, together with the oversampling-caused correlation in noise samples, poses a great challenge to the OFDM receiver design. This paper aims to tackle this challenge. For the proposed receiver, we consider an often-used two-phase transmission protocol. In the first phase, training OFDM symbols are transmitted for channel estimation. In the second phase, information-conveying OFDM symbols are transmitted and detected using the previously obtained channel estimate. Therefore, the proposed receiver consists of two key components: channel estimator and data detector. These components are elaborately derived in the framework of Bayesian inference. Due to the diversity gain resulting from the oversampling operation, the proposed receiver can remarkably outperform the counterparts, including the conventional OFDM receiver with perfect infinite-precision quantization.}

This study focuses on a downlink RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication system that comprises three communication links of Rician channel, including base station (BS) to RIS, RIS to user, and BS to user. The objective is to design an optimal transmit covariance matrix at BS and diagonal phase-shifting matrix at RIS to maximize the achievable ergodic rate by exploiting the statistical channel state information at BS. Therefore, a large-system approximation of the achievable ergodic rate is derived using the replica method in large dimension random matrix theory. This large-system approximation enables the identification of asymptotic-optimal transmit covariance and diagonal phase-shifting matrices using an alternating optimization algorithm. Simulation results show that the large-system results are consistent with the achievable ergodic rate calculated by Monte-Carlo averaging. The results verify that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the RIS-assisted MIMO system performance.}

	abstract = {Caching holds the promise of scaling the service capability of next-generation radio access networks (RANs), thereby attracting much recent attention in the era of 6G research. To enable caching, popular content items should be proactively pushed to the user ends (UEs) in the placement phase. In practice, most content placement is only allowed to exploit idle spectrum or timeslot that is not occupied by any on-demand transmissions. In this case, however, the performance analysis and optimizations of practical caching gains remain open. In this paper, we are interested in how pushing, as a secondary service, improves the overall performance in terms of energy efficiency and latency reduction. To this end, we formulate a Markovian queueing model, the caching gains of which are optimized via linear programming (LP) with acceptable computational complexity. Our work demonstrates that the peak traffic load due to burst on-demand transmissions, as primary services, can be effectively offloaded by pushing over idle timeslots, leading to substantially reduced power consumption and queueing delay.}

	abstract = {Fog radio access networks (F-RANs), which consist of a cloud and multiple edge nodes (ENs) connected via fronthaul links, have been regarded as promising network architectures. The F-RAN entails a joint optimization of cloud and edge computing as well as fronthaul interactions, which is challenging for traditional optimization techniques. This paper proposes a Cloud-Enabled Cooperation-Inspired Learning (CECIL) framework, a structural deep learning mechanism for handling a generic F-RAN optimization problem. The proposed solution mimics cloud-aided cooperative optimization policies by including centralized computing at the cloud, distributed decision at the ENs, and their uplink-downlink fronthaul interactions. A group of deep neural networks (DNNs) are employed for characterizing computations of the cloud and ENs. The forwardpass of the DNNs is carefully designed such that the impacts of the practical fronthaul links, such as channel noise and signling overheads, can be included in a training step. As a result, operations of the cloud and ENs can be jointly trained in an end-to-end manner, whereas their real-time inferences are carried out in a decentralized manner by means of the fronthaul coordination. To facilitate fronthaul cooperation among multiple ENs, the optimal fronthaul multiple access schemes are designed. Training algorithms robust to practical fronthaul impairments are also presented. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}

For reducing the signaling overhead, only partial channel state information (CSI), including the instantaneous CSI between the RIS and the BS as well as the slowly varying statistical CSI between the UTs and the RIS, is exploited in our investigation. In particular, an optimization framework is proposed for jointly designing the transmit covariance matrices of the UTs and the RIS phase shift matrix to maximize the system global energy efficiency (GEE) with partial CSI. We first obtain closed-form solutions for the eigenvectors of the optimal transmit covariance matrices of the UTs. Then, to facilitate the design of the transmit power allocation matrices and the RIS phase shifts, we derive an asymptotically deterministic equivalent of the objective function with the aid of random matrix theory. We further propose a suboptimal algorithm to tackle the GEE maximization problem with guaranteed convergence, capitalizing on the approaches of alternating optimization, fractional programming, and sequential optimization. Numerical results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as the considerable GEE gains provided by the RIS-assisted transmission scheme over the traditional baselines.}

	abstract = {In application scenarios such as Internet of Things, a large number of energy receivers (ERs) exist and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation could be common. Considering this, we investigate wireless energy transfer (WET) in extra-large massive MIMO Rician channels. We derive analytical expressions of the received net energy for different schemes, including 1) training-based WET, where the ER sends beacon signal for channel training and the energy transmitter (ET) uses the channel estimate for energy beamforming, 2) LOS beamforming, where the ET transmits to the LOS direction of the ER, and 3) energy harvesting, which allows an ER to harvest the training energy from the other ERs. We derive a path loss threshold for switching between training and LOS beamforming-based WET. We further show that the WET scheme selection of one ER is not affected by the other ERs, and the energy harvested from training is minimal in practice. With these insights, we propose an algorithm for the multi-ER scenario, which minimizes the power consumption by iteratively updating the WET scheme selection and power allocation for all ERs. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as compared to exhaustive searching, while with much lower implementation complexity.}

	abstract = {Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have emerged as an enabling technology for aquatic monitoring. However, data delivery in UWSNs is challenging, due to the harsh aquatic environment and characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel. In recent years, underwater nodes with multi-modal communication capabilities have been proposed to create communication diversity and improve data delivery in UWSNs. Nevertheless, less attention has been devoted to the design of networking protocols leveraging multi-modal communication capabilities of underwater nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic model for the study of opportunistic routing (OR) in multi-modal UWSNs. We also design two candidate set selection heuristics, named OMUS-E and OMUS-D, for the joint selection of the most suitable acoustic modem for data transmission and next-hop forwarder candidate nodes at each hop, aimed to reduce the energy consumption and improve the network data delivery ratio in multi-modal UWSNs, respectively. Numerical results showed that both proposed heuristics reduced the energy consumption by 65%, 70%, and 75% as compared to the DBR, HydroCast, and GEDAR classical related work protocols, while maintaining a similar data delivery ratio. Furthermore, the proposed solutions outperformed the CAPTAIN routing protocol in terms of data delivery ratio, while maintaining comparable energy consumption.}

However, in practical scenarios with the presence of high-velocity users, the network experiences an inevitable performance degradation due to the Doppler shift effect. This paper analyzes the potential of frame length optimization in limiting the Doppler shift effect on the performance of time-division duplexing CF massive MIMO under different mobility conditions. In doing so, we derive novel expressions for tight lower bound of the average downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) rates. Capitalizing on the derived analytical results, we provide an analytical framework to determine the optimal frame length that limits the Doppler shift effect on DL and UL rates according to some criterion. Our results show perfect match of both analytical and simulated results under different system settings. Also, we reveal that the optimal frame lengths for maximizing the DL and UL rates are different and depend mainly on the transmission criterion and the users' velocities. Besides, our results demonstrate the high potential of adapting the frame length according to the velocity conditions in limiting the Doppler shift effect compared to applying a fixed frame length.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel and effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to addressing joint resource management (JRM) in a practical multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) system, where hardware sensitivity and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) are considered. We first formulate the JRM problem to maximize the weighted-sum system throughput. Then, the JRM problem is decoupled into two iterative subtasks: subcarrier assignment (SA, including user grouping) and power allocation (PA). Each subtask is a sequential decision process. Invoking a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, our proposed DRL-based JRM (DRL-JRM) approach jointly performs the two subtasks, where the optimization objective and constraints of the subtasks are addressed by a new joint reward and internal reward mechanism. A multi-agent structure and a convolutional neural network are adopted to reduce the complexity of the PA subtask. We also tailor the neural network structure for the stability and convergence of DRL-JRM. Corroborated by extensive experiments, the proposed DRL-JRM scheme is superior to existing alternatives in terms of system throughput and resistance to interference, especially in the presence of many users and strong inter-cell interference. DRL-JRM can flexibly meet individual service requirements of users.}

We consider linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) reception for a multiuser MIMO uplink, and provide performance guarantees based on two key concepts: (a) summarization of the impact of per-antenna nonlinearities via a quantity that we term the “intrinsic SNR”, (b) using linear MMSE performance in an ideal system without nonlinearities to bound that in our non-ideal system. For our numerical results, we employ nominal parameters corresponding to outdoor picocells operating at a carrier frequency of 140 GHz, with a data rate of 10 Gbps per user.}

	abstract = {Traditional D2D power control methods require instantaneous interference information and so are difficult to implement in a real network due to the backhaul delay and high computational requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose a distributed power allocation algorithm called interference feature extractor aided recurrent neural network (IFE-RNN). The core design ideas are described as follows. First, we design linear filters with various sizes termed IFEs to extract the different local interference patterns from outdated channel information. This feature extraction process enables our network to precisely learn the interference patterns around D2D links, so as to provide more effective power allocation strategies. Second, we propose to predict the real-time interference pattern based on the outputs of the IFEs and further make power decision. The prediction and decision can be modelled as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and solved by using a recurrent neural network. Third, an input reduction process is also designed to reduce the input size from O(N 2 ) to O(1), which speeds up the operation time and reduces the system overhead. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an encouraging performance compared to the state-of-the-art power allocation algorithm.}

As the networks evolve, applications are becoming ever more demanding, particularly with respect to high reliability and low latency. A common way to achieve high reliability in wireless communications is adding redundant communication channels by means of multi-connectivity. This comes at the cost of additional radio resources that could have been used by other connections. However, multiple links are not always required to achieve the desired reliability. Thus, we propose to combine multi-connectivity with rateless coding as a strategy for efficient resource usage in reliable wireless communications. The proposed schemes consider an erasure channel, and can therefore be implemented on the application layer, making them suitable for use with different physical layer wireless technologies simultaneously. We start out with a single-user analysis and then extend our discussion to multi-user scenarios. Our approach is compared against standardized packet duplication with our analytical framework and by means of simulation. The results with rateless coding show significant gains with respect to the required resources and feedback transmissions.}

	abstract = {A high-coverage algorithm termed enhanced camera assisted received signal strength ratio (eCA-RSSR) positioning algorithm is proposed for visible light positioning (VLP) systems. The basic idea of eCA-RSSR is to utilize visual information captured by the camera to estimate first the incidence angles of visible lights. Based on the incidence angles, eCA-RSSR utilizes the received signal strength ratio (RSSR) calculated by the photodiode (PD) to estimate the ratios of the distances between the LEDs and the receiver. Based on an Euclidean plane geometry theorem, eCA-RSSR transforms the ratios of the distances into the absolute values. In this way, eCA-RSSR only requires three LEDs for both orientation-free 2D and 3D positioning, implying that eCA-RSSR can achieve high coverage. Based on the absolute values of the distances, the linear least square method is employed to estimate the position of the receiver. Therefore, for the receiver having a small distance between the PD and the camera, the accuracy of eCA-RSSR does not depend on the starting values of the non-linear least square method and the complexity of eCA-RSSR is low. Furthermore, since the distance between the PD and camera can significantly affect the performance of eCA-RSSR, we further propose a compensation algorithm for eCA-RSSR based on the single-view geometry. Experiment results show that positioning errors of less than five centimeters is achievable for eCA-RSSR. Simulation results show that eCA-RSSR can achieve 80th percentile accuracy of about four centimeters and can improve the coverage ratio at low cost.}

	abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) as an emerging networking paradigm has recently gained significant attention, due to the improvement of content delivery efficiency. The built-in network storage for caching is a key component in ICN to provide low latency service and reduce high backhaul traffic by caching popular content. However, users' content preference contains individual sensitive characteristics which is distinguishable from others. Therefore, in this work, we propose a data-driven caching revenue maximization problem with the considerations of users' local differential privacy. Specifically, we employ dBitFlip, a local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism, to locally add differential private noise to the users' preference content information. We leverage data-driven approach to predict the content popularity based on the reference distribution constructed by the reported noisy preference content data from users, mathematically present the distance between the noisy reference distribution and the true distribution by the tolerance level, and prove the relationship among the tolerance level, differential privacy budget and the confidence level. We provide feasible solutions to the proposed revenue maximization problem, and conduct simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

Firstly, analytical expressions for the moment generating function (MGF) and the average of the received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are derived. Then, based on the derived MGF expression the average symbol error probability (SEP) for the CI precoder with PSK signaling is calculated. In this regard, new exact and very accurate asymptotic approximation for the average SEP are provided. Building on the new performance analysis, different power allocation schemes are considered to enhance the achieved SEP. In the first scheme, power allocation based on minimizing the sum symbol error probabilities (Min-Sum) is studied, while in the second scheme the power allocation based on minimizing the maximum SEP (Min-Max) is investigated. Furthermore, new analytical expressions of the throughput and power efficiency of the CI precoding in MU-MISO systems are also derived. The numerical results in this work demonstrate that, the CI precoding outperforms the conventional interference suppression precoding techniques with an up to 20 dB gain in the transmit SNR in terms of SEP, and up to 15 dB gain in the transmit SNR in terms of the throughput. In addition, the SEP-based power allocation schemes provide additional up to 13 dB gains in the transmit SNR compared to the conventional equal power allocation scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a symbiotic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) radio system, where the UAV is leveraged to help the IRS reflect its own signals to the base station, and meanwhile enhance the UAV transmission by passive beamforming at the IRS. First, we consider the weighted sum bit error rate (BER) minimization problem among all IRSs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IRS phase shift matrix, and IRS scheduling, subject to the minimum primary rate requirements. To tackle this complicated problem, a relaxation-based algorithm is proposed. We prove that the converged relaxation scheduling variables are binary, which means that no reconstruct strategy is needed, and thus the UAV rate constraints are automatically satisfied. Second, we consider the fairness BER optimization problem. We find that the relaxation-based method cannot solve this fairness BER problem since the minimum primary rate requirements may not be satisfied by the binary reconstruction operation. To address this issue, we first transform the binary constraints into a series of equivalent equality constraints. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed designs under different setups, as compared with benchmarks.}

	abstract = {A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can shape the radio propagation environment by virtue of changing the impinging electromagnetic waves towards any desired directions, thus, breaking the general Snell's reflection law. However, the optimal control of the RIS requires perfect channel state information (CSI) of the individual channels that link the base station (BS) and the mobile station (MS) to each other via the RIS. Thereby super-resolution channel (parameter) estimation needs to be efficiently conducted at the BS or MS with CSI feedback to the RIS controller. In this paper, we adopt a two-stage channel estimation scheme for RIS-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO systems without a direct BS-MS channel, using atomic norm minimization to sequentially estimate the channel parameters, i.e., angular parameters, angle differences, and the products of propagation path gains. We evaluate the mean square error of the parameter estimates, the RIS gains, the average effective spectrum efficiency bound, and average squared distance between the designed beamforming and combining vectors and the optimal ones. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves super-resolution estimation compared to the existing benchmark schemes, thus offering promising performance in the subsequent data transmission phase.}

To countermine the time variation effect, we propose an adaptive design for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission systems by utilizing the long-term stability of the second-order statistics of the channel state information (CSI). We derive the analytical expression of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at each subcarrier to reach the target error performance based on the statistical information of the CSI. Thereafter, a new adaptive coding and bit-power loading algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed to pursuit the highest achievable bit rate with fixed error rate. The validity of SINR calculations and the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive algorithm are demonstrated under various conditions, wherein both simulated and measured channels have been tested.}

We consider three multipath scenarios all of which show a pronounced link-reliability improvement with a retrodirective transponder compared to its standard non-retrodirective counterpart. The measurements also reveal that by comparing the best case scenario of the two transponder designs under 0.001 outage probability, the retrodirective transponder requires only a 13-dB fade margin while the conventional tag requires a 34-dB fade margin—a significant improvement that would be a key enabler for next-generation backscatter systems.}

In systems with a large bandwidth, the IQ imbalance will be frequency-dependent and hence cannot be described by a single parameter. Furthermore if there is a carrier-frequency offset (CFO), the IQ imbalance estimation in a MIMO system becomes a challenging task. However the CFO introduces a time-varying component to the received signal which can be exploited to estimate the model parameters using a carefully designed training sequence. This approach obtains the TX and RX IQ imbalance separately in an accurate fashion. We verify this by simulations and also show the estimated IQ imbalance in a customised hardware prototype.}

This implies that secrecy is obtained almost for free in these settings. This study shows that this is a valid property for a large class of low-complexity massive MIMO transmitters. The investigations consider two dominant approaches for complexity reduction, namely antenna selection and hybrid analog-digital precoding. It is shown that using either approach, the information leakage per achievable sum-rate vanishes as the number of transmit antennas grows large. The results demonstrate that, as the transmit array size grows large, the normalized information leakage obtained by antenna selection and hybrid analog-digital precoding converges to zero double-logarithmically and logarithmically, respectively. The analytical results are confirmed for various benchmark architectures via numerical simulations.}

More specifically, a nonconvex problem is formulated by minimizing the symbol mean-square error, while ensuring the target localization performance for radar. A direct one-bit sequence design tackled by an alternating minimization (AM) approach, which involves a simple unconstrained quadratic sub-problem with closed-form solution and a quadratically constrained nonconvex sub-problem tackled by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, is developed. The solutions of primal variables under the ADMM framework are provided and the convergence is discussed. Additionally, an indirect but computationally more efficient design, which is realized by transmit beamforming based on an accelerated primal gradient (APG) method, is presented. For better understanding of this design, both the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) and symbol error probability of the resulting beamformer with one-bit quantization using the Bussgang theorem are analyzed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

At the time of writing, cfm-MIMO has only been considered for communication in the long blocklength regime (LBR), whose throughput is determined by the Shannon capacity with the interference treated as Gaussian noise. Conjugate beamforming (CB) is often used as it requires only local channel state information (CSI) for implementation but its design is based on a large-scale nonconvex problem, which is computationally intractable. The rate function in URLLC is much more complex than the Shannon rate function. The paper proposes a special class of CB, which admits a low-scale optimization formulation for computational tractability. Accordingly, a new path-following algorithm, which generates a sequence of better feasible points and converges at least to a locally optimal solution, is developed for optimizing URLLC rates and cfm-MIMO energy efficiency. Furthermore, the paper also develops improper Gaussian signaling to improve both the Shannon rate and URLLC rate.}

Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed E-FTN signaling scheme exhibits improvements in secrecy rate and secrecy outage probability over conventional Nyquist-based and FTN signaling transmission, assuming employment of a root-raised cosine filter. We also show that the same benefits as those of single-carrier E-FTN signaling are attainable by its non-orthogonal multicarrier counterpart, where subcarrier spacing is set lower than that of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.}

	abstract = {The resource allocation in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications face a great challenge for satisfying the heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements of the ultra-reliable safety-related services and the minimum throughput required entertainment services, due to the channel uncertainties caused by high mobility. In this paper, we first consider an optimistic scenario where the distribution of uncertain channel state information (CSI) can be deterministic and accurately known at the eNB. Then, a low-complexity resource allocation approach is developed, in which the probabilistic QoS constraint of V2V is transformed into a computable optimization constraint. To deal with the scenario with unknown uncertain CSI distribution, we develop a distributionally robust resource allocation approach for converting the intractable chance constraint of V2V into a deterministic semidefinite constraint based only on the first- and second-order moments of uncertain CSI. For alleviating the conservatism of above approach, a support-based distributionally robust resource allocation approach is developed to tighten the semidefinite constraint by utilizing the support information of uncertain CSI. Finally, we conduct simulations to show that the effectiveness of the proposed approaches outperforms other state-of-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Mobile-edge computing (MEC) enhances the capacities and features of mobile devices by offloading computation-intensive tasks over wireless networks to edge servers. One challenge faced by the deployment of MEC in cellular networks is to support user mobility. As a result, offloaded tasks can be seamlessly migrated between base stations (BSs) without compromising the resource-utilization efficiency and link reliability. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by optimizing the policy for migration/handover between BSs by jointly managing computation-and-radio resources. The objectives are twofold: maximizing the sum offloading rate, quantifying MEC throughput, and minimizing the migration cost. The policy design is formulated as a decision-optimization problem that accounts for virtualization, I/O interference between virtual machines (VMs), and wireless multi-access. To solve the complex combinatorial problem, we develop an efficient relaxation-and-rounding based solution approach. The approach relies on an optimal iterative algorithm for solving the integer-relaxed problem and a novel integer-recovery design. The latter outperforms the traditional rounding method by exploiting the derived problem properties and applying matching theory. In addition, we also consider the design for a special case of “hotspot mitigation”, referring to alleviating an overloaded server/BS by migrating its load to the nearby idle servers/BSs. From simulation results, we observed close-to-optimal performance of the proposed migration policies under various settings. This demonstrates their efficiency in computation-and-radio resource management for joint service migration and BS handover in multi-cell MEC networks.}

	abstract = {With the fast development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), various types of computation-intensive vehicular applications pose significant challenges to resource-constrained vehicles. The emerging Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) and Edge Intelligence (EI) can alleviate this situation by offloading the computation tasks of vehicles to the roadside edge servers. However, with many vehicles contending for the communication and computation resources at the same time, how to quickly and efficiently make an optimal computation offloading decision for individual vehicles represents a fundamental research issue. In this paper, we propose a self-learning based distributed computation offloading scheme for IoV. Note that without any centralized controller, a fully distributed algorithm is necessary. The proposed scheme is devised based on a game-theoretic model. Specifically, through establishing an offloading framework with communication and computation for IoV, the computation offloading problem is first formulated as a distributed offloading decision-making game, in which each vehicle as a player makes its best response decision to minimize its joint cost (including latency and offloading cost). The existence of Nash Equilibrium can be proved. We then propose a self-learning based distributed computation offloading (DISCO) algorithm to reach the Nash Equilibrium, where a mutually satisfactory solution among vehicles is obtained and no vehicle is willing to change its decision. Using extensive simulations, we verify that DISCO can outperform the counterparts and achieve at least an order-of-magnitude improvement on time overhead and 88% performance gain on message overhead, only at up to 12% performance loss on joint cost over the centralized scheme.}

	abstract = {Fast channel estimation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems is a fundamental enabler of high-gain beamforming, which boosts coverage and capacity. The channel estimation stage typically involves an initial beam training process where a subset of the possible beam directions at the transmitter and receiver is scanned along a predefined codebook. Unfortunately, the high number of transmit and receive antennas deployed in mmWave systems increase the complexity of the beam selection and channel estimation tasks. In this work, we tackle the channel estimation problem in analog systems from a different perspective than used by previous works. In particular, we propose to move the channel estimation problem from the angular domain into the transformed spatial domain, in which estimating the angles of arrivals and departures corresponds to estimating the angular frequencies of paths constituting the mmWave channel. The proposed approach, referred to as transformed spatial domain channel estimation (TSDCE) algorithm, exhibits robustness to additive white Gaussian noise by combining low-rank approximations and sample autocorrelation functions for each path in the transformed spatial domain. Numerical results evaluate the mean square error of the channel estimation and the direction of arrival estimation capability. TSDCE significantly reduces the first, while exhibiting a remarkably low computational complexity compared with well-known benchmarking schemes.}

Furthermore, the asymptotic expressions for the OP, capacity, and throughput are developed in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to obtain some insights. We also provide new definitions for throughput and OP within a short communication duration.

The algorithm, called Selective Initialization Viterbi Algorithm (SIVA), performs the Viterbi algorithm (VA) iteratively and assigns at each iteration the initial costs for a selective set of states to satisfy a necessary condition. The process of selecting the set of states and setting their initial costs is done by forming a directed acyclic graph among the candidate states. We prove the convergence and optimality of SIVA and analyze its complexity in terms of the number of operations for the worst-case scenario with a noise-like decoder input. SIVA achieves optimum decoding at a complexity comparable to the popular, yet sub-optimal, wrap-around Viterbi algorithm (WAVA) and at several orders of magnitude lower complexity compared to other optimal tail-biting decoding algorithms. Application of SIVA to a practical millimeter wave MIMO system with two different tail-biting codes illustrates URLLC-regime frame error performance better than WAVA and confirms the low complexity of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have the capability of reconfiguring the wireless environment in a favorable way to improve the quality-of-service (QoS) of wireless communications. This makes RISs a promising candidate to enhance vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. This paper investigates the spectrum sharing problem in RIS-aided vehicular networks, in which multiple vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links reuse the spectrum already occupied by vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. To overcome the difficulty of acquiring instantaneous channel state information (CSI) due to the fast varying nature of some V2X channels, we rely upon large-scale (slowly varying) CSI in order to fulfill the QoS requirements of V2I and V2V communications. Particularly, we aim to maximize the sum capacity of V2I links that are used for high-rate content delivery and to guarantee the reliability of V2V links that are used for the exchange of safety information. The transmit power of vehicles, the multi-user detection (MUD) matrix, the spectrum reuse of V2V links, and the RIS reflection coefficients are jointly optimized, which results in a mixed-integer and non-convex optimization problem. To tackle this problem, the outage probability of each V2V link is first approximated by introducing an analytical expression to simplify the formulated problem. By leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) method, the considered optimization problem is decomposed into three sub-problems, whose optimal solutions are provided independently and updated alternately to obtain a near-optimal solution. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as well as unveil the benefits of introducing RISs for enhancing the QoS performance of vehicular communications.}

The new scheme exploits the so-called dual-mode light-emitting diode (DM-LED) of different radiation lobe mode numbers at the transmitter and a photodiode at the receiver. Specifically, we devise a method that utilizes a radiation angle measurement approach for DM-LED, derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimated distance and analyze the characteristics of key parameters. In addition, two localization algorithms based on linear and nonlinear least squares methods are developed. Simulation results show that under the ideal light-of-sight scenario, the CRLB of the proposed VLP scheme can be close to that of the conventional received signal strength (RSS) aided VLP scheme. Furthermore, we implement the first ever prototype DM-LED lamp to validate the new DM-LED aided VLP system model. Both simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms its RSS-aided VLP counterpart in terms of positioning accuracy in the more realistic, and thus more challenging multi-path scenario, even with a tilting receiver.}

More precisely, we put forth a neural network architecture inspired by the algorithmic unfolding of the iterative weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method, that we denote by unfolded WMMSE (UWMMSE). The learnable weights within UWMMSE are parameterized using graph neural networks (GNNs), where the time-varying underlying graphs are given by the fading interference coefficients in the wireless network. These GNNs are trained through a gradient descent approach based on multiple instances of the power allocation problem. We show that the proposed architecture is permutation equivariant, thus facilitating generalizability across network topologies. Comprehensive numerical experiments illustrate the performance attained by UWMMSE along with its robustness to hyper-parameter selection and generalizability to unseen scenarios such as different network densities and network sizes.}

	abstract = {We consider a single-cell massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) network with uniform planar array (UPA) antennas equipped at the base station that serves a number of single-antenna users. In the overloaded multi-user setting, it is likely that users' channels are highly spatial-correlated with overlapping spectrum in the angular domain, which imposes challenges on uplink channel estimation and data transmission due to potential pilot contamination during uplink training and multiuser interference during uplink data transmission. To mitigate the effect of multiuser channel spatial correlation, we adopt a recently proposed active channel sparsification strategy, and propose a novel method for joint user and beam selection in the angular domain. In particular, we represent all users' channels in the angular/beam domain, taking advantage of the doubly block Toeplitz structure of the channel covariance matrix for UPA. Accordingly, we construct a weighted bipartite graph to represent the beam and user association for ease of user/beam selection. By doing so, we reformulate the problems of mean square error minimization for uplink channel estimation and sum rate maximization for uplink data detection as two mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), by which the challenging joint user and beam selection problem can be efficiently solved via off-the-shelf MILP solvers. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our active channel sparsification strategy for the joint user and beam selection.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a recently developed multi-carrier multi-slot transmission scheme for wireless communications in high-mobility environments. In this paper, the error performance of coded OTFS modulation over high-mobility channels is investigated. We start from the study of conditional pairwise-error probability (PEP) of the OTFS scheme, based on which its performance upper bound of the coded OTFS system is derived. Then, we show that the coding improvement for OTFS systems depends on the squared Euclidean distance among codeword pairs and the number of independent resolvable paths of the channel. More importantly, we show that there exists a fundamental trade-off between the coding gain and the diversity gain for OTFS systems, i.e., the diversity gain of OTFS systems improves with the number of resolvable paths, while the coding gain declines. Furthermore, based on our analysis, the impact of channel coding parameters on the performance of the coded OTFS systems is unveiled. The error performance of various coded OTFS systems over high-mobility channels is then evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate a significant performance improvement for OTFS modulation over the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation over high-mobility channels. Analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed code design are also verified by simulations with the application of both classical and modern codes for OTFS systems.}

	abstract = {Multi-hop networks comprising line-of-sight dominated wireless channels have found attractive applications in wireless networks involving unmanned aerial vehicles. It is well known that these applications require both high-reliability and low-latency features. While automatic-repeat-request (ARQs) based decode-and-forward (DF) relaying strategies provide the high-reliability feature, they are known to incur delay owing to multiple re-transmissions of packets. Towards addressing the above trade-off between reliability and low-latency of ARQ based DF strategies, we impose a sum constraint on the total number of ARQs across the nodes as it captures an upper bound on the time taken for packet re-transmissions. Subsequently, we propose various cooperative strategies among the nodes to minimize the packet-drop-probability (PDP). At the heart of our cooperative strategies lies the idea that unused ARQs of a node can be used by its neighbors to reduce the PDP without violating the sum constraint on the total number of ARQs. For each of the cooperative strategies, we formulate an optimization problem for distributing a given number of ARQs among the nodes. Then, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the optimal ARQ distribution in each of these strategies, and use these conditions to synthesize low-complexity algorithms to solve the problem. In addition to using PDP, we also present a thorough analysis on the delay profiles of the packets to incorporate the effect of cooperation on the latency performance of the cooperative strategies.}

This is particularly true since the existing relevant literature overlooked the possibility of preferential treatment of data packets based on their delay requirements. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes to classify the data packets emanating from the source node into either Delay Tolerant (DT) packets or Non Delay Tolerant (NDT) ones and to service these packets according to this classification at the relay node. Priority queueing is first introduced in the relay's buffer with a view to improving the delay experienced by NDT packets. Class of service mutation is then proposed as a starvation mitigation strategy to better manage the interesting dynamics resulting from the co-existence of packets having different QoS requirements in the same buffer. The various performance measures of interest for the explored QoS-aware communication system are both evaluated mathematically based on a Markov chain analysis and validated through extensive simulations. An asymptotic analysis is also carried out highlighting the dependence of the performance on the system parameters in an intuitive manner.}

	abstract = {In massive MIMO systems, the effective channel state information (CSI) is an essential prerequisite for the beamforming (BF) design. While there is a handful of previously proposed compressive sensing (CS)-based channel estimation algorithms in the literature, the large BF gain provided by the massive MIMO array has not been fully exploited in the channel estimation stage. In order to obtain higher BF gain and better estimation performance with less pilot overhead, we study the joint design of the transmitting and receiving hybrid pilot BF as well as the associated channel tracking scheme. Specifically, a Markov prior is used to model the temporal correlation in massive MIMO channels over different time slots. Then, the hybrid pilot BF is optimized by maximizing the mutual information between the channel measurements and the corresponding downlink sparse channels with the Markov prior. Following, we derive an efficient channel tracking algorithm called Turbo Bayesian Inference (Turbo-BI) to solve the resulting CS problem and generate the channel prior information required to calculate the mutual information for the optimization of hybrid pilot BF in the next time slot. The proposed Turbo-BI can exploit both the sparsity and the temporal correlation of massive MIMO channels to enhance the estimation performance. Finally, simulations show that our proposed algorithm can achieve significant gain over the existing state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Traffic flows with different requirements of quality of service (QoS requirements) are aggregated into different QoS classes to provide differentiated services (Diffserv) and better quality of experience (QoE) for users. The existing aggregation approaches/QoS mapping methods are based on quantitative QoS requirements and static QoS classes. However, they are typically qualitative and time-varying at the edge of the beyond fifth generation (B5G) networks. Therefore, the artificial intelligence technology of preference logic is applied in this paper to achieve an intelligent method for edge computing, called the preference logic based aggregation model (PLM), which effectively groups flows with qualitative requirements into dynamic classes. First, PLM uses preferences to describe QoS requirements of flows, and thus can deal with both quantitative and qualitative cases. Next, the potential conflicts in these preferences are eliminated. According to the preferences, traffic flows are finally mapped into dynamic QoS classes by logic reasoning. The experimental results show that PLM presents better performance in terms of QoE satisfaction compared with the existing aggregation methods. Utilizing preference logic to group flows, PLM implements a novel way of edge intelligence to deal with dynamic classes and improves the Diffserv for massive B5G traffic with quantitative and qualitative requirements.}

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising paradigm to ease the computation burden of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices by leveraging computing capabilities at the network edge. With the yearning needs for resource provision from IoT devices, the queueing delay at the edge nodes not only poses a colossal impediment to achieving satisfactory quality of experience (QoE) for the IoT devices but also to the benefits of the edge nodes owing to escalating energy expenditure. Moreover, since the service providers may differ, computationally competent entities' computing services should entail economic compensation for the incurred energy expenditure and the capital investment. Therefore, the workload allocation mechanism, where we consider flat-rate and dynamic pricing schemes in the multi-layer edge computing structure, is much-needed. We use Stackelberg game to capture the inherent hierarchy and interdependence between the second-layer edge node (SLEN) and first-layer edge nodes (FLENs). A truthful admission control mechanism grounded on the optimal workload allocation is designed for FLENs without violating end-to-end (E2E) latency requirements. We prove that a Stackelberg equilibrium with the E2E latency guarantee and truthfulness exists and can be reached through proposed algorithm. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our scheme and illustrate several insights.}

	abstract = {Adopting OFDMA and MU-MIMO techniques for both downlink and uplink IEEE 802.11ax will help next-generation WLANs efficiently cope with large numbers of devices but will also raise some research challenges. One of these is how to optimize the channelization, resource allocation, beamforming design, and MCS selection jointly for IEEE 802.11ax-based WLANs. In this paper, this technical requirement is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem maximizing the total system throughput for the WLANs consisting of unicast users with multicast groups. A novel two-stage solution approach is proposed to solve this challenging problem. The first stage aims to determine the precoding vectors under unit-power constraints. These temporary precoders help re-form the main problem into a joint power and radio resource allocation one. Then, two low-complexity algorithms are proposed to cope with the new problem in stage two. The first is developed based on the well-known compressed sensing method while the second seeks to optimize each of the optimizing variables alternatively until reaching converged outcomes. The outcomes corresponding to the two stages are then integrated to achieve the complete solution. Numerical results are provided to confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over benchmarks.}

Software defined network technique is a novel approach introduced to the LEO satellite networks to improve the resource flexibility and efficiency, forming the software defined LEO satellite networks (SDLSNs). How to efficiently allocate the resources of SDLSN to provide services for the terrestrial users is a key issue. Hence, in this work, we explore the service provision for SDLSN via virtual network functions (VNFs) orchestration on the software defined time-evolving graph. In view of the scarce, intermittent and unstable satellite-to-satellite (S2S) links, the problem is formulated to minimize the S2S resource consumption while satisfying the terrestrial tasks, which is in the form of integer linear programming. Since the problem is intractable by exhaustive search, we design a branch-and-price algorithm based on the coupling of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, column generation, and branch-and-bound to efficiently acquire the optimal solution. Further, to obtain a faster solution for practical usage, we further design an approximation algorithm for the subproblem and leverage the beam search to accelerate the pruning for the search tree. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted and the numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {To get channel state information (CSI) at a base station (BS), most of researches on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems consider time division duplexing (TDD) to get benefit from the uplink and downlink channel reciprocity. Even in TDD, however, the BS still needs to transmit downlink training signals, which are referred to as channel state information reference signals (CSI-RSs) in the 3GPP standard, to support spatial multiplexing in practice. This is because there are many cases that the number of transmit antennas is less than the number of receive antennas at a user equipment (UE) due to power consumption and circuit complexity issues. Because of this mismatch, uplink sounding reference signals (SRSs) from the UE are not enough for the BS to obtain full downlink MIMO CSI. Therefore, after receiving the downlink CSI-RSs, the UE needs to feedback quantized CSI to the BS using a pre-defined codebook to support spatial multiplexing. In this paper, possible approaches to reconstruct full downlink MIMO CSI at the BS are proposed by exploiting both the SRS and quantized downlink CSI considering practical antenna structures with reduced downlink CSI-RS overhead. Numerical results show that the spectral efficiencies by spatial multiplexing based on the proposed downlink MIMO CSI reconstruction techniques outperform the conventional methods solely based on the quantized CSI.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study distributed algorithms to realize efficient communications under the Rayleigh-fading model. This model extends the popular deterministic SINR model using stochastic propagations to address the fading effects observed in reality. Stochastic propagations can greatly increase the difficulty of handling interference and collisions, especially in a local context without much global knowledge. We present a new technique called Inductive Coloring that can be used to schedule fast transmissions with Rayleigh-fading interference. The computation of inductive coloring takes only O(log 2 n) time with the proposed distributed algorithm, where n is the number of nodes in the network. We illustrate the power of inductive coloring by giving a distributed and randomized algorithm to implement the abstract MAC (absMAC) layer, which was first proposed by Kuhn et al.. With two basic time-guaranteed communication primitives, namely acknowledgement and progress, which correspond to the operations of node local broadcasts and message receptions from others, the absMAC layer decomposes the algorithm design and analysis in networks into two independent components, i.e., implementing the absMAC layer over a physical network and designing algorithms with the help of the two primitives in the absMAC layer. Thus, it sharply reduces the fussy and complicated process of algorithm design and analysis over the physical network. Our proposed algorithm implements the absMAC layer under the Rayleigh-fading model with no more than a logarithmic factor inferior to the optimal solution in terms of time complexity. The presented simulation results indicate that our algorithm performs well in realistic environments. Furthermore, we show that by making full use of our proposed absMAC layer algorithm, many network primitives such as Neighbor Discovery, Single/Multiple-Message Broadcast, and Consensus, can be efficiently implemented.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology that is able to reconfigure the wireless channel via tunable passive signal reflection and thereby enhance the spectral/energy efficiency of wireless networks cost-effectively. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system and adopt the two-timescale (TTS) transmission to reduce the signal processing complexity and channel training overhead as compared to the existing schemes based on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), and at the same time, exploit the multiuser channel diversity in transmission scheduling. Specifically, the long-term passive beamforming (i.e., IRS phase shifts) is designed based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, while the short-term active beamforming (i.e., transmit precoding vectors at the access point (AP)) is designed to cater to the I-CSI of all users' reconfigured channels with optimized IRS phase shifts. We aim to minimize the average transmit power at the AP, subject to the users' individual quality of service (QoS) constraints on the achievable long-term average rate. The formulated stochastic optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve since the long-term and short-term design variables are complicatedly coupled in the QoS constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm, called the primal-dual decomposition based TTS joint active and passive beamforming (PDD-TJAPB), where the original problem is decomposed into a long-term passive beamforming problem and a family of short-term active beamforming problems, and the deep unfolding technique is employed to extract gradient information from the short-term problems to construct a convex surrogate problem for the long-term problem. We show that both the long-term and short-term problems can be efficiently solved and the proposed algorithm is proved to converge to a stationary solution of the original problem almost surely. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as compared to benchmark schemes.}

The unlicensed frequency bands used by WiFi are mainly deployed for indoor applications and are not always fully occupied. The cellular industry has been working to enable cellular and WiFi coexistence. In particular, 5G New Radio in unlicensed channel spectrum (NR-U) supports the uplink and downlink transmission on the maximum channel occupation time (MCOT) duration. In this paper, we consider maximizing the total throughput of both downlink and uplink in NR-U by jointly optimizing the time and power allocation during MCOT while ensuring fair coexistence with WiFi. Fairness is guaranteed in two steps: 1) tuning the access related parameters of NR-U to achieve proportional fairness, and 2) including 3GPP fairness from the throughput perspective as a constraint in NR-U throughput maximization. Numerical analysis and simulation have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed resource allocation algorithm compared to conventional deployment strategies.}

Unlike most of the existing predetermined relaying protocols, the proposed strategy is adjustable in the sense that it is controlled by K threshold levels. A Markov chain (MC) analysis is adopted for evaluating the outage probability (OP) and average packet delay (APD) of the proposed scheme. Through an asymptotic analysis, we highlight on the impact of the K controlling parameters on the triad of OP, APD and diversity order that can be contemplated. While most of the existing schemes are designed to achieve fixed APD and diversity order values, the proposed scheme can achieve all diversity orders ranging from K to 2K while compromising the asymptotic APD that will range from 2 to 2K+2. We also target the optimization of the buffer size and we prove that a buffer size of three is sufficient for extracting the full capabilities of the BA network. Simulations over Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate the performance gains and the OP-APD tradeoffs that can be attained.}

However, in OFDM based IBFD systems, digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC) employed at baseband does not provide sufficient cancellation in the cyclic prefix (CP) region. When the propagation delay between two communicating radios is non-zero, the CP noise affects the data region of the desired signal. In this work, we propose CP noise reduction (CPNR) technique for OFDM based IBFD radios. We have evaluated CPNR with time and frequency domain DSIC schemes via both simulations and MATLAB and FPGA implementations on our Software Defined Radio based IBFD radio. In the laboratory tests, the total suppression of the IBFD radio is improved by 6 dB by employing CPNR in frequency-domain DSIC and EVM for bidirectional communication is improved by up to 5%, allowing realistic propagation delays. In addition to improving the total suppression and EVM performance, CPNR is also shown to enhance the multi-path resiliency of DSIC techniques.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) improve both the bandwidth and energy efficiency of wideband communication systems by using low-cost passive elements for reflecting the impinging signals with adjustable phase shifts. To realize the full potential of IRS-aided systems, having accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable, but it is challenging to acquire, since these passive devices cannot carry out transmit/receive signal processing. The existing channel estimation methods conceived for wideband IRS-aided communication systems only consider the channel’s frequency selectivity, but ignore the effect of beam squint, despite its severe performance degradation. Hence we fill this gap and conceive wideband channel estimation for IRS-aided communication systems by explicitly taking the effect of beam squint into consideration. We demonstrate that the mutual correlation function between the spatial steering vectors and the cascaded two-hop channel reflected by the IRS has two peaks, which leads to a pair of estimated angles for a single propagation path, due to the effect of beam squint. One of these two estimated angles is the frequency-independent ‘actual angle’, while the other one is the frequency-dependent ‘false angle’. To reduce the influence of false angles on channel estimation, we propose a twin-stage orthogonal matching pursuit (TS-OMP) algorithm, where the path angles of the cascaded two-hop channel reflected by the IRS are obtained in the first stage, while the propagation gains and delays are obtained in the second stage. Moreover, we propose a bespoke pilot design by exploiting the specific the characteristics of the mutual correlation function and cross-entropy theory for achieving an improved channel estimation performance. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed channel estimation algorithm and pilot design over their conventional counterparts.}

To combine the signals received at the antennas, diversity combining techniques such as maximal ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC) are performed at the receiver of each vehicle. However, in practice, the expected performance from the diversity techniques may not be achieved due to the fact that all the diversity branches are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) all the time. In this context, analytical expressions of the outage probability and ergodic sum rate are derived for the considered vehicular networks with the assumption of independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Nakagami-\nm\nfading channels. The performance analysis of NOMA vehicular networks is also extended for multiple-input multiple-output antenna configurations and evaluated in the presence of successive interference cancellation (SIC) error propagation. The obtained analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the performance of NOMA is verified with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) for fading parameter\nm=1\nand\nm=2\nwith perfect channel knowledge and channel estimation. Numerical results show that NOMA outperforms the conventional OMA by approximately 20% and has high sum rate with i.n.i.d as well as i.i.d channel consideration. However, i.n.i.d consideration degrades the performance of NOMA and OMA as the diversity gain achieved with i.n.i.d consideration is less as compared to i.i.d consideration. The performance is further deteriorated with SIC error and channel estimation.}

	abstract = {A new approach to distributed synchronization (frequency alignment) for the coordination of nodes in open loop coherent distributed antenna arrays to enable distributed beamforming is presented. This approach makes use of the concept of consensus optimization among nodes without requiring centralized control. Decentralized frequency consensus can be achieved through iterative frequency exchange among nodes. We derive a model of the signal received from a coherent distributed array and analyze the effects on beamforming of phase errors induced by oscillator frequency drift. We introduce and discuss the average consensus protocol for frequency transfer in undirected networks where each node transmits and receives frequency information from other nodes. We analyze the following cases: 1) undirected networks with a static topology; 2) undirected networks with a dynamic topology, where connections between nodes are made and lost dynamically; and 3) undirected networks with oscillator frequency drift. We show that all the nodes in a given network achieve average consensus and the number of iterations needed to achieve consensus can be minimized for a given cluster of nodes. We derive the theoretical phase error resulting from both processing noise and measurement noise, and derive an optimal update interval that minimizes the error. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the consensus algorithm enables tolerable errors to obtain high coherent gain of greater than 90% of the ideal gain in an error-free distributed phased array.}

In this paper, we carry out beam training designs for IRSs assisted mmWave communications to estimate the aforementioned parameters. To acquire the optimal beams and reflection patterns, we firstly perform random beamforming and maximum likelihood estimation to estimate angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) of the line of sight (LoS) path between BS/AP (or IRSs) and MT. Then, with the estimated AoDs, we propose an iterative positioning algorithm that achieves centimeter-level positioning accuracy. The obtained location information is not only a fringe benefit but also enables us to cross verify and enhance the estimation of AoA and AoD, and it also facilitates the estimation of blockage indicator. Numerical results show the superiority of our proposed beam training scheme and verify the performance gain brought by location information.}

	abstract = {Being able to accommodate multiple simultaneous transmissions on a single channel, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) appears as an attractive solution to support massive machine type communication (mMTC) that faces a massive number of devices competing to access the limited number of shared radio resources. In this paper, we first analytically study the throughput performance of NOMA-based random access (RA), namely NOMA-RA. We show that while increasing the number of power levels in NOMA-RA leads to a further gain in maximum throughput, the growth of throughput gain is slower than linear. This is due to the higher-power dominance characteristic in power-domain NOMA known in the literature. We explicitly quantify the throughput gain for the very first time in this paper. With our analytical model, we verify the performance advantage of NOMA-RA scheme by comparing with the baseline multi-channel slotted ALOHA (MS-ALOHA), with and without capture effect. Despite the higher-power dominance effect, the maximum throughput of NOMA-RA with four power levels achieves over three times that of the MS-ALOHA. However, our analytical results also reveal the sensitivity of load on the throughput of NOMA-RA. To cope with the potential bursty traffic in mMTC scenarios, we propose adaptive load regulation through a practical user barring algorithm. By estimating the current load based on the observable channel feedback, the algorithm adaptively controls user access to maintain the optimal loading of channels to achieve maximum throughput. When the proposed user barring algorithm is applied, simulations demonstrate that the instantaneous throughput of NOMA-RA always remains close to the maximum throughput confirming the effectiveness of our load regulation.}

	abstract = {With the large number of antennas and subcarriers the overhead due to pilot transmission for channel estimation can be prohibitive in wideband massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This can degrade the overall spectral efficiency significantly, and as a result, curtail the potential benefits of massive MIMO. In this paper, we propose a neural network (NN)-based joint pilot design and downlink channel estimation scheme for frequency division duplex (FDD) MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems. The proposed NN architecture uses fully connected layers for frequency-aware pilot design, and outperforms linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation by exploiting inherent correlations in MIMO channel matrices utilizing convolutional NN layers. Our proposed NN architecture uses a non-local attention module to learn longer range correlations in the channel matrix to further improve the channel estimation performance.We also propose an effective pilot reduction technique by gradually pruning less significant neurons from the dense NN layers during training. This constitutes a novel application of NN pruning to reduce the pilot transmission overhead. Our pruning-based pilot reduction technique reduces the overhead by allocating pilots across subcarriers non-uniformly and exploiting the inter-frequency and inter-antenna correlations in the channel matrix efficiently through convolutional layers and attention module.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the joint problem of access point (AP) assignment and power allocation (PA) in a three-tier hybrid radio frequency/visible light communication (VLC) heterogeneous network (HetNet). The main goal is to maximize the HetNet’s sum-rate under practical constraints such as APs’ power budgets and users’ quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, while maintaining an acceptable level of illumination in the VLC system. When this design problem is formulated mathematically, it turns out to be a combinatorial decision problem that involves non-linear constraints, and hence is NP hard. To efficiently obtain good quality solutions for the formulated problem, a reformulation into the college admission model is first performed. Then, a distributed and low-complexity algorithm based on matching theory and an efficient heuristic PA scheme are proposed to obtain a good quality suboptimal solution for the joint problem. Simulation results highlight the robustness of the proposed solution and its significant gain in network sum-rate as compared to different benchmark schemes. The effect of various system parameters such as the minimum QoS and maximum illumination requirements on the performance of the proposed solution is studied. Finally, the theoretical analysis of convergence, stability, and complexity of the proposed technique is performed.}

To handle the user scheduling problem, a heuristic algorithm based on matching and swapping theory is proposed first to allocate users that access UAV in each subperiod, then the transmit power allocation problem which considers the maximum transmit power and minimum user date rate is transformed to a convex optimization problem using logarithmic approximation. Meanwhile, the successive convex optimization is used in UAV trajectory optimization problem and a joint optimization algorithm is presented with the algorithm’s convergence and computational complexity. Finally, numerical results are provided to support the rationality of the proposed algorithm.}

However, providing wireless VR users with seamless connectivity and real-time VR video with high quality is challenging due to its requirements in high Quality of Experience (QoE) and low VR interaction latency under limited computation capability of VR device. To address these issues, we propose a MEC-enabled wireless VR network, where the field of view (FoV) of each VR user can be real-time predicted using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and the rendering of VR content is moved from VR device to MEC server with rendering model migration capability. Taking into account the geographical and FoV request correlation, we propose centralized and distributed decoupled Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategies to maximize the long-term QoE of VR users under the VR interaction latency constraint. Simulation results show that our proposed MEC rendering schemes and DRL algorithms substantially improve the long-term QoE of VR users and reduce the VR interaction latency compared to rendering at VR devices.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (MIMO-OFDM-IM) has recently received increased attention, due to the potential advantage to balance the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, we investigate the application of MIMO-OFDM-IM to millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, where a hybrid analogy-digital (HAD) beamforming architecture is employed. Taking advantage of the Pareto-optimal beam design, we propose a feasible solution to approximately achieve a globally Pareto-optimal trade-off between SE and EE, and the collision constraints of the multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) can be solved efficiently. Correspondingly, the MOP of SE-EE trade-off can be converted into a feasible solution for energy-efficient resource usage, by finding the Pareto-optimal set (POS) towards the Pareto front. This combinatorial-oriented resource allocation approach on the SE-EE relation considers the optimal beam design and power control strategies for downlink multi-user mmWave transmission. To ease the system performance evaluation, we adopt the Poisson point process (PPP) to model the mobile data traffic, and the evolutionary algorithm is applied to speed up the search efficiency of the Pareto front. Compared with benchmarks, the experimental results collected from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed optimization approach is vastly superior to existing algorithms.}

This makes it hard to assess the suitability of Massive MIMO for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) operating with short-blocklength codes. This paper provides a rigorous framework for the characterization and numerical evaluation (using the saddlepoint approximation) of the error probability achievable in the uplink and downlink of Massive MIMO at finite blocklength. The framework encompasses imperfect channel state information, pilot contamination, spatially correlated channels, and arbitrary linear spatial processing. In line with previous results based on infinite-blocklength bounds, we prove that, with minimum mean-square error (MMSE) processing and spatially correlated channels, the error probability at finite blocklength goes to zero as the number M\nof antennas grows to infinity, even under pilot contamination. However, numerical results for a practical URLLC network setup involving a base station with M=100\nantennas, show that a target error probability of 10 −5 can be achieved with MMSE processing, uniformly over each cell, only if orthogonal pilot sequences are assigned to all the users in the network. Maximum ratio processing does not suffice.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a novel unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) secure communication system with the assistance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), where a UAV and a ground user communicate with each other, while an eavesdropper tends to wiretap their information. Due to the limited capacity of UAVs, an RIS is applied to further improve the quality of the secure communication. The time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol is applied for the communications between the UAV and the ground user, namely, the downlink (DL) and the uplink (UL) communications. In particular, the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channels is assumed to be imperfect. We aim to maximize the average worst-case secrecy rate by the robust joint design of the UAV’s trajectory, RIS’s passive beamforming, and transmit power of the legitimate transmitters. However, it is challenging to solve the joint UL/DL optimization problem due to its non-convexity. Therefore, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating optimization (AO) technique. Specifically, the formulated problem is divided into three sub-problems, and the successive convex approximation (SCA),\nS\n-Procedure, and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are applied to tackle these non-convex sub-problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can considerably improve the average secrecy rate compared with the benchmark algorithms, and also confirm the robustness of the proposed algorithm.}

Existing works treat the reciprocity mismatch as constant for simplicity. However, the practical RF chain consists of nonlinear components, which leads to nonlinear reciprocity mismatch. In this work, we examine the impact and the calibration approach of the nonlinear reciprocity mismatch in massive MIMO systems. To evaluate the impact of the nonlinear mismatch, we first derive the closed-form expression of the ergodic achievable rate. Then, we analyze the performance loss caused by the nonlinear mismatch to show that the impact of the mismatch at the base station (BS) side is much larger than that at the user equipment side. Therefore, we propose a calibration method for the BS. During the calibration, polynomial function is applied to approximate the nonlinear mismatch factor, and over-the-air training is employed to estimate the polynomial coefficients. After that, the calibration coefficients are computed by maximizing the downlink achievable rate. Simulation results are presented to verify the analytical results and to show the performance of the proposed calibration approach.}

However, the energy efficiency (EE) of proactive caching over fading channels has not been well studied yet. In this paper, we aim at presenting an energy-efficient content pushing policy by carefully adapting the transmit rate and power in pushing and on-demand delivery phases, while assuring delivery delay constraints. To this end, the average delay, delay-outage probability, and EE are analyzed for a general adaptive pushing policy based on the saddle point approximation. According to these results, we formulate EE maximization problems under average delay and delay-outage constraints, respectively, for two special types of adaptive pushing policies, namely, opportunistic pushing and water-filling-based pushing. Due to the high complexity of the grid search for solving the formulated problems, suboptimal algorithms are presented based on gradient descent and golden section search methods. Moreover, we mathematically derive the scaling property and numerically obtain request probability and delivery delay thresholds for content pushing. Simulations show that the presented pushing policies achieve higher EE than on-demand transmissions, especially when the content item is popular and the tolerable delivery delay is small.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact of channel aging on the performance of cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with both spatial correlation and pilot contamination. We derive novel closed-form uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions that take imperfect channel estimation into account. More specifically, we consider large-scale fading decoding and matched-filter receiver cooperation in the uplink. The uplink performance of a small-cell (SC) system is derived for comparison. The CF massive MIMO system achieves higher 95%-likely uplink SE than the SC system. In the downlink, the coherent transmission has four times higher 95%-likely per-user SE than the non-coherent transmission. Statistical channel cooperation power control (SCCPC) is used to mitigate the inter-user interference. SCCPC performs better than full power transmission, but the benefits are gradually weakened as the channel aging becomes stronger. Furthermore, strong spatial correlation reduces the SE but degrades the effect of channel aging. Increasing the number of antennas can improve the SE while decreasing the energy efficiency. Finally, we use the maximum normalized Doppler shift to design the SE-improved length of the resource block. Simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of our expressions and prove that the CF massive MIMO system is more robust to channel aging than the SC system.}

	abstract = {Joint analog and digital self-interference cancellation (SIC) is essential for enabling in-band full duplex (IBFD) communications. Analog least mean square (ALMS) loop is a promising low-complexity high-performance analog SIC technique with multi-tap adaptive filtering capability, but its properties on the tap coefficient variation have not been fully understood. In this paper, analysis based on higher-order statistics of the transmitted signal is performed to solve the problem of evaluating the variance of the ALMS loop’s weighting coefficient error, which reveals two additional types of irreducible residual self-interference (SI) produced by an ALMS loop if it runs freely. The residual SI channel impulse response in digital baseband is also analysed and its unique properties are investigated. By introducing a simple track and hold control to the ALMS loop’s tap coefficients, a joint analog and digital SIC scheme is proposed to stop the tap coefficient variation and achieve very low residual SI close to the IBFD receiver’s noise floor. In a coordinated application scenario, the noise figure of the digital SIC algorithm is proved to be only 1.76 dB at most. Simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analyses.}

The problem is posed as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with the goal of minimizing the average beam alignment overhead subject to the average rate constraint on each user. Under a certain assumption on the rate function of the users, by using a structural result derived from the Lagrangian formulation of the CMDP, we show that the optimal policy should keep scheduling the users that are scheduled in the previous time slot unless an abrupt change in the beam direction occurs. Using this result, the complexity of the problem decreases to polynomial in the number of users. In addition, we provide a heuristic deterministic algorithm that achieves\n(1+ϵ)\napproximation of the optimal solution, with smaller\nϵ\nat the cost of longer transmission interval of each user. Lastly, to deal with the case where the assumption on the rate function does not hold due to beam conflicts between the users, we consider a system model that accounts for an angular channel information. A new CMDP is formulated for the problem and a heuristic algorithm based on the age information is proposed.}

	abstract = {We study distributed algorithms for joint adaptation of precoding and combining filters in frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems. Our approach extends bi-directional training (BiT), designed for time division duplex (TDD) systems, to FDD systems where uplink/downlink reciprocity may not apply. An analysis of the performance loss due to different uplink-downlink frequencies in a point-to-point scenario, shows that a direct application of BiT gives mismatched precoders with substantial performance degradation. We first propose an algorithm assuming each base transceiver station (BTS) knows the uplink and downlink channels of mobiles within the cell. We then consider the scenario where neither the BTSs nor the mobiles have a priori channel state information. Our proposed approaches assume angular reciprocity characterized by angles of arrival/departure that vary predictably with frequency. Hence spatial beams corresponding to angles of arrival can be turned around to the corresponding angles of departure in the paired band. We present three methods, differing in how the angular decomposition is applied and used, namely, to reconstruct the combiner directly, or to reconstruct the received signal. Simulation results indicate that when the multipath is sufficiently sparse, most of achievable gain with channel reciprocity and TDD can be recovered.}

	abstract = {Deployed with computation resources, fog radio access network (F-RAN) provides a promising solution for computation offloading. To take full advantage of two-tier computing in the F-RAN, on one hand, it is inevitable to design, between edge and cloud, an efficient and flexible fronthaul transmission strategy, and fronthaul resource allocation should be jointly optimized with allocation of tasks and other resources. On the other hand, a robust computation provisioning strategy that can avoid failures caused by estimation errors of available computation resources is necessary. In this work, considering the fronthaul compression and the uncertain computation capacity, we design an energy-efficient computation offloading mechanism in the F-RAN. The formulated problem is challenging to solve due to coupled communication and computation resource constraints and binary variables for task placement. We show that the problem can be recast as a convex problem if binary variables are relaxed. On top of this result, we propose an efficient algorithm to find a stationary solution. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm significantly and converges to the near-optimal point solution. Besides, we compare the F-RAN with single-tier computing systems and show the excellence of the F-RAN in energy conservation for mobile devices.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of oscillator phase noise on a multiuser millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO uplink as we scale up the number of base station antennas, fixing the load factor, defined as the ratio of the number of simultaneous users to the number of base station antennas. We consider a modular approach in which the base station employs an array of subarrays, or “tiles.” Each tile supports a fixed number of antennas, and can therefore be implemented using a separate radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), with synchronization across tiles accomplished by employing a phased locked loop in each tile to synthesize an on-chip oscillator at the carrier frequency by locking on to a common lower frequency reference clock. Assuming linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) multiuser detection, we provide an analytical framework that can be used to specify the required power spectral density (PSD) mask for phase noise for a target system performance. Our analysis for the phase noise at the output of the LMMSE receiver indicates two distinct effects: self-noise for each user which is inversely proportional to the number of tiles, and cross-talk between users which is insensitive to the number of tiles, and is proportional to the load factor. These analytical predictions, verified by simulations for a 140 GHz system targeting a per-user data rate of 10 Gbps, show that tiling is a robust approach for scaling. Numerical results for our proposed design approach yield relatively relaxed specifications for phase noise PSD masks.}

Indeed, the impact of passive eavesdropping has been shown to be negligible when the base station (BS) antenna size approaches infinity for Rayleigh channels. In this paper, we experimentally explore eavesdropping in massive MIMO incorporating real-world factors including a limited BS antenna array size, potential correlation in over-the-air channels, and adaptation of modulating and coding schemes (MCS) over a discrete and finite set. Using a 96-antenna ArgosV2 BS, we first explore scaling the array size and identify eavesdropper (Eve) advantages due to channel correlation. We next identify the “MCS saturation regime” as a vulnerability even with high SNR due to limited MCS levels, and thereby demonstrating the need for power control as a counter-strategy, especially considering Eve’s advantages in the over-the-air channels. We further demonstrate Eve’s gain in optimizing her position, not only via being nomadic and searching for the most favorable position, but also via exploiting predictable line-of-sight (LoS) positional vulnerabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate Eve’s advantage by simply sharing the elevation angle with Bob in the LoS scenario. Finally, we examine how Eve’s advantage due to channel correlation scales with more eavesdropping antennas.}

	abstract = {In ultra-dense networks, the increasing popularity of computation intensive applications imposes challenges to the resource-constrained smart mobile devices (SMDs), which may be solved by offloading these computation tasks to the nearby mobile edge computing centers. However, when massive SMDs offload computation tasks in a dynamic wireless environment simultaneously, the joint optimization of their offloading decisions becomes prohibitively complex. In this paper, we firstly model the joint optimization problem as a multi-user non-cooperative dynamic stochastic game, then propose a mean field game based algorithm to solve it with a drastically reduced complexity. We derive the two partial differential equations ruling the optimal strategies of the mean field game, namely the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations, which are solved in an iterative manner in our proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed mean field game-based offloading algorithm requires a lower cumulated cost than the conventional strategies under the latency constraints of computation tasks, with perfect prediction of future channel states. It also appears that the performance of the mean field game-based offloading strategy depends on the accuracy of the future channel knowledge provided to the system, as the uncertainty may compromise its cumulated cost performance.}

	abstract = {The network operators will soon be accommodating a new type of users: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). 5G New Radio (NR) technology operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands can support the emerging bandwidth-hungry applications facilitated by such aerial devices. To reliably integrate UAVs into the NR-based network infrastructure, new system models that capture the features of UAVs in urban environments are required. As city building blocks constitute one of the primary sources of blockage on the links from the UAV to its serving base station (BS), the corresponding line-of-sight (LoS) probability models are essential for accurate performance evaluation in realistic scenarios. We propose a LoS probability model in UAV communication setups over regular urban grid deployments, which is based on a Manhattan Poisson line process. Our approach captures different building height distributions as well as their dimensions and densities. Under certain characteristic distributions, closed-form expressions for the LoS probability are offered. Our numerical results demonstrate the importance of accounting for the building height distribution type as well as the orientation of the UAV with respect to its BS. By comparing our model with the standard ITU and 3GPP formulations, we establish that the latter provide an overly optimistic approximation for various deployments.}

	abstract = {Edge side caching assisted device-to-device (D2D) communication has been acknowledged as a promising technique to alleviate the heavy burden of backhaul transmission link and to reduce the network latency. However, the effectiveness of caching strategies at the network edge is highly dependent on the distribution of individual user’s content preference. To fully attain the benefits of edge caching, some proactive mechanisms shall be considered. Among which, recommendation performs noticeably well due to its capability of reshaping the content request probabilities of different users, which in turn affects the cache decision significantly. In this work, we quantitatively investigate how recommendation can be applied to enhance the caching efficiency of D2D enabled wireless content caching networks. And for that, the cache hit ratio maximization problem for a generic network model is formulated taking into account the requirements of each user’s personalized recommendation quality, recommendation quantity and cache capacity. Then, we show that the optimal recommendation and caching policies which jointly maximize the cache efficiency is NP-hard to compute. Further, a time-efficient sub-optimal algorithm is designed, which works in an iterative manner and has provable convergence guarantee as well as polynomial time complexity. Monte-Carlo simulation results demonstrate the convergence performance of our proposed joint decision algorithm and its cache efficiency improvements compared to extensive benchmarks.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel scheme for mitigating strong interferences, which is applicable to various wireless scenarios, including full-duplex wireless communications and uncoordinated heterogeneous networks. As strong interferences can saturate the receiver’s analog-to-digital converters (ADC), they need to be mitigated both before and after the ADCs, i.e., via hybrid processing. The key idea of the proposed scheme, namely the Hybrid Interference Mitigation using Analog Prewhitening (HIMAP), is to insert an M\n-input M\n-output analog phase shifter network (PSN) between the receive antennas and the ADCs to spatially prewhiten the interferences, which requires no signal information but only an estimate of the covariance matrix. After interference mitigation by the PSN prewhitener, the preamble can be synchronized, the signal channel response can be estimated, and thus a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamformer can be applied in the digital domain to further mitigate the residual interferences. The simulation results verify that the HIMAP scheme can suppress interferences 80dB stronger than the signal by using off-the-shelf phase shifters (PS) of 6-bit resolution.}

The effectiveness of multi-dimensional resource collaboration has significant impacts on the IoRT data downloading performance. However, the environment ’ s dynamics, e.g., channel conditions and solar infeed process, are unknown in practical scenarios, which poses daunting challenges in making efficient utilization of multi-dimensional resources. Motivated by this fact, we model the joint resource scheduling and IoRT data scheduling problem with the aim of maximizing the amount of the IoRT data of the overall network by applying the model-free reinforcement learning framework. To overcome the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, we propose several feature functions by investigating the natural attributes of the multi-dimensional resources of the SIoRTNs, and further exploit the concept of function approximation to approximate the expected downloaded IoRT data given the network state. Furthermore, we propose a state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) based actor-critic reinforcement learning (SACRL) resource allocation strategy to achieve the optimal resource allocation and IoRT data scheduling with casual information at LEO satellites. Simulations validate the convergence property and the effectiveness of the proposed SACRL algorithm in terms of the amount of the downloaded IoRT data. Particularly, we investigate the impact of typical network parameters on network performance to further provide guidance for future SIoRTN system design.}

	abstract = {Classical random access protocols support prioritized user groups by allowing a high priority user to transmit with a relatively high probability. However, when a high priority user competes for the channel with a large number of low priority users, transmission success probability of the high priority user can still diminish to zero. In this paper, a distributed medium access control (MAC) framework is proposed to support hierarchical user groups in a random multiple access system in the following senses. First, when the number of primary users is small, the MAC framework guarantees that channel availability should stay above a pre-determined threshold no matter how many secondary users are competing for the channel. Second, when the number of primary users is large, the MAC framework drives transmission probabilities of the secondary users to zero but does not reject channel access to the primary users. These properties are achieved in a distributed environment without direct message exchange between users, without knowledge on the number of users, and without knowing whether each transmission should belong to a primary or a secondary user. The MAC framework is also extended to systems where each user can be equipped with multiple transmission options.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a single-cell multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network with one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which works as an amplify-and-forward relay to improve the quality-of-service (QoS) of the user equipments (UEs) in the cell edge. Aiming to improve the throughput while guaranteeing the user fairness, we jointly optimize the communication mode, subchannel allocation, power allocation, and UAV trajectory, which is an NP-hard problem. To design the UAV trajectory and resource allocation efficiently, we first decompose the problem into three subproblems, i.e., mode selection and subchannel allocation, trajectory optimization, and power allocation, and then solve these subproblems iteratively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the random algorithm and the cellular scheme.}

	abstract = {The fundamental intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment problem is investigated for IRS-assisted networks, where one IRS is arranged to be deployed in a specific region for assisting the communication between an access point (AP) and multiple users. Specifically, three multiple access schemes are considered, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). The weighted sum rate maximization problem for joint optimization of the deployment location and the reflection coefficients of the IRS as well as the power allocation at the AP is formulated. The non-convex optimization problems obtained for NOMA and FDMA are solved by employing monotonic optimization and semidefinite relaxation to find a performance upper bound. The problem obtained for TDMA is optimally solved by leveraging the time-selective nature of the IRS. Furthermore, for all three multiple access schemes, low-complexity suboptimal algorithms are developed by exploiting alternating optimization and successive convex approximation techniques, where a local region optimization method is applied for optimizing the IRS deployment location. Numerical results are provided to show that: 1) near-optimal performance can be achieved by the proposed suboptimal algorithms; 2) asymmetric and symmetric IRS deployment strategies are preferable for NOMA and FDMA/TDMA, respectively; 3) the performance gain achieved with IRS can be significantly improved by optimizing the deployment location.}

	abstract = {Wireless charging coupled with computation offloading in edge networks offers a promising solution for realizing power-hungry and computation intensive applications on user-devices. We consider a multi-access edge computing (MEC) system with collocated MEC server and base-station/access point (AP), each equipped with a massive MIMO antenna array, supporting multiple users requesting data computation and wireless charging. The goal is to minimize the energy consumption for computation offloading and maximize the received energy at the user from wireless charging. The proposed solution is a novel two-stage algorithm employing a nested descent algorithm, primal-dual subgradient and linear programming techniques to perform data partitioning and time allocation for computation offloading and design the optimal energy beamforming for wireless charging, all within MEC-AP transmit power and latency constraints. Algorithm results show that optimal energy beamforming significantly outperforms other schemes such as isotropic or directed charging without beam power allocation. Compared to binary offloading, data partition in partial offloading leads to lower energy consumption and more charging time, resulting in better wireless charging performance. The charged energy over an extended period of multiple time-slots both with and without computation offloading can be substantial. Wireless charging from MEC-AP thus offers a viable untethered approach for supplying energy to user-devices.}

According to available channel state information, the proposed ASSM algorithms are conducted to compute the optimal numbers of scatters and the optimal modulation orders constrained by the maximal tolerable symbol error probability (SEP). In addition, the minimal tolerate value of the minimal tolerant signal-to-noise ratio and SEP threshold are computed with a given data rate requirement by the bisection algorithm. At the receiver, a new type of optimal maximum likelihood detector is proposed to enhance the SEP performance. Furthermore, the union upper bound on the SEP is derived and analyzed. In addition, the computational complexity and system performance of the ASSM schemes are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASSM algorithms yield a lower SEP than the conventional spatial scattering modulation at the same value of average data rate.}

Small cell networks utilize low transmission power levels and thus, are appropriate for deploying full-duplex (FD) technology. In this paper, a hybrid full/half duplex (FD/HD) small cell network exploiting fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and fractional power control (FPC) for interference mitigation is considered. Theoretical expressions for the coverage probability and the average sum-rate in uplink and downlink directions are derived for systems that make use of conventional frequency reuse, hard FFR, and soft FFR. The impact of various system parameters, such as power control parameter, small base station (SBS) density, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) parameters on system performance are investigated. The numerical experiments show that SBSs tend to operate in FD mode for large values of SBS density and SIC level. Also, interestingly, the optimal sum-rate is achieved when all SBSs operate either in FD or in HD mode. Finally, it is observed that exploiting FFR techniques in FD networks making use of FPC, significantly improves downlink coverage probability.}

	abstract = {The hardware realization of Universal Filtered Multi Carrier (UFMC) architecture has attracted significant attention in fifth generation (5G) and beyond. In addition to the flexibility in fast Fourier transform (FFT)-length, a flexible prototype filter in combination with multiplicative complex spectrum shifting co-efficients is required for realizing flexible UFMC architecture. The existing architectures of UFMC transmitter commonly adopted fixed-size FFT-length, number of subbands, subband size, and filter-length. Moreover, the lack of flexible prototype filter and spectrum localization of filter co-efficients to individual subbands limits the flexible UFMC system design. In this paper, we propose VLSI architecture for a flexible length prototype filter that can generate spectrally shifted filter co-efficients to individual subbands in tune with the changing value of FFT-length, number of subbands, subband size, and filter-length. For 16-bit word size architecture, our proposed design produces filter co-efficients and spectrum shifting co-efficients upto length, 2^{15}\n. Thus, any desired combination of FFT-length, number of subbands, subband size and filter-length is selected to generate the filter co-efficients for the individual subbands. Moreover, complex multiplication and addition operations are reduced in proposed architecture, quantitatively, about 58.81% reduction in filtering unit is achieved over the state-of-the-art architecture. Finally, hardware implementation output and XILINX post route simulation result matches perfectly with MATLAB simulations.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) for underwater visible light communication systems. We consider three SLIPT methods namely time switching (TS), power splitting (PS) and time switching-power splitting (TS-PS) where the splitting/switching factors are defined as optimization parameters. For each of these methods, we derive closed-form expressions for the average harvested energy, bit error rate and spectral efficiency in the presence of underwater turbulence modeled by lognormal statistics. Using these expressions, we determine the optimal splitting factors to maximize the harvested energy while satisfying a given bit error rate value and a given threshold spectral efficiency value. Our results reveal that, if not optimized, SLIPT methods under consideration are outperformed by the simple AC-DC separation (ADS) method which provides the largest harvested energy versus spectral efficiency (HE-SE) region. Optimization of splitting/switching factors extends the HE-SE regions; hence, optimized versions of TS, PS and TS-PS methods are able to significantly outperform ADS for most cases. We further investigate the effect of various channel and system parameters such as water type, turbulence level, beam divergence, receiver aperture size on the harvested energy and quantify the improvements in battery lifetime through the use of SLIPT methods.}

The radio’s objective is to apply both frequency hopping and transmit power adjustment to maintain a required level of quality-of-service (QoS). The spectrum is partitioned into sub-bands each made of a number of narrowband channels. A multi-task deep Q-network (DQN) is utilized to solve the underlying problem where communications over each sub-band represents a single task. The proposed technique exploits transfer learning between tasks to speed up learning operation for new tasks. The proposed multi-task transfer DQN is proved to be converged. It is shown through simulations that the radio is able to learn an efficient strategy to evade interference signals in a partially observable environment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach offers up to 24% improvement to the percentage of successful communications when compared to other RL-based approaches found in existing literature.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development and convergence of the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT), computing-intensive and delay-sensitive IoT applications (APPs) are proliferating with an unprecedented speed in recent years. Mobile edge computing (MEC) and energy harvesting (EH) technologies can significantly improve the user experience by offloading computation tasks to edge-cloud servers as well as achieving green and durable operation. Traditional centralized strategies require precise information of system states, which may not be feasible in the era of big data and artificial intelligence. To this end, how to allocate limited edge-cloud computing resource on demand, and how to develop heterogeneous task offloading strategies with EH in a more flexible manner are remaining challenges. In this paper, we investigate an EH-enabled MEC offloading system, and propose an online distributed optimization algorithm based on game theory and perturbed Lyapunov optimization theory. The proposed algorithm works online and jointly determines heterogeneous task offloading, on-demand computing resource allocation, and battery energy management. Furthermore, to reduce the unnecessary communication overhead and improve the processing efficiency, an offloading pre-screening criterion is designed by balancing battery energy level, latency, and revenue. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Caching popular contents at the network edge has been considered as a promising enabler to relieve the pressure on networks due to the fact that a substantial portion of global data traffic is repeatedly requested by many subscribers and thus redundantly generated. Recommendation, on the other hand, has attracted spiraling attention for its capability of reshaping users’ contents demand patterns. In this paper, we examine the practicability of recommendation in boosting the gains of edge caching with uncharted users’ feature information. To this end, we first characterize the average system cost for a generic network model, disclosing its dependence on the recommendation and caching strategies. Then, we formulate the joint caching and recommendation decision oriented cost minimization problem, taking the constraints on each content provider’s cache capacity budget, each individual user’s recommendation size and recommendation quality into account. However, the implicit information regarding users’ preference makes the problem inextricable. To address this issue, a versatile long short term memory (LSTM) network assisted prediction paradigm is proposed to attain the preference schema of users with the assistance of their historical behavior data. Based on that, we rigorously prove the NP-hardness of obtaining the optimal recommendation and caching policies that jointly minimize the system cost. Therewith, an iterative suboptimal algorithm is developed, which has provable polynomial time complexity and convergence guarantee. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed LSTM enabled feature information prediction approach and the convergence performance of the devised joint decision making methodology. In addition, it is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms numerous benchmarks significantly.}

Self-interference is distorted by transceiver nonlinearity. Thus, the IBFD literature includes reports of nonlinear self-interference cancellers developed to achieve better cancellation performance. However, there are no detailed theoretical studies analyzing the performance of nonlinear cancellers in IBFD systems. In this work, we develop a theoretical analysis technique for IBFD systems using parallel Hammerstein self-interference cancellers. The nonlinear characteristics of the system are expanded by a generalized Fourier series using orthonormal Laguerre polynomials. Then, the canceller’s performance and the system’s symbol error rate (SER) are analyzed using the obtained Fourier coefficients. The analytical results are compared with simulation results, demonstrating good correlation in a wide range of situations, from extremely nonlinear cases to good linear cases. Additionally, we show that the SER of the IBFD system is reduced by moderately nonlinearizing rather than linearizing the amplifier.}

To overcome this challenge, we propose fast deep learning (DL)-aided SD (FDL-SD) and fast DL-aided K\n-best SD (KSD, FDL-KSD) algorithms. Therein, the major application of DL is to generate a highly reliable initial candidate to accelerate the search in SD and KSD in conjunction with candidate/layer ordering and early rejection. Compared to existing DL-aided SD schemes, our proposed schemes are more advantageous in both offline training and online application phases. Specifically, unlike existing DL-aided SD schemes, they do not require performing the conventional SD in the training phase. For a 24 \\times 24\nMIMO system with QPSK, the proposed FDL-SD achieves a complexity reduction of more than 90% without any performance loss compared to conventional SD schemes. For a 32 \\times 32\nMIMO system with QPSK, the proposed FDL-KSD only requires K = 32\nto attain the performance of the conventional KSD with K=256\n, where K\nis the number of survival paths in KSD. This implies a dramatic improvement in the performance–complexity tradeoff of the proposed FDL-KSD scheme.}

	abstract = {Communication is widely known as the primary bottleneck of federated learning, and quantization of local model updates before uploading to the parameter server is an effective solution to reduce the communication overhead. However, prior literature always assumes homogeneous quantization for all clients, while in reality, devices are heterogeneous and support different levels of quantization precision. This heterogeneity of quantization poses a new challenge: fine-quantized model updates are more accurate than coarse-quantized ones, and how to optimally aggregate them at the server is an open problem. In this paper, we propose FedHQ – Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Quantization – that allocates different aggregation weights to different clients by minimizing the convergence rate upper bound as a function of the heterogeneous quantization errors of all clients, for both strongly convex and non-convex loss functions. To further accelerate the convergence, the instantaneous quantization error is computed and piggybacked when each client uploads the local model update, and the server dynamically calculates the weight accordingly for the current aggregation. Numerical experiment results demonstrate the performance advantages of FedHQ over both vanilla FedAvg with standard equal weights and a heuristic aggregation scheme, which assigns weights linearly proportional to the clients’ quantization precision.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable antennas (RAs) emerged as a promising technology that can deal with channel variations and enhance the capacity and reliability of the wireless channel. To fully exploit the advantage of RAs, optimal antenna modes need to be selected in an online manner. However, the channel statistics are unknown a priori. Multi-armed bandit-based online learning algorithms were proposed to address this challenge, but the main drawback of existing approaches are that their regret scales linearly with the number of antenna modes, which converges slowly when the latter is large. To improve the scalability, we first apply an existing algorithm: Thompson sampling via Gaussian process (TS-GP), and propose two new algorithms for antenna mode selection: upper confidence bound with channel prediction (UCB-CP) and Thompson Sampling with channel prediction (TS-CP). TS-GP uses Gaussian prior to model the reward distribution of each antenna mode, as well as the correlation among them. UCB-CP and TS-CP exploit channel modeling to predict the channel conditions of unexplored antenna modes at each time step, by relating the correlation between different channel states to the underlying antenna modes. We prove the finite-time regret bound of UCB-CP and show that it is independent from the number of arms, when the expected channel estimation errors are small enough. We also extend the algorithms to the mobile setting. Both simulation results and real-world experiments show that all of our proposed learning algorithms can significantly improve the convergence rate and yield much lower regret (thus higher throughput) than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {This article studies the strategic interactions between an IoT service provider (IoTSP) which consists of heterogeneous IoT devices and its energy service provider (ESP). To that end, we propose an economic framework using the Stackelberg game to maximize the network throughput and energy efficiency of both the IoTSP and ESP. To obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply a backward induction technique which first derives a closed-form solution for the ESP (follower). Then, to tackle the non-convex optimization problem for the IoTSP (leader), we leverage the block coordinate descent and convex-concave procedure techniques to design two partitioning schemes (i.e., partial adjustment (PA) and joint adjustment (JA)) to find the optimal energy price and service time that constitute local SEs. Numerical results reveal that by jointly optimizing the energy trading and time allocation for IoT devices, one can achieve significant improvements in terms of the IoTSP’s profit compared with those of conventional transmission methods (up to 38.7 folds). Different tradeoffs between the ESP’s and IoTSP’s profits and complexities of the PA/JA schemes can also be numerically tuned. Simulations also show that the obtained local SEs approach the optimal social welfare when the benefit per transmitted bit exceeds a given threshold.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been selected as the basis for the fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) waveform developments. However, effective signal processing tools are needed for enhancing the OFDM spectrum in various advanced transmission scenarios. In earlier work, we have shown that fast-convolution (FC) processing is a very flexible and efficient tool for filtered-OFDM signal generation and receiver-side subband filtering, e.g., for the mixed-numerology scenarios of the 5G NR. FC filtering approximates linear convolution through effective fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based circular convolutions using partly overlapping processing blocks. However, with the continuous overlap-and-save and overlap-and-add processing models with fixed block-size and fixed overlap, the FC-processing blocks cannot be aligned with all OFDM symbols of a transmission frame. Furthermore, 5G NR numerology does not allow to use transform lengths shorter than 128 because this would lead to non-integer cyclic prefix (CP) lengths. In this article, we present new FC-processing schemes which solve or avoid the mentioned limitations. These schemes are based on dynamically adjusting the overlap periods and extrapolating the CP samples, which make it possible to align the FC blocks with each OFDM symbol, even in case of variable CP lengths. This reduces complexity and latency, e.g., in mini-slot transmissions and, as an example, allows to use 16-point transforms in case of a 12-subcarrier-wide subband allocation, greatly reducing the implementation complexity. On the receiver side, the proposed scheme makes it possible to effectively combine cascaded inverse and forward FFT units in FC-filtered OFDM processing. Transform decomposition is used to simplify these computations, leading to significantly reduced implementation complexity in various transmission scenarios. A very extensive set of numerical results is also provided, in terms of the radio-link performance and associated processing complexity.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) leverages the existing ambient radio frequency (RF) environment to implement communication with battery-free devices. The key challenge in the development of AmBC is the very weak RF signals backscattered by the AmBC Tag. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) by incorporating multiple antennas at the Tag as well as at the Reader. Our approach considers both coherent and non-coherent OSTBC so that systems with and without channel state information can be considered. To allow the application of OSTBC, we develop an approximate linearized and normalized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model for the AmBC system. This MIMO channel model is shown to be accurate for a wide range of useful operating conditions. Two coherent detectors and a non-coherent detector are also provided based on the proposed AmBC channel model. Simulation results show that enhanced bit error rate performance can be achieved, demonstrating the benefit of using multiple antennas at the Tag as well as the Reader.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce DeepFake, a novel deep reinforcement learning-based deception strategy to deal with reactive jamming attacks. In particular, for a smart and reactive jamming attack, the jammer is able to sense the channel and attack the channel if it detects communications from the legitimate transmitter. To deal with such attacks, we propose an intelligent deception strategy which allows the legitimate transmitter to transmit “fake” signals to attract the jammer. Then, if the jammer attacks the channel, the transmitter can leverage the strong jamming signals to transmit data by using ambient backscatter communication technology or harvest energy from the strong jamming signals for future use. By doing so, we can not only undermine the attack ability of the jammer, but also utilize jamming signals to improve the system performance. To effectively learn from and adapt to the dynamic and uncertainty of jamming attacks, we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm using the deep dueling neural network architecture to obtain the optimal policy with thousand times faster than those of the conventional reinforcement algorithms. Extensive simulation results reveal that our proposed DeepFake framework is superior to other anti-jamming strategies in terms of throughput, packet loss, and learning rate.}

Numerical evaluation demonstrates that the RB-SLIPT can deliver more than 4W charging power and enable 3Gb/s achievable data rate with the moving range of 20° field of view (FOV) over 3m distance.

An equivalent channel model for the considered multicast transmission is analyzed, and then an optimization problem for the corresponding channel capacity is formulated to obtain the optimal covariance matrix and phase shifts. In order to solve the above non-convex and non-differentiable problem, this paper first exploits the gradient descent method and alternating optimization, to approach the locally optimal solution for any number of MUs. Then, this paper considers a special case, which can obtain the global optimal solution, and shows the sufficient and necessary condition for this special case. Finally, the order growth of the maximal capacity is obtained when the numbers of the reflecting elements, the BS antennas, and the MUs go to infinity.}

	abstract = {Wide area networks for surveying applications, such as seismic acquisition, have been witnessing a significant increase in node density and area, where large amounts of data have to be transferred in real-time. While cables can meet these requirements, they account for a majority of the equipment weight, maintenance, and labor costs. A novel wireless network architecture, compliant with the IEEE 802.11ad standard, is proposed for establishing scalable, energy-efficient, and gigabit-rate backhaul across very large areas. Statistical path-loss and line-of-sight models are derived using real-world topographic data in well-known seismic regions. Additionally, a cross-layer analytical model is derived for 802.11 systems that can characterize the overall latency and power consumption under the impact of co-channel interference. On the basis of these models, a Frame Aggregation Power-Saving Backhaul (FA-PSB) scheme is proposed for near-optimal power conservation under a latency constraint, through a duty-cycled approach. A performance evaluation with respect to the survey size and data generation rate reveals that the proposed architecture and the FA-PSB scheme can support real-time acquisition in large-scale high-density scenarios while operating with minimal power consumption, thereby enhancing the lifetime of wireless seismic surveys. The FA-PSB scheme can be applied to cellular backhaul and sensor networks as well.}

	abstract = {In a wireless network that conveys status updates from sources (i.e., sensors) to destinations, one of the key issues studied by existing literature is how to design an optimal source sampling strategy on account of the communication constraints which are often modeled as queues. In this paper, an alternative perspective is presented—a novel status-aware communication scheme, namely parallel communications , is proposed which allows sensors to be communication-agnostic. Specifically, the proposed scheme can determine, based on an online prediction functionality, whether a status packet is worth transmitting considering both the network condition and status prediction, such that sensors can generate status packets without communication constraints. We evaluate the proposed scheme on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) test platform, which is integrated with a collaborative autonomous driving simulator, i.e., Simulation-of-Urban-Mobility (SUMO), to produce realistic vehicle control models and road conditions. The results show that with online status predictions, the channel occupancy is significantly reduced, while guaranteeing low status recovery error. Then the framework is applied to two scenarios: a multi-density platooning scenario, and a flight formation control scenario. Simulation results show that the scheme achieves better performance on the network level, in terms of keeping the minimum safe distance in both vehicle platooning and flight control.}

This causes the beam measurements to become outdated by different extents at the time the transmit and receive beams are selected. The rapid changes in user device orientation exacerbate this problem. We first present a novel modified bivariate Nakagami-\nm\n(MBN) model to tractably and accurately characterize the joint, non-stationary statistics of the channel gains seen at the times of measurement and data transmission. We then derive a novel and optimal beam selection rule that maximizes the average rate of the system. We use the MBN model to propose a near-optimal, practically amenable bound-based selection (PABS) rule. Our approach captures several pertinent aspects about the spatial channel model and 5G, such as transmission of periodic bursts of reference signals, feedback from the user to enable the base station to select its transmit beam, and the faster pace of updating the data rate compared to the transmit-receive beam pair. The PABS rule markedly outperforms the widely used conventional power-based selection rule and is less sensitive to user orientation changes.}

An artificial CE is calculated as a sum of the ideal noiseless channel (pre-defined Quadriga model) and the leftover noise after the optimal estimate. The artificial CE is then utilized in the MIMO detector and decoder units to calculate performance bound. Our method outperforms the accuracy of a well-known Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) due to considering more statistics (number of taps and correlation between them) since performance strongly depends on several channel taps and their power ratio. Additionally, we show that our bound can be obtained from the generalized Bayesian CRLB. Simulation results are presented for the 5G QuaDRiGa 2.0 NLOS channel.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security and reliability trade-off (SRT) for a wireless sensor network (WSN) which consists of one cluster head (CH), multiple users, and one eavesdropper (E), where the eavesdropper attempts to tap the confidential transmission between multiple users and CH. We first present two multiuser scheduling schemes, namely the selection combining (SC) scheme and the switch-and-examine combining with post-selection (SECps) scheme to enhance physical-layer security (PLS) of the WSN system. For comparison purposes, the round-robin scheduling (RRS) scheme is also considered as a baseline. Then, we analyze the SRT of the RRS, SECps, and SC schemes by deriving their closed-form outage and intercept probability expressions under the joint impact of hardware impairment (HI) and co-channel interference (CCI). And, secrecy diversity analysis of the three schemes is also carried out. Numerical results show that the SC and SECps scheme outperform the RRS scheme in terms of the SRT performance, where the SC scheme can achieve the best SRT performance at the cost of an increased channel estimation complexity. Moreover, a trade-off between the security and reliability can be achieved for each of the RRS, SECps, and SC schemes by adjusting the overall data rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study covert communications between a pair of legitimate transmitter-receiver against a watchful warden over slow fading channels. There coexist multiple friendly helper nodes who are willing to protect the covert communication from being detected by the warden. We propose an uncoordinated jammer selection scheme where those helpers whose instantaneous channel gains to the legitimate receiver fall below a pre-established selection threshold will be chosen as jammers radiating jamming signals to defeat the warden. By doing so, the detection accuracy of the warden is expected to be severely degraded while the desired covert communication is rarely affected. We then jointly design the optimal selection threshold and message transmission rate for maximizing covert throughput under the premise that the detection error of the warden exceeds a certain level. Numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analyses. It is shown that the multi-jammer assisted covert communication outperforms the conventional single-jammer method in terms of covert throughput, and the maximal covert throughput improves significantly as the total number of helpers increases, which demonstrates the validity and superiority of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have extensive civilian and military applications, but establishing a UAV network providing high data rate communications with low delay is a challenge. Millimeter wave (mmWave), with its high bandwidth nature, can be adopted in the UAV network to achieve high speed data transfer. However, it is difficult to establish and maintain the mmWave communication links due to the mobility of UAVs. In this paper, a beam management scheme utilizing angular domain information (ADI) is proposed to rapidly establish and reliably maintain the communication links for the mmWave UAV network. Firstly, Gaussian process machine learning (GPML)-enabled position prediction is proposed to facilitate coarse-ADI acquisition through the proposed UAV clustering algorithm. Then, with the proposed confined-ADI acquisition which removes the redundancy in the coarse-ADI acquisition, fast beam tracking with respectively the single-beam pattern and the multi-beam pattern is achieved. Finally, a data-driven beam pattern selection scheme is proposed for improving the spectrum efficiency. Simulation results verify the outstanding performance of the proposed beam management for mmWave UAV networks.}

	abstract = {Terrestrial-satellite networks (TSNs) are envisioned to play a significant role in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In such networks, hot air balloons are useful as they can relay the signals between satellites and ground stations. Most existing works assume that the hot air balloons are deployed at the same height with the same minimum elevation angle to the satellites, which may not be practical due to possible route conflict with airplanes and other flight equipment. In this paper, we consider a TSN containing hot air balloons at different heights and with different minimum elevation angles, which creates the challenge of non-uniform available serving time for the communication between the hot air balloons and the satellites. Jointly considering the caching, computing, and communication (3C) resource management for both the ground-balloon-satellite links and inter-satellite laser links, our objective is to maximize the network energy efficiency. Firstly, by proposing a tapped water-filling algorithm, we schedule the traffic to relay among satellites according to the available serving time of satellites. Then, we generate a series of configuration matrices, based on which we formulate the relation between relay time and the power consumption involved in the relay among satellites. Finally, the collaborative resource allocation problem for TSN is modeled and solved by geometric programming with Taylor series approximation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Wireless networks are usually deployed to cover more overlapping areas, experiencing severe interferences and hence making interference management essential for their viability. Interference alignment (IA) is an effective way of interference management and has thus received significant attention. With IA, at least one degree-of-freedom (DoF) should be used to place the aligned interferences. However, when multiple interferences are from one identical transmitter and to a common destination, IA is not applicable under a one-DoF cost constraint. If these interfering signals are aligned in the same direction at the interfered receiver, they will also overlap with each other at their intended receiver, thus becoming indistinguishable. Moreover, IA is realized by adjusting the spatial feature of disturbance, hence incurring co-channel interference to the interfering transmission-pair’s own communication. To solve this problem, we propose cooperative IA . Instead of adjusting the spatial characteristics of all interferences, we aim to achieve IA by adjusting interferences’ strength along with one or none interference’s signature, based on the interactions among multiple wireless disturbances. We propose two cooperative IA schemes: cooperative IA with space-power adjustment and cooperative IA with power adjustment. With the first method, the overall effect of all interferences is aligned in the orthogonal direction with respect to the desired signal at the interfered receiver. This method modifies the direction of one interference with a properly designed precoding vector and the strength of all interferences via power allocation. Under the second scheme, the strength of all interfering signals is modified so that the overall effect of multiple interferences is orthogonal to the desired transmission while guaranteeing the orthogonality among the interfering signals at their intended receiver. Our theoretical analysis and in-depth simulation have shown that the proposed schemes can effectively manage multiple interferences from an identical source while achieving good performance of the interfering transmission-pair.}

However, the hybrid precoder design is a challenging task requiring channel state information (CSI) feedback and solving a complex optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel RSSI-based unsupervised deep learning method to design the hybrid beamforming in massive MIMO systems. Furthermore, we propose i) a method to design the synchronization signal (SS) in initial access (IA); and ii) a method to design the codebook for the analog precoder. We also evaluate the system performance through a realistic channel model in various scenarios. We show that the proposed method not only greatly increases the spectral efficiency especially in frequency-division duplex (FDD) communication by using partial CSI feedback, but also has near-optimal sum-rate and outperforms other state-of-the-art full-CSI solutions.}

	abstract = {Interference exploitation has recently been shown to provide significant security benefits in multi-user communication systems. In this technique, the known interference is designed to be constructive to the legitimate users and disruptive to the malicious receivers. Accordingly, this paper analyzes the secrecy performance of constructive interference (CI) precoding technique in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems with phase-shift-keying (PSK) signals and in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. The secrecy performance of CI technique is comprehensively investigated in terms of symbol error probability (SEP), secrecy sum-rate, and intercept probability (IP). Firstly, new and exact analytical expressions for the average SEP of the legitimate users and the eavesdroppers are derived. In addition, for simplicity and in order to provide more insights, very accurate approximations of the average SEPs are presented in closed-form. Departing from classical Gaussian rate analysis, we employ finite constellation rate expressions to investigate the secrecy sum-rate. In this regard, closed-form analytical expression of the ergodic secrecy sum-rate is obtained. Then, based on the new secrecy sum-rate expression we propose adaptive modulation (AM) scheme with the aim to enhance the secrecy performance. Finally, we present analytical expressions of the IP with fixed and adaptive modulations. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate that, the interference exploitation technique can provide additional up to 17dB gain in the transmit SNR in terms of SEP, and up to 10dB gain in terms of the secrecy sum-rate and the IP, compared to the conventional interference suppression technique. Furthermore, significant performance improvement up to 66% can be achieved with the proposed AM scheme.}

We propose a hidden Markov model to capture the structured sparsity and temporal dependency characteristic of massive MIMO-OFDM channels in the angle-delay domain, and this probability model exhibits extensive adaptability to different realistic propagation scenarios. Then we solve the channel estimation problem based on a novel optimization framework named constrained Bethe free energy (BFE) minimization, which is valid for a generic statistical model. Under this systematic theoretical framework, a hierarchical hybrid message passing (HHMP) algorithm is proposed to track dynamic channel parameters recursively. The proposed method can adaptively learn the sparse structure and temporal correlation of multiuser channels without requiring the knowledge of hidden Markov channel parameters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed HHMP algorithm can accurately estimate angle-delay domain channels with reduced iteration times and pilot overhead.}

	abstract = {Future wireless and mobile network services must accommodate highly dynamic downlink and uplink traffic asymmetry. To fulfill this requirement, the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) introduced the enhanced interference mitigation and traffic adaptation strategy in addition to dynamic time division duplexing (TDD). In this study, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic TDD framework that effectively controls interference and serves various traffic demands. First, we introduce an interference-penalty model that evaluates interference indirectly based on the duplexing policy. This can significantly reduce overhead for measuring and exchanging channel information in a dense network. Second, we design a new mixed-reward model that consists of the achievable data rate and the implicit interference penalty. Third, we implement deep RL algorithms that base station (BSs) use to train their radio frame configurations (RFCs). The training process at each BS takes into account the traffic demand and the RFCs of the surrounding BSs. The BSs are coordinated in a single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, which achieves a global RFC setup that maximizes the data rate and minimizes the interference. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework stably converges in various environments and provides near-optimal performance equivalent to 95% or more of the full-search-based optimal performance, which is 48.84%, 41.92%, and 62.11% higher than the currently utilized random RFC, fixed RFC, and traffic-matched RFC approaches.}

	abstract = {Although the combination of the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology can make communication systems perform better in high-mobility scenarios, there are still many challenges in downlink channel estimation owing to inaccurate modeling and high pilot overhead in practical systems. In this paper, we propose a channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme for downlink massive MIMO-OTFS in presence of the fractional Doppler, including deterministic pilot design and channel estimation algorithm. First, we analyze the input-output relationship of the single-input single-output (SISO) OTFS based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modem and extend it to massive MIMO-OTFS. Moreover, we formulate an accurate model for the practical system in which the fractional Doppler is considered and the influence of subpaths is revealed. A deterministic pilot design is then proposed based on the model and the structure of the pilot matrix to reduce pilot overhead and save memory consumption. Since channel geometry changes very slowly relative to the communication timescale, we put forward a modified sensing matrix based channel estimation (MSMCE) algorithm to acquire the downlink CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed downlink CSI acquisition scheme has significant advantages over traditional algorithms.}

	abstract = {A dual-polarized intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can contribute to a better multiplexing of interfering wireless users. In this paper, we use this feature to improve the performance of dual-polarized massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). By considering the downlink of a multi-cluster scenario, the IRSs assist the base station (BS) to multiplex subsets of users in the polarization domain. Our novel strategy alleviates the impact of imperfect SIC and enables users to exploit polarization diversity with near-zero inter-subset interference. To this end, the IRSs are optimized to mitigate transmissions originated at the BS from the interfering polarization. The formulated optimization is transformed into quadratically constrained quadratic sub-problems, which makes it possible to obtain the optimal solution via interior-points methods. We also derive analytically a closed-form expression for the users’ ergodic rates by considering large numbers of reflecting elements. This is followed by representative simulation examples and comprehensive discussions. The results show that when the IRSs are large enough, the proposed scheme always outperforms conventional massive MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA systems even if SIC error propagation is present. It is also confirmed that dual-polarized IRSs can make cross-polar transmissions beneficial to the users, allowing them to improve their performance through diversity.}

Following that, the diversity order is obtained. It is shown that the use of discrete phase shifts does not degrade diversity order. More importantly, simulation results reveal that a 3-bit resolution for discrete phase shifts is sufficient to achieve near-optimal outage performance. Simulation results also imply the superiority of IRSs over full-duplex decode-and-forward relays.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and promising paradigm to substantially improve the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless networks, by constructing favorable communication channels via tuning massive low-cost passive reflecting elements. Despite recent advances in the link-level performance optimization for various IRS-aided wireless systems, it still remains an open problem whether the large-scale deployment of IRSs in wireless networks can be a cost-effective solution to achieve their sustainable capacity growth in the future. To address this problem, we study in this paper a new hybrid wireless network comprising both active base stations (BSs) and passive IRSs, and characterize its achievable spatial throughput in the downlink as well as other pertinent key performance metrics averaged over both channel fading and random locations of the deployed BSs/IRSs therein based on stochastic geometry . Compared to prior works on characterizing the performance of wireless networks with active BSs only, our analysis needs to derive the power distributions of both the signal and interference reflected by distributed IRSs in the network under spatially correlated channels, which exhibit channel hardening effects when the number of IRS elements becomes large. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of deploying distributed IRSs in enhancing the hybrid network throughput against the conventional network without IRS, which significantly boosts the signal power but results in only marginally increased interference in the network. Moreover, it is unveiled that there exists an optimal IRS/BS density ratio that maximizes the hybrid network throughput subject to a total deployment cost given their individual costs, while the conventional network without IRS (i.e., zero IRS/BS density ratio) is generally suboptimal in terms of throughput per unit cost.}

	abstract = {Spectrum sharing alleviates the severe shortage of spectrum in sub-6 GHz frequency bands through the harmonious coexistence of two or more wireless technologies on the same frequency resources. In this work, we study underlay radar-massive MIMO cellular coexistence in LoS/near-LoS channels, where both systems have 3D beamforming capabilities. Using mathematical tools from stochastic geometry, we derive an upper bound on the average interference power at the radar due to the 3D massive MIMO cellular downlink under the worst-case ‘cell-edge beamforming’ conditions. To overcome the technical challenges imposed by asymmetric and arbitrarily large cells, we devise a novel construction in which each Poisson Voronoi (PV) cell is bounded by its circumcircle to bound the effect of the random cell shapes on average interference. Since this model is intractable for further analysis due to the correlation between adjacent PV cells’ shapes and sizes, we propose a tractable nominal interference model, where we model each PV cell as a circular disk with an area equal to the average area of the typical cell. We quantify the gap in the average interference power between these two models and show that the upper bound is tight for realistic deployment parameters. We also compare them with a more practical but intractable MU-MIMO scheduling model to show that our worst-case interference models show the same trends and do not deviate significantly from realistic scheduler models. Under the nominal interference model, we characterize the interference distribution using the dominant interferer approximation by deriving the equi-interference contour expression when the typical receiver uses 3D beamforming. Finally, we use tractable expressions for the interference distribution to characterize radar’s spatial probability of false alarm/detection in a quasi-static target tracking scenario. Our results reveal useful trends in the average interference as a function of the deployment parameters (BS density, exclusion zone radius, antenna height, transmit power of each BS, etc.). We also provide useful system design insights using radar receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves by applying our analytical results to design the minimum exclusion zone radius in current and future radar-cellular spectrum sharing scenarios.}

	abstract = {It is a known issue that low-latency communication is hard to achieve when using multiple network interfaces with asymmetric capacity and delay (e.g., LTE and WLAN) simultaneously. A main underlying cause of this issue is that the packets with lower sequence number are stalled on a high-latency path, thus the early arriving packets with higher sequence number become “out-of-order (OFO)” packets. These OFO packets may excessively consume receiver’s buffer, causing long reordering delay and unnecessary packet retransmission. In this paper, we present a novel design of packet scheduling for Multipath TCP (MPTCP), called OverLapped Scheduler (OLS), able to tackle the OFO-packet problem more effectively. OLS can guarantee sufficient throughput on demand of upper layer applications, and utilizes the remaining bandwidth to reduce OFO-packets. To do so, OLS schedules packets according to their arrival time and sends a controlled number of redundant packets to avoid the impact of inaccurate arrival-time estimations due to network jitter. We implement OLS in a Linux kernel, and the experiments show that in asymmetric networks with or without jitter, OLS can effectively reduce OFO-packets and transmission latency while maintaining a sufficient throughput, which makes it fully capable to meet the requirements of applications such as live video streaming.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a full-stack perspective that involves content coding, caching and recommendation is presented for wireless edge caching networks. Therein, content coding and recommendations are utilized to ensure the reliability of the network and to boost the gain of edge caching, respectively. Specifically, with a well-designed coding pattern, the concurrently occurred data corruptions of multiple access points (APs) can be successfully recovered. Whilst, the successful content retrieval is warranted with highly selective retrieval sets. Further, by offering personalized recommendations, the cache hitting at network edges can be promoted. On these grounds, a cache hit ratio maximization problem for reliability-aware wireless edge caching system is formulated, considering the successful content retrieval and repair, total repair cost requirements, cache capacity budget of each AP, and recommendation quality and quantity per user. To solve this intractable problem, a framework with two steps is developed, which leads to construction of a suitable coding schema with the minimum repair cost per content to satisfy the retrieval and repair criteria, thus achieving a stabilized optimal solution regarding the joint cache placement and recommendation decisions from a game-theoretical viewpoint. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are performed to confirm the superior performance of our devised algorithms compared with benchmark baselines.}

	abstract = {Leveraging recent advances on mobile edge computing (MEC), edge intelligence has emerged as a promising paradigm to support mobile artificial intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the AI service placement problem in a multi-user MEC system, where the access point (AP) places the most up-to-date AI program at user devices to enable local computing/task execution at the user side. To fully utilize the stringent wireless spectrum and edge computing resources, the AP sends the AI service program to a user only when enabling local computing at the user yields a better system performance. We formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem to minimize the total computation time and energy consumption of all users by jointly optimizing the service placement (i.e., which users to receive the program) and resource allocation (on local CPU frequencies, uplink bandwidth, and edge CPU frequency). To tackle the MINLP problem, we derive analytical expressions to calculate the optimal resource allocation decisions with low complexity. This allows us to efficiently obtain the optimal service placement solution by search-based algorithms such as meta-heuristic or greedy search algorithms. To enhance the algorithm scalability in large-sized networks, we further propose an ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) based method to decompose the optimization problem into parallel tractable MINLP subproblems. The ADMM method eliminates the need of searching in a high-dimensional space for service placement decisions and thus has a low computational complexity that grows linearly with the number of users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform extremely close to the optimum and significantly outperform the other representative benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Routing is a fundamental problem and has been extensively studied in various networks. However, in highly dynamic networks (e.g., wireless ad hoc networks), nodes have limited transmission opportunities due to high mobility, noise and interference, where traditional routing is often not the best approach. Opportunistic routing (OR) , on the other hand, can effectively minimize the routing cost (e.g., the number of hops) and improve the success of routing by utilizing link metrics. However, the link metrics are usually unknown in advance and changing. In this paper, we design an adaptive algorithm called Thompson sampling-based opportunistic routing (TSOR) motivated by the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithms. TSOR is able to learn the link metrics and route packets simultaneously to reduce the overall cost. Theoretically, we show a lower bound and an upper bound of the cumulative regret (i.e., performance gap) between TSOR and the optimal routing algorithm that knows all link metrics in advance. The regret increases sublinearly with respect to the number of packets, and has a lower order in terms of the network size than the best-known results. Furthermore, we compare TSOR with the state-of-the-art algorithms, and the evaluation results show that TSOR has a lower regret and a faster convergence rate to the optimal policy than the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as an appealing solution to enhance wireless communication performance by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we propose to apply IRS to the physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI) system, where a single-antenna access point (AP) integrates two sorts of service messages, i.e., multicast message and confidential message, via superposition coding to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our goal is to optimize the power allocation (for transmitting different messages) at the AP and the passive beamforming at the IRS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate region. To this end, we formulate this problem as a bi-objective optimization problem, which is shown equivalent to a secrecy rate maximization problem subject to the constraints on the quality of multicast service. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we propose two customized algorithms to obtain its high-quality suboptimal solutions, thereby approximately characterizing the secrecy rate region. The resulting performance gap with the globally optimal solution is analyzed. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to unveil the impact of IRS beamforming on the performance of PHY-SI. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of leveraging IRS in improving the performance of PHY-SI and also validate our theoretical analysis.}

The Tx, having (imperfect) prior knowledge about the Rx location and the surrounding geometry, transmits reference signals based on a set of fixed beams. We develop strategies for the power allocation among the beams aiming to minimize the expected Cramér-Rao lower bound for Rx positioning. Additional constraints on the design are included to make the optimized power allocation robust to uncertainty on the line-of-sight (LOS) path direction. Furthermore, the effect of clock asynchronism on the proposed allocation strategies is studied. Our evaluation results show that, for non-negligible synchronization error, it is optimal to allocate a large fraction of the available power for the illumination of the non-LOS (NLOS) paths, which help resolve the clock offset. In addition, the complexity reduction achieved by our proposed suboptimal approach incurs only a small performance degradation. We also propose an off-grid compressed sensing-based position estimation algorithm, which exploits the information on the clock offset provided by NLOS paths, and show that it is asymptotically efficient.}

In this CoMP scheme, we identify the cooperating base stations (BSs) by comparing the average received link power (ARLP) of the neighbouring BSs with respect to the BS having the strongest ARLP (i.e., the main link BS) to a user. To analyze the performance of this CoMP scheme in the downlink multi-tier UDN, we first approximate the received signal power distribution, and derive the coverage probability using stochastic geometry. After revisiting the area spectral efficiency (ASE) to make it more suitable for CoMP transmission in UDN, we also analyze the ASE and the network energy efficiency (NEE). Using simulations, we validate the derived coverage probability, and investigate the CoMP performance in multi-tier UDN. Our simulations show that the RRLP-based CoMP scheme can outperform the fixed number of strongest BS-based CoMP scheme in the high BS density regime. Our study of the NEE performance reveals that not only the RRLP-based CoMP scheme is more efficient than conventional non-CoMP transmission scenario, but also its NEE performance improves with the average number of cooperating BSs.}

However, the distortion caused by one-bit ADCs makes the data detection task much more challenging. In this paper, we propose a two-stage detection method for massive MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs. In the first stage, we present several linear receivers based on the Bussgang decomposition that show significant performance gains over conventional linear receivers. Next, we reformulate the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection problem to address its non-robustness. Based on the reformulated ML detection problem, we propose a model-driven deep neural network-based detector, namely OBMNet, whose performance is comparable with an existing support vector machine-based receiver, albeit with a much lower computational complexity. A nearest-neighbor search method is then proposed for the second stage to refine the first stage solution. Unlike existing search methods that typically perform the search over a large candidate set, the proposed search method generates a limited number of most likely candidates and thus limits the search complexity. Numerical results confirm the low complexity, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed two-stage detection method.}

Due to the complexity and unpredictability of the network environment, it is challenging to ensure the continuity and security of computing offloading services in the process of user movement. Most existing works consider the decisions of communication handover and computational offloading simultaneously while ignoring the security on offloading tasks. In light of this, we propose a secure mobility management framework for blockchain-based ultra-dense edge computing, where blockchain reduces duplicate authentication between edge servers. We jointly optimize the wireless handover and service migration decisions between base stations, which is translated into a multi-objective dynamic optimization problem using the Lyapunov optimization. The optimization problem is solved by deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Actor – Critic method. Finally, we use simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that, compared with other existing schemes, the proposed scheme can reduce the average delay of computing tasks, the rate of tasks failure and the rate of handover.}

	abstract = {Cell-Free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is a distributed antenna system, wherein a large number of access points wish to simultaneously communicate with a relatively small number of users. Similar to co-located massive MIMO system, pilot contamination and multi-user interference are two major impediments to CF massive MIMO network performance improvement. One can mitigate the detrimental effect of pilot contamination and multi-user interference through judicious resource allocation. In this work, we formulate and investigate the problem of frequency assignment for a CF massive MIMO. The formulated optimization problem is proven to be generally NP-hard. Local optima can be found by approaches such as the Lagrangian method that however, has considerably slow rates of convergence. To circumvent this issue, we propose an alternative solution being of two-folds. Firstly, we reformulate the problem as a grouping strategy which enables to attenuate the effect of intra-group multi-user interference. In the second fold, frequencies are assigned in a non-overlapping fashion to each scheduled group to palliate the effect of inter-group interference and pilot contamination. To further improve the performance of the proposed approach, power coefficients are allocated to the users via a sequential convex approximation (SCA)-based framework. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is then verified through extensive numerical simulations which demonstrate a non-negligible improvement in the performance of the studied scenario.}

	abstract = {The channel capacity of noncoherent reception of multi-level one-sided amplitude-shift keying (ASK), which is an asymmetric constellation, in Rayleigh fading with receive diversity and energy detection is considered. The asymmetries result in capacity achieving input probability distributions, that is, a priori probability distributions, that deviate from uniformity. An analytical expression for the mutual information in terms of a single integral is derived, and from it the set of equations, which can be solved to obtain the optimum or capacity achieving input probabilities, is obtained. High and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations of the optimum input probabilities and the capacity are derived next. Furthermore, a logarithmic upper bound on the mutual information is obtained. Numerical results confirm that the uniform distribution of input probabilities is not capacity achieving. For example, with average SNR per symbol per branch of 6 dB, the relative deviation of the mutual information (with uniform input distribution) from the capacity is nearly 20% for 4-level ASK with one transmit diversity branch and two receive diversity branches. Furthermore, the derived high and low SNR approximations to the capacity are shown to be reasonably accurate.}

	abstract = {A well-known drawback of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is its signal with high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Among a number of PAPR reduction techniques, clipping and filtering (CAF) is the simplest approach, which effectively reduces the PAPR of band-limited OFDM signals at the cost of increasing in-band distortion. In order to mitigate the performance degradation caused by the in-band distortion, several iterative distortion recovery techniques have been proposed in the literature, and they are largely classified into time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD) compensation approaches: The former and latter are represented by the decision-aided reconstruction (DAR) and clipping noise cancellation (CNC), respectively. To date, however, their theoretical performance limits have not been studied. In this work, we revisit the performance limits of CAF and derive a closed-form signal-to-distortion power ratio (SDR) expression. Furthermore, we introduce a time-domain distortion model for characterizing the OFDM signal with CAF, based on which we make performance comparison between the two compensation approaches. Theoretical analysis and simulations in terms of their achievable symbol error rate (SER) reveal that, unlike the FD counterpart, the TD compensation may suffer from unrecoverable distortion when filtering after clipping is applied at the transmitter.}

	abstract = {The integration of visible light communication (VLC) with existing radio frequency (RF) networks has emerged as a new network architecture to meet the rapidly growing traffic demand. The resulting RF/VLC hybrid network structures offer capacity-per-area improvements due to the use of two technologies operating at different frequency bands and the relatively higher base station (BS) density. However, the reduced BS coverage footprints and the heterogeneous BS types result in challenges for user mobility such as frequent handovers and the need for suitable BS association policies. To help addressing these challenges, in this paper, we conduct a user mobility analysis for RF/VLC hybrid networks by deriving the user-to-BS association probabilities and handover rates. The analysis makes use of stochastic geometry and modeling BSs’ locations via a Poisson point process (PPP). Since PPP modeling has not yet been well established for hybrid RF/VLC networks, we support the applicability of our approach by comparing the user mobility performance to those obtained for an actual deployment, a Matérn hard-core point process (MHCPP) based deployment, and a deterministic square lattice deployment of VLC luminaries. Furthermore, since the handover rates directly depend on the association policies, we consider two popular association policies. Our numerical results show that the PPP, the MHCPP, the square lattice, and the actual deployments have comparable performance in terms of handover rates regardless of the association policy, and they highlight the tradeoff between balancing network load and handover rates achieved by the association policies.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the emerging orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is firstly restructured as a precoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, so that the well-established frequency-domain approach can be applied to perform signal in fast fading channels. Then a frequency-domain minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizer for OTFS is introduced and its performance is analyzed based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the channel matrix. Inspired by the frequency-domain precoding structure, an adaptive transmission scheme with frequency-domain precoding matrix composed of the eigenvectors of the channel matrix is proposed to improve the system performance under MMSE equalization, and its optimized performance is derived with simple expression. Finally, considering two extreme channel conditions, the lower and upper bounds for the diversity performance of the adaptive transmission scheme are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive transmission achieves significantly better performance for short signal frames and can work well with imperfect channel state information (CSI). The derived performance bounds can serve as benchmarks for OTFS and other precoded OFDM systems.}

	abstract = {Improving the uplink quality of service for users located around the boundaries between cells is a key challenge in cellular systems. Existing approaches relying on power control throttle the rates of cell-center users, while multi-user detection requires accurate channel estimates for the cell-edge users, which is another challenge due to their low received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Utilizing the fact that cell-edge user signals are weak but common (received at roughly equal power) at different base stations (BSs), this paper establishes a connection between cell-edge user detection and generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA). It puts forth a GCCA-based method that leverages selective BS cooperation to recover the cell-edge user signal subspace even at low SNR. The cell-edge user signals can then be extracted from the resulting mixture via algebraic signal processing techniques. The paper includes theoretical analysis showing why GCCA recovers the correct subspace containing the cell-edge user signals under mild conditions. The proposed method can also identify the number of cell-edge users in the system, i.e., the common subspace dimension. Simulations reveal significant performance improvement relative to various multiuser detection techniques. Cell-edge detection performance is further studied as a function of how many / which BSs are selected, and it is shown that using the closest three BS is always the best choice.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely utilized to improve the end-to-end performance of wireless communications. However, its line-of-sight makes UAV communication vulnerable to malicious eavesdroppers. In this paper, we propose two cooperative dual-UAV enabled secure data collection schemes to ensure security, with the practical propulsion energy consumption considered. We first maximize the worst-case average secrecy rate with the average propulsion power limitation, where the scheduling, the transmit power, the trajectory and the velocity of the two UAVs are jointly optimized. To solve the non-convex multivariable problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation. To further save the on-board energy and prolong the flight time, we then maximize the secrecy energy efficiency of UAV data collection, which is a fractional and mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Based on the Dinkelbach method, we transform the objective function into an integral expression and propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to secrecy energy efficiency maximization. Numerical results show that the average secrecy rate is maximized in the first scheme with propulsion limitation, while in the second scheme, the secrecy energy efficiency is maximized with the optimal velocity to save propulsion power and improve secrecy rate simultaneously.}

	abstract = {We consider a wireless-powered ad hoc network with clustered Power Beacons (PBs). The wireless-powered transmitters (WP-Txs) only activate stochastically deployed PBs within the circles centered at their locations. The PBs transmit radio frequency (RF) signals, which are harvested by the WP-Txs to transmit information to their target receivers. The nodes are modeled as following\nβ\n-Ginibre Point Processes (\nβ\n-GPP), which incorporate repulsion among PBs or active WP-Txs. Lacking analytical mathematical tools to describe the distribution of clustered PBs, we establish lower and upper bounds on the energy outage probability, as well as an approximated expression of it. We then derive the information outage probability, an approximate expression of it by approximating the reduced Palm distribution of\nβ\n-GPP as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPPP), and an analytical approximate expression of it by further ignoring the small-scale fading of interfering WP-Tx links. Finally, the transmission capacity is obtained based on the overall outage probability. The simulation results show that the derived theoretical expressions accurately reflect the performance of the wireless-powered ad hoc networks and the performance gap introduced by approximations is negligible. Transmission capacity optimization based on the derived expressions is also possible and demonstrated.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been used in wireless communications to increase data rates via multiplexing or improve performance via diversity. Additionally, in radar systems, MIMO promises improved parameter identifiability and target resolution. Frequency diverse (FD)-MIMO radar can effectively distinguish targets that are closely spaced in the same angle cell by exploiting its range-angle-dependent transmit beamform. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose an integrated waveform design by embedding weighted, phase-modulated communication signals in the FD-MIMO radar waveform. Then, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the location estimation and analyze the communication performance achieved when the communication receiver extracts information from the integrated signals. Next, transmit beamforming is optimized to achieve the best tradeoff between the radar and communication performances of the system. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, we apply sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods to solve the problem. The simulation results reveal the effects of some parameters, such as the frequency interval, symbol period, and communication symbol sequence, on radar and communication performance and demonstrate the tradeoff between radar and communication obtained by optimizing the transmit beamforming vector.}

	abstract = {Random access (RA) or preamble collision is one of the crucial problems in massive internet-of-things (IoT) at the network entry stage. Since a massive number of IoT nodes simultaneously attempt RAs on the same physical random access channel (PRACH), preambles may be selected by multiple nodes, incurring preamble collisions at the first step of the RA procedure. However, conventional RA models are limited to binary preamble detections which poses severe RA performance loss in the massive IoT environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based end-to-end RA framework which has detection and resolution abilities for the collided preambles. In particular, advanced preamble classification and timing advance (TA) classifications are performed using deep neural networks (DNNs) for improving the probability of RA success while reducing the delay of the entire RA procedure. The effectiveness of the proposed DNN-based preamble and TA classifiers are demonstrated through extensive simulations. We further evaluate the system-level performance of the proposed DL-based RA model. It shows a significantly higher probability of instant RA success, which makes every node succeed in RA with very limited reattempts, and also maintains a significantly lower RA delay in massive IoT environment.}

	abstract = {Opportunistic computation offloading is an effective method to improve the computation performance of mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks under dynamic edge environment. In this paper, we consider a multi-user MEC network with time-varying wireless channels and stochastic user task data arrivals in sequential time frames. In particular, we aim to design an online computation offloading algorithm to maximize the network data processing capability subject to the long-term data queue stability and average power constraints. The online algorithm is practical in the sense that the decisions for each time frame are made without the assumption of knowing the future realizations of random channel conditions and data arrivals. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem that jointly determines the binary offloading (each user computes the task either locally or at the edge server) and system resource allocation decisions in sequential time frames. To address the coupling in the decisions of different time frames, we propose a novel framework, named LyDROO, that combines the advantages of Lyapunov optimization and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, LyDROO first applies Lyapunov optimization to decouple the multi-stage stochastic MINLP into deterministic per-frame MINLP subproblems. By doing so, it guarantees to satisfy all the long-term constraints by solving the per-frame subproblems that are much smaller in size. Then, LyDROO integrates model-based optimization and model-free DRL to solve the per-frame MINLP problems with very low computational complexity. Simulation results show that under various network setups, the proposed LyDROO achieves optimal computation performance while stabilizing all queues in the system. Besides, it induces very low computation time that is particularly suitable for real-time implementation in fast fading environments.}

However, directional communications in the presence of uncertainty in user equipment (UE) locations and channel conditions make maintaining coverage and connectivity challenging. In this context, we propose a joint optimization framework to determine the minimum number of required access points (APs), their optimal locations, their optimal beam directions, and their optimal assignments to individual UEs in order to maintain a network-wide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coverage and stable connections. The network deployment decisions (i.e., the required number of APs, their placements, and their beam directions) are static and are taken before UE locations and channel conditions are revealed. The UE assignment decisions are taken under each realization of UE locations and channel conditions considering the availability and stability of the mmW beams. We develop our joint optimization framework following a two-stage chance-constrained stochastic optimization model. Our numerical results demonstrate the gains brought by our proposed framework in terms of reducing cost of network deployment while ensuring a network-wide SNR coverage and stable connections under various UE distributions and system parameters.}

	abstract = {Multipath TCP (MPTCP) utilizes multiple paths for simultaneous data transmission to enhance performance. However, existing MPTCP protocols are still far from satisfactory in wireless networks because of their loss-based congestion control and the difficulty of managing multiple subflows. To overcome these problems, we redesign the coupled congestion control algorithm and scheduler to boost MPTCP in wireless heterogeneous networks. The main purpose is to promote transmission rate under lossy networks, while also provide stability when networks suffer physical link changes and asymmetric links. In this paper, inspired by Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR), we first propose Coupled BBR that utilizes detected bandwidth to adjust the sending rate within an MPTCP connection. Coupled BBR provides high loss tolerance as well as balanced congestion among MPTCP subflows. Then, to further improve the performance, we propose an Adaptively Redundant and Predictive packet (AR&P) scheduler to improve adaptability and keep in-order packet delivery in highly dynamic network scenarios. Based on Linux kernel implementation and experiments in both testbed and real network scenarios, we show that the proposed scheme not only provides high throughput in wireless networks, but also improves robustness and reduces out-of-order packets in some harsh circumstances.}

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of simultaneously tracking the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of far-field multiple moving sources/users in wireless communications using the vector-signal received by an antenna array of N\nelements. The antenna array can be rigid (fixed array locations) or flexible (time-varying array locations), and it is used in conjunction with a “manifold extender”, a spatiotemporal state-space model and a Kalman-type tracking approach for non-stationary wireless channels. In particular, two tracking approaches are proposed. The first is based on an arrayed Extended Kalman Filter (arrayed-EKF) algorithm and the second on an arrayed Unscented Kalman Filter (arrayed-UKF) algorithm. Furthermore, if the array is rigid the spatiotemporal state-space model incorporates the DOAs and the angular velocities of the sources, while if it is flexible it also includes the array locations in the set of state-variables. The performance of the two approaches using both rigid and flexible arrays is evaluated using computer simulation studies and compared with a subspace tracking algorithm and a particle filter method under the same conditions. The results show that the arrayed-UKF and the arrayed-EKF show superior tracking performance, especially for low SNRs.}

	abstract = {Robust channel estimation in time-varying channels is used to guarantee the quality of communication services, especially for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) scenarios. To improve the channel estimation accuracy and reduce the pilot overhead, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar is deployed to assist millimeter wave (mmWave) channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a MIMO radar aided channel estimation scheme using deep learning (DL) for the uplink mmWave multiuser (MU)-MIMO communications. To allocate pilot resources reasonably, we design a transmission frame structure of joint radar module and communication module, which divides the estimation scheme into two stages, i.e., the arrival/departure (AoA/AoDs) estimation stage and the gain estimation stage. In view of the imperfections of array elements in practice, we propose an AoA/AoDs estimation algorithm based on subspace reconstruction in the AoA/AoDs estimation stage named two-step angle estimation (TSAE) algorithm. In the gain estimation stage, a DL based channel gain estimator is designed. An autoencoder combined with residual structure named residual denoising autoencoder (RDAE) is proposed to eliminate the noise on wireless signals, which is passed into the least square (LS) estimation module to obtain gains. Simulation results demonstrate that the MIMO radar aided and DL-based channel estimator provides the efficient estimation performance of the high-mobility mmWave channel with fewer training resources.}

	abstract = {To exploit massive amounts of data generated at mobile edge networks, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as an attractive substitute for centralized machine learning (ML). By collaboratively training a shared learning model at edge devices, FL avoids direct data transmission and thus overcomes high communication latency and privacy issues as compared to centralized ML. To improve the communication efficiency in FL model aggregation, over-the-air computation has been introduced to support a large number of simultaneous local model uploading by exploiting the inherent superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the heterogeneity of communication capacities among edge devices, over-the-air FL suffers from the straggler issue in which the device with the weakest channel acts as a bottleneck of the model aggregation performance. This issue can be alleviated by device selection to some extent, but the latter still suffers from a tradeoff between data exploitation and model communication. In this paper, we leverage the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to relieve the straggler issue in over-the-air FL. Specifically, we develop a learning analysis framework to quantitatively characterize the impact of device selection and model aggregation error on the convergence of over-the-air FL. Then, we formulate a unified communication-learning optimization problem to jointly optimize device selection, over-the-air transceiver design, and RIS configuration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed design achieves substantial learning accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, especially when channel conditions vary dramatically across edge devices.}

	abstract = {We consider the downlink of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular network consisting of multiple cooperative UAVs, whose operations are coordinated by a central ground controller using wireless fronthaul links, to serve multiple ground user equipments (UEs). A problem of jointly designing UAVs’ positions, transmit beamforming, as well as UAV-UE association is formulated in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to maximize the sum UEs’ achievable rate subject to limited fronthaul capacity constraints. Solving the considered problem is hard owing to its non-convexity and the unavailability of channel state information (CSI) due to the movement of UAVs. To tackle these effects, we propose a novel algorithm comprising of two distinguishing features: (i) exploiting a deep Q-learning approach to tackle the issue of CSI unavailability for determining UAVs’ positions, (ii) developing a difference of convex algorithm (DCA) to efficiently solve for the UAV’s transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. The proposed algorithm recursively solves the problem of interest until convergence, where each recursion executes two steps. In the first step, the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm allows UAVs to learn the overall network state and account for the joint movement of all UAVs to adapt their locations. In the second step, given the determined UAVs’ positions from the DQL algorithm, the DCA iteratively solves a convex approximate subproblem of the original non-convex MINLP problem with the updated parameters, where the problem’s variables are transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. Numerical results show that our design outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of algorithmic convergence and network performance with a gain of up to 70%.}

However, the resource allocation problem in GF-NOMA is challenging due to the absence of closed-loop power control. We design a prototype of transmit power pool (PP) to provide open-loop power control. IoT users acquire their transmit power in advance from this prototype PP solely according to their communication distances. Firstly, a multi-agent deep Q-network (DQN) aided GF-NOMA algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal transmit power levels for the prototype PP. More specifically, each IoT user acts as an agent and learns a policy by interacting with the wireless environment that guides them to select optimal actions. Secondly, to prevent the Q-learning model overestimation problem, double DQN (DDQN) based GF-NOMA algorithm is proposed. Numerical results confirm that the DDQN based algorithm finds out the optimal transmit power levels that form the PP. Comparing with the conventional online learning approach, the proposed algorithm with the prototype PP converges faster under changing environments due to limiting the action space based on previous learning. The considered GF-NOMA system outperforms the networks with fixed transmission power, namely all the users have the same transmit power and the traditional GF with orthogonal multiple access techniques, in terms of throughput.}

	abstract = {Adaptive compressed spectrum sensing (ACSS) can effectively save sampling resources in wideband spectrum sensing. Almost all of the existing ACSS algorithms are based on the discrete multitone signal model. However, real-world spectra are always multiband signals. In this paper, we derive mathematical models and algorithms enabling the ACSS suitable for multiband signals, which can save sampling resources and has lower computational complexity. Firstly, we introduce the multicoset sampling system into ACSS to sample multiband signals. Besides, we propose a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) based ACSS scheme with low sampling costs. To save sampling resources, we choose only one sampling channel as a testing subset to validate reconstructed signal and repeat this several times with different sampling channels. Then, we use the mean of the multiple validation results to determine the accuracy of the reconstructed signal. To reduce computational complexity, we propose a LOOCV-ACSS algorithm, in which we only perform the least square method several times in the LOOCV procedure, rather than the complicated compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations and real-world signal test results demonstrate that our derivation and algorithms are effective to reduce the sampling cost while keeping the same performance as conventional algorithms.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely applied in many wireless communi- cation systems. The artificial intelligence (AI)-aided OFDM receivers are currently brought to the forefront to replace and improve the traditional OFDM receivers. In this paper, we first compare two AI-aided OFDM receivers, namely, data-driven fully connected deep neural network and model-driven ComNet, through extensive simulation and real-time video transmission using a 5G rapid prototyping system for an over-the-air (OTA) test. We find a performance gap between the simulation and the OTA test caused by the discrepancy between the channel model for offline training and the real environment. We develop a novel online training system, which is called SwitchNet receiver, to address this issue. This receiver has a flexible and extendable architecture and can adapt to real channels by training only several parameters online. From the OTA test, the AI-aided OFDM receivers, especially the SwitchNet receiver, are robust to OTA environments and promising for future communication systems. At the end of this paper, we discuss potential challenges and future research inspired by our initial study in this paper.}

In this paper, we propose to use the channel state information (CSI) of a small number of antennas to extrapolate the CSI of the other antennas and reduce the training overhead. Specifically, we design a deep neural network that we call an antenna domain extrapolation network (ADEN) that can exploit the correlation function among antennas. We then propose a deep learning (DL) based antenna selection network (ASN) that can select a limited antennas for optimizing the extrapolation, which is conventionally a type of combinatorial optimization and is difficult to solve. We trickly designed a constrained degradation algorithm to generate a differentiable approximation of the discrete antenna selection vector such that the back-propagation of the neural network can be guaranteed. Numerical results show that the proposed ADEN outperforms the traditional fully connected one, and the antenna selection scheme learned by ASN is much better than the trivially used uniform selection.}

The contribution aims to allow significant overhead reduction of MIMO systems by enabling grant-free access, while maintaining moderate throughput per user. To that end, we extend the conventional MIMO transmission framework so as to incorporate activity detection capability without resorting to spreading informative data symbols, in contrast with related work which typically relies on signal spreading. Our method leverages a Bayesian message passing scheme based on Gaussian approximation, which jointly performs active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and multi-user detection (MUD), incorporating also a well-structured low-coherence pilot design based on frame theory, which mitigates pilot contamination, and finally complemented with a detector empowered by bilinear message passing. The efficacy of the resulting JACDE-based grant-free access scheme in the cell-free MIMO system setup compliant with fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is demonstrated by simulation results. The results are shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art and approach the performance of an idealized (genie-aided) scheme in which user activity and channel coefficients are perfectly known.}

In this paper, we propose a novel MEC system with several ground servers at access points and one aerial server carried by UAV. To balance the vital metrics of the MEC system, computation bits and energy consumption, we aim to maximize the weighted computation efficiency of the system, subject to the constraints on communication and computation resources, minimum computation requirement and UAV’s mobility. To this end, a joint optimization problem with the goal of weighted computation efficiency maximization is formulated. First, we analyze the problem and transform it into an equivalent tractable form. Then, we solve the challenging non-convex problem by jointly optimizing the computation task assignment, time slot partition, transmission bandwidth and CPU frequency allocation, transmit power allocation, and UAV’s trajectory, based on the Dinkelbach’s method, Lagrange duality and successive convex approximation technique. Furthermore, we propose an alternative computation efficiency maximization algorithm, followed by the convergence and complexity analysis. Finally, numerical simulations show that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the computation efficiency compared to benchmark schemes. It is also validated that the proposed algorithm effectively obtains a good tradeoff between the computation task bits and energy consumption of the system.}

However, designing an efficient 3D deployment of ABSs is a considerably complicated problem due to its high degree of freedom and inter-cell interference among ABSs. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed 3D ABS deployment method for providing on-demand downlink communications. To consider the spatial and temporal variations of user locations due to user activities, we model them by an inhomogeneous point process. By analyzing the performance metrics under this model and applying a distributed push-sum, we develop an ABS deployment algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee that solves the maximization problems of the overall communication quality in a distributed and iterative manner. In our method, each ABS updates its position based on its local information by communicating with its neighboring ABSs. Furthermore, we propose an estimation method of the overall user density from partial observation of ground sensors. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can efficiently improve the overall communication quality and can be applied to a dynamic network.}

	abstract = {The received signal strength (RSS) based technique is extensively utilized for localization in the indoor environments. Since the RSS values of neighboring locations may be similar, the localization accuracy of the RSS based technique is limited. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose to utilize reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for the RSS based multi-user localization. As the RIS is able to customize the radio channels by adjusting the phase shifts of the signals reflected at the surface, the localization accuracy in the RIS aided scheme can be improved by choosing the proper phase shifts with significant differences of RSS values among adjacent locations. However, it is challenging to select the optimal phase shifts because the decision function for location estimation and the phase shifts are coupled. To tackle this challenge, we formulate the optimization problem for the RIS-aided localization, derive the optimal decision function, and design the phase shift optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the formulated problem efficiently. Analysis of the proposed RIS aided technique is provided, and the effectiveness is validated through simulation.}

	abstract = {Full-duplex millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has shown increasing promise for self-interference cancellation via hybrid precoding and combining. This paper proposes a novel mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) design for configuring the analog and digital beamformers of a full-duplex transceiver. This work is the first to holistically consider the key practical constraints of analog beamforming codebooks, a minimal number of radio frequency (RF) chains, limited channel knowledge, beam alignment, and a limited receive dynamic range. To prevent self-interference from saturating receive components, such as LNAs and ADCs, a design framework is developed that limits the degree of self-interference on a per-antenna and per-RF chain basis. We present a means for constructing analog beamforming candidates from beam alignment measurements to afford our design greater flexibility in its aim to reduce self-interference. Numerical results evaluate the design in a variety of settings and validate the need to prevent receiver-side saturation. These results and corresponding insights serve as useful design references and benchmarks for practical full-duplex mmWave transceivers.}

	abstract = {The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising modulation scheme for high mobility wireless communications. To enable efficient OTFS detection in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the DD domain channels need to be acquired accurately. To achieve the low latency requirement in future wireless communications, the time duration of the OTFS block should be small, therefore fractional Doppler shifts have to be considered to avoid significant modelling errors due to the assumption of integer Doppler shifts. However there lack investigations on the estimation of OTFS channels with fractional Doppler shifts in the literature. In this work, we develop a channel estimator for OTFS with particular attention to fractional Doppler shifts, and both bi-orthogonal waveform and rectangular waveform are considered. Instead of estimating the DD domain channel directly, we estimate the channel gains and (fractional) Doppler shifts that parameterize the DD domain channel. The estimation is formulated as a structured sparse signal recovery problem with a Bayesian treatment. Based on a factor graph representation of the problem, an efficient message passing algorithm is developed to recover the structured sparse signal (thereby the OTFS channel). The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation is developed and the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulations.}

Workers send their estimates through a multipath fading multiple access channel with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to mitigate the frequency selectivity of the channel. We assume that there is no channel state information (CSI) at the workers, and the parameter server (PS) employs multiple antennas to align the received signals. To reduce the power consumption and the hardware costs, we employ complex-valued low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), at the transmitter and the receiver sides, respectively, and study the effects of practical low-cost DACs and ADCs on the learning performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that the impairments caused by low-resolution DACs and ADCs, including those of one-bit DACs and ADCs, do not prevent the convergence of the federated learning algorithms, and the multipath channel effects vanish when a sufficient number of antennas are used at the PS. We also validate our theoretical results via simulations, and demonstrate that using low-resolution, even one-bit, DACs and ADCs causes only a slight decrease in the learning accuracy.}

	abstract = {Edge caching can effectively reduce backhaul burden at core network and increase quality-of-service at wireless edge nodes. However, the beneficial role of edge caching cannot be fully realized when the offloading link is in deep fade. Fortunately, the impairments induced by wireless propagation environments could be renovated by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In this paper, a new RIS-aided edge caching system is proposed, where a network cost minimization problem is formulated to optimize content placement at cache units, active beamforming at base station and passive phase shifting at RIS. After decoupling the content placement subproblem with the hybrid beamforming design, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle the active beamforming and passive phase shifting. For active beamforming, we transfer the problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) and prove that the optimal solution of SDP is always rank-one. For passive phase shifting, we introduce the block coordinate descent method to alternately optimize the auxiliary variables and the RIS phase shifts. Further, a conjugate gradient algorithm based on manifold optimization is proposed to deal with the non-convex unit-modulus constraints. Numerical results show that our RIS-aided edge caching design can effectively decrease the network cost by improving the quality of offloading links.}

The core difficulty of this problem is how to ensure that the learned power control results by the deep neural network (DNN) satisfy the per-user rate constraints. To tackle the difficulty, we propose to cascade a projection block after a traditional DNN, which projects the infeasible power control results onto the constraint set. The projection block is designed based on a geometrical interpretation of the constraints, which is of low complexity, meeting the real-time requirement of online applications. Explicit-form expression of the backpropagated gradient is derived for the proposed projection block, with which the DNN can be trained to directly maximize the sum rate via unsupervised learning. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing deep learning and numerical optimization methods, and show the robustness of the proposed method to the model mismatch between training and testing datasets.}

	abstract = {The millimeter wave (mmWave) band will provide multi-gigabits-per-second connectivity in the radio access of future wireless systems. The high propagation loss in this portion of the spectrum calls for the deployment of large antenna arrays to compensate for the loss through high directional gain, thus introducing the need for a spatial dimension in the channel model to accurately represent the performance of a mmWave network. In this perspective, ray tracing can characterize the channel in terms of Multi Path Components (MPCs) to provide a highly accurate model, at the price of extreme computational complexity (e.g., for processing detailed environment information about the propagation), which may limit the scalability of the simulations. In this paper, we present possible simplifications to improve the trade-off between accuracy and complexity in ray-tracing simulations at mmWaves by reducing the total number of MPCs. The effect of such simplifications is evaluated from a full-stack perspective through end-to-end simulations, testing different configuration parameters, propagation scenarios, and higher-layer protocol implementations. We then provide guidelines on the optimal degree of simplification, for which it is possible to reduce the complexity of simulations with a minimal reduction in accuracy for different deployment scenarios.}

Thanks to the Walsh Hadamard transform (WHT), the modulation and demodulation do not require complex domain multiplications. For the proposed OTSM, we first derive the input-output relation in the delay-sequency domain and present a low complexity detection method taking advantage of zero-padding. We demonstrate via simulations that OTSM offers high performance gains over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and similar performance to orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), but at lower complexity owing to WHT. Then we propose a low complexity time domain channel estimation method. Finally, we show how to include an outer error control code and a turbo decoder to improve error performance of the coded system.}

In the considered network, the central processor unit (CPU) sends the compressed beamformed signals to the transmit-APs (T-APs) over the downlink fronthaul, and the T-APs forward the signals to downlink users. At the same time, the receive-APs (R-APs) compress the signals transmitted by uplink users and forward them to the CPU via uplink fronthaul. We aim to maximize the spectral efficiency and the number of users that should be admitted by the network, where users’ requirements of both downlink and uplink signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) constraints, fronthaul capacity constraints, energy harvesting constraints and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) ratio design are considered. A successive convex approximation-based algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled problem, which is guaranteed to converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between the NAFD scheme and the traditional co-frequency co-time full duplex (CCFD) scheme and time division duplex (TDD) scheme and offer some valuable opinions about the system design.}

	abstract = {In multi-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, designing an appropriate user grouping strategy is an open problem due to diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements and inter-cell interference. In this paper, we exploit both game theory and graph theory to study QoS-aware user grouping strategies, aiming at minimizing power consumption in downlink multi-cell NOMA systems. Under different QoS requirements, we derive the optimal successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order with inter-cell interference, which is different from existing SIC decoding order of increasing channel gains, and obtain the corresponding power allocation strategy. Based on this, the exact potential game model of the user grouping strategies adopted by multiple cells is formulated. We prove that, in this game, the problem for each player to find a grouping strategy can be converted into the problem of searching for specific negative loops in the graph composed of users. Bellman-Ford algorithm is expanded to find these negative loops. Furthermore, we design a greedy based suboptimal strategy to approach the optimal solution with polynomial time. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of grouping users with consideration of QoS and inter-cell interference, and show that the proposed strategies can considerably reduce total power consumption comparing with reference strategies.}

However, applying uniform resource allocation is inefficient in presence of non-uniform demand distribution. To overcome this limitation, the next generation of broadband GEO satellite systems will enable flexibility in terms of power and bandwidth assignment, enabling on-demand resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite resource assignment design whose goal is to satisfy the beam traffic demand by making use of the minimum transmit power and utilized bandwidth. The motivation behind the proposed design is to maximize the satellite spectrum utilization by pushing the spectrum reuse to affordable limits in terms of tolerable interference. The proposed problem formulation results in a non-convex optimization structure, for which we propose an efficient tractable solution. We validate the proposed method with extensive numerical results, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to benchmark schemes.}

The data is encoded into independent streams, all using the same linear code, after which linear precoding is applied, while integer-forcing equalization is applied at the receiver side. Previous works have established that this architecture achieves channel capacity up to a finite gap for general multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian channels, as well as obtained tighter bounds for the special case of diagonal (parallel) channels. The present work provides a precise performance characterization when integer-forcing equalization is applied to two parallel channels and where precoding is done using the full-diversity rotation matrix cyclo 2 . It is shown that this scheme achieves capacity up to a gap bounded by\nlog\n2\n(\n9\n/5)\nbits per complex channel use when the standard integer-forcing receiver is used, and the gap is reduced to\nlog\n2\n(\n5\n/4)\nbits per complex channel use when its successive decoding variant is applied. In addition, a full characterization of the basis transformation matrices used by the integer-forcing receiver is derived. These turn out to consist only of Fibonacci numbers and are explicitly determined as a function of the condition number. The results obtained are also highly relevant to lattice-reduction detection schemes.}

We thus formulate a joint coded caching and computing optimization problem to decide whether a mobile device stores the data before computing or the data after computing, which tasks to be coded cached and which tasks to be computed locally. The optimization problem is shown to be 0–1 non-convex non-smooth programming, and can be decomposed into a computation offloading programming and a coded caching programming. For a computation offloading subproblem, we proposed an algorithm which applies the convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) under a non-convex programming and the wide application of the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) for difference of convex (DC) programming to obtain a stationary point, and numerical results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm and its suboptimality. For the coded cache programming, we design a low complexity algorithm to obtain an acceptable solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a significant bandwidth saving by taking full advantage of the caching and computing capability of mobile devices.}

	abstract = {Edge machine learning involves the deployment of learning algorithms at the network edge to leverage massive distributed data and computation resources to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. Among others, the framework of federated edge learning (FEEL) is popular for its data-privacy preservation. FEEL coordinates global model training at an edge server and local model training at devices that are connected by wireless links. This work contributes to the energy-efficient implementation of FEEL in wireless networks by designing joint computation-and-communication resource management ( \\mathrm {C}^{2}\nRM). The design targets the state-of-the-art heterogeneous mobile architecture where parallel computing using both CPU and GPU, called heterogeneous computing , can significantly improve both the performance and energy efficiency. To minimize the sum energy consumption of devices, we propose a novel \\mathrm {C}^{2}\nRM framework featuring multi-dimensional control including bandwidth allocation, CPU-GPU workload partitioning and speed scaling at each device, and \\mathrm {C}^{2}\ntime division for each link. The key component of the framework is a set of equilibriums in energy rates with respect to different control variables that are proved to exist among devices or between processing units at each device. The results are applied to designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal \\mathrm {C}^{2}\nRM policies faster than the standard optimization tools. Based on the equilibriums, we further design energy-efficient schemes for device scheduling and greedy spectrum sharing that scavenges “spectrum holes” resulting from heterogeneous \\mathrm {C}^{2}\ntime divisions among devices. Using a real dataset, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of \\mathrm {C}^{2}\nRM on improving the energy efficiency of a FEEL system.}

	abstract = {Information barrier coverage has been widely adopted to prevent unauthorized invasion of important areas in Internet of Things. As sensors are typically placed outdoors, they are susceptible to getting faulty. Previous works assumed that faulty sensors are easy to recognize, e.g., they may stop functioning or output apparently deviant sensory data. In practice, there exist multiple types of fault that sensors may have during operation. It is, thereby, difficult to recognize faulty sensors as well as their invalid output and attain accurate intrusion detection. We, in this paper, propose a novel fault-tolerant intrusion detection algorithm (TrusDet) based on trust management to address this challenging issue. TrusDet comprises of three steps: i) sensor-level detection, ii) sink-level decision by collective voting, and iii) trust management and fault determination. In the Step i) and ii), TrusDet divides the surveillance area into a set of fine-grained subareas and exploits temporal and spatial correlation of sensory output among sensors in different subareas to yield a more accurate and robust performance of information barrier coverage. In the Step iii), TrusDet builds a trust management based framework to determine the confidence level of sensors being faulty. We implement TrusDet on HC-SR501 infrared sensors, and design hardware and software to build a practical detection system. Extensive experimental results and simulation results validate the information coverage model and demonstrate that TrusDet has a very low false alarm rate.}

	abstract = {Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting is known as the most concerned method for indoor localization as its high accuracy and low cost. Numerous RSSI based methods have shown their attractive performances, but the major drawback is the high dependency on the database. In this paper, we propose a multi-floor indoor localization method which includes floor detection and location estimation based on the radial basis function (RBF) network. To ensure the localization accuracy and stability, the network is constructed according to the probabilistic algorithm. Choosing Gaussian radial basis functions with appropriate widths, the network parameters can be initialized appropriately regardless of deficiency of RSSI data. By further conducting the supervised learning of RBF network, the network parameters will be effectively calibrated and updated, so as to achieve a better localization performance. In addition, a radio map quality evaluation criterion is proposed to conduct a comprehensive analysis and interpretation for the localization approach. Finally, experimental results of a publicly accessible dataset which includes multi-floors buildings verify that the performance of the proposed RBF network is superior to other commonly used methods.}

	abstract = {In this work, we derive a novel multicarrier modulation based on the Type-I even discrete cosine transform (DCT1e), which includes new procedures to carry out both the channel estimation and the signal reconstruction. By using a small number of training symbols, we achieve an accurate estimation of the channel’s impulse response (CIR) using a novel mirror, replicate and add (MIRA) procedure. The proposed scheme does not require knowing the length of the CIR and is valid even in the presence of spectral nulls. We provide the theoretical results that guarantee the validity of the developed technique. After the estimation process, the transmitted symbols are also reconstructed by means of the DCT1e using the same novel MIRA scheme. The conditions that ensure a perfect reconstruction in the absence of noise are also provided in this case. Numerical simulations illustrate the excellent behaviour of the proposed approach, both in terms of channel estimation and recovery of the transmitted information.}

Thus, it is a significant issue to design low-complexity hybrid precoders. In this paper, a simplified sum-mean-square-error (SMSE) is used to design hybrid precoders, based on the array gain and spatial macro-diversity. Then, a heuristic hybrid pre-coding scheme is proposed, with two analog design algorithms that are with or without the knowledge of statistical information. The influence of the imperfect state information of beams is theoretically analyzed, from the instantaneous and ergodic aspects, verifying the robustness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that our proposed low-complexity hybrid precoder can be easily realized with acceptable bit error rate (BER) and sum-rate performances, especially when the total transmit power is small.}

	abstract = {A comprehensive vehicular network analysis requires modeling the street system and vehicle locations. Even when Poisson point processes (PPPs) are used to model the vehicle locations on each street, the analysis is barely tractable. That holds for even a simple average-based performance metric—the success probability, which is a special case of the fine-grained metric, the meta distribution (MD) of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). To address this issue, we propose the transdimensional approach as an alternative. Here, the union of 1D PPPs on the streets is simplified to the transdimensional PPP (TPPP), a superposition of 1D and 2D PPPs. The TPPP includes the 1D PPPs on the streets passing through the receiving vehicle and models the remaining vehicles as a 2D PPP ignoring their street geometry. Through the SIR MD analysis, we show that the TPPP provides good approximations to the more cumbrous models with streets characterized by Poisson line/stick processes; and we prove that the accuracy of the TPPP further improves under shadowing. Lastly, we use the MD results to control network congestion by adjusting the transmit rate while maintaining a target fraction of reliable links. A key insight is that the success probability is an inadequate measure of congestion as it does not capture the reliabilities of the individual links.}

Individual nodes decide their optimal states with distributed coordination among other nodes through randomly varying backhaul links. This poses a technical challenge in distributed universal optimization policy robust to a random topology of the wireless network, which has not been properly addressed by conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) with rigid structural configurations. We develop a flexible DNN formalism termed distributed message-passing neural network (DMPNN) with forward and backward computations independent of the network topology. A key enabler of this approach is an iterative message-sharing strategy through arbitrarily connected backhaul links. The DMPNN provides a convergent solution for iterative coordination by learning numerous random backhaul interactions. The DMPNN is investigated for various configurations of the power control in wireless networks, and intensive numerical results prove its universality and viability over conventional optimization and DNN approaches.}

	abstract = {Deep learning can be used to classify waveform characteristics ( e.g. , modulation) with accuracy levels that are hardly attainable with traditional techniques. Recent research has demonstrated that one of the most crucial challenges in wireless deep learning is to counteract the channel action, which may significantly alter the waveform features. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that deep learning algorithms are hardly re-trainable in real time due to their sheer size. This paper proposes DeepFIR , a framework to counteract the channel action in wireless deep learning algorithms without retraining the underlying deep learning model . The key intuition is that through the application of a carefully-optimized digital finite input response filter (FIR) at the transmitter’s side, we can apply tiny modifications to the waveform to strengthen its features according to the current channel conditions. We mathematically formulate the Waveform Optimization Problem (WOP) as the problem of finding the optimum FIR to be used on a waveform to improve the classifier’s accuracy. We also propose a data-driven methodology to train the FIRs directly with dataset inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepFIR on an experimental testbed of 20 software-defined radios, as well as on two datasets made up by 500 ADS-B devices and by 500 WiFi devices and a 24-class modulation dataset. Experimental results show that our approach (i) increases the accuracy of the radio fingerprinting models by about 35%, 50% and 58%; (ii) decreases an adversary’s accuracy by about 54% when trying to imitate other device’s fingerprints by using their filters; (iii) achieves 27% improvement over the state of the art on a 100-device dataset; (iv) increases by\n2×\nthe accuracy of the modulation dataset.}

	abstract = {Passive Gen2 radio frequency identification (RFID) tags work thanks to the utilization of line codes that balance their operation between two opposite states: absorbing RF (for energy harvesting) and reflecting RF (for backscattering/communications). Given the current RF harvesting technology, batteryless tags need to be located very close to an active illuminator in order to harvest sufficient energy and operate. To tackle this limitation, prior art has tried to bring the illuminator closer to the tags by designing proprietary illuminating architectures. Our solution comes in two parts. First, we offer a novel, Gen2-compliant, near-optimal, noncoherent sequence detection algorithm with linear complexity (in the sequence length) for Miller line codes. We leverage the robustness of this algorithm to overcome issues inherent in multistatic setups, such as carrier frequency offset. Second, we propose a modular multistatic architecture that makes use of low-cost commodity software defined radios (SDR) and omnipresent Ethernet infrastructure. Simulations and experimental results in a monostatic, bistatic, or multistatic SDR testbed with commercial RFIDs, corroborate the low-cost, real-time and near-optimal flavor of our solution.}

We consider the scenario in which images are transmitted progressively in layers over time or frequency, and such layers can be aggregated by receivers in order to increase the quality of their reconstructions. We investigate two scenarios, one in which the layers are sent sequentially, and incrementally contribute to the refinement of a reconstruction, and another in which the layers are independent and can be retrieved in any order. Those scenarios correspond to the well known problems of successive refinement and multiple descriptions , respectively, in the context of joint source-channel coding (JSCC). We propose DeepJSCC- l\n, an innovative solution that uses convolutional autoencoders, and present three architectures with different complexity trade-offs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical multiple-description JSCC scheme developed and tested for practical information sources and channels. Numerical results show that DeepJSCC- l\ncan learn to transmit the source progressively with negligible losses in the end-to-end performance compared with a single transmission. Moreover, DeepJSCC- l\nhas comparable performance with state of the art digital progressive transmission schemes in the challenging low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and small bandwidth regimes, with the additional advantage of graceful degradation with channel SNR.}

	abstract = {Driven by the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with stringent requirements on latency and reliability, ultra-reliability and low latency communication (uRLLC) has become one of the three key communication scenarios for the 5th generation (5G) and 6G communication systems. In this paper, we focus on the beamforming design problem for the downlink multiuser uRLLC system. Since the strict demand on the reliability and latency, in general, short packet transmission is a favorable way for uRLLC systems, which indicates the classical Shannon’s capacity formula is no longer applicable. With the finite blocklength transmission, the achievable rate is greatly influenced by the reliability and finite blocklength. Using the developed achievable rate formula for finite blocklength transmission, we respectively formulate the problems of interest as the weighted sum rate maximization, energy efficiency maximization, and user fairness optimization by considering the maximum allowable transmission power and minimum rate requirement. These problems considered are non-convex and are hard to obtain the global optimal solution, even for the local optimal solution. To overcome these difficulties, some important insights have been discovered by analyzing the function of achievable rate. For example, an analytical solution of the minimum rate requirement is provided with respective to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Based on the discovered results, we provide algorithms to optimize the beamforming vectors and power allocation, which are guaranteed to converge to a local optimum solution to the formulated problems with low computational complexity. Our simulation results reveal that our proposed beamforming algorithms outperform the zero-forcing beamforming algorithm with equal power or water filling allocation widely used in the existing literatures.}

Three important problems that can adversely affect the performance of the DFE in SC-FDMA systems are to be addressed here, i.e., the feedback symbols reliability, the feedback correlation metric, and the phase noise due to inaccuracies in the fabrication process of the crystal oscillator. Instead of using all the detected symbols in the feedback loop of the DFE, only the highly reliable symbols are selected to be fed back. This results in the improvement of the error propagation, one of the common problems in a DFE. Also, the feedback correlation is an important metric in the design of the DFE, and hence an elegant method is proposed in this design and found to perform better than the available existing designs in the literature. Finally, the transmitter and receiver phase noise is iteratively compensated using its corresponding time- and frequency-domain properties. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of our designed iterative block DFE.}

	abstract = {Caching high-frequency reuse contents at the edge servers in the mobile edge computing (MEC) network omits the part of backhaul transmission and further releases the pressure of data traffic. However, how to efficiently decide the caching contents for edge servers is still an open problem, which refers to the cache capacity of edge servers, the popularity of each content, and the wireless channel quality during transmission. In this paper, we discuss the influence of unknown user density and popularity of content on the cache placement solution at the edge server. Specifically, towards the implementation of the cache placement solution in the practical network, there are two problems needing to be solved. First, the estimation of unknown users’ preference needs a huge amount of records of users’ previous requests. Second, the overlapping serving regions among edge servers cause the wrong estimation of users’ preference, which hinders the individual decision of caching placement. To address the first issue, we propose a learning-based solution to adaptively optimize the cache placement policy without any previous knowledge of the user density and the popularity of the contents. We develop the extended multi-armed bandit (Extended MAB), which combines the generalized global bandit (GGB) and Standard Multi-armed bandit (MAB), to iteratively estimate both a global parameter, i.e., the user density, and individual parameters, i.e., the popularity of each content. For the second problem, a multi-agent Extended MAB based solution is presented to avoid the mis-estimation of parameters and achieve the decentralized cache placement policy. The proposed solution determines the primary time slot and secondary time slot for each edge server. The edge servers estimate expected satisfied user number of caching a content with the overlap information and determine the cache placement solution. The proposed strategies are proven to achieve the bounded regret according to the mathematical analysis. Extensive simulations verify the optimality of the proposed strategies when comparing with baselines.}

	abstract = {Many operators have been bullish on the role of millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications in fifth-generation (5G) mobile broadband because of its capability of delivering extreme data speeds and capacity. However, mmWave comes with challenges related to significantly high path loss and susceptibility to blockage. Particularly, when mmWave communication is applied to a mobile terminal device, communication can be frequently broken because of rampant hand blockage. Although a number of mobile phone companies have suggested configuring multiple sets of antenna modules at different locations on a mobile phone to circumvent this problem, identifying an optimal antenna module and a beam pair by simultaneously opening multiple sets of antenna modules causes the problem of excessive power consumption and device costs. In this study, a fast antenna and beam switching method termed Fast-ABS is proposed. In this method, only one antenna module is used for the reception to predict the best beam of other antenna modules. As such, unmasked antenna modules and their corresponding beam pairs can be rapidly selected for switching to avoid the problem of poor quality or disconnection of communications caused by hand blockage. Thorough analysis and extensive simulations, which include the derivation of relevant Cramér-Rao lower bounds, show that the performance of Fast-ABS is close to that of an oracle solution that can instantaneously identify the best beam of other antenna modules even in complex multipath scenarios. Furthermore, Fast-ABS is implemented on a software defined radio and integrated into a 5G New Radio physical layer. Over-the-air experiments reveal that Fast-ABS can achieve efficient and seamless connectivity despite hand blockage.}

	abstract = {This paper considers the time evolution of a queue that is embedded in a Poisson point process of moving wireless interferers. The queue is driven by an external arrival process and is subject to a time-varying service process that is a function of the SINR that it sees. Static configurations of interferers result in an infinite queue workload with positive probability. In contrast, a generic stability condition is established for the queue in the case where interferers possess any non-zero mobility that results in displacements that are both independent across interferers and oblivious to interferer positions. The proof leverages the mixing property of the Poisson point process. The effect of an increase in mobility on queuing metrics is also studied. Convex ordering tools are used to establish that faster moving interferers result in a queue workload that is smaller for the increasing-convex stochastic order. As a corollary, mean workload and mean delay decrease as network mobility increases. This stochastic ordering as a function of mobility is explained by establishing positive correlations between SINR level-crossing events at different time points, and by determining the autocorrelation function for interference and observing that it decreases with increasing mobility. System behaviour is empirically analyzed using discrete-event simulation and the performance of various mobility models is evaluated using heavy-traffic approximations.}

	abstract = {TeraHertz (THz) communications are envisioned as a promising technology, owing to its unprecedented multi-GHz bandwidth. One fundamental challenge when moving to new spectrum is to understand the science of radio propagation and develop an accurate channel model. In this paper, a wideband channel measurement campaign between 130 GHz and 143 GHz is investigated in a typical meeting room. Directional antennas are utilized and rotated for resolving the multi-path components (MPCs) in the angular domain. With careful system calibration that eliminates system errors and antenna effects, a realistic power delay profile is developed. Furthermore, a combined MPC clustering and matching procedure with ray-tracing techniques is proposed to investigate the cluster behavior and wave propagation of THz signals. In light of the measurement results, physical parameters and insights in the THz indoor channel are comprehensively analyzed, including the line-of-sight path loss, power distributions, temporal and spatial features, and correlations among THz multi-path characteristics. Finally, a hybrid channel model that combines ray-tracing and statistical methods is developed for THz indoor communications. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid channel model shows good agreement with the measurement and outperforms the conventional statistical and geometric-based stochastic channel model in terms of the temporal-spatial characteristics.}

We extend here the existing Trial and Error (TE) framework developed in the deterministic case and for which strong convergence properties hold. We prove that using directly this solution in the random context leads to unsatisfactory solutions. Then we propose an adaptation of the original Trial and Error Learning (TEL) algorithm, called Robust TEL (RTEL), assuming that the random channel effects translate into a bounded stochastic disturbance of the utility function. The solution consists in introducing thresholds in the transitions of the TEL’s Finite State Controller (FSC). We prove that this new solution restores the good convergence property inherited from the TEL. Furthermore, we provide analysis of the stochastic utilities in the Rayleigh fading case in order to check the bounded assumption. Finally, we develop an online algorithm that dynamically estimates the optimal threshold values to adapt to the instantaneous disturbance. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical claims.}

	abstract = {Most existing optimization objectives considered in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation schemes are non-delay-sensitive metrics. In order to apply NOMA to various Internet of Things scenarios, the delay must be considered. The effective capacity of users, which characterizes the capacity under specific expiration probabilities, can potentially be a performance metric of statistical delay quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose two novel dynamic power allocation schemes with statistical delay QoS guarantee in the uplink NOMA system with paired users. One of the schemes maximizes the sum effective capacity (SEC) of the strong and weak users, which is a non-convex nonlinear optimization problem and is solved by Lagrangian dual decomposition and successive convex approximation (SCA). The other one maximizes the effective energy efficiency (EEE) of uplink NOMA, which is a fractional optimization problem and is solved by integrating the Dinkelbach method, SCA, and Lagrangian dual decomposition. Numerical results show that the SEC and EEE can be significantly improved by the proposed schemes, compared to the existing NOMA and orthogonal multiple access power allocation schemes.}

	abstract = {In wireless distributed computing systems, mobile devices that are connected wirelessly to the Fog (e.g., small base stations) collaboratively solve a given computational task. Unfortunately, wireless distributed computing systems suffer from packet losses due to severe channel fading. Moreover, a wireless device can drop out of the system when leaving the coverage of a master node in the Fog layer. We model this unreliability between a device and a master node as a packet erasure channel. When a packet fails to be detected at the receiver, the corresponding packet is retransmitted, which would significantly increase the overall run-time to finish the task. We take a coding-theoretic approach to tackle this straggler-like problem in wireless distributed computing. We first investigate the expected latency using an (n, k)\nmaximum-distance separable (MDS) code. We obtain the lower and upper bounds on the latency in closed forms and provide guidelines to design MDS codes depending on the channel condition characterized by packet erasure probability. Then, we introduce another important performance metric called minimum latency , and also provide guidelines on designing optimal codes. Based on optimal codes, we obtain the performance curves of achievable minimum latency and achievable workload as functions of packet erasure probability.}

	abstract = {Hybrid beamforming (HBF) is an attractive technology for practical massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. Compared with the fully-connected HBF architecture, the partially-connected one can further reduce the hardware cost and power consumption. However, the special block diagonal structure of its analog beamforming matrix brings additional design challenges. In this paper, we develop effective HBF algorithms for spectral efficiency maximization (SEM) in wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems with the partially-connected architecture. One main contribution is that we prove the equivalence of the SEM problem and a weighted mean square error minimization (WMMSE) problem, which leads to a convenient algorithmic approach to directly tackle the SEM problem. Specifically, we decompose the equivalent WMMSE problem into the hybrid precoding and hybrid combining subproblems, for which both the optimal digital precoder and combiner have closed-form solutions. For the more challenging analog precoder and combiner, we propose an element iteration based algorithm and a manifold optimization based algorithm. Finally, the hybrid precoder and combiner are alternatively updated. The overall HBF algorithms are proved to monotonously increase the spectral efficiency and converge. Furthermore, we also propose modified algorithms with reduced computational complexity and finite-resolution phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HBF algorithms achieve significant performance gains over conventional algorithms.}

	abstract = {Energy correlation critically affects the performance of a wirelessly powered network due to its key effect on the spatial distribution of concurrent RF-powered transmitters. This paper introduces a powerful analytical framework with foundations in stochastic geometry to characterize the energy correlation in a general wirelessly powered network. Unlike the commonly used pair correlation function (pcf)-based method, it is based on the energy correlation coefficient (ECC) and yields the energy correlation distance that gives a sufficiently small ECC. Specifically, we focus on the spatial correlation of the energy harvested from a Poisson field of RF power sources with directional beams under two cases: i) each power source points the beam in a random direction; ii) each power source points the beam to an RF-powered node located in its Voronoi cell. The results demonstrate that the energized RF-powered nodes in both cases exhibit positive correlation that is weaker than in the omni-directional case due to the introduction of energy beamforming. As an application, we provide an ECC-based method using the energy correlation distance to approximate the success probability and area spectral efficiency in the communication phase. It turns out that the ECC-based approximation matches the exact result well, and, more importantly, it can deal with the energy correlation in more general and complicated scenarios (where the pcf analysis is infeasible) due to its superior tractability.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the interplay between device-to-device (D2D) communications and real-time monitoring systems in a cellular-based Internet of Things (IoT) network. In particular, besides the possibility that the IoT devices communicate directly with each other in a D2D fashion, we consider that they frequently send time-sensitive information/status updates (about some underlying physical processes observed by them) to their nearest cellular base stations (BSs). Specifically, we model the locations of the IoT devices as a bipolar Poisson Point Process (PPP) and that of the BSs as another independent PPP. For this setup, we characterize the performance of D2D communications using the average network throughput metric whereas the performance of the real-time applications is quantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metric. The IoT devices are considered to employ a distance-proportional fractional power control scheme while sending status updates to their serving BSs. Hence, depending upon the maximum transmission power available, the IoT devices located within a certain distance from the BSs can only send status updates. This association strategy, in turn, forms the Johnson-Mehl (JM) tessellation, such that the IoT devices located in the JM cells are allowed to send status updates. The average network throughput is obtained by deriving the mean success probability for the D2D links. On the other hand, the temporal mean AoI of a given status update link can be treated as a random variable over space since its success delivery rate is a function of the interference field seen from its receiver. Thus, in order to capture the spatial disparity in the AoI performance, we characterize the spatial moments of the temporal mean AoI. In particular, we obtain these spatial moments by deriving the moments of both the conditional success probability and the conditional scheduling probability for status update links. Our results provide useful design guidelines on the efficient deployment of future massive IoT networks that will jointly support D2D communications and several cellular network-enabled real-time applications.}

On the other hand, a malicious adversary can also attack the primary user (PU) system and the legitimate CR system via spectrum sensing, which can lead to serious security issue for both systems. In this article, we study an online attacking strategy, referred to as PU emulation attacker (PEA), which transmits forged PU signals over available channels to deteriorate the spectrum sensing performance of the SUs. We propose an online learning based attacking scheme for both the single attacker and the multiple-attacker cases, and analyze the regret upper bound of the proposed algorithm. The proposed PEA strategy can work in both stationary and non-stationary CR networks where the statistical characteristics of channels and the access strategy of SUs change over time. Numerical results show that it is more efficient than others in two different performance metrics: successful accesses of SUs and effective attacks of PEAs. Our proposal raises an interesting open question on how to develop CR networks with security guarantee.}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to simultaneously manage inferences at the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), and to identify opportunities for power transfer and additional UL transmissions integrated with existing protocols and infrastructures for enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) protocol in dense IoT HetNets, while considering practical non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model. The design is formulated as the joint optimization of interference aware UL/DL decoupling, airtime resource allocation and energy transfer. The key insight of our algorithm is to translate the original, intractable joint-optimization problem into a problem space where a good approximate solution can be quickly found. We evaluate our scheme through theoretical analysis and simulation. The evaluation shows that our approach improves the system utility by over 20% compared to start-of-the-art in dense IoT HetNets. Compared to alternative schemes, our approach maintains the best user fairness and rate experience and can solve the problem in a fast and scalable way.}

	abstract = {In order to facilitate the reliability of data transmission of Spinal codes over the fading channel, performance analysis of Spinal codes is conducted, and an improved encoding structure is proposed. First, we derive an approximate frame error rate (FER) upper bound for Spinal codes over the Rayleigh fading channel in the finite block length (FBL) regime. Then, inspired by the FER analysis process, we propose an improved encoding structure, named self-concatenation structure, to reduce the FER of Spinal codes. In addition, a parallel structure is proposed for Spinal codes to improve the decoding throughput. For the self-concatenation structure, simulation results show that it exhibits a significant gain in anti-noise performance compared with the original Spinal codes over the Rayleigh fading channel. For the parallel structure, we find that by combining the parallel structure with the self-concatenation structure, not only is the encoding and decoding throughput of Spinal codes significantly improved but also the FER of Spinal codes is reduced.}

	abstract = {Joint communication and sensing (JCAS) is an emerging technology for managing efficiently the scarce radio frequency (RF) spectrum, and is expected to be a key ingredient in beyond fifth-generation (5G) networks. We consider a JCAS system, where the full-duplex radar transceiver and the communication transmitter are the same device, and pursue orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform optimization by jointly minimizing the lower bounds of delay and Doppler estimation. This is attained by filling the empty subcarriers within the OFDM frame with optimized samples while reallocating a proportion of the communication subcarriers’ power, which essentially controls the fairness between the two functionalities. Both communication and filled radar subcarriers are used for radar processing. The optimized sample values are found analytically, and a computationally feasible algorithm is presented for this task. We also address how the peak-to-average power ratio of the waveform can be controlled and minimized along the optimization process. The results are then numerically evaluated in 5G New Radio (NR) network context, which indicate a trade-off between the minimization of the lower bounds. The main-lobe width and the peak side-lobe level (PSL) of the range and velocity profiles of the radar image are also analyzed. An inverse relation between the lower bounds and the PSLs is observed, while the main-lobe width can be minimized simultaneously. The trade-off between communication and sensing is investigated, which indicates that the lower bounds can be improved at the cost of the communication capacity. Moreover, over-the-air RF measurements are carried out with unoptimized and optimized 5G NR waveforms at the 28 GHz mm-wave band, to validate the range profile’s PSL improvement in an outdoor mapping scenario, depicting considerable performance gain.}

	abstract = {Limited backhaul bandwidth and blockage effects are two main factors limiting the practical deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) networks. To tackle these issues, we study the feasibility of relaying as well as caching in mmWave networks. A user association and relaying (UAR) criterion dependent on both caching status and maximum biased received power is proposed by considering the spatial correlation caused by the coexistence of base stations (BSs) and relay nodes (RNs). Using stochastic geometry tools, we decouple the UAR and caching placement issues by analyzing the relationship between UAR probabilities and caching placement probabilities. We then optimize the formulated caching placement problem based on polyblock outer approximation by exploiting the monotonic property in the general case and utilizing convex optimization in the noise-limited case. Accordingly, we propose a BS and RN selection algorithm where caching status at BSs and maximum biased received power are jointly considered. Experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement of backhaul offloading using the proposed algorithms, and show that deploying more RNs and increasing cache size in mmWave networks is a more cost-effective alternative than increasing BS density to achieve similar backhaul offloading performance.}

	abstract = {Deploying a mobile edge computing (MEC) server in the mobile blockchain-enabled Internet of things (IoT) system is a promising approach to improve the system performance, however, it imposes a significant challenge on the trust of the MEC server. To address this problem, we first propose an untrusted MEC proof of work (PoW) scheme in mobile blockchain networks where plenty of nonce hash computing demands can be offloaded to the MEC server. Then, we design a nonce ordering algorithm for this scheme to provide fairer computing resource allocation for all mobile IoT devices/users. Specifically, we formulate the user’s nonce selection strategy as a non-cooperative game, where utilities of the individual user are maximized in the untrusted MEC-aided mobile blockchain networks. We also prove the existence of Nash equilibrium and analyze that the cooperation behavior is unsuitable for blockchain-enabled IoT devices by using the repeated game. Finally, we design the blockchain’s difficulty adjustment mechanism to ensure stable block times during a long period of time. Compared with the weighted round-robin algorithm, our proposed nonce ordering algorithm can provide fairer computation resources and optimal nonce selection strategies for all mobile users. Network stability is gained through the proposed blockchain’s difficulty adjustment mechanism. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable design insights for practical mobile blockchain IoT systems.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider partitioned edge learning (PARTEL), which implements parameter-server training, a well known distributed learning method, in a wireless network. Thereby, PARTEL leverages distributed computation resources at edge devices to train a large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) model by dynamically partitioning the model into parametric blocks for separated updating at devices. Targeting broadband channels, we consider the joint control of parameter allocation, sub-channel allocation, and transmission power to improve the performance of PARTEL. Specifically, the policies for joint SUbcarrier, Parameter, and POweR allocaTion (SUPPORT) are optimized under the criterion of minimum learning latency. Two cases are considered. First, for the case of decomposable models (e.g., logistic regression), the latency-minimization problem is a mixed-integer program and non-convex. Due to its intractability, we develop a practical solution by integer relaxation and transforming it into an equivalent convex problem of model size maximization under a latency constraint. Thereby, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to compute the SUPPORT policy. Second, consider the case of deep neural network (DNN) models which can be trained using PARTEL by introducing some auxiliary variables. This, however, introduces constraints on model partitioning reducing the granularity of parameter allocation. The preceding policy is extended to DNN models by applying the proposed techniques of load rounding and proportional adjustment to rein in latency expansion caused by the load granularity constraints.}

	abstract = {Service providers are considering the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance wireless connectivity of cellular networks. To provide connectivity, UAVs have to be backhauled through terrestrial base stations (BSs) to the core network. In particular, we consider millimeter-wave (mmWave) backhauling in the downlink of a hybrid aerial-terrestrial network, where the backhaul links are subject to beamforming misalignment errors. In the proposed model, the user equipment (UE) can connect to either a ground BS or a UAV, where we differentiate between two transmission schemes according to the backhaul status. In one scheme, the UEs are served by the UAVs regardless of whether the backhaul links are good or not. In the other scheme, the UAVs are aware of the backhaul links status, and hence, only the subset of successfully backhauled UAVs can serve the UEs. Using stochastic geometry, the performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of coverage probability and validated against Monte-Carlo simulations. Several insights are provided for determining some system parameters including the UAVs altitude and required number and the beamforming misalignment error of the backhaul link. The obtained results highlight the impact of the UAVs backhaul link on the UE experience.}

	abstract = {Optimizing a hybrid beamforming transmitter is a non-convex problem and requires channel state information, leading in most cases to nontrivial feedback overhead. We propose a methodology relying on the principles of deep generative models and unfolding to achieve near-optimal hybrid beamforming with reduced feedback and computational complexity. We first represent the channel as a low-dimensional manifold via a generative adversarial network (GAN) and search the optimum digital and analog precoders in this low-dimensional space. To decrease the search complexity, we find an iteration rule by formulating hybrid beamforming as a bi-level optimization problem and then unfold each iteration as a neural layer. This results in a novel model-based deep neural network that incorporates domain knowledge. Our results show that this method (i) approaches the capacity-achieving spectral efficiency, (ii) provides a superior energy and spectral efficiency tradeoff, (iii) decreases feedback overhead, and (iv) reduces the complexity significantly, by optimizing a single low-dimensional vector per channel coherence time, with the neural network itself trained offline. The achieved spectral efficiency is robust when tested with realistic 3GPP channel models, even if the offline training relies on a simple geometric channel model.}

In particular, we consider an RIS-aided mmWave-NOMA downlink system with a hybrid beamforming structure. To maximize the achievable sum-rate under a minimum rate constraint for the users and a maximum transmit power constraint, a joint RIS phase shifts, hybrid beamforming, and power allocation problem is formulated. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, first, the non-convex problem is transformed into three subproblems, i.e., power allocation, joint phase shifts and analog beamforming optimization, and digital beamforming design. Then, we solve the power allocation problem by keeping fixed the phase shifts of the RIS and the hybrid beamforming. Finally, given the power allocation matrix, an alternating manifold optimization (AMO)-based method and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method are utilized to design the phase shifts, analog beamforming, and transmit beamforming, respectively. Numerical results reveal that the proposed AO algorithm outperforms existing schemes in terms of sum-rate. Moreover, compared to a conventional mmWave-NOMA system without RIS, the proposed RIS-aided mmWave-NOMA system is capable of improving the achievable sum-rate.}

	abstract = {In line-of-sight (LOS) massive MIMO, there is a nonnegligible probability that the channel vectors of some users become correlated. In these correlated scenarios, nonlinear precoders can be used instead of linear precoders at the cost of high computational complexity. To reduce the complexity of nonlinear precoders, hybrid linear and nonlinear precoders have been suggested in 5G New Radio (NR). In this paper, we find the probability that there is at least one pair of correlated users and we find the average number of correlated users. We propose a hybrid linear and nonlinear precoder (HLNP) with max-min power control for which the served users are divided into two groups. By employing a proposed modified Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP), we design and combine the transmit vectors of the two groups such that inter-group interference is removed. Simulation results show that by employing HLNP instead of zero-forcing, the required transmit power to assure a given average block error rate (BLER) with 95% probability is reduced. For a 64-antennas BS, when modified THP is used for 3 out of 10 users in HLNP, the transmit power is reduced by up to 4.70 dB to assure an average BLER of 10 −2 using 16QAM and 64QAM constellations with NR low-density parity-check codes.}

To characterise the data freshness of status updates, we exploit the age of information (AoI) as a metric, which is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the latest successfully decoded status update. The average AoI is formulated and minimised for both HD-DF and FD-DF relaying IoT networks in finite blocklength regime. For the HD-DF relaying, we introduce a perfect approximation of the average AoI to solve the problem of average AoI minimisation with the optimal blocklengths in two phases. For the FD-DF relaying, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem of average AoI minimisation by optimising the relay’s transmit power and the blocklength. Illustrative numerical results not only substantiate the validity of our proposed algorithms, but also provide useful references for the IoT monitoring network design, specifically for the transmit power thresholds at the IoT device and the relay.}

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, caching is a promising technique to alleviate energy consumption of sensors by responding to users’ data requests with the data packets cached in the edge caching node (ECN). However, without an efficient status update strategy, the information obtained by users may be stale, which in return would inevitably deteriorate the accuracy and reliability of derived decisions for real-time applications. In this paper, we focus on striking the balance between the information freshness, in terms of age of information (AoI), experienced by users and energy consumed by sensors, by appropriately activating sensors to update their current status. Particularly, we first depict the evolutions of the AoI with each sensor from different users’ perspective with time steps of non-uniform duration, which are determined by both the users’ data requests and the ECN’s status update decision. Then, we formulate a non-uniform time step based dynamic status update optimization problem to minimize the long-term average cost, jointly considering the average AoI and energy consumption. To this end, a Markov Decision Process is formulated and further, a dueling deep R-network based dynamic status update algorithm is devised by combining dueling deep Q-network and tabular R-learning, with which challenges from the curse of dimensionality and unknown of the environmental dynamics can be addressed. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by comparing it with five baseline deep reinforcement learning algorithms and policies.}
