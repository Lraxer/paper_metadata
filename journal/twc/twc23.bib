	abstract = {We consider a system consisting of a server, which receives updates for\nN\nfiles according to independent Poisson processes. The goal of the server is to deliver the latest version of the files to a user through a parallel network of\nK\ncaches. We consider an update received by the user successful, if the user receives the same file version that is currently prevailing at the server. We derive an analytical expression for information freshness at the user. We observe that freshness for a file increases with increase in consolidation of rates across caches. To solve the multi-cache problem, we first solve the auxiliary problem of a single-cache system. We then rework this auxiliary solution to our parallel-cache network by consolidating rates to single routes as much as possible. This yields an approximate (sub-optimal) solution for the original problem. We provide an upper bound on the gap between the sub-optimal solution and the optimal solution. We present counterpart expressions and policies for version age of information by employing a stochastic hybrid system approach. Numerical results for both timeliness metrics show that the proposed sub-optimal policy closely follows the optimal policy.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), empowered with the capability of high-definition image transmission, are used to capture the rapidly changing physical environment by leveraging its high flexibility to reconstruct an immersive realistic virtual environment for metaverse users. In this paper, we consider a novel UAV-assisted image acquisition system where a UAV is dispatched to take off from an initial location to capture real-time images of multiple ground targets and then transfer the captured images back to the ground user for virtual environment reconstruction. We aim to minimize the time for the UAV to complete the image acquisition task by optimizing the three-dimensional UAV trajectory under the constraints of image quality, information causality and energy consumption. To this end, we first formulate the investigated scenario into a mixed integer optimization problem, which, however, is difficult to solve due to the infinite time-varying variables closely coupled with each other. Then, a three-stage progressive algorithm is proposed to obtain an efficient solution to the formulated mixed integer optimization problem, where the constraints of image quality, information causality and energy consumption can be sequentially satisfied. Finally, comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed three-stage progressive trajectory design algorithm, and the results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {In this work, we propose novel HARQ prediction schemes for Cloud RANs (C-RANs) that use feedback over a rate-limited feedback channel (2 - 6 bits) from the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) to predict at the User Equipment (UE) the decoding outcome at the BaseBand Unit (BBU) ahead of actual decoding. In particular, we propose a Dual Autoencoding 2-Stage Gaussian Mixture Model (DA2SGMM) that is trained in an end-to-end fashion over the whole C-RAN setup. Using realistic link-level simulations in the sub-THz band at 100 GHz, we show that the novel DA2SGMM HARQ prediction scheme clearly outperforms all other adapted and state-of-the-art schemes. The DA2SGMM shows a superior performance in terms of blockage detection as well as HARQ prediction in the no-blockage and single-blockage cases. In particular, the DA2SGMM with 4 bit feedback achieves a more than 200 % higher throughput in average compared to its best alternative. Compared to regular HARQ, the DA2SGMM reduces the maximum transmission latency by more than 72.4 %, while maintaining more than 75 % of the throughput in the no-blockage scenario. In the single-blockage scenario, DA2SGMM significantly increases the throughput for most of the evaluated Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) compared to regular HARQ.}

Two localisation algorithms, based on k-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest, were applied to data from three academic buildings to test the effectiveness of various access points (APs) selection filters. Additionally, new hierarchical selection models were proposed. The methods divide building into zones to improve the characteristics of the positioning error by a local selection of APs. Hierarchical methods reduced the median number of AP to 67 in comparison to over 100 selected by existing methods, obtaining a statistically similar median error of 6.01 m.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the coexistence of the New Radio-based access to Unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) network and the Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) network in unlicensed millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. To enable the NR-U network to achieve equitable and harmonious spectrum sharing with WiGig systems, we develop two new classes of user equipment (UE) scheduling schemes by exploiting the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we first propose the distributed deep reinforcement learning scheduling (DeepDS) scheme, wherein multiple deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to make decisions for different panels in an independent fashion. Thereafter, to reduce the computational cost of adopting multiple DNNs, we design the centralized deep reinforcement learning scheduling (DeepCS) scheme that introduces the shared DNN framework to perform decisions for all panels in parallel at one time. The objective of both DeepDS and DeepCS is to maximize the total data rate of the NR-U network with as little interference to WiGig systems as possible, while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirement for each UE. We first formulate this problem into the constrained Markov decision process framework. To address the multi-constraint issue, we put forth a new DRL algorithm that incorporates the Lagrangian primal-dual optimization into the deep Q-network framework, referred to as adaptive multi-constraint deep Q-network (AMC-DQN). With AMC-DQN, both DeepDS and DeepCS can achieve their goals even without acquiring prior operations about the WiGig network. Simulation results show that compared with the state-of-the-art omniLBT and dirLBT, both DeepDS and DeepCS yield significant performance benefits in terms of the total network data rate. We also demonstrate the ability of DeepDS and DeepCS to satisfy the QoS requirements of different UEs and their robustness against various simulation setups. Furthermore, compared with DeepDS, DeepCS can save a large amount of computational cost although at the expense of a slightly lower data rate.}

First, analytical expressions for the exact and asymptotic secrecy outage probability (SOP) of NOMA-aided SGF systems with a single GF user are derived. Then, the SGF systems with multiple GF users and the best-user scheduling scheme is considered. By utilizing order statistics theory, analytical expressions for the exact and asymptotic SOP are derived. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided and compared with two benchmark schemes. The effects of system parameters on the SOP of the considered system are demonstrated and the accuracy of the developed analytical results is verified. The results indicate that both the outage target rate for GB and the secure target rate for GF are the main factors of the secrecy performance of SGF systems.}

	abstract = {Handover (HO) management is one of the most crucial tasks in dense cellular networks with mobile users. A problem in the HO management is to deal with increasing HOs due to network densification in the 5G evolution and various HO skipping techniques have so far been studied in the literature to suppress excessive HOs. In this paper, we propose yet another HO skipping scheme, called periodic HO skipping. The proposed scheme prohibits the HOs of a mobile user equipment (UE) for a certain period of time, referred to as skipping period, thereby enabling flexible operation of the HO skipping by adjusting the length of the skipping period. We investigate the performance of the proposed scheme on the basis of stochastic geometry. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions of two performance metrics—the HO rate and the expected downlink data rate—when a UE adopts the periodic HO skipping. Numerical results based on the analysis demonstrate that the periodic HO skipping scenario can outperform the scenario without any HO skipping in terms of a certain utility metric representing the trade-off between the HO rate and the expected downlink data rate, in particular when the UE moves fast. Furthermore, we numerically show that there can exist an optimal length of the skipping period, which locally maximizes the utility metric, and approximately provide the optimal skipping period in a simple form. Numerical comparison with some other HO skipping techniques is also conducted.}

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) plays a critical role in achieving the potential benefits of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. In frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, the base station (BS) relies on sustained and accurate CSI feedback from users. However, due to the large number of antennas and users being served in massive MIMO systems, feedback overhead can become a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a model-driven deep learning method for CSI feedback, called learnable optimization and regularization algorithm (LORA). Instead of using l_{1} -norm as the regularization term, LORA introduces a learnable regularization module that adapts to characteristics of CSI automatically. The conventional Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) is unfolded into a neural network, which can learn both the optimization process and the regularization term by end-to-end training. We show that LORA improves the CSI feedback accuracy and speed. Besides, a novel learnable quantization method and the corresponding training scheme are proposed, and it is shown that LORA can operate successfully at different bit rates, providing flexibility in terms of the CSI feedback overhead. Various realistic scenarios are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LORA through numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), which transmits information bits through ordinary constellation symbols and indices of active subcarriers, is a promising multicarrier transmission scheme and has attracted the attention of researchers due to numerous benefits such as flexibility and simplicity. Nonetheless, OFDM-IM cannot satisfy the needs of future wireless communication services such as superior reliability, high data rates, and low complexity. In this article, we propose a novel OFDM-IM scheme named coordinate interleaved OFDM with repeated in-phase/quadrature IM (CI-OFDM-RIQIM), which provides superior error performance and enhanced spectral efficiency due to its diversity order of two and clever subcarrier activation pattern (SAP) detection mechanism, respectively. In addition, CI-OFDM-RIQIM is further extended to coordinate interleaved OFDM with in-phase/quadrature IM (CI-OFDM-IQIM) by doubling information bits transmitted by IM. Furthermore, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) based low-complexity detectors are designed for both proposed schemes. Theoretical analyses are performed and an upper bound on the bit error probability is derived. Comprehensive computer simulations under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI), are conducted to compare the proposed and reference schemes. It is shown that CI-OFDM-RIQIM and CI-OFDM-IQIM show superior results and can be considered promising candidates for next-generation wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {To enable innovative applications and services, both industry and academia are exploring new technologies for sixth generation (6G) communications. One of the promising candidates is fluid antenna system (FAS). Unlike existing systems, FAS is a novel communication technology where its antenna can freely change its position and shape within a given space. Compared to the traditional systems, this unique capability has the potential of providing higher diversity and interference-free communications. Nevertheless, the performance limits of FAS remain unclear as its system properties are difficult to analyze. To address this, we approximate the outage probability and diversity gain of FAS in closed-form expressions. We then propose a suboptimal FAS with N^{\\ast} ports, where a significant gain can be obtained over FAS with N^{\\ast}-1 ports whilst FAS with N^{\\ast}+1 ports only yields marginal improvement over the proposed suboptimal FAS. In this paper, we also provide analytical and simulation results to unfold the key factors that affect the performance of FAS. Limited to systems with one active radio frequency (RF)-chain, we show that the proposed suboptimal FAS outperforms single-antenna (SISO) system and selection combining (SC) system in terms of outage probability. Interestingly, when the given space is \\frac {\\lambda }{2} , the outage probability of the proposed suboptimal FAS with one active RF-chain achieves near to that of the maximal ratio combining (MRC) system with multiple active RF-chains.}

	abstract = {Fault diagnosis for wireless networks is commonly conducted by human experts. However, such manual diagnosis becomes much less feasible due to the growing complexity of wireless networks. To resolve this issue, automatic fault diagnosis has been studied in self-organizing networks (SONs). However, existing works mostly consider that only a single network fault could occur at a time, which might not be true in practice. Therefore, we in this paper consider that multiple faults with different levels of severity can occur simultaneously and investigate the multi-fault and severity diagnosis for SONs. We first consider using supervised learning techniques to conduct the diagnosis and propose the corresponding diagnosis neural networks. Then, since the characteristics of different network scenarios could be different and it is costly to collect labeled data for all network scenarios, we further propose an unsupervised transfer learning approach that can effectively transfer the diagnosis system from the source domain with labeled data to the target domain with unlabeled data. We conduct extensive simulations to validate our approaches. Results show that our approach can outperform all the reference approaches. Furthermore, results also show that the performance of our transfer learning-based diagnosis is close to that of the supervised learning-based diagnosis.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a physical layer security methodology to recognize individual devices by leveraging hardware imperfections inevitably induced in the manufacturing process. However, the performance degradation caused by the time-varying channel impacts and interferences has severely restricted the development of RFFI. To this end, we present a channel-agnostic RFFI system, which consists of three modules, i.e., signal preprocessing module, feature extraction module, and classification module. In the signal preprocessing module, we first propose a novel approach, referred to as limiter-based spectral circular shift bidirectional division (LB-SCSBD), to generate two parallel spectral quotient (SQ) sequences. Then, we define the spectral quotient constellation (SQC) symbols according to different modulation formats, and thereby transform the SQ sequences into four magnitude-based sequences in terms of two channel-robust signal representations, i.e., the SQ magnitude (SQM) and SQC error vector magnitude (SQC-EVM). In the feature extraction module, we present a moment-based statistical feature extractor (MB-SFE) to extract the device-specific information from the above four sequences. In the classification module, the extracted statistics are fed into the multi-class support vector machine (SVM) for training and testing. We take WiFi as a case study and evaluate the performance of the proposed RFFI system by classifying eight simulated device models and six universal software radio peripheral (USRP) transmitter radios. Experimental results show that (i) the proposed method achieves the accuracies of 99.84% and 98.26% with eight devices in QPSK and 16QAM cases, as well as the accuracy of 92.42% with six USRP devices (ii) the proposed method exhibits superior classification performance in comparison to some existing RFFI methods, leading to a significant accuracy improvement of at least 38.33%.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes to leverage intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) backscatter to implement downlink communications for a multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, which represents a brand-new communication framework. In such a network, one active macro cell base station (MBS) is deployed for radiating energy signal, while each IRS acts as a small cell base station to realize its own information transmission by modulating and reflecting the signal from the MBS. Under this paradigm, we investigate two optimization problems, namely weighted sum rate maximization problem and max-min fairness problem, aiming at satisfying different communication requirements. To seek their optimal solutions, Lagrangian dual transform and alternate methods are employed to optimize the active beamforming vector at the MBS and the passive beamforming vectors at all the IRSs. Additionally, an element clustering scheme is developed to reduce computation and control complexity, in which each element cluster works like a unit and all clusters can collaborate to communicate with users. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the achievable communication performance and to verify the feasibility of the proposed IRS backscatter enabled downlink multi-cell MIMO network.}

	abstract = {Base station (BS) activation is a widely-used approach to alleviate the system power cost for device maintenance. However, frequently switching on/off BSs may also introduce extra power and signaling costs, which motivates us to limit the BS switching frequency when performing BS activation. To address this, we study a problem of joint long-term BS activation and short-term beamforming (J-LTBA-STBF) in a network where multiple multi-antenna BSs cooperatively serve multiple single-antenna users. LTBA means that each BS’s active/inactive switching frequency is properly controlled to yield relatively stable BS-user association and limited switching power, while STBF lies in that due to the low cost of refreshing beamformers, the transmit beamformers are allowed to be updated frequently to maximally lower the transmit power. Following the idea, two efficient algorithms are designed, according to the data amount they request to start running, to optimize the active BSs and the BS transmit beamformers in multiple adjacent time slices. Consequently, the transmit, maintenance and switching powers can be well balanced to facilitate power-efficient communications. Numerical results validate the efficacies of the algorithms.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) has emerged as a spectrum- and energy-efficient paradigm to support massive Internet of Things (IoT) connections. Two multiple access schemes are proposed in this paper to facilitate massive IoT connections using the cellular network based on the SR technique, namely, the simultaneous access (SA) scheme and the selection diversity access (SDA) scheme. In the SA scheme, the base station (BS) transmits information to the receiver while multiple IoT devices transmit their information simultaneously by passively backscattering the BS signal to the receiver, while in the SDA scheme, only the IoT device with the strongest backscatter link transmits information. In both of the schemes, the receiver jointly decodes the information from the BS and IoT devices. To evaluate the above two schemes, the closed-form expressions of the ergodic rates in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes and outage probabilities for cellular and IoT transmissions are derived by using extreme value theory, generalized-K distribution approximation and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature methods. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and compare the proposed multiple access schemes. When the number of IoT devices is small, the SDA scheme is more appealing since it can significantly reduce the computational complexity while achieving equivalent performance to the SA scheme. When the number of IoT devices is large, the SA scheme is preferable since it guarantees a significantly better rate performance and a lower outage probability.}

	abstract = {Adequate and uniform network coverage provision is one of the main objectives of cellular service providers. Additionally, the densification of cells exacerbates coverage and service provision challenges, particularly at the cell-edges. In this paper, we present a new approach of cell-sweeping-based Base Stations (BSs) deployments in cellular Radio Access Networks (RANs) where the coverage is improved by enhancing the cell-edge performance. In essence, the concept of cell-sweeping rotates/sweeps the sectors of a site in azimuth continuously/discretely resulting in near-uniform distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) around the sweeping site. This paper investigates the proposed concept analytically by deriving expressions for the PDF/CDF of SINR and achievable rate; and with the help of system-level simulations, it shows that the proposed concept can provide throughput gains of up to 125% at the cell-edge. Then, using a link-budget analysis, it is shown that the maximum allowable path loss (MAPL) increases by 2.1 dB to 4.1 dB corresponding to the gains in wideband SINR and post-equalized SINR, respectively. This increase in MAPL can be translated to cell-radius/area with the help of the Okumura-Hata propagation model and results in cell-coverage area enhancement by 30% to 66% in a Typical Urban cell deployment scenario.}

	abstract = {Recently, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that controls the reflection characteristics of incident signals has received a great deal of attention. To make the most of the RIS-aided systems, an acquisition of RIS reflected channel information at the base station (BS) is crucial. However, this task is by no means easy due to the pilot overhead induced by the large number of reflecting elements. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation and phase shift control technique reducing the pilot overhead of the RIS-aided mmWave systems. Key idea of the proposed scheme is to decompose the RIS reflected channel into three major components, i.e., static BS-RIS angles, quasi-static RIS-UE angles, and time-varying BS-RIS-UE path gains, and then estimate them in different time scales. By estimating the BS-RIS and RIS-UE angles occasionally and estimating only the path gains frequently, the proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction on the pilot overhead. Further, by optimizing the phase shifts using the channel components with relatively long coherence time, we can improve the channel estimation accuracy. From the performance analysis and numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves more than 60% pilot overhead reduction over the conventional techniques.}

	abstract = {With its privacy preservation and communication efficiency, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising learning framework for beyond 5G wireless networks. It is anticipated that future wireless networks will jointly serve both FL and downlink non-FL user groups in the same time-frequency resource. While in the downlink of each FL iteration, both groups simultaneously receive data from the base station in the same time-frequency resource, the uplink of each FL iteration requires bidirectional communication to support uplink transmission for FL users and downlink transmission for non-FL users. To overcome this challenge, we present half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) communication schemes to serve both groups. More specifically, we adopt the massive multiple-input multiple-output technology and aim to maximize the minimum effective rate of non-FL users under a quality of service (QoS) latency constraint for FL users. Since the formulated problem is nonconvex, we propose a power control algorithm based on successive convex approximation to find a stationary solution. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions perform significantly better than the considered baselines schemes. Moreover, the FD-based scheme outperforms the HD-based counterpart in scenarios where the self-interference is small or moderate and/or the size of FL model updates is large.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is an emerging technology that can improve the spectrum and energy efficiency of next-generation wireless networks. However, attaining accurate channel state information (CSI) for the cascaded RIS channel is particularly challenging. Imperfect CSI is a major bottleneck to achieving the spectral efficiency benefit of RIS-assisted networks. Rate splitting (RS), a promising multiple access technology, has been shown to be able to achieve an improved spectrum efficiency and be robust to channel uncertainties. This paper investigates the interplay between RIS and RS by considering a RIS-assisted RS beamforming problem. Active beamforming at the base station (BS) and passive beamforming at the RIS are jointly considered to maximize the minimum user rate under both the perfect CSI case and the imperfect CSI case. A block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is developed to solve this non-convex problem. Compared with the conventional semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach, the proposed method does not require that the covariance matrix of the common beamforming vector be rank-one. Moreover, we present theoretical results to help reveal the impact of the system parameters and explain the performance gain resulting from the integration of RIS and RS. Extensive simulation results are also provided to show that RIS-assisted RS can improve the max-min rate performance significantly compared with conventional multiple access technologies, such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space division multiple access (SDMA) with/without RIS, especially in overloaded systems. With the proposed method, RS shows great potential in combating realistic CSI errors in RIS-assisted networks.}

	abstract = {The protection of multicast transmission with optimized secrecy in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a low sidelobe secret multicast transmission scheme in mmWave communication based on physical layer security techniques. By utilizing oblique projection, we jointly adopt the directional modulation (DM) and the artificial noise (AN) to achieve secret multicast transmission at low computational costs, without jeopardizing the low sidelobe transmitting pattern. Specifically, considering the constraint of multibeam with the channel knowledge of all target users, a primary transmitting weight vector of the base station (BS) is designed to achieve a low sidelobe transmitting pattern. Then, in each symbol period, the transmitting weight vector of the BS is updated by performing a linear transformation on the primary weight vector with a transformation matrix, which is obtained from the oblique projection matrices of all the target users’ channel vectors. In this way, without deteriorating the primary weight vector’s low sidelobe transmitting pattern, the obtained transmitting weight vector synthesizes the expected symbols at the target users and adds randomness to the eavesdroppers at undesired directions. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves outstanding communication performance for the target users at low computational costs, while keeping the high symbol error rates at the undesired directions.}

	abstract = {We investigate joint power allocation and decoding order selection (PA-DOS) aimed at enhancing the outage performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. By considering the diverse target rates of users, new important properties of NOMA are revealed: When users’ target rates satisfy certain conditions, the channel state information (CSI) is not required by PA-DOS to minimize the system outage probability, and different users’ outage probabilities can be minimized simultaneously; When such conditions are not satisfied, the opposite situation occurs. Following these properties, two PA-DOS strategies are designed regarding distinct user priorities, which ensure the minimization of the system outage probability and the user outage probability of the high-priority user. Especially, these strategies do not require CSI or only require one-bit CSI feedback depending on users’ target rates. Analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed strategies significantly outperform the existing strategies in terms of both system and user outage performance. Furthermore, the results show that although under some target rates the minimum user outage probabilities cannot be simultaneously achieved, they can be closely approached at the same time in the high-signal-to-noise-ratio regime by the proposed strategies.}

	abstract = {Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently been proposed to compensate for the severe multiplicative fading effect of conventional passive RIS-aided systems. Each reflecting element of active RISs is assisted by an amplifier such that the incident signal can be reflected and amplified instead of only being reflected as in passive RIS-aided systems. This work addresses the practical challenge that, on the one hand, in active RIS-aided systems the perfect individual channel state information (CSI) of the RIS-aided channels cannot be acquired due to the lack of signal processing power at the active RISs, but, on the other hand, this CSI is required to calculate the expected system data rate and RIS transmit power needed for transceiver design. To address this issue, we first derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable rate and the average RIS transmit power based on partial CSI of the RIS-aided channels. Then, we formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem for jointly optimizing the active beamforming at both the base station (BS) and the RIS. This problem is then tackled using the majorization–minimization (MM) algorithm framework, and, in each iteration low-complexity solutions for the BS and RIS beamforming are found based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To ensure the quality of service (QoS) of each user, we further formulate a rate outage constrained beamforming problem, which is solved using the Bernstein-Type inequality (BTI) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently overcome the challenges imposed by imperfect CSI in active RIS-aided wireless systems.}

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an attention guided multi-task network for joint CFO and channel estimation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, considering the correlation between CFO estimation and channel estimation, we construct a multi-task neural network framework which consists of a shared branch (SB), a CFO estimation branch (CFOEB) and a channel estimation branch (CEB). Among them, the SB extracts common features of two tasks, and the CFOEB and CEB make more detailed CFO and channel estimation, respectively. To further suppress the influence of CFO estimation error on channel estimation, we introduce an attention guided module (AGM) which completes the re-calibration of the channel dimension on the basis of different CFO characteristics. We train the whole network by an end-to-end paradigm and construct a suitable multi-task loss function to balance the losses between different tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed attention guided multi-task learning based joint CFO and channel estimation scheme outperforms the conventional methods and has greater robustness under various conditions.}

	abstract = {Simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) is a potential way to meet the demands of sustainable power supply and high-rate data transfer in next-generation networks. Although resonant beam-based SLIPT (RB-SLIPT) can realize high-power energy transfer, high-rate data transfer, human safety, and self-alignment simultaneously, mobile transmission channel (MTC) analysis under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation has not been investigated. In this paper, we propose analytical models and simulation tools for reflector-assisted NLOS transmission of RB-SLIPT, where transmission loss and accurate beam field profile of NLOS MTC can be obtained with a receiver at arbitrary positions and attitude angles. We establish analytical models relying on full diffraction theory for beam propagation between tilted or off-axis planes. Then, we provide three numerical methods (i.e., NUFFT-based, cubic interpolation-based, and linear interpolation-based methods) in simulations. Moreover, to deal with the contradiction between limited computing memory and high sampling requirements for long-range transmission analysis, we propose a multi-hop sliding window approach, which can reduce the sampling number by a factor of thousands. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that RB-SLIPT can achieve 3W charging power and 10bit/s/Hz data rate over a 2m distance in NLOS scenarios.}

Single UAV-enabled aerial computing (SUEAC) is limited by small coverage area and insufficient resources, which cannot meet the application requirements. Multiple UAV-enabled aerial computing (MUEAC) has broken through the limitation of SUEAC and has attracted wide attention. Cooperation among multiple UAVs in MUEAC can fully utilize UAV resources and achieve load balancing. Furthermore, for divisible tasks with data-dependent characteristics, using partial offloading makes task scheduling more flexible compared to binary offloading, thus reducing task processing delay. Therefore, we propose a software defined networking enhanced cooperative MUEAC system. To minimize the processing delay of divisible tasks, we study the problem of joint task scheduling and computing resource allocation under task data dependency and UAV energy consumption constraints. To solve the non-convex problem, a multi-UAV cooperative communication and computing optimization (MCCCO) scheme is proposed. Experimental results corroborate that MCCCO can achieve better performance in task processing delay reduction and load balancing on UAV energy consumption than the traditional schemes.}

	abstract = {We consider a bidirectional communication between two single-antenna transceivers using multiple multi-antenna access points (APs) in a cell-free network architecture. In such a network, because of different propagation delays associated with different APs, the end-to-end link is a multi-path channel that results in inter-symbol-interference (ISI) in the signals received at the transceivers. To tackle ISI, we resort to cyclic prefix (CP) assisted block transmission of the information symbols and employ joint pre- and post-channel equalizers at both the transceivers to mitigate the impact of intra-block interference. Considering the amplify-and-forward technique at the APs, we cast the joint design of equalizers, beamforming matrices, and transceivers’ transmit powers as a power minimization problem while guaranteeing predefined data rates at the transceivers. Assuming symmetric beamforming matrices at the APs, we devise a semi-closed-form solution for this problem. We prove rigorously that at the optimum only a synchronous subset of the APs should participate in the information exchange between the two transceivers. This is achieved by proving that at the optimum, the pre-equalizer matrices should be unitary and the post-equalizer matrices should be invertible.}

	abstract = {Remote state estimation of large-scale distributed dynamic processes plays an important role in Industry 4.0 applications. In this paper, we focus on the transmission scheduling problem of a remote estimation system. First, we derive some structural properties of the optimal sensor scheduling policy over fading channels. Then, building on these theoretical guidelines, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for optimal scheduling of the system to achieve the minimum overall estimation mean-square error (MSE). In particular, we propose a structure-enhanced action selection method, which tends to select actions that obey the policy structure. This explores the action space more effectively and enhances the learning efficiency of DRL agents. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-enhanced loss function to add penalties to actions that do not follow the policy structure. The new loss function guides the DRL to converge to the optimal policy structure quickly. Our numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed structure-enhanced DRL algorithms can save the training time by 50% and reduce the remote estimation MSE by 10% to 25%, when compared to benchmark DRL algorithms. In addition, we show that the derived structural properties exist in a wide range of dynamic scheduling problems that go beyond remote state estimation.}

	abstract = {Human-computer interaction continuously evolves towards a genuinely immersive experience, submerging users in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world. A realistic, immersive experience necessitates a highly reliable and agile wireless connection to support immense data transmission. Yet, there are abundant but underutilized memory resources available at the devices which can be harnessed as supplementary assets to reduce the excessive burden on the wireless medium. What is more, the use of Coded Caching (CC) techniques enables the cumulative cache memory of users in the network to be used as an additional communication resource. To this end, a location-dependent multi-antenna CC-based content delivery scheme tailored specifically for wireless extended reality applications is proposed in this paper. First, a novel memory allocation process is developed, enabling an appropriate trade-off between local and global caching gains. In this regard, the local caching gain is maximized when the memory is mostly dedicated to locations with poor connectivity conditions (absolute fairness). In contrast, the global caching gain is maximized when the memory is uniformly allocated among all the locations. As a result of the memory allocation process, unequal fractions of location-dependent multimedia content are cached by each user. Given the asymmetric cache placement, a novel algorithm is proposed to create suitable codewords for each user during the subsequent delivery phase, which simultaneously achieves a global and local caching gain. The proposed delivery scheme also combines global caching and spatial multiplexing gains using a weighted max-min multicast beamformer design with multi-rate modulation. Numerical experiments and mathematical analysis demonstrate significant performance gains, in terms of the 95-percentile expected delivery time, compared to unicast and multicast scenarios where either the local or global caching gain is maximized.}

However, in the existing SIS schemes, the shadow images will be easily tampered and corrupted during the communication, which will pose serious security issues. Recently, blockchain has emerged as a promising paradigm in the field of data communication and information security. To securely communicate and effectively protect the secret image data in wireless networks, we propose a Blockchain-based Secure and Efficient Secret Image Sharing (BC-SESIS) scheme with outsourcing computation in wireless networks. In the proposed BC-SESIS scheme, the shadow images are encrypted and stored in the blockchain to prevent them from being tampered and corrupted. The identity authentication-enabled smart contract is deployed to achieve the (k,n) threshold for secret image restoring. Furthermore, to reduce the computational burden of smart contract and users, an efficient outsourcing computation method is designed to outsource the restoring task, which is securely implemented by agent miners in the encryption domain. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that the BC-SESIS scheme can achieve desirable communication security and high computational efficiency in the wireless networks.}

	abstract = {In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, channel estimation is of crucial importance to guarantee reliable recovery of ultra-high-speed MIMO signals. This paper proposes a novel channel estimation algorithm for the emerging MIMO-based orthogonal chirp-division multiplexing (OCDM) systems by utilizing the unique features of OCDM signals. In the proposed algorithm, a set of pilot signals is designed based on the Fresnel basis, which is essentially a family of orthogonal linear chirps. The pilots are assigned to different antennas for transmission occupying the same time slot and bandwidth. According to the convolution-preservation theorem of the Fresnel transforms, the transfer matrices of MIMO-OCDM systems can be readily estimated at the receiver without any inter-antenna interference, even if the pilots overlap in both the time and frequency domains. The proposed algorithm avoids bandwidth waste in conventional channel estimators, in which silent pilots will be required in time and/or frequency to ensure the received MIMO pilots separable. We show that the proposed algorithm is unbiased for the unique OCDM pilots and has better estimate accuracy and system performance. Finally, analysis and numerical results are provided to validate its advantages as a promising algorithm for emerging wireless access technology based on MIMO-OCDM.}

We develop transmission scheduling policies to minimize the weighted sum average age of information (AoI) subject to transmission capacity and long-run average resource constraints. We formulate a stochastic control optimization problem and solve it using a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) approach and a drift-plus-penalty method. The CMDP problem is solved by transforming it into an MDP problem using the Lagrangian relaxation method. We theoretically analyze the structure of optimal policies for the MDP problem and subsequently propose a structure-aware algorithm that returns a practical near-optimal policy. Using the drift-plus-penalty method, we devise a near-optimal low-complexity policy that performs the scheduling decisions dynamically. We also develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning policy for which the Lyapunov optimization theory and a dueling double deep Q-network are employed. The complexities of the proposed policies are analyzed. Simulation results are provided to assess the performance of our policies and validate the theoretical results. The results show up to 91% performance improvement compared to a baseline policy.}

For arbitrary array geometry and under independent (possibly non-Gaussian) errors, the FP property is shown to hold for the perturbed array as long as it holds for the unperturbed one. This means that small errors do not have catastrophic impact on the FP, even for a large number of antennas. The negative impact of random errors is to slow down the convergence to the asymptotic value so that more antennas are needed under random errors to achieve the same low inter-user interference as without errors. For large but finite number of antennas, the distribution and an analytically-tractable approximation of the inter-user interference power are obtained. Practical design guidelines are given that quantify the accuracy level needed to make the impact of random errors negligible. The analytical results are validated via numerical simulations and are in agreement with measurement-based studies.}

	abstract = {Some emerging 5G and beyond use-cases impose stringent latency constraints, which necessitates a paradigm shift towards finite blocklength performance analysis. In contrast to Shannon capacity-achieving codes, the codeword length in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) is a critical design parameter that imposes an intricate tradeoff between delay, reliability, and information coding rate. In this context, this paper presents a novel mathematical analysis to characterize the performance of large-scale downlink networks using short codewords. Theoretical achievable rates, outage probability, and reliability expressions are derived using the finite blocklength coding theory in conjunction with stochastic geometry, and compared to the performance in the asymptotic regime (AR). Achievable rates under practical modulation schemes as well as multilevel polar coded modulation (MLPCM) are investigated. Numerical results provide theoretical performance benchmarks, highlight the potential of MLPCM in achieving close to optimal performance with short codewords, and confirm the discrepancy between the performance in the FBR and that predicted by analysis in the AR. Finally, the meta distribution of the coding rate is derived, providing the percentiles of users that achieve a predefined target rate in a network.}

This problem is hard to solve due to its nonconvexity and the existence of multiple quadratic constraints. Conventional methods to tackle this problem, such as the iterative weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) algorithm, typically consist of two nested loops and thus suffer from high computational complexity. By leveraging the inherent separability of the PAPC constraint set, we propose a low-complexity single-loop algorithm for solving the WSR maximization problem under PAPC, in which each updating step is done efficiently with closed form. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to stationary solutions. Then we extend the proposed algorithm to the multi-carrier scenario where the power constraints are shared over the subcarriers. Complexity analysis and numerical results show that the proposed single-loop algorithm maintains the same WSR performance as existing methods but dramatically reduces the computational complexity.}

	abstract = {The paper considers independent reinforcement learning (IRL) for multi-agent collaborative decision-making in the paradigm of federated learning (FL). However, FL generates excessive communication overheads between agents and a remote central server, especially when it involves a large number of agents or iterations. Besides, due to the heterogeneity of independent learning environments, multiple agents may undergo asynchronous Markov decision processes (MDPs), which will affect the training samples and the model’s convergence performance. On top of the variation-aware periodic averaging (VPA) method and the policy-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm (i.e., proximal policy optimization (PPO)), this paper proposes two advanced optimization schemes orienting to stochastic gradient descent (SGD): 1) A decay-based scheme gradually decays the weights of a model’s local gradients with the progress of successive local updates, and 2) By representing the agents as a graph, a consensus-based scheme studies the impact of exchanging a model’s local gradients among nearby agents from an algebraic connectivity perspective. This paper also provides novel convergence guarantees for both developed schemes, and demonstrates their superior effectiveness and efficiency in improving the system’s utility value through theoretical analyses and simulation results.}

Caching at the user equipment enables device-to-device (D2D) communications to be used to deliver requested contents which will help reduce data traffic at base stations and also enhance the achievable data rates. In this paper, we propose a system whereby users are able to exchange valuable cached content with each other via a D2D link which underlays the reception of a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) signal. We formulated a sum rate maximization problem that is subject to minimum rate constraints and derived optimal solutions depending on which user is the D2D transmitter. Additionally, sub-optimal solutions based on a negligible self-interference assumption are also proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gains of underlaid D2D communications as compared with optimal downlink cellular NOMA. Furthermore, results on the self-interference (SI) cancellation factor highlight that the sub-optimal power allocation solution offers sum rate performance close to the optimal case. The performance gains are further enhanced when SI cancellation is high.}

Given that the inference stage of GNNs can be naturally implemented in a decentralized manner, GNN is a potential enabler for decentralized control/management in the next-generation wireless communications. Privacy leakage, however, may occur due to the information exchanges among neighbors during decentralized inference with GNNs. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we analyze and enhance the privacy of decentralized inference with GNNs in wireless networks. Specifically, we adopt local differential privacy as the metric, and design novel privacy-preserving signals as well as privacy-guaranteed training algorithms to achieve privacy-preserving inference. We also define the SNR-privacy trade-off function to analyze the performance upper bound of decentralized inference with GNNs in wireless networks. To further enhance the communication and computation efficiency, we adopt the over-the-air computation technique and theoretically demonstrate its advantage in privacy preservation. Through extensive simulations on the synthetic graph data, we validate our theoretical analysis, verify the effectiveness of proposed privacy-preserving wireless signaling and privacy-guaranteed training algorithm, and offer some guidance on practical implementation.}

	abstract = {The design and development of sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) cellular systems entail the need for new channel models that can precisely predict channel characteristics beyond 100GHz in outdoor and dynamic environments. This work proposes a novel multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channel model for cellular communication, developed within the framework of a class of spatio-temporal stochastic processes called ambit-process. The modeling methodology effectively captures the typicalities of sub-THz propagation like molecular absorption and scattering of the evolving multipaths while accounting for the propagation delay of electromagnetic waves across large array apertures deployed at the transmitter and the receiver. This allows for an accurate characterization of the spatial-wideband effect along with other relevant spatio-temporal attributes of the channel. Numerical simulations indicate a good level of agreement between the spectral efficiency and spatio-temporal correlation of the proposed model against a state-of-the-art stochastic Terahertz (THz) channel model and measurements reported in the literature.}

	abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is leveraged to enhance the physical layer security of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in which the IRS is deployed to not only assist the downlink communication for multiple users, but also create a virtual line-of-sight (LoS) link for target sensing. In particular, we consider a challenging scenario where the target may be a suspicious eavesdropper that potentially intercepts the communication-user information transmitted by the base station (BS). To ensure the sensing quality while preventing the eavesdropping, dedicated sensing signals are transmitted by the BS. We investigate the joint design of the phase shifts at the IRS and the communication as well as radar beamformers at the BS to maximize the sensing beampattern gain towards the target, subject to the maximum information leakage to the eavesdropping target and the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) required by users. Based on the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) of all involved user links and the potential target location of interest at the BS, two scenarios are considered and two different optimization algorithms are proposed. For the ideal scenario where the CSI of the user links and the potential target location are perfectly known at the BS, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution. In particular, the beamformers are obtained with a semi-closed-form solution using Lagrange duality and the IRS phase shifts are solved for in closed form by applying the majorization-minimization (MM) method. On the other hand, for the more practical scenario where the CSI is imperfect and the potential target location is uncertain in a region of interest, a robust algorithm based on the \\cal S\n-procedure and sign-definiteness approaches is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving a trade-off between the communication quality and the sensing quality, and also show the tremendous potential of IRS for use in sensing and improving the security of ISAC systems.}

	abstract = {We exploit both covert communication and friendly jamming to propose a friendly jamming-assisted covert communication and use it to doubly secure a large-scale device-to-device (D2D) network against eavesdroppers (i.e., wardens). The D2D transmitters defend against the wardens by: 1) hiding their transmissions with enhanced covert communication, and 2) leveraging friendly jamming to ensure information secrecy even if the D2D transmissions are detected. We model the combat between the wardens and the D2D network (the transmitters and the friendly jammers) as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Therein, the wardens are the followers at the lower stage aiming to minimize their detection errors, and the D2D network is the leader at the upper stage aiming to maximize its utility (in terms of link reliability and communication security) subject to the constraint on communication covertness. We apply stochastic geometry to model the network spatial configuration so as to conduct a system-level study. We develop a bi-level optimization algorithm to search for the equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg game based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and Rosenbrock method. Numerical results reveal interesting insights. We observe that without the assistance from the jammers, it is difficult to achieve covert communication on D2D transmission. Moreover, we illustrate the advantages of the proposed friendly jamming-assisted covert communication by comparing it with the information-theoretical secrecy approach in terms of the secure communication probability and network utility.}

	abstract = {Due to the unique merits of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, they have already been harnessed for military, public, and civil applications. Time synchronization is a significant premise of formatting and applying UAV networks. However, the irregular high-speed mobile UAVs pose new challenges to time synchronization, especially when external time references are unavailable in some rigid scenarios. Therefore, in these harsh cases, self-time-synchronization (STS) without any external assistance should be concerned to overcome the relative velocity between UAVs caused by irregular high-speed motion. In this paper, a realistic timestamps model for the multi-UAV networks is established, and then a dynamic topology-based maximum likelihood estimator will be developed to carry out the STS. Furthermore, by introducing the information on frequency offset, a new estimator with the closed-form expression is proposed based on a two-way message exchange framework. After that, a tracking algorithm with the assistance of estimation results will be introduced to compensate for the time-varying change of the clock parameters for the dynamic topology UAV networks. To evaluate the performance of the estimator, both the estimation error and Cramér-Rao lower bound are analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits its superiority in STS performance and computational complexity compared to the existing two-way message exchange algorithm using timestamps only.}

	abstract = {Users in dynamic spectrum access (DSA) with federated reinforcement learning (FRL) autonomously access channels, avoiding centralized coordination and protecting users’ privacy. However, existing FRL-based DSA mechanisms are limited to ideal network states, i.e., assuming that channel states and users’ interference relationships are unchanged. Besides, users should upload intermediate results simultaneously for federated aggregation. The above conditions are impractical for mobile users since their network states and locations are unstable. Meanwhile, newly connected users have to train their models through local data with numerous computing resources since global models are unsuitable for them. We propose FRDSA, an FRL-based secure and lightweight channel selection mechanism in DSA for mobile users under dynamic network states. An independent channel selection environment with a virtual group strategy is presented to avoid interference between users under unstable channel states. Furthermore, an asynchronous parameter aggregation method in FRDSA dynamically adjusts the aggregation factors without users simultaneously uploading intermediate results. Simulations based on real trajectory data show that FRDSA significantly reduces approximately 60% interference between mobile users under unstable network states. Newly connected users can directly apply the well-trained global model to access channels autonomously instead of retraining a model, effectively reducing mobile users’ computing resource requirements.}

Each channel coherent time block consists of a channel training (CT) phase followed by a data transmission (DT) phase. During the CT phase, the UTs broadcast pilots to enable the BS to estimate the wireless channels, and the RIS manipulates the wireless environment so that the channel estimations obtained by the BS are incorrect. During the DT phase, the BS generates beamforming vectors, which are based on the channel estimations obtained during the CT phase, to transmit data to the UTs, and the RIS adopts a randomly time-varying reflection pattern to distort the signals received by the UTs. The mean square errors (MSEs) of the UTs are used as the performance metric, for which, analytical expressions are derived in large system limit. Based on the theoretic results, an efficient method is proposed to optimize the time-varying reflection pattern of the RIS to enhance the attack performance. Numerical simulations are presented to validate our theoretical results and to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed attack scheme over an existing attack scheme wherein the reflection pattern is time-invariant.}

The use of both location information and RIS beamwidth adaptation allows a significant reduction of beam training overhead. However, considering a trade-off between accuracy and beam training overhead, this may induce inaccurate channel estimation. Nevertheless, superior channel estimation performance is achieved by multi-dimensional ANM techniques, which have been shown to be effective in capturing cascaded structures such as the channel in RIS-aided systems. In the proposed work, a cascade of BS-to-RIS channel and RIS-to-BS channel is represented as a linear combination of either steering vectors, 2D steering vectors, or 3D steering vectors, and ANM with appropriate dimension is applied to estimate the channel. From simulation results, it has been demonstrated that location-aware channel estimation via 2D ANM and 3D ANM achieves excellent estimation accuracy along with a reduced beam training overhead.}

In such a network, the terrestrial network and satellite network are co-existing with a spectrum-sharing scheme in the presence of a multi-antenna jammer. We aim at maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing the terrestrial beamformers and IRS phase shifts while considering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of legitimate users. Different from the non-convex optimization techniques utilized in the IRS-related problem, a novel optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages both the robustness of model-free learning approaches and the efficiency of model-based optimization methods. In the optimization module of the proposed algorithm, we analyze the smart jammer under the unknown jamming model and derive a lower bound of the anti-jamming uncertainty, such that the IRS-aided anti-jamming problem can be solved by alteration method with second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the IRS can enhance the anti-jamming performance efficiently, and the proposed optimization-driven DRL algorithm can improve both the learning rate and the system performance compared with existing solutions.}

Considering fairness issue, we aim at maximizing the minimum throughput among GUs by jointly optimizing the UAV’s trajectory, transmit power and power allocation coefficient, under UAV mobility and covertness constraints. On the one hand, according to the covertness constraint, the maximal transmit power is characterized as a close form expression of UAV’s position. On the other hand, the optimal UAV trajectory structure is characterized as a successive-hover-and-fly (SHF) structure. Following the two fundamental characterizations, we first transform the original problem to a joint trajectory and power allocation design one and then it is reformulated to another one addressing only a limited number of hovering points, corresponding hovering durations, turning points and allocation coefficient. Although being still non-convex, the new problem is efficiently solved via applying the sequential convex programming (SCP) method. Namely, by introducing a series of tight concave function in each iteration, we can solve a series of convex problems iteratively to make the trajectory converge to a high-quality solution. Numerical results confirm the convergence of our approach and show the high performance comparing with benchmark.}

To improve the energy efficiency and information freshness, an earliest- \\ell partial relay selection scheme is proposed, in which the earliest \\ell relays that successfully receive the status update from the source will be selected to forward the status update to the destination, and the selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) schemes are used at the destination. Firstly, we investigate the update packet delivery schemes of source-relay (S-R) and relay-destination (R-D) links, and present the packet error probabilities under the SC and MRC schemes based on SPC theory. Secondly, after characterizing the full charge time durations of both the source and relay, we investigate the statistical description of the number of the packet transmission attempts from the source to relay as well as the one from the relay to destination by using order statistics. With the analysis of the evolution of the instantaneous age of information (AoI), the expression for average AoI is derived. Finally, we investigate the average AoI minimization, which is formulated as a coupled triplet problem of the packet lengths at the source and relays and the value of \\ell . To overcome the coupling, we present the convexity approximation of the average AoI as well as the concise proof. Then, an efficient gradient-based two-step optimal search algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem, which searches the local optimal packet lengths for S-R and R-D links by iteratively updating the value of \\ell until the global optimal objective parameters are found. Numerical analyses give the effect of the key parameters on the average AoI, and the comparison demonstrates that the proposed gradient-based method converges quickly than the conventional greedy search method.}

	abstract = {Existing device scheduling works in wireless federated learning (FL) mainly focused on selecting the devices with maximum gradient norm or loss function and require all devices to perform local training in each round. This may produce extra training costs and schedule devices with similar data statistics, thus degrading learning performance. To mitigate these problems, we first theoretically characterize the convergence behaviour of the considered FL system, finding that the learning performance is degraded by the difference between the aggregated gradient of scheduled devices and the full participation gradient. Inspired by this, we propose to find a subset of representative devices and the corresponding pre-device stepsizes to approximate the full participation aggregated gradient. Considering the limited wireless bandwidth, we formulate a problem to capture the trade-off between representativity and latency by optimizing device scheduling and bandwidth allocation policies. Our analysis reveals optimal bandwidth allocation is achieved when all scheduled devices have the same latency. Then, by proving the non-monotone submodularity of the problem, we develop a double greedy algorithm to solve the device scheduling policy. To avoid the local training of unscheduled devices, we utilize the historical gradient information of devices to estimate the current gradient for device scheduling design. Compared to existing scheduling algorithms, the proposed representativity-aware device scheduling algorithm improves 6.7% and 4.02% accuracies on two typical datasets under heterogeneous local data distributions, i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively. In addition, the proposed latency- and representativity-aware scheduling algorithm saves over 16% and 12% training time for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets than the scheduling algorithms based on either latency and representativity individually.}

Therefore, in this paper, for effective interference management, the power allocation problem is first formulated as a non-cooperative game with a pricing mechanism to imitate the interactions among users served by UAV-BSs. Then, based on the combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the game theory, the power allocation and the 3D deployment of UAV-BSs are transformed into a Markov decision problem. Finally, a novel price-based proximal policy optimization (3PO) algorithm is proposed to explore the optimal policy to maximize the system throughput. Simulation results reveal that the proposed 3PO algorithm can significantly improve system throughput and energy efficiency compared to other baselines by jointly optimizing power allocation and 3D deployment for UAV-BSs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the beam domain statistical channel state information (CSI) estimation for the two-dimensional (2D) beam-based statistical channel model (BSCM) in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The problem is to estimate the beam domain channel power matrices (BDCPMs) based on multiple received pilot signals. A received signal model showing the relation between the statistical properties of the received pilot signals and the BDCPMs is derived. On the basis of the received signal model, we formulate an optimization problem with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. By solving the optimization problem, a novel method to estimate the statistical CSI without the estimates of instantaneous CSI is proposed. We further reduce the complexity of the proposed method by utilizing the circulant structures of particular matrices in the algorithm. We also showed the generality of the proposed method by introducing another application, i.e., estimation of the angle domain channel power matrix. Simulation results show that the proposed method has good convergence and can obtain sparse BDCPMs. Compared with the regularized multiple measurement vector focal underdetermined system solver (RM-FOCUSS) algorithm, the proposed algorithm obtains overall more accurate statistical CSI with much lower complexity and brings significant performance gains when used in channel estimation.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) near-field beamforming (BF) design for Large Intelligent Surface (LIS). We firstly investigate the definitions of near-field and far-field of LIS, and derive the Fresnel near-field region where amplitudes variations are negligible but only phase variations worsen the harvested array-gains. We show that the Fresnel region which covers the majority part of near-field, can be enlarged by a factor of four when considering possible imperfectness from a conventional two-dimensional (2D) far-field BF. Therefore, it is of interest to design an analog 3D-BF that can recover array-gain losses in this region. Secondly, with a decomposition theorem we show that the optimal 3D-BF can be decomposed into a 2D far-field BF and a one-dimensional (1D) near-field BF. The 2D far-field BF compensates phase variations from mismatches in the azimuth and elevation angles, while the 1D near-field BF compensates remaining phases variations caused by distance differences from a user-equipment (UE) to different antenna-elements on LIS. Such a proposed “2D+1D” BF design reduces codebook-size significantly and is compatible with the existing far-field BF in the fifth-generation new-radio (5G-NR) system. Thirdly, we analyze an optimal codebook design for the 1D near-field BF, and show that with a small codebook it can perform close to optimal. Numerical results verify that the proposal is effective to recover array-gains in the near-field of LIS.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has been widely used in automatic modulation classification (AMC) recently. Most of deep learning-based AMC uses a single network model to deal with radio signals with a single input format. In this paper, we propose a hybrid heterogeneous modulation classification architecture named DeepSIG, which integrates Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in a single framework to process radio signals with heterogeneous input formats, i.e., in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) sequences, images mapped from IQ signals and graphs converted from IQ signals, to extract and integrate the features from different perspectives. A fusion training mechanism is presented to train DeepSIG. We use three different radio signal datasets for simulations. Results show that our proposed DeepSIG performs the best in terms of classification accuracy compared with the three methods with single input, i.e., sequence, image or graph. The performance gain is larger in few-shot scenarios.}

In terms of throughput performance, we derive a lower bound for the average sum-rate achievable with Gaussian signaling inputs and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding based on Bussgang decomposition. By diagonal approximation, we derive an approximate, yet accurate, model for the distortion caused by uniform polar quantization, which can be used to evaluate the corresponding sum-rate in closed form. To assess the power efficiency, we provide power consumption models with realistic parameters and values for the quantized polar and Cartesian transmitters, based on state-of-the-art integrated circuit (IC) designs and measurements. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed quantized polar transmitter can enable excellent performance in terms of average sum-rate, symbol error rate (SER), and out-of-band (OOB) emission level, compared to the Cartesian architecture. Furthermore, the power consumption comparisons show that the digital polar transmitter can save more than 36% in the energy consumption under 64-antenna setting in typical 5G enhanced mobile broadband use cases, thus making it highly appealing for future power-efficient massive MIMO transmitter implementations.}

	abstract = {Due to the open communications environment in wireless channels, wireless networks are vulnerable to jamming attacks. However, existing approaches for jamming rely on knowledge of the legitimate users’ (LUs’) channels, extra jamming power, or both. To raise concerns about the potential threats posed by illegitimate intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), we propose an alternative method to launch jamming attacks on LUs without either LU channel state information (CSI) or jamming power. The proposed approach employs an adversarial IRS with random phase shifts, referred to as a “disco” IRS (DIRS), that acts like a “disco ball” to actively age the LUs’ channels. Such active channel aging (ACA) interference can be used to launch jamming attacks on multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. The proposed DIRS-based fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can jam LUs with no additional jamming power or knowledge of the LU CSI, and it can not be mitigated by classical anti-jamming approaches. A theoretical analysis of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ that provides an evaluation of the DIRS-based jamming attacks is derived. Based on this detailed theoretical analysis, some unique properties of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ can be obtained. Furthermore, a design example of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ based on one-bit quantization of the IRS phases is demonstrated to be sufficient for implementing the jamming attack. In addition, numerical results are provided to show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical analysis and the jamming impact of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ.}

	abstract = {We investigate signal detection in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with hardware impairments, such as power amplifier nonlinearity and in-phase/ quadrature imbalance. To deal with the complex combined effects of hardware imperfections, neural network (NN) techniques, in particular deep neural networks (DNNs), have been studied to directly compensate for the impact of hardware impairments. However, it is difficult to train a DNN with limited pilot signals, hindering its practical application. In this work, we investigate how to achieve efficient Bayesian signal detection in MIMO systems with hardware imperfections. Characterizing combined hardware imperfections often leads to complicated signal models, making Bayesian signal detection challenging. To address this issue, we first train an NN to ‘model’ the MIMO system with hardware imperfections and then perform Bayesian inference based on the trained NN. Modelling the MIMO system with NN enables the design of NN architectures based on the signal flow of the MIMO system, minimizing the number of NN layers and parameters, which is crucial to achieving efficient training with limited pilot signals. We then represent the trained NN with a factor graph, and design an efficient message passing based Bayesian signal detector, leveraging the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm. The implementation of a turbo receiver with the proposed Bayesian detector is also investigated. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique delivers remarkably better performance than state-of-the-art methods.}

In this study, we construct a three-tier cloud-edge integration network, where user tasks are offloaded to satellite based edge server and further to the remote ground cloud server via backhaul links. The optimization problem is modeled for minimizing system energy consumption and considers user association, power allocation, task scheduling, and bandwidth assignment jointly.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles mounted aerial base stations (ABSs) are capable of providing on-demand coverage in next-generation mobile communication system. However, resource allocation for ABSs to provide continuous coverage is challenging, since the high dynamic of ABSs and time-varying air-to-ground channel would result in channel state information (CSI) mismatch between resource allocation decision and implementation. In consequence, the coverage of ABSs is discontinuous in spatial-temporal dimensions, i.e., the variance of user rate between adjacent time slots is large. To ensure the coverage continuity, we design a resource allocation method based on deep reinforcement learning (RDRL). Capable of adaptively tuning neural network structures, RDRL could satisfy coverage requirements by jointly allocating subchannels and power for ground users. Meanwhile, the temporal channel correlation is taken into account in the design of reward function in RDRL, which aims to alleviate the influence of CSI mismatch between method decision and implementation. Moreover, RDRL can apply a pre-trained model of previous coverage requirement to current requirement to reduce computation complexity. Experimental results show that the rate variance of RDRL can be reduced by 66.7% and spectral efficiency of RDRL can be increased by 34.7% compared with benchmark algorithms, which ensures the coverage continuity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a semantic communication framework for image data transmission is developed. In the investigated framework, a set of servers cooperatively transmit image data to a set of users utilizing semantic communication techniques, which enable servers to transmit only the semantic information that accurately captures the meaning of images. To evaluate the performance of studied semantic communication system, a multimodal metric called image-to-graph semantic similarity (ISS) is proposed to measure the correlation between the extracted semantic information and the original image. To meet the ISS requirement of each user, each server must jointly determine the semantic information to be transmitted and the resource blocks (RBs) used for semantic information transmission. Due to the co-channel interference among users associated with different servers, each server must cooperate with other servers to find a globally optimal semantic oriented RB allocation. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the sum of the average transmission latency of each server while reaching the ISS requirement. To solve this problem, we propose a value decomposition based entropy-maximized multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The proposed algorithm enables each server to coordinate with other servers in training stage and execute RB allocation in a distributed manner to approach to a globally optimal performance with less training iterations. Compared to traditional multi-agent RL algorithms, the proposed RL framework improves the exploration of valuable action of servers and the probability of finding a globally optimal RB allocation policy based on local observation of wireless and semantic communication environments. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the transmission delay by up to 16.1% and improve the convergence speed by up to 100% compared to the traditional multi-agent RL algorithms.}

This paper studies the downlink transmission of IRS-assisted NOMA communication, considering the practical case of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Aiming to maximize the system sum rate, a robust IRS-aided NOMA design is proposed to jointly find the optimal beamforming vector for the access point and the passive reflection matrix for the IRS. This robust design is realised using the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) scheme, and it is shown that the results have a close performance to their upper bound obtained from the corresponding perfect CSI scenario. The presented method is compatible with both continuous and discrete phase shift elements of the IRS. Our findings show that the proposed algorithms, for both continuous and discrete IRS, have low computational complexity compared to other schemes in the literature. Furthermore, we conduct a performance comparison between the IRS-aided NOMA and the IRS-aided orthogonal multiple access (OMA). This comparison shows that robust beamforming techniques are crucial for the system to reap the advantages of IRS-aided NOMA communication in the presence of CSI uncertainty.}

Tracking these beams from multiple cells can increase power consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore, a mobile needs to selectively and smartly track beams under power/overhead constraints. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based, selective link tracking approach. These approaches are developed for both fixed and adaptive power/overhead constraints, which also predict the magnitude of the best performing beam. The algorithms are validated in simulations of a \\mathrm {28 GHz} 5G New Radio (NR)-like system in an urban area with realistic navigation routes utilizing detailed ray-tracing. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classic and deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches in terms of tracking accuracy, power saving and overhead for both analog and digital beamforming architectures. We also argue that the prediction of the proposed method can be easily performed on a digital signal processor of a modern chipset with minimal resource consumption.}

An ideal beam alignment technique should achieve high beamforming gain with low latency, scale well to systems with higher carrier frequencies, larger antenna arrays and multiple user equipment, and not require hard-to-obtain context information. These qualities are collectively lacking in existing methods. We depart from the conventional codebook-based (CB) approach where the optimal beam is chosen from quantized codebooks and instead propose a grid-free beam alignment method that directly synthesizes the transmit and receive beams from the continuous search space using measurements from a few site-specific probing beams found via a deep learning pipeline. In realistic settings, the proposed method achieves a far superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-latency trade-off compared to the CB baselines: it aligns near-optimal beams 100x faster or equivalently finds beams with 10–15 dB higher average SNR in the same number of searches, relative to an exhaustive search over a conventional codebook.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been considered as one of the most promising candidates to support reliable data transmission especially in high-mobility networks, wherein the performance of communications strongly relies on timely and accurate tracking of the relevant user state parameters. In this context, the problem of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) assisted user state refinement is addressed in the framework of OTFS systems. In particular, by exploiting the initial yet coarse angle estimate provided by the typical codebook-based user state sensing algorithm, we judiciously design a hybrid digital-analog architecture to output the nested array structured low dimensional observations. In this way, the corresponding nested array based technique is employed to perform angle refinement by fully utilizing the degrees of freedom provided by the measurements. Next, based on the refined angle estimate, we develop a two-stage joint delay and Doppler shifts estimation scheme to update the corresponding coarse estimates. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios, showing that our well designed user state refinement scheme is able to improve the performance of the considered ISAC-assisted OTFS systems in term of both radar and communication metrics.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal-time-frequency-space (OTFS) has been developed as a promising modulation scheme for high Doppler channels. In OTFS systems, channel estimation (CE) plays a key role. Most existing CE schemes put pilots in delay-Doppler (DD)-domain, often resulting in low spectrum efficiency and high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we propose three schemes to solve the problems. Proposed methods have distinct features being able to estimate fractional delays and fractional Dopplers. Different from existing methods, our approach places pilots in time-frequency (TF)-domain. The first scheme overlaps pilots and data in both TF- and DD-domain, while Scheme II overlaps them in TF- but not in DD-domain. To further enhance the performance, the third scheme makes pilots and data non-overlapped in both TF- and DD-domain. To conduct CE, time-domain pilot signals are extracted with a filtering operation and a two-dimensional frequency estimation problem is formulated consequently. Delays are first estimated with root-MUSIC. Then, Dopplers are estimated using a simple line-fitting method. Finally, channel gains are estimated by a least-squares method. To solve the interference between pilots and data, successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) is also applied. With the estimated channel, a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) equalizer is used for the compensation of channel effect. Simulation results show that the bit-error-rate (BER) performance with the channel estimated by proposed CE methods can approach to that with known channel. Also, spectrum efficiency can be improved by at most 25% and PAPR can be reduced by at least 19 dB.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) cooperative channel model for sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. In the proposed multi-UAV cooperative channel model, the channel impulse response (CIR) of sub-channel between each UAV and ground station (GS) is calculated, including line-of-sight (LoS), non-LoS (NLoS), as well as ground reflection transmissions. The relative distance and transmission relationship among sub-channels between multi-UAVs and GS are further modeled and analyzed. To simultaneously capture the cooperative non-stationarity of multi-UAV cooperative channels in space and time domains, a novel cooperation-based space-time (S-T) non-stationary algorithm is developed based on the birth-death (BD) process for the first time. Meanwhile, the UAV-related parameters, e.g., the height and 3D movement of UAVs, are considered. Some important channel statistical properties, such as space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), cooperative time stationary interval, and singular value spread (SVS), are obtained. Based on the simulation results, multi-UAV cooperative channel statistical properties are analyzed. Finally, the simulation results match well with the ray-tracing results, which validates the accuracy of the proposed multi-UAV channel model.}

	abstract = {In order to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) in multicarrier-division duplex (MDD) enabled cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO), a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN), referred to as CF-HGNN, is specifically introduced to optimize the power allocation (PA). To efficiently manage the interference invoked, a meta-path based mechanism is applied in CF-HGNN to enable individual access point (AP) and mobile station (MS) nodes to aggregate information from the interfering and communication paths with different priorities during message passing. Moreover, the proposed CF-HGNN employs the adaptive node embedding layer and adaptive output layer to make it scalable to the various numbers of APs, MSs and subcarriers. For comparison, a quadratic transform and successive convex approximation (QT-SCA) algorithm is proposed to solve the PA problem in classic way. Numerical results show that CF-HGNN is capable of achieving 99% of the SE achievable by QT-SCA but using only 10−4 times of its operation time, and it can outperform the conventional learning-based and greedy unfair methods in terms of SE performance. Furthermore, CF-HGNN exhibits good scalability to the CF networks with various numbers of nodes and subcarriers, and also to the large-scale CF networks when assisted by user-centric clustering.}

	abstract = {The application of network non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) technique to coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems has attracted significant attention due to its superior capability to improve connectivity and maintain reliable transmission for CoMP users simultaneously. Based on the concept of quasi-degraded channel for N-NOMA, this paper studies the precoding design for downlink N-NOMA scenarios with two base stations (BSs) equipped with multiple antennas. In specific, under quasi-degraded channels, simple linear precoding based N-NOMA can achieve the same minimal total transmission power as theoretically optimal but complicated dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme, when the users’ target rates and minimal transmission power of each BS are given. In this paper, the channel quasi-degradation (QD) condition is first rigorously derived for the scenario with single CoMP user and two NOMA users. The closed-form optimal precoders for N-NOMA under quasi-degraded channels are also provided. Then, based on QD condition, a novel hybrid N-NOMA (H-N-NOMA) scheme is proposed, which is a mixture of N-NOMA and conventional zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) scheme. Further, for the scenarios with more users, a low-complexity QD based user pairing (QDUP) algorithm is proposed, which is then combined with H-N-NOMA to make a novel scheme termed H-N-NOMA/QDUP into being. Numerical results are presented to reveal the impact factors on QD channels, and also demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed H-N-NOMA/QDUP scheme. It is shown that the proposed H-N-NOMA/QDUP scheme can effectively exploit the benefit of multi user diversity.}

	abstract = {Recent efforts have promoted programmable wireless environments (PWEs) to enhance the reception quality in high-frequency bands via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, relevant research efforts are limited to setups with stationary users. This paper shows that crowd mobility in indoor PWEs induces spatio-temporal shadows on the surfaces, resulting in spatio-temporal sparsity in channel gains due to signal blockages. This overlooked aspect impacts the operation strategy of PWEs as the shadowed RIS tiles would contribute to the overheads while offering almost no improvement to the reception quality. Hence, this paper proposes an optimal strategy that excludes the shadowed tiles, which maximizes the utilization efficiency of RISs while minimizing the overheads. Since signal blockage is tied with the details of user mobility, a general model does not exist to identify such shadowed tiles for exclusion. Hence, we follow a data-driven approach that capitalizes on a realistic indoor mobility model and ray-tracing to generate the channel data. However, conventional ray-tracing presents high complexity that hinders data generation. So, we propose an approach to identify the shadow regions with a nine-order of magnitude reduction in complexity to efficiently generate the channel data. Furthermore, we present two exclusion strategies that offer guaranteed and best-effort quality-of-service support, and each can identify the tiles to be excluded via a search method with a complexity of \\mathcal {O}(N) for N tiles. The results indicate that the proposed strategies reduce the overheads by 45-50\\% while maintaining optimal service quality in various environments, operation frequencies, and user and access point density.}

	abstract = {According to whether a connection to the receiver is established before data transmission, random access schemes can be divided into two categories: connection-based and connection-free. For cellular networks, its connection-based access mechanism has been heavily criticized for being ill-suited to Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. With the existing studies overwhelmingly focusing on the physical-layer transmission and detection design of various connection-free access schemes, less attention has been paid to the fundamental understanding of when connection establishment could be beneficial. The challenge originates from the lack of proper modeling of connection-based random access. In this paper, a scalable model that incorporates each node’s queueing behavior is proposed for connection-based slotted Aloha, based on which both the data throughput and the mean queueing delay of data packets are characterized, optimized, and compared with those for connection-free slotted Aloha. Conditions for beneficial connection establishment in terms of the optimal throughput and queueing delay performance are discussed and applied to cellular networks with the newly introduced Random Access-based Small Data Transmission (RA-SDT) schemes. The analysis offers important insights for the optimal access design of M2M communications.}

There are several network infrastructure setups that can be used for BC with IoT nodes. One of them is the bistatic setup where typically there is a need for high dynamic range and high-resolution analog-to-digital converters at the reader. In this paper, we investigate a bistatic BC setup with multiple antennas. We propose a novel transmission scheme, which includes a protocol for channel estimation at the carrier emitter (CE) as well as a transmit beamformer construction that suppresses the direct link interference between the two ends of a bistatic link (namely CE and reader), and increases the detection performance of the backscatter device (BD) symbol. Further, we derive a generalized log-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to detect the symbol/presence of the BD. We also provide an iterative algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters in the GLRT. Finally, simulation results show that the required dynamic range of the system is significantly decreased, and the detection performance of the BD symbol is increased, by the proposed algorithm compared to a system not using beamforming at the CE.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) allow controlling the propagation environment in wireless networks by tuning multiple reflecting elements. RISs have been traditionally realized through single connected architectures, mathematically characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix. Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as a novel branch of RISs whose scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal, which creates new benefits and opportunities for RISs. Efficient BD-RIS architectures have been realized based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, a closed-form solution for the global optimal scattering matrix of these architectures is not yet available. In this paper, we provide such a closed-form solution proving that the theoretical performance upper bounds can be exactly achieved for any channel realization. We first consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems aided by a BD-RIS working in reflective or transmissive mode. Then, we extend our solution to single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. We show that our algorithm is less complex than the iterative optimization algorithms employed in the previous literature. The complexity of our algorithm grows linearly (resp. cubically) with the number of RIS elements in the case of group (resp. fully) connected architectures.}

	abstract = {We propose a federated learning (FL) in stratosphere (FLSTRA) system, where a high altitude platform station (HAPS) facilitates a large number of terrestrial clients to collaboratively learn a global model without sharing the training data. FLSTRA overcomes the challenges faced by FL in terrestrial networks, such as slow convergence and high communication delay due to limited client participation and multi-hop communications. HAPS leverages its altitude and size to allow the participation of more clients with line-of-sight (LOS) links and the placement of a powerful server. However, handling many clients at once introduces computing and transmission delays. Thus, we aim to obtain a delay-accuracy trade-off for FLSTRA. Specifically, we first develop a joint client selection and resource allocation algorithm for uplink and downlink to minimize the FL delay subject to the energy and quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Second, we propose a communication and computation resource-aware (CCRA-FL) algorithm to achieve the target FL accuracy while deriving an upper bound for its convergence rate. The formulated problem is non-convex; thus, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FLSTRA system, compared to terrestrial benchmarks, in terms of FL delay and accuracy.}

The proposed algorithm jointly performs data association, sequential estimation of a mobile agent position, and adapts all relevant model parameters. We derive a novel non-uniform false alarm (FA) model that captures the delay and amplitude statistics of the multipath radio channel. This model enables the algorithm to indirectly exploit position-related information contained in the multipath components (MPCs) for the estimation of the agent position without using any prior information such as floorplan information or training data. Using simulated and real measurements in different channel conditions, we demonstrate that the algorithm can provide high-accuracy position estimates even in fully obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) situations and show that the performance of our algorithm constantly attains the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (P-CRLB), facilitating the additional information contained in the presented FA model. The algorithm is shown to provide robust estimates in both, dense multipath channels as well as channels showing specular, resolved MPCs, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art radio-based localization methods.}

In particular, the maximum number of deployable sensors is obtained in the closed-form expressions, where the maximum number of sensors is revealed to be only relevant to the QoS requirements of communications. 2) For the multi-user case with the variable number of sensors, an extended CRB (ECRB) metric is proposed to characterize the impact of the number of sensors on the sensing performance. A generic decoupling approach is proposed to convexify the non-convex ECRB expression. Based on this, a novel penalty-based double-loop (PDL) algorithm is proposed.

The innovation of using a smart combination of those modulation formats is based on the exploitation of specific features of the different approaches. In particular, we combine time, amplitude and frequency features to enhance the robustness of the system, without sacrificing the data rate performance as for coded systems. The major implication of such approach is twofold. In this way, we grant a constant illumination level per symbol and, moreover, we outperform in terms of reliability coded modulations for the same level of spectral efficiency. Theoretical results, validated through experimental evaluations, demonstrate that the combined approach achieves very good performance.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) has been recently considered as a promising technique for beyond 5G systems. In ISCC systems, the competition for communication and computation resources between sensing tasks for ambient intelligence and computation tasks from mobile devices becomes an increasingly challenging issue. To address it, we first propose an efficient sensing framework with a novel action detection module. In this module, a threshold is used for detecting whether the sensing target is static and thus the overhead can be reduced. Subsequently, we mathematically analyze the sensing performance of the proposed framework and theoretically prove its effectiveness with the help of the sampling theorem. Based on sensing performance models, we formulate a sensing performance maximization problem while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of tasks. To solve it, we propose an optimal resource allocation strategy, in which the minimum resource is allocated to computation tasks, and the rest is devoted to the sensing task. Besides, a threshold selection policy is derived and the results further demonstrate the necessity of the proposed sensing framework. Finally, a real-world test of action recognition tasks based on USRP B210 is conducted to verify the sensing performance analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance improvement of our proposal by comparing it with some benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) is a promising solution to achieve high spectrum- and energy-efficiency due to its spectrum sharing and low-power consumption properties, in which the secondary system achieves data transmissions by backscattering the signal originating from the primary system. In this paper, we are interested in the pilot design and signal detection when the primary transmission adopts orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In particular, to preserve the channel orthogonality among the OFDM sub-carriers, each secondary symbol is designed to span an entire OFDM symbol. The comb-type pilot structure is employed by the primary transmission, while the preamble pilot structure is used by the secondary transmission. With the designed pilot structures, the primary signal can be detected via the conventional methods by treating the secondary signal as a part of the composite channel, i.e., the effective channel of the primary transmission. Furthermore, the secondary signal can be extracted from the estimated composite channel with the help of the detected primary signal. The bit error rate (BER) performance with both perfect and estimated CSI, the diversity orders of the primary and secondary transmissions, and the sensitivity to symbol synchronization error are analyzed. Simulation results show that the performance of the primary transmission is enhanced thanks to the backscatter link established by the secondary transmission. More importantly, even without the direct link, the primary and secondary transmissions can be supported via only the backscatter link.}

An optimal communication receiver based on integer programming is proposed to handle any subset of permutations followed by a more efficient sub-optimal receiver based on the Hungarian algorithm. Considering optimal maximum likelihood detection, the block error rate is analyzed under both additive white Gaussian noise and correlated Rician fading. We propose two methods to select a permutation subset with an improved block error rate and an efficient encoding scheme to map the information symbols to selected permutations under these subsets. From the radar perspective, the ambiguity function is analyzed with regards to the local and the global accuracy of target detection. Furthermore, a subset selection method to reduce peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) is proposed by extending the properties of Costas arrays. Finally, the process of remapping the frequency tones to the symbol set used to generate permutations is introduced as a method to improve both the communication and radar performances of the selected permutation subset.}

	abstract = {One of the main challenges of popularizing the integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) network is mutual interference between the two functions. A viable solution is the time division scheme where communication and sensing are separated in time domain. This paper considers a multi-cluster ISAC network model, where the time-domain radio resources are allocated to sensing and communication. At the same time, the time resources can be reused in space-domain. Particularly, the terminals in different work phases can access radio resources of different or the same clusters simultaneously, depending on interference. In this way, the interference is isolated while the resources utilization is improved. Two different resource allocation approaches are proposed according to how interference is considered. The aim is to maximize the sensing detection probability under the constraint of network throughput. The performance improvement in terms of target detection probability brought by the proposed schemes is shown by numerical results compared with benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a huge demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in wireless edge networks to assist individuals with real-time services. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a suitable and appealing distributed learning paradigm to deploy these applications at the network edge. Despite the many successful efforts made to apply FL to wireless edge networks, the adopted algorithms mostly follow the same spirit as FedAvg, thereby heavily suffering from the practical challenges of label deficiency and device heterogeneity. These challenges not only decelerate the model training in FL but also downgrade the application performance. In this paper, we focus on the algorithm design and address these challenges by investigating the personalized semi-supervised FL problem and proposing an effective algorithm, named FedCPSL. In particular, the techniques of pseudo-labeling, and interpolation-based model personalization are judiciously combined to provide a new problem formulation for personalized semi-supervised FL. The proposed FedCPSL algorithm employs novel strategies, including adaptive client variance reduction, local momentum, and normalized global aggregation, to combat the challenge of device heterogeneity and boost algorithm convergence. The convergence property of FedCPSL is also thoroughly analyzed and shows that FedCPSL is resilient to both statistical and system heterogeneity, obtaining a sublinear convergence rate. Experimental results on image classification tasks are presented to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms its counterparts in terms of both convergence speed and application performance.}

The proposed channel model consists of a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) both equipped with uniform linear arrays (ULAs), and an IRS is used to enable communications between the transmitter and the receiver through the line-of-sight (LoS) links seen by the IRS. When modeling the reflection of electromagnetic waves at the IRS, we take into account the curvature of the wavefront on different reflecting elements. Based on the established channel model, we show that an IRS-assisted MIMO channel is able to support spatial multiplexing solely by the cascaded LoS links. We generalize the notion of Rayleigh distance originally coined for the single-hop MIMO channel to full multiplexing region (FMR) for the cascaded LoS MIMO channel, where the FMR is the union of all the Tx-IRS and IRS-Rx distance pairs that enable full multiplexing communication. We derive an inner bound of the FMR under a special passive beamforming (PB) strategy named reflective focusing, and provide the corresponding orientation settings of the antenna arrays that achieve full multiplexing.}

	abstract = {Hybrid beamforming has been widely considered in millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which can greatly reduce power consumption and hardware cost of data paths. Compared to the fully-connected hybrid beamforming architecture, the sub-connected architecture is more practical for its reduced complexity. However, optimal precoding design for the sub-connected architecture is not straightforward due to the specific block-diagonal structure of analog phase shifter network. Algorithms on fully-digital or fully-connected hybrid beamforming architecture cannot be directly applied to sub-connected architecture. Meanwhile, most existing precoding algorithms in such case can only solve the approximate problem, which results in significant performance loss. In this paper, we study the sum rate maximization problem in the sub-connected architecture. We first relax the objective function and derive a relaxed upper bound of the original problem. Then we propose an algorithm to solve the original problem with a local-optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed local-optimal algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms with better sum rate and energy efficiency performance. Besides, the proposed algorithm also converges quickly and is robust.}

	abstract = {5G/B5G networks are expected to deliver huge traffic and support various use cases with diverse requirements. With the increasing demand for network capacity, a cost-effective and flexible RAN is urgently needed to provide customized services for users. On this basis, advanced flexible RAN architectures with functional splits are introduced. In this paper, we study the slice-centric fine-grained functional split and resource allocation problem in flexible RAN. We first formulate a multi-objective problem to jointly optimize the functional split selection, processing, and transmission resource allocation for slices, aiming at maximizing the functional split gain while satisfying slices’ requirements. Since a multi-objective problem may have multiple Pareto optimal solutions and is difficult to solve, we mathematically analyze and transform the problem into an equivalent parametric convex problem. Then, we propose an upper bound algorithm and a dual based resource allocation algorithm to find the solution for the optimization problem. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively solve the functional split gain maximization problem and obtain a trade-off between processing and transmission resource gain. In addition, the proposed algorithms also outperform other benchmark approaches in terms of resource saving and flexibility.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables mobile devices to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping data locally. However, there are two major research challenges to practically deploy FL over mobile devices: (i) frequent wireless updates of huge size gradients v.s. limited spectrum resources, and (ii) energy-hungry FL communication and local computing during training v.s. battery-constrained mobile devices. To address those challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-bit over-the-air computation (M-AirComp) approach for spectrum-efficient aggregation of local model updates in FL and further present an energy-efficient FL design for mobile devices. Specifically, a high-precision digital modulation scheme is designed and incorporated in the M-AirComp, allowing mobile devices to upload model updates at the selected positions simultaneously in the multi-access channel. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of our FL algorithm. Guided by FL convergence analysis, we formulate a joint transmission probability and local computing control optimization, aiming to minimize the overall energy consumption (i.e., iterative local computing + multi-round communications) of mobile devices in FL. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing ones in terms of spectrum utilization, energy efficiency, and learning accuracy.}

First, we provide a performance analytical framework for the system with the linear decorrelator and study the impact of hardware impairments (HIs) at transceivers on the uplink SE. Based on that, we discuss the local minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) and partial MMSE combining schemes and the partial large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) method from a scalable point of view. Besides, the exact closed-form SE expression is derived with maximum ratio combining (MRC). Then, we study the MMSE-based successive interference cancelation (MMSE-SIC) detector and give an approximate closed-form SE expression with MRC. In the simulations, we compare the linear decorrelator to the MMSE-SIC detector under different hardware-impaired scenarios. Numerical results correspond to the theoretical analyses and show that the impact of HIs can be mitigated by adding the number of receive antennas.}

	abstract = {Due to the high flexibility and mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as aerial relays touring to serve ground users (GUs), especially when the ground base station is temporally damaged. However, the broadcasting nature of wireless channels makes such communication vulnerable to be wiretapped by malicious eavesdropping users (EUs). Besides the collecting offloading data for legitimate GUs, UAVs are also expected to be friendly jammers, i.e., generating artificial noise (AN) to deteriorate the wiretapping of EUs. With this in mind, a novel role switching scheme (RSS) is proposed in the paper to guarantee the secure communication by the cooperation of multiple UAVs, where each UAV is allowed to switch its role as a collector or a jammer autonomously to explore a wider trajectory space. It’s worthy to be noticed that the joint optimization for the trajectory of UAVs and the transmission power of GUs and UAVs with role switching scheme is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Since the relaxation of binary variables will lead the solution dropping into local minimum, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined successive convex approximate (SCA) algorithm is further designed to maximize the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of GUs. Numerical results illustrate that compared with the role fixed scheme (RFS) and relaxation based SCA approaches, the proposed DRL-SCA algorithm endows UAVs the capacity to fly close enough to target users (both GUs and EUs) with less moving distance which brings better ASR and less energy consumption.}

To enhance the system’s information timeliness with high energy efficiency, we define a novel performance metric, i.e., age-energy efficiency (AEE), which depicts the achievable AoI gain per unit energy consumption. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system long-term AEE by jointly optimizing the IIoEDs scheduling and the HAP’s transmit power. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem and the intractable challenges with discrete binary variables, we first model the problem as a two-stage discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) with carefully designed state spaces, action spaces, and reward functions. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to find the effective scheduling strategy and transmit power. To improve the accuracy of the learned policy, we design a dual-layer deep Q-network (DLDQN) algorithm with fast convergence. Simulation results show that our proposed DLDQN algorithm can improve the AEE by at least 25% when the number of IIoEDs exceeds 50 compared with benchmarks. Moreover, with the proposed DLDQN algorithm, the system long-term AEE can be improved with the increase of the number of IIoEDs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation scheme for pulse-shaped multicarrier systems using smoothness regularization for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). It can be applied to any multicarrier system with or without linear precoding to estimate challenging doublydispersive channels. A recently proposed modulation scheme using orthogonal precoding is orthogonal time-frequency and space modulation (OTFS). In OTFS, pilot and data symbols are placed in delay-Doppler (DD) domain and are jointly precoded to the time-frequency (TF) domain. On the one hand, such orthogonal precoding increases the achievable channel estimation accuracy and enables high TF diversity at the receiver. On the other hand, it introduces leakage effects which requires extensive leakage suppression when the piloting is jointly precoded with the data. To avoid this, we propose to precode the data symbols only, place pilot symbols without precoding into the TF domain, and estimate the channel coefficients by interpolating smooth functions from the pilot samples. Furthermore, we present a piloting scheme enabling a smooth control of the number and position of the pilot symbols. Our numerical results suggest that the proposed scheme provides accurate channel estimation with reduced signaling overhead compared to standard estimators using Wiener filtering in the discrete DD domain.}

	abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of smart devices in wireless networks, more powerful technologies are expected to fulfill the network requirements of high throughput, massive connectivity, and diversify quality of service. To this end, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is proposed as a promising solution to improve spectral efficiency and provide better fairness for the next-generation mobile networks. In this paper, the outage performance of uplink RSMA transmission with randomly deployed users is investigated, taking both user scheduling schemes and power allocation strategies into consideration. Specifically, the greedy user scheduling (GUS) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) based user scheduling (CUS) schemes are considered, which could maximize the rate performance and guarantee scheduling fairness, respectively. Meanwhile, we re-investigate cognitive power allocation (CPA) strategy, and propose a new rate fairness-oriented power allocation (FPA) strategy to enhance the scheduled users’ rate fairness. By employing order statistics and stochastic geometry, an analytical expression of the outage probability for each scheduling scheme combining power allocation is derived to characterize the performance. To get more insights, the achieved diversity order of each scheme is also derived. Theoretical results demonstrate that both GUS and CUS schemes applying CPA or FPA strategy can achieve full diversity orders, and the application of CPA strategy in RSMA can effectively eliminate the secondary user’s diversity order constraint from the primary user. Simulation results corroborate the accuracy of the analytical expressions, and show that the proposed FPA strategy can achieve excellent rate fairness performance in high signal-to-noise ratio region.}

	abstract = {Vertical federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning framework that enables devices to learn a global model from the feature-partition datasets without sharing local raw data. However, as the number of the local intermediate outputs is proportional to the training samples, it is critical to develop communication-efficient techniques for wireless vertical FL to support high-dimensional model aggregation with full device participation. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) based vertical FL system to enable fast and accurate model aggregation by leveraging over-the-air computation (AirComp) and alleviating communication straggler issue with cooperative model aggregation among geographically distributed edge servers. However, the model aggregation error caused by AirComp and quantization errors caused by the limited fronthaul capacity degrade the learning performance for vertical FL. To address these issues, we characterize the convergence behavior of the vertical FL algorithm considering both uplink and downlink transmissions. To improve the learning performance, we establish a system optimization framework by joint transceiver and fronthaul quantization design, for which successive convex approximation and alternate convex search based system optimization algorithms are developed. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system architecture and optimization framework for vertical FL.}

	abstract = {We study the problem of unsourced random access (URA) over Rayleigh block-fading channels with a receiver equipped with multiple antennas. We propose a slotted structure with multiple stages of orthogonal pilots, each of which is randomly picked from a codebook. In the proposed signaling structure, each user encodes its message using a polar code and appends it to the selected pilot sequences to construct its transmitted signal. Accordingly, the transmitted signal is composed of multiple orthogonal pilot parts and a polar-coded part, which is sent through a randomly selected slot. The performance of the proposed scheme is further improved by randomly dividing users into different groups each having a unique interleaver-power pair. We also apply the idea of multiple stages of orthogonal pilots to the case of a single receive antenna. In all the set-ups, we use an iterative approach for decoding the transmitted messages along with a suitable successive interference cancellation technique. The use of orthogonal pilots and the slotted structure lead to improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity in the proposed set-ups, and make the implementation with short blocklengths more viable. Performance of the proposed set-ups is illustrated via extensive simulation results which show that the proposed set-ups with multiple antennas perform better than the existing MIMO URA solutions for both short and large blocklengths, and that the proposed single-antenna set-ups are superior to the existing single-antenna URA schemes.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a promising distributed learning paradigm to support intelligent applications at the wireless edge, where a global model is trained iteratively through the collaboration of the edge devices without sharing their data. However, due to the relatively large communication cost between the devices and parameter server (PS), direct computing based on the information from the devices may not be resource efficient. This paper studies the joint communication and learning design for the over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based two-tier wireless FL scheme, where the lead devices first collect the local gradients from their nearby subordinate devices, and then send the merged results to the PS for the second round of aggregation. We establish a convergence result for the proposed scheme and derive the upper bound on the optimality gap between the expected and optimal global loss values. Next, based on the device distance and data importance, we propose a hierarchical clustering method to build the two-tier structure. Then, with only the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimality gap minimization problem and solve it by using an efficient alternating minimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline ones.}

	abstract = {Delay and information transmission rate are two fundamental quantities in communication systems. The information-theoretic capacity provides the ultimate limit of the transmission rate for reliable communications, yet with the effect of delay either completely ignored or partially considered. How to incorporate delay constraints into capacity characterization is one of the long-standing fundamental problems in wireless communications, which has gained a renewed sense of urgency with the increasingly demanding requirements for high data rate and low latency. The challenge lies in establishing an analytical framework that can integrate the accurate characterization of delay with the information-theoretic capacity. In this paper, by modeling the information flow as a queue of codewords, we demonstrate that the service process is the key that associates both the information output rate and the access/queueing delay performance. For a given mean-access-delay constraint, the maximum information output rate is characterized in various conditions in fading channels. The analysis shows that the mean-access-delay constraint has a crucial impact on the maximum information output rate when it is below a certain threshold. To achieve the maximum information output rate, the information encoding rate needs to be carefully tuned according to the delay constraint, which diminishes as the constraint becomes more strict. Discussions on how to incorporate feedback overhead and other delay constraints including the mean queueing delay and access delay deadline into the rate analysis are also presented.}

	abstract = {The practical deployment of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks requires balancing energy efficiency, convergence rate, and a target accuracy due to the limited available resources of devices. Prior art on FL often trains deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve high accuracy and fast convergence using 32 bits of precision level. However, such scenarios will be impractical for resource-constrained devices since DNNs typically have high computational complexity and memory requirements. Thus, there is a need to reduce the precision level in DNNs to reduce the energy expenditure. In this paper, a green-quantized FL framework, which represents data with a finite precision level in both local training and uplink transmission, is proposed. Here, the finite precision level is captured through the use of quantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and activations in fixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device trains its QNN and transmits a quantized training result to the base station. Energy models for the local training and the transmission with quantization are rigorously derived. To minimize the energy consumption and the number of communication rounds simultaneously, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with respect to the number of local iterations, the number of selected devices, and the precision levels for both local training and transmission while ensuring convergence under a target accuracy constraint. To solve this problem, the convergence rate of the proposed FL system is analytically derived with respect to the system control variables. Then, the Pareto boundary of the problem is characterized to provide efficient solutions using the normal boundary inspection method. Design insights on balancing the tradeoff between the two objectives while achieving a target accuracy are drawn from using the Nash bargaining solution and analyzing the derived convergence rate. Simulation results show that the proposed FL framework can reduce energy consumption until convergence by up to 70% compared to a baseline FL algorithm that represents data with full precision without damaging the convergence rate.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on designing robust symbol-level precoding (SLP) in an overlay cognitive radio (CR) network, where the primary and secondary networks transmit signals concurrently. When the primary base station (PBS) shares data and perfect channel state information (CSI) with the cognitive base station (CBS), we derive an SLP approach that minimizes the CR transmission power and satisfies symbol-wise Safety Margin (SM) constraints of both primary users (PUs) and cognitive users (CUs). The resulting optimization has a quadratic objective and linear inequality (LI) constraints, which can be solved by standard convex methods. For the case of imperfect CSI from the PBS, we propose robust SLP schemes. First, with a norm-bounded CSI error model to approximate the uncertain channels, we adopt a max-min philosophy to conservatively achieve robust SLP constraints. Second, we use the additive quantization noise model (AQNM) to describe the quantized PBS CSI and employ a stochastic constraint to formulate the problem. Both robust approaches also result in a quadratic objective with LI constraints. Simulation results show that, rather than simply trying to eliminate the network’s cross-interference, the proposed robust SLP schemes enable the primary and secondary networks to aid each other in meeting their quality of service constraints.}

However, due to the overloaded machine-type devices in IoT, the existing random access procedure in cellular networks suffers significant preamble collision problem and hardly meets the requirement of large random access. Despite the effort to cope with the preamble collision problem in conventional random access control schemes, other important performance requirements in random access are not well addressed, including access delay, energy consumption, and service priority. To improve the random access control scheme, we propose a novel hierarchical hybrid (HH) access class barring (ACB) and back-off (BO) scheme (HH ACB-BO scheme), where the hybrid ACB-BO is exploited to balance the delay-energy tradeoff, and the hierarchical structure is proposed to prioritize communication services. We mathematically formulate this random access control scheme to optimize the delay and energy performance jointly. With the fixed priority weights for each service priority, the closed-form of the optimal ACB factors and BO indicators adjustment result is derived. Moreover, in order to realize the adaptive prioritized random access control, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to the proposed random access scheme to dynamically adjust the ACB factors and BO indicators in an online manner. Considering the hierarchical structure and the action space complexity in DRL, a multi-agent DRL algorithm is designed for the HH ACB-BO scheme (multi-agent HH-DRL algorithm), where online policy transfer is applied to guarantee the policy effectiveness in the practical networks. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed HH ACB-BO scheme and reveal that the multi-agent HH-DRL algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of average access success probability and energy consumption performance.}

Different from the typical channel model based optimization in prior works, we tackle the joint design of 3D UAV trajectory and transmission scheduling as well as playback rate adaption with an environment and channel knowledge map (ECKM) approach, which provides rich information about the location-specific channel for enabling environment-aware communications.

For the scenario without such map information, we propose a dueling Deep Q-learning (DQL) solution with map construction such that the learning process can be facilitated for path planning.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be an effective approach for achieving intelligence in Cognitive Radio (CR). Through interactions with the environment, RL enables a CR to optimize in an efficient and flexible manner. The vast majority of studies, however, are carried out in a spectrum environment with prefixed user access rules, typically with a constant transition probability and reward distribution. In fact, in a real-world spectrum environment, changes in access rules are common, which has a significant impact on the effectiveness of RL, while few studies have been conducted on this topic. This paper demonstrates how changes in primary user’s (PU) access rules affect RL strategies. To improve the secondary user’s (SU) performance for the dynamic spectrum environment, a transfer Deep Q-Network (DQN) is proposed, this method screens out knowledge from historical experience while avoiding interference from irrelevant information with an experience playback mechanism. Experiments show that this method outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of conflict rate, spectrum utilization rate, and convergence rate in the dynamic spectrum. Given the scarcity of studies on this topic, this study is expected to serve as a benchmark for the future research.}

In this paper, we consider maximal ratio combining (MRC) detection for an OTFS receiver with oversampling for channels with fractional delays and Doppler shifts. Specifically, we first reformulate input-output relations in delay-Doppler and delay-time domains for an oversampled OTFS receiver. Then we present a modified iterative MRC detection in both domains taking advantage of the oversampled received signal to improve error performance. The complexity of our detection method is equivalent to that of standard MRC detection scaled by the oversampling factor, while remaining much lower than message passing (MP) detection. We also develop a noise whitening approach to decorrelate the oversampled noise in time domain and derive the optimal combining weights of the MRC detection. Simulation results show that the proposed detection with receiver oversampling outperforms the MRC detection with Nyquist sampling, and the oversampling MP detection. Finally, we show that adding noise whitening can significantly improve error performance, compared to the MRC detection without noise whitening. This comes at a small additional computational cost, while still remaining much lower than MP detection.}

	abstract = {Massive MIMO systems can achieve high spectrum and energy efficiency in downlink (DL) based on accurate estimate of channel state information (CSI). Existing works have developed learning-based DL CSI estimation that lowers uplink feedback overhead. One often overlooked problem is the limited number of DL pilots available for CSI estimation. One proposed solution leverages temporal CSI coherence by utilizing past CSI estimates and only sending channel state information-reference symbols (CSI-RS) for partial arrays to preserve CSI recovery performance. Exploiting CSI correlations, FDD channel reciprocity is helpful to base stations with direct access to uplink CSI. In this work, we propose a new learning-based feedback architecture and a reconfigurable CSI-RS placement scheme to reduce DL CSI training overhead and to improve encoding efficiency of CSI feedback. Our results demonstrate superior performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios by the proposed framework for CSI recovery at substantial reduction of computation power and storage requirements at UEs.}

	abstract = {Existing path planning schemes designed for wireless sensor networks generally account for abstract payload sensors, rendering them inapplicable to concrete sensor-array-based localization systems due to differences in measurement models. In this paper, we establish a general framework for path planning of a practical sensor array and factor in an oft-neglected degree of freedom regarding optimality, i.e., the array’s orientation/attitude. The optimization problem is formulated based on the A-optimality criterion under constraints arising from the maximum distance between consecutive waypoints, maximal heading change, and forbidden regions. To facilitate semidefinite relaxation (SDR), we recast the optimization function into a fractional nonhomogeneous quadratic structure and transform the constraints into a bilinear form. By applying SDR and replacing the bilinear terms with a matrix variable, the problem is relaxed into a single-ratio fractional program. By leveraging the Charnes-Cooper variable transformation, we transform the single-ratio fractional program into a mixed semidefinite/second-order cone program (SD/SOCP) that can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we apply the results to angle-of-arrival (AOA) and direct localization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed path planning scheme attains near-optimal performance.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel two-timescale resource management framework for mobile edge computing (MEC) is constructed. Unlike existing studies, for providing seamless and cost-efficient MEC services, this work aims to strike the balance between service migration and task rerouting for mobile devices (MDs) whenever handovers occur (i.e., switching access from one edge server to another). Considering the network dynamics (e.g., randomness of MDs’ task generations and time-varying channel conditions) and the asynchronization of different management decisions with different triggers, we formulate an online optimization problem for jointly determining: 1) large-timescale decisions, including which edge server should be selected to access, and whether service migration or task rerouting should be chosen for each MD in each large time frame; and 2) small-time scale decisions, including how computing and communication resources should be allocated among MDs with task offloading requests in each small time slot. Then, we propose an online algorithm based on the improved Lyapunov method, together with an iterative algorithm integrating randomized rounding and Lagrange dual techniques, which solves the problem to asymptotic optimum in terms of the long-term average service delay. Theoretical analyses and simulations evaluate the performance of the proposed solution and show its superiority over counterparts.}

	abstract = {Hybrid beamforming (HB) with quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning per stream in millimeter waves is indispensable in 5G/6G networks. HB includes baseband and radio frequency (RF) beamforming, and requires error-free channel state information (CSI), which is erroneous in practice. So there is a need for efficient, feasible, robust, and QoS-aware HB. To achieve this, we mitigate CSI uncertainty via baseband beamforming, and we steer the RF beamformer by using the estimates of the channel’s eigenvectors. In doing so, we consider the effective channel’s uncertainty region instead of the uncertainty region of the channel itself, as the former is smaller than the latter, requiring less transmit power to satisfy the QoS constraint. We also detect and eliminate the infeasible data streams. Our iterative scheme (which is based on the cutting-set method) for baseband beamforming satisfies the mean-squared error (MSE) constraint per stream, where a limited number of constraints are considered instead of infinitely many constraints. In our low-complexity scheme, we derive a simple sufficient condition to check the feasibility of each stream, we diagonalize the effective channel at the baseband precoder, and we use minimum MSE combining at the baseband combiner. Extensive simulations validate our formulations and theoretical derivations.}

We consider especially the physical-layer reliability perspective that has not yet been comprehensively studied. For establishing a solid analytical background, we first derive original closed-form expressions to evaluate demodulation and detection performance of frequency-hopped and frequency-shift keyed drone remote control signals under external or self-inflicted interference. The developed analytical tools are verified by comparison to simulated results and then used to study the impact that the operation mode has on the operable area of drones and effectiveness of counter-drone systems in different scenarios, linking the physical layer performance to practical safety. Analysis of the scenarios shows that FD operation compared to HD can improve the effectiveness of a counter-drone system and that in FD mode a drone can detect the attacks from the counter-drone system from a greater distance than in HD mode. However, two-way communication between the remote controller and drone in FD mode compared to HD significantly reduces the drone’s operable area when targeted by a smart counter-drone system.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology for applications in next-generation networks. However, reflecting-only RIS provides limited coverage compared to a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS). Hence, in this paper, we focus on the downlink achievable rate and its optimization of a STAR-RIS-assisted mMIMO system. Contrary to previous works on STAR-RIS, we consider mMIMO, correlated fading, and multiple user equipments (UEs) at both sides of the RIS. In particular, we introduce an estimation approach of the aggregated channel with the main benefit of reduced overhead links instead of estimating the individual channels. Next, leveraging channel hardening in mMIMO and the use-and-forget bounding technique, we obtain an achievable rate in closed-form that only depends on statistical channel state information (CSI). To optimize the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS, we employ a projected gradient ascent method (PGAM) that simultaneously adjusts the amplitudes and phase shifts for both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) STAR-RIS operation protocols. By considering large-scale fading, the proposed optimization can be performed every several coherence intervals, which can significantly reduce overhead. Considering that STAR-RIS has twice the number of controllable parameters compared to conventional reflecting-only RIS, this accomplishment offers substantial practical benefits. Simulations are carried out to verify the analytical results, reveal the interplay of the achievable rate with fundamental parameters, and show the superiority of STAR-RIS regarding its achievable rate compared to its reflecting-only counterpart.}

Communication links are maintained with users having multiple spatial data streams over frequency-selective non-line-of-sight channels while simultaneously transmitting separate spatial data streams to different sensing directions, where a portion of the communication data streams’ power is reallocated to the sensing data streams. The received reflections from the environment due to all transmit (TX) streams are used to obtain range–velocity and range–angle maps. Through optimizing the TX precoding and receive combining, inter-user, intra-user, and radar–communications interference are also canceled. In addition, streams transmitted in the sensing directions are optimized to minimize the lower bounds of direction-of-arrival and delay estimates jointly, and the solution is analytically derived. The simulation results illustrate that the JCAS system can reliably perform target detection while minimizing lower bounds compared with a communications-only scenario. Further, the detection probability and estimation errors of sensing can be improved while also controlling the communications capacity of the OFDM waveform, thereby indicating the need to appropriately choose the optimization parameters to obtain an optimal trade-off.}

The proposed BGCS-CIM scheme considers effective cluster power gain and spatial diversity gain obtained by the additional paths within the indexed cluster to construct an efficient codebook. We also integrate the proposed scheme into a practical system model to create a virtual path between transmitter and receiver where the direct link has been blocked. Thanks to the designed whitening filter, a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error rate (ABER) is derived and used to validate the simulation results. It has been shown that the proposed BGCS-CIM scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks thanks to its higher effective cluster gain, spatial diversity of indexed clusters, and lower inter-cluster interference.}

In the second phase, the residual information bits of all the users are partitioned into sub-blocks with a very short length to exhibit a higher spectral efficiency and a lower computational complexity than the existing transmission schemes in massive MIMO URA. By using the acquired CSI in the first phase, the sub-block recovery in the second phase is cast as a compressed sensing (CS) problem. From the perspective of the statistical physics, we provide a theoretical framework for our proposed URA scheme to analyze the induced problem based on the replica method. The analytical results show that the performance metrics of our URA scheme can be linked to the system parameters by a single-valued free entropy function. An AMP-based recovery algorithm is designed to achieve the performance indicated by the proposed theoretical framework. Simulations verify that our scheme outperforms the most recent counterparts.}

	abstract = {Owing to the controlling flexibility and cost-effectiveness, fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to serve as flying base stations (BSs) in the air-ground integrated network. By exploiting the mobility of UAVs, controllable coverage can be provided for mobile group users (MGUs) under challenging scenarios or even somewhere without communication infrastructure. However, in such dual mobility scenario where the UAV and MGUs are all moving, both the non-hovering feature of the fixed-wing UAV and the movement of MGUs will exacerbate the dynamic changes of user scheduling, which eventually leads to the degradation of MGUs’ quality-of-service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a fixed-wing UAV-enabled wireless network architecture to provide moving coverage for MGUs. In order to achieve fairness among MGUs, we maximize the minimum average throughput between all users by jointly optimizing the user scheduling, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control under the constraints on users’ QoS requirements, communication resources, and UAV trajectory switching. Considering the optimization problem is mixed-integer non-convex, we decompose it into three optimization subproblems. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve these three subproblems alternately till the convergence is realized. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the minimum average throughput of MGUs.}

However, in multibeam LEO-SN systems, the multiuser access and inter-group interference are crucial issues that need to be addressed urgently. To this end, we investigate the system weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem under the constraints of the user terminals (UTs) grouping, satellite total power budget, and minimum transmission rate requirements. For solving the problem, we propose a multiuser space-ground multicast group control (MU-SGMGC) scheme. Specifically, we first group all UTs into multiple multicast groups based on the channel correlation coefficient. Then, the group centers determination algorithm based on user distribution is proposed to ensure that each beam can cover all user groups. Finally, the beamformers designing problem is transformed into a difference-of-convex (DC) programming problem by utilizing auxiliary variables, and an iterative algorithm based on convex-concave procedure (CCP) is presented to solve the problem. Simulation results show that our proposed MU-SGMGC scheme has significant superiority in system WSR compared with the benchmark algorithms.}

To investigate the impact of vehicular traffic density (VTD) on channel statistics, clusters are divided into static clusters and dynamic clusters, which are further distinguished into static/dynamic single/twin-clusters to capture the mixed-bouncing propagation. A new method, which integrates the visibility region and birth-death process methods, is developed to model space-time-frequency (S-T-F) non-stationarity of V2V channels with time-space (T-S) consistency. The continuously arbitrary vehicular movement trajectory (VMT) and soft cluster power handover are modeled to further ensure channel T-S consistency. From the proposed model, key channel statistics are derived. Simulation results show that S-T-F non-stationarity of channels with T-S consistency is modeled and the impacts of VTD and VMT on channel statistics are analyzed. The generality of the proposed model is validated by comparing simulation results and measurement/ray-tracing (RT)-based results.}

	abstract = {Enabled by Self-interference (SI) cancellation, In-Band Full-duplex (IBFD) communication is promising for wireless systems as it can double spectral efficiency. At high power levels, SI cancellation drops abruptly due to transceivers’ non-linearity, as estimation/cancellation of SI signal with non-linearity is particularly challenging in the presence of the linear SI channel. To resolve this problem, we propose switched IBFD radio architecture along with a frequency-domain non-linear estimation algorithm. In this architecture, during the training phase, proposed non-linear estimation is performed on the SI signal, isolated from linear SI channel. In the cancellation phase, the estimated non-linear signal is provided as a reference to linear SI estimation, followed by linear cancellation. Experiments on a software defined IBFD radio demonstrate that the proposed solution improves linear cancellation by up to 16 dB, existing non-linear cancellation algorithms by up to 13 dB, and SI is reduced to the noise level for almost all power levels. Since the non-linear model needs to be trained once, at power-up, our IBFD solution is not affected from changes in multi-path, while existing schemes require (re)optimization and (re)training of the model. With the same reasoning, proposed non-linear solution has no estimation overhead and complexity is only for non-linear reconstruction.}

	abstract = {Facing the dramatic increase of real-time applications and time-sensitive services, large-scale ultra-low delay requirements are put forward for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. To support massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC), in this paper we propose an adaptive finite blocklength framework to reduce the over-the-air delay for short packet transmissions with multiple-access and delay-bounded demands. In particular, we first give the specified over-the-air delay model. Then, we reveal the tradeoff relationship among queuing delay, transmission delay, and the number of retransmissions along with the change of finite blocklength, as well as formulate the adaptive blocklength framework. Based on the adaptive blocklength framework and associated with grant-free (GF) access protocol, we formulate the average over-the-air delay minimization problem, where the blocklength can be adaptively changed in terms of transmission time interval (TTI) design and bandwidth allocation to achieve the optimal tradeoff and obtain its minimum over-the-air delay. We develop the cooperative multi-agent deep Q-network (M-DQN) scheme with a grouping mechanism to efficiently solve the average over-the-air delay minimization problem. Numerical results validate our proposed adaptive blocklength scheme outperforms corresponding schemes in long-term evolution (LTE) and the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR).}

	abstract = {In large-scale multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks, each device should make the computation offloading decision distributively. In this paper, we target on a delay-optimal computation offloading problem in large-scale MEC systems, where each task has two properties: data size and computation amount. Because the detailed state information of massive devices are huge in large-scale systems, we propose a distributed computation offloading algorithm using the mean field game (MFG). To design the distributed computation offloading algorithm, we first formulate the delay-optimal computation offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and derive the Hamilton-Jaccobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with the unknown task allocation proportion, where the combined influence from other devices and MEC servers should be estimated. Based on MFG, we obtain the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation to describe the evolution of the system’s collective behavior, with the influence from other devices and MEC servers formulated as the mean field. To solve the large-scale problem with the unknown allocation proportion, we propose a optimal computation offloading algorithm based on the generative adversarial networks (GAN) structure. For the generator, we generate the unknown task allocation proportion due to its non-calculability and insufficient dataset. For the discriminator, we train the value function, and propose a water-filling algorithm to prioritize the task offloading. Finally, the simulation results evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and show the performance gain compared to conventional algorithms.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communication is envisaged as an attractive way to attain abundant spectrum resources for 6G wireless communications. One main difficulty of the THz communications is the severe attenuation of signal power caused by the high diffraction and penetration losses and atmospheric absorption. To compensate for the severe path loss, a beamforming technique realized by the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been widely used. Since the beamforming gain is maximized only when the beams are appropriately aligned with the signal propagation paths, acquisition of accurate beam directions is of paramount importance. A major issue of the conventional beam management schemes is the considerable latency being proportional to the number of training beams. In this paper, we propose a THz beam management technique that simultaneously generates multiple frequency-dependent beams using the true time delay (TTD)-based phase shifters. By closing the gap between the frequency-dependent beamforming vectors and the desired directional beamforming vectors using the TTD-based signal propagation network called intensifier, we generate very sharp training beams maximizing the beamforming gain. From the numerical results, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves more than 70% reduction in the beam management latency and 60% increase in the data rate.}

	abstract = {The coordinates of beacon light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are assumed as known prior information in most visible light positioning (VLP) systems. However, such an assumption may be unpractical because the structures of the buildings change unpredictably due to the material aging or the changes of temperature and humidity. Therefore, a periodical update of the LEDs’ coordinates is necessary for accurate VLP. When the number of beacon LEDs increases, the manual measurement becomes too time-consuming and laborious. In this paper, we propose a novel LED coordinates estimator exploiting arbitrary number of angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimators. Each AOA estimator contains several differently oriented photodiodes (PDs) to detect the incident light direction. Considering the PDs’ thermal noises, a closed-form error expression is derived for the proposed LED coordinates estimator. Moreover, AOA estimator selection methods are proposed to detect the AOA estimators of a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and improve the positioning accuracy of the LED coordinates. Analytical and simulation results show centimeter-level positioning accuracy, and verify that the selection methods can reduce the positioning error.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system is a prominent strategy where a UAV equipped with an MEC server is deployed to serve terminal devices. This paper considers a multi-UAV assisted network in which multiple UAVs and a terrestrial base station (BS) are deployed to provide MEC services to mobile users. The objective is to minimize an energy and latency-based cost function by jointly optimizing task offloading and MEC server selection decision, transmission power, UAV trajectory, and CPU frequency allocation. An alternating iterative approach based on the block descent method is proposed to solve this problem. In the first layer, task offloading and server selection decision subproblem is solved using a game theoretic approach. The second layer handles offloading and downloading transmission power allocations by utilizing a simplistic geometric waterfilling (GWF) technique, and the UAV trajectory by successive convex approximation (SCA). Whereas, the third layer solves the computation resource subproblem by performing CPU frequency allocation using a gradient descent method. The proposed method uses a segment-by-segment approach, which divides the entire UAV flight trajectory into shorter timeframe segments to reduce the computation time. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed approach outperforms various benchmark schemes.}

The proposed iMM and ADMM methods are faster than the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and interior point methods, respectively. In order to counter against the changing large-scale path loss, the iMM method is helped by channel normalization to reduce the computational complexity, while the ADMM method is helped by the adaptive parameterizations to robust against the changing large-scale path loss. Simulation results show that the computational times of the proposed method are much faster than other methods, the proposed method is robust against the changing large-scale path loss, and the user’s bit error rate (BER) is stable under small to medium channel estimation errors.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a new communication-efficient federated learning (FL) framework is proposed, inspired by vector quantized compressed sensing. The basic strategy of the proposed framework is to compress the local model update at each device by applying dimensionality reduction followed by vector quantization. Subsequently, the global model update is reconstructed at a parameter server by applying a sparse signal recovery algorithm to the aggregation of the compressed local model updates. By harnessing the benefits of both dimensionality reduction and vector quantization, the proposed framework effectively reduces the communication overhead of local update transmissions. Both the design of the vector quantizer and the key parameters for the compression are optimized so as to minimize the reconstruction error of the global model update under the constraint of wireless link capacity. By considering the reconstruction error, the convergence rate of the proposed framework is also analyzed for a non-convex loss function. Simulation results on the MNIST and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve classification accuracy by more than 2.4% compared to state-of-the-art FL frameworks when the communication overhead of the local model update transmission is 0.1 bit per local model entry.}

Assuming that the BS treats this interference as additional noise, we focus on the problem of estimating the interference correlation matrix from received signal samples. We consider a BS equipped with multiple antennas and operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands and propose techniques exploiting the fact that channels comprise only a few reflections at these frequencies. This yields a specific structure of the interference correlation matrix that can be decomposed into three matrices, two rectangular depending on the angle of arrival (AoA) of the interference and the third square with smaller dimensions. We resort to gridless approaches to estimate the AoAs and then project the least square estimate of the interference correlation matrix into a subspace with a smaller dimension, thus reducing the estimation error. Moreover, we derive two simplified estimators, still based on the gridless angle estimation that turns out to be convenient when estimating the interference over a larger number of samples.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communication signals are susceptible to severe degradation because of the molecular interaction with the atmosphere in the form of subsequent absorption and re-radiation. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a potential technology to assist in THz communications by boosting signal power or providing virtual line-of-sight (LOS) paths. However, the re-radiated energy has either been modeled as a scattering component or as additive Gaussian noise in the literature. Since the precise characterization is still a work in progress, this paper presents the first comparative investigation of the performance of an RIS-aided THz system under these two extreme re-radiation models. In particular, we first develop a novel parametric channel model that encompasses both models of the re-radiation through a simple parameter change, and then utilize that to design a robust block-coordinate descent (BCD) algorithmic framework which maximizes a lower bound on channel capacity while accounting for imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this framework, the original problem is split into two sub-problems: a) receive beamformer optimization, and b) RIS phase-shift optimization. As the latter sub-problem (unlike the former) has no analytical solution, we propose three approaches for it: a) semi-definite relaxation (SDR) (high complexity), b) signal alignment (SA) (low complexity), and c) gradient descent (GD) (low complexity). The time complexities associated with the proposed approaches are explicitly derived. We analytically demonstrate the limited interference suppression capability of a passive RIS by deriving the stationary points of signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of a one-element RIS system with one interferer. Our numerical results also demonstrate that slightly better throughput is achieved when the re-radiation manifests as scattering.}

Specifically, the Gamma-Gamma distribution is utilized to characterize the atmospheric turbulence effect for the FSO link from UAV to HAP, while the Rayleigh and Nakagami- m\ndistribution fading are applied to simulate the legitimate and wiretap RF links, respectively. We present the closed-form expressions for the probability density functions, the cumulative distribution functions, and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terms of Meijer’s G-function. To gain more insight into secrecy performance, we further obtain the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic SOP, the asymptotic probability of positive secrecy capacity (PPSC), the diversity gain, and the coding gain at high SNR regions. We can observe that the secrecy performance depends on the weaker channel between the RF and FSO, and is closely related to the number of RIS elements, the number of terrestrial users, the atmospheric turbulence factor, pointing error parameters, and the fading parameter of Nakagami- m\ndistributed wiretap link. Finally, numerical results validate the derived results and demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior secrecy performance over the benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a promising technology for communications under high mobility in the sixth-generation (6G) communications system. To enable machine-type communications (MTC) with high mobility in 6G, researchers have considered designing multiple access (MA) technologies based on OTFS modulation. The reliability and connectivity of OTFS-MA are highly correlated with the characteristics of the channel spreading function. In the spectrum-limited MA system where the channel spreading function is not sparse and compact enough, the system device capacity of OTFS-MA schemes is limited. To this end, a grant-free MA scheme, named orthogonal time frequency code space modulation enabled multiple access (OTFCSMA) is proposed in this article. In general, orthogonal code domain resources are introduced into OTFCSMA to enhance device connectivity and transmission reliability of MA systems based on OTFS modulation. In detail, firstly, the characteristic of the realistic channel spreading function is described, especially the reduced sparsity and compactness of the channel in the spectrum-limited system. Secondly, the principles for designing OTFCSMA are described, including orthogonal spreading/despreading, data interleaving/deinterleaving, device identification, two-stage channel estimation, and data recovery strategies. Thirdly, the system device capacity and the system complexity of OTFCSMA are analyzed. Fourthly, a date-block-wise device connectivity scaling-up scheme for OTFCSMA is proposed, based on which the exponential system user capacity growth is realized. Finally, the performances of OTFCSMA on transmission reliability and device connectivity are demonstrated, and the gain brought by orthogonal spreading is analyzed.}

Since the projection and GD step have different loss functions, necessary compromise has to be made to balance them during iterations. For this reason, the generalized PGD (GPGD) method is proposed with flexible choices of projection and GD. Different from performing projection and GD alternatively, we show that implementing projection after every multiple GD steps is a better solution. Meanwhile, the step-size of GD is also investigated for convergence efficiency. After that, by unfolding this proposed GPGD method with deep neural networks (DNN), the self-corrected auto-detector (SAD) is established to achieve better decoding performance, where enhancement by attention mechanism and extension by another iterative method are also given for performance improvement and efficiency.}

In this paper, we first derive a three-dimensional (3D) generalised propulsion energy consumption model (GPECM) for rotary-wing UAVs under the consideration of stochastic wind modeling and 3D force analysis. Based on the GPECM, we study a UAV-enabled downlink communication system, where a rotary-wing UAV flies subject to stochastic wind disturbance and provides communication services for ground users (GUs). We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UAV by jointly optimizing the 3D trajectory and user scheduling among the GUs based on the GPECM. We formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization, which is difficult to solve due to the lack of real-time wind information. To address this issue, we propose an offline-based online adaptive (OBOA) design that is comprised of two phases, namely, an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, we average the wind effect on the UAV by leveraging stochastic programming (SP) based on wind statistics; then, in the online phase, we further optimize the instantaneous velocity to adapt to the real-time wind. Simulation results show that the optimized trajectories of the UAV in both phases can better adapt to changes of the speed and direction of the wind, resulting in a higher EE compared with the wind-unaware scheme. In particular, the proposed OBOA design can be applied in the scenario with dramatic wind changes, and allows the UAV to adjust its velocity dynamically to achieve better performance in terms of EE.}

	abstract = {Compressive spectrum sensing (CSS) is regarded as one of the promising techniques to detect wideband spectrum holes. How to formulate an accurate prior knowledge in CSS is still an important and open topic. In this paper, we propose a novel CSS algorithm with cascade forward-backward propagation and prior knowledge refining. Firstly, the wideband signal reconstruction model is formulated as a \\ell _{p} -norm ( 0 < p < 1 ) nonconvex optimization problem where the temporal correlation between continuous observed spectrum signals is exploited to improve the reconstruction accuracy of the current spectrum signal, and such nonconvex optimization problem is solved by iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. Then, the multiple reconstructed versions of the current spectrum signal obtained by forward-backward propagation are fused into a prior. Finally, such fused prior is modified adaptively in each iteration, and thus significantly improves the accuracy of spectrum decision and speeds up the convergence. The simulation results show that compared with other CSS schemes based on weighted \\ell _{1} minimization, \\ell _{1} - \\ell _{1} minimization, \\ell _{1} - \\ell _{2} minimization, and maximizing correlation, the proposed scheme has more than 7% and 10% detection performance improvement when the probability of false alarm is 10%, under received signal-to-noise ratio as −10 dB and −5 dB, respectively.}

	abstract = {In terahertz (THz) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the combination of huge bandwidth and massive antennas results in severe beam split, thus making the conventional phase-shifter based hybrid precoding architecture ineffective. With the incorporation of true-time-delay (TTD) lines in the hardware implementation of the analog precoders, delay-phase precoding (DPP) emerges as a promising architecture to effectively overcome beam split. However, existing DPP approaches suffer from poor performance, high complexity, and weak robustness in practical THz channels. In this paper, we propose a novel DPP approach in wideband THz massive MIMO systems. First, the matrix decomposition optimization problem is converted into a compressive sensing (CS) form, which can be solved by the proposed extended spatially sparse precoding (SSP) algorithm. To compensate for beam split, frequency-dependent measurement matrices are designed, which can be approximately realized by feasible phase and delay codebooks. Furthermore, several efficient atom selection techniques are developed to further reduce the complexity of the extended SSP algorithm. In simulation, the proposed DPP approach achieves superior performance, complexity, and robustness by using it alone or in combination with existing DPP approaches under various settings.}

	abstract = {Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and machine-to-machine (M2M) relaying are increasingly important. In-band full-duplex (IBFD) communication is desirable for low-latency communication because it can theoretically double the capacity of half-duplex (HD) communication, but is limited by self-interference (SI) in which the IBFD transmitter injects interference into its received signal due to large transmit and receive power differences. There are many methods to mitigate SI in IBFD, but we focus on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding to spatially null SI, while also being careful to limit communication latency. Unlike works aiming to compute the highest achievable rate in IBFD relays with an essentially fixed precoder, we propose a strategy allowing the precoder to change on a per channel use basis to avoid rate bottlenecks at each hop. Our strategy generalizes to multiple relays. We frame finding the sequence of precoders to relay packets through N IBFD MIMO relays with the lowest communication latency as a shortest path problem. Specifically, we design a quantized covariance precoder codebook at each transmitter based on limiting the maximal SI power each precoder produces. Then, an iterative algorithm is used to optimize the selection of precoders over channel uses to relay packets in the fewest channel uses possible.}

	abstract = {In orthogonal time sequency multiplexing (OTSM) modulation, the information symbols are conveyed in the delay-sequency domain upon exploiting the inverse Walsh Hadamard transform (IWHT). It has been shown that OTSM is capable of attaining a bit error ratio (BER) similar to that of orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation at a lower complexity, since the saving of multiplication operations in the IWHT. Hence we provide its BER performance analysis and characterize its detection complexity. We commence by deriving its generalized input-output relationship and its unconditional pairwise error probability (UPEP). Then, its BER upper bound is derived in closed form under both ideal and imperfect channel estimation conditions, which is shown to be tight at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Moreover, a novel approximate message passing (AMP) aided OTSM detection framework is proposed. Specifically, to circumvent the high residual BER of the conventional AMP detector, we proposed a vector AMP-based expectation-maximization (VAMP-EM) detector for performing joint data detection and noise variance estimation. The variance auto-tuning algorithm based on the EM algorithm is designed for the VAMP-EM detector to further improve the convergence performance. The simulation results illustrate that the VAMP-EM detector is capable of striking an attractive BER vs. complexity trade-off than the state-of-the-art schemes as well as providing a better convergence. Finally, we propose AMP and VAMP-EM turbo receivers for low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded OTSM systems. It is demonstrated that our proposed VAMP-EM turbo receiver is capable of providing both BER and convergence performance improvements over the conventional AMP solution.}

In the standard massive MIMO setup, the users transmit orthonormal pilots during the training phase and the received signal at the base station is projected onto each pilot. This processing is optimum when the noise is Gaussian. We show that this processing is not optimal when the noise is Cauchy and as a remedy propose a channel estimation technique that operates on the raw received signal. Second, we derive uplink-downlink achievable rates in the presence of Cauchy noise for perfect and imperfect channel state information. Finally, we derive log-likelihood ratio expressions for soft bit detection for both uplink and downlink, and simulate coded bit-error-rate curves. In addition to this, we derive and compare the symbol detectors in the presence of both Gaussian and Cauchy noises. An important observation is that the detector constructed for Cauchy noise performs well with both Gaussian and Cauchy noises; on the other hand, the detector for Gaussian noise works poorly in the presence of Cauchy noise. In other words, the Cauchy detector is robust against heavy-tailed noise, whereas the Gaussian detector is not.}

Even though each AP may have its own local channel state information (CSI), due to the communication delay in the backhaul, neither the APs nor the CC has timely global CSI. Under this hierarchical semi-online setting, our goal is to minimize the accumulated precoding deviation, between the actual local precoders executed by the APs and an ideal cooperative precoder based on timely and perfect global CSI, subject to per-AP transmit power limits. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Semi-Online Precoding with Information Parsing (SOPIP), which accounts for the network heterogeneity in information timeliness and computational capacity. SOPIP does not require the CC to send the full global CSI to each AP. Instead, it takes advantage of the precoder structure to substantially lower the communication overhead, while allowing each AP to effectively combine its own timely local CSI with the delayed global CSI to enable adaptive precoder updates. We analyze the performance of SOPIP in the presence of multi-slot communication delay, CSI inaccuracy, and gradient estimation error, showing that it has a bounded performance gap from an offline optimal solution. Simulation results under typical cellular system settings further demonstrate the substantial performance gain of SOPIP over other centralized and distributed schemes.}

	abstract = {This article studies the reliability of multi-hop routing in a multi-tier hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network (HSTRN). We evaluate the reliability of multi-hop routing by introducing interruption probability, which is the probability that no relay device (ground gateway or satellite) is available during a hop. The single-hop interruption probability is derived and extended to the multi-hop interruption probability using a stochastic geometry-based approach. Since the interruption probability in HSTRN highly depends on the priority of selecting communication devices at different tiers, we propose three priority strategies: 1) stationary optimal priority strategy; 2) single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy; and 3) density inspired strategy. Among them, the interruption probability under the stationary optimal priority strategy can approach the ideal lower bound. However, when analyzing an HSTRN with a large number of tiers, the stationary optimal priority strategy is computationally expensive. The single-hop interruption probability inspired strategy is expected to be a low-complexity but less reliable alternative to the stationary optimal priority strategy. In numerical results, we study the complementarity between terrestrial devices and satellites. Furthermore, analytical results for reliability are also applicable to the analysis of satellite availability, coverage probability, and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) rate. Finally, we extend our original routing strategy into a multi-flow one with dynamic priority strategy.}

However, most previous study on blockchain consensus protocols for wireless networks relies on reliable message transmissions and honest leaders. In practice, wireless blockchains inherently suffer from limited physical resources and unreliable wireless channels due to environmental noises and adversary attacks. This paper studies the design of Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol for blockchain in single-hop wireless networks subject to signal-to-noise constraint. For this purpose, we propose a low-latency and reliable Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol LRBP, which incorporates the following three designs: 1) Randomized credit-based block proposer selection, which can prevent adversary corruption and improve the system throughput, 2) Enhanced threshold Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature based voting mechanism, which can achieve communication-efficient block validity voting by using piggyback-based acknowledgment and criticality-based adaptive channel accessing probability adjustment, and 3) Random linear network coding based batch forwarding, which supports reliable block transmissions. We derive the consensus success probability and consensus time complexity of LRBP. We prove that LRBP simultaneously satisfies the properties of persistence and liveness. It is resistant to the 51% attack, Sybil attack, double-spending attack, and jamming attack. Simulation results show the high efficiency of LRBP as compared with existing work.}

However, current solutions focus on a single and fixed goal, which cannot satisfy the dynamic and diverse emergency message requirements. In this article, we propose an adaptive broadcast-relay selection scheme to fill up this gap. An adaptive control message is designed to reflect the dynamic and diverse emergency message requirements. An adaptive relay pattern switching mechanism is designed to accommodate such requirements based on the adaptive control message. Delay-sensitive messages are broadcasted by an adaptive sender-based relay pattern, in which the link quality is used to address the inherent transmission reliability problem. Delay-insensitive messages are broadcasted by an adaptive receiver-based relay pattern, in which the time interval of adjacent potential relays is set to address the inherent packet collision problem. The unique features of our solution are twofold. One is the stronger adaptivity due to the implementation of the dynamic relay patterns, and the other is the wider applications due to the satisfaction of multiple types of emergency messages. Extensive simulations demonstrate the advantages of our solution in terms of transmission delay, dissemination speed, and adaptability in different scenarios.}

The hybrid precoding replaces the conventional fully digital precoding with a combination of analog and digital precoding to achieve good performance using a significantly smaller number of RF chains compared to the number of antennas. In this paper, we consider a narrowband downlink multiple user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and propose a hybrid precoding method in order to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) for all users. The analog and digital precoding design subproblems are isolated from each other. Analog precoder design is cast as a trace maximization problem, and solved by an iterative procedure based on truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). The digital precoder is determined subsequently after fixing the analog precoder, using Lagrange’s method. The proposed hybrid precoder produces spectral and bit error rate (BER) performances quite close to fully digital precoder, and almost the same as existing high performance hybrid precoders, albeit at a much lower complexity. The proposed precoding method is extended to operate in wideband channel, where it exhibits equally good performance with less complexity.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the framework of cross-entropy (CE) based clustering and beamforming for mmWave-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system taking into consideration the impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). For the design of clustering and beamforming, we adopt CE based machine learning algorithm that has the objective to obtain the statistical parameters by minimizing the cross-entropy between optimal and sampling distributions. By using CE based clustering, the number of clusters can be adjusted to strike a balance between the inter-cluster interference and intra-cluster interference introduced by imperfect SIC. Furthermore, the inter-cluster interference induced by spatial beamforming is further reduced using CE based beamforming, which can significantly enhance the system performance of mmWave-NOMA. Based on the result, we compute the power allocation by dividing it into the intra-cluster and inter-cluster power allocation problems. In particular, we derive the optimal intra-cluster power allocation in a closed form and obtain the condition to guarantee the minimum rate requirements of all the users. We next solve the inter-cluster power allocation using convex optimization technique. Data-intensive simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm such as K -mean based clustering and the number of clusters can be controlled using CE based clustering algorithm.}

	abstract = {Edge inference refers to the use of artificial intelligent (AI) models at the network edge to provide mobile devices inference services and thereby enable intelligent services such as auto-driving and Metaverse towards 6G. However, departing from the classic paradigm of data-centric designs, the 6G networks for supporting edge AI features task-oriented techniques that focus on effective and efficient execution of AI task. Targeting end-to-end system performance, such techniques are sophisticated as they aim to seamlessly integrate sensing (data acquisition), communication (data transmission), and computation (data processing). Aligned with the paradigm shift, a task-oriented over-the-air computation (AirComp) scheme is proposed in this paper for multi-device split-inference system. In the considered system, local feature vectors, which are extracted from the real-time noisy sensory data on devices, are aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the waveform superposition in a multiuser channel. Then the aggregated features as received at a server are fed into an inference model with the result used for decision making or control of actuators. To design inference-oriented AirComp, the transmit precoders at edge devices and receive beamforming at edge server are jointly optimized to rein in the aggregation error and maximize the inference accuracy. The problem is made tractable by measuring the inference accuracy using a surrogate metric called discriminant gain, which measures the discernibility of two object classes in the application of object/event classification. It is discovered that the conventional AirComp beamforming design for minimizing the mean square error in generic AirComp with respect to the noiseless case may not lead to the optimal classification accuracy. The reason is due to the overlooking of the fact that feature dimensions have different sensitivity towards aggregation errors and are thus of different importance levels for classification. This issue is addressed in this work via a new task-oriented AirComp scheme designed by directly maximizing the derived discriminant gain. However, the resultant problem of joint transmit precoding and receive beamforming is nonconvex and difficult to solve due to the complicated form of discriminant gain and the coupling between the control variables. We overcome the difficulty using the successive convex approximation. The performance gain of the proposed task-oriented scheme over the conventional schemes is verified by extensive experiments targeting the application of human motion recognition.}

However, cell-free UAV networks present major challenges related to the wireless nature of access and fronthaul links. This manuscript studies the uplink of cell-free systems where users connect to UAVs, the latter devices forwarding the information to a processing point through imperfect wireless fronthaul links. Three multiple access alternatives are considered for the fronthaul, namely frequency division multiples access, spatial division multiple access, and combinations thereof. Deterministic equivalent expressions for the spectral efficiency under these fronthaul schemes and minimum mean-square error reception are derived. Then, the optimization subproblems of (a) the 3D deployment of the UAVs, (b) the user transmit powers, and (c) the UAV transmit powers, are investigated. The joint optimization of these subproblems yields superior performance, with the 3D deployment being the main source of improvement.}

	abstract = {The explosive growth of maritime vessels imposes high demands on the security of automatic identification system (AIS). Radio frequency fingerprinting identification (RFFI) as a physical-layer authentication method offers a new perspective on security solutions for wireless communication systems. However, RFFI for AIS satellite component suffers from poor performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes a data-driven RFFI method with high performance and resilience for AIS satellite links. The bivariate variational mode decomposition (VMD) enables adaptive signal decomposition for effective denoising. The raw I/Q samples after bivariate VMD are directly taken as input to the RF fingerprinting feature extraction network without any transformation process. The complex-valued neural network used for feature extraction provides a superior representation capability compared to traditional real-valued neural networks. Furthermore, channel attention mechanisms are embedded in the feature extraction network to shed light on the correlation between channels within the signal. The following integrated spatial attention mechanisms are employed to reveal the correlations between signals. Numerical results show that the proposed RFFI method can achieve over 90.37% accuracy on real-world datasets with SNRs greater than 6 dB, and achieve a balance between complexity and performance.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurability is a desired characteristic of future communication networks. From a transceiver’s standpoint, this can be materialized through the implementation of fluid antennas (FAs). An FA consists of a dielectric holder, in which a radiating liquid moves between pre-defined locations (called ports) that serve as the transceiver’s antennas. Due to the nature of liquids, FAs can practically take any size and shape, making them both flexible and reconfigurable. In this paper, we deal with the outage probability of FAs under general fading channels, where a port is scheduled based on selection combining. An analytical framework is provided for the performance with and without errors due to post-scheduling delays. We show that although FAs achieve maximum diversity, this cannot be realized in the presence of delays. Hence, a linear prediction scheme is proposed that overcomes delays and restores the lost diversity by predicting the next scheduled port. Moreover, we design space-time coded modulations that exploit the FA’s sequential operation with space-time rotations and code diversity. The derived expressions for the pairwise error probability and average word error rate give an accurate estimate of the performance. We illustrate that the proposed design attains maximum diversity, while keeping a low-complexity receiver, thereby confirming the feasibility of FAs.}

	abstract = {Satellite communications play an indispensable role in serving aviation user. However, since the number of satellite beams is much less than the number of users, aviation users need to share beams by time division multiplexing when the number of users is large, which inevitably leads to the situation that the satellite frequently requires the user to report location information for beam scheduling so as to prevent users from deviating from the coverage of satellite beams. Frequent user location updates result in high interaction overhead between the satellite and aviation users. In such a case, how to free users from frequent location updates and realize low interaction overhead beam scheduling are the key in satellite aviation communications. To solve such a problem, we first propose a dynamic spatio-temporal approximation (DSTA) model to provide large spatial-temporal scale mobility tolerance for users within the time frame permitted by the satellite system, then a novel beam collaboration scheduling algorithm based on this new model is further proposed, aiming to realize low-overhead satellite multi-beam scheduling. Simulation results show that the proposed method with moderate complexity reduces interaction frequency and interaction overhead between the satellite and users by at least 56.9% and 47.1% compared with benchmark approaches respectively, which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Bayesian modelling of the channel distribution is a crucial step before channel recovery specially in the underdetermined scenario in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna setups. In complicated dynamic propagation environments such as the ones encountered in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Air to Ground (A2G) channels, Bayesian modelling might not be feasible or the model may not be able to approximate the different aspects of the true distribution well enough. Thus, estimation performance will be affected irrespective of the efficiency of recovery algorithm. To exploit the temporal correlations and imperfections in the real channels in such a scenario, we design a temporally correlated adversarial regulariser using Variational recurrent neural networks (VRNN) and train the framework on simulated channel dataset. The framework can be trained directly with channel samples, thus, allowing channel modelling and estimation without explicit tractable Bayesian models in highly dynamic systems. We then propose a temporally correlated deep compressed sensing algorithm which does not depend on the expressibility of the networks and provide theoretical results for existence and recovery. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness for channel estimation in A2G channels and show superior channel recovery and improved modelling even for out-of-distribution channels.}

	abstract = {Although the multi-antenna or so-called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is an enabling technology for past generations of wireless communication systems, its application to visible light communication (VLC) still faces a critical challenge due to the strong spatial correlation of VLC channels, which makes it difficult to achieve sufficient spatial multiplexing gain. This paper proposes to use optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) to tackle this challenge. Firstly, we characterize the extremely near-field channel condition in the optical frequency range and reveal a peculiar “inter-element interference (IEI) free” property of the OIRS-reflected channel, where the OIRS reflecting elements can be individually configured to align with one pair of transmitter and receiver antennas without causing interference to each other. Next, we characterize the OIRS-assisted MIMO VLC capacities under different power constraints at the transmitter antennas, and then proceed to maximize them by jointly optimizing the OIRS element alignment and transmitter emission power. In particular, we propose two algorithms for the OIRS optimization, namely, location-aided interior-point algorithm and log-det-based alternating optimization algorithm, to balance the performance versus complexity trade-off; while the optimal transmitter emission power is derived in closed form. Numerical results are provided to validate the capacity improvement of OIRS-assisted MIMO VLC against the VLC without OIRS and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms compared to baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {There are three generic services in 5G: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). To guarantee the performance of heterogeneous services, network slicing is proposed to allocate resources to different services. Network slicing is typically done in an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) fashion, which means different services are allocated non-interfering resources. However, as the number of users grows, OMA-based slicing is not always optimal, and a non-orthogonal scheme may achieve better performance. This work aims to analyse the performances of different slicing schemes in uplink, and a promising scheme based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is studied. RSMA can provide a more flexible decoding order and theoretically has the largest achievable rate region than OMA and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) without time-sharing. Hence, RSMA has the potential to increase the rate of users requiring different services. In addition, it is not necessary to decode the two split streams of one user successively, so RSMA lets suitable users split messages and designs an appropriate decoding order depending on the service requirements. This work shows that for network slicing RSMA can outperform NOMA counterpart, and obtain significant gains over OMA in some regions.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a disruptive technology to enhance the performance of physical-layer key generation (PKG) thanks to its ability to smartly customize the radio environments. Existing RIS-assisted PKG methods are mainly based on the idealistic assumption of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel model at both the base station (BS) and the RIS. However, the i.i.d. model is inaccurate for a typical RIS in an isotropic scattering environment and neglecting the existence of channel spatial correlation would possibly degrade the PKG performance. In this paper, we establish a general spatially correlated channel model and propose a new channel probing framework based on the transmit and the reflective beamforming. We derive a closed-form key generation rate (KGR) expression and formulate an optimization problem, which is solved by using the low-complexity Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) with Mirror-Prox method. Simulation results show that compared to the existing methods based on the i.i.d. fading model, our proposed method achieves about 5 dB transmit power gain when the spacing between two neighboring RIS elements is a quarter of the wavelength. Also, the KGR increases significantly with the number of RIS elements while that increases marginally with the number of BS and user antennas.}

However, each individual MNO may not be able to benefit from this technology without joint optimizations. In this paper, we investigate a symbiotic spectrum and service sharing paradigm, which can improve the overall performance of the multi-MNO network while guaranteeing each MNO benefits as well. Particularly, we formulate two user association problems with novel mutual benefit constraints, namely, sum rate maximization and load balancing. Besides, we introduce a sharing coefficient for inter-MNO service sharing, which can be regarded as an inter-MNO service level agreement (SLA) accounting for the regulation of user association behaviors. Then, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm and a fractional programming (FP) based algorithm to solve the sum rate maximization problems for different inter-MNO sharing strategies. In addition, we also develop a Lagrangian dual decomposition based algorithm for the load balancing problems. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that mutual benefit constraints can help multiple MNOs realize a symbiotic spectrum and service sharing paradigm. By comparing different inter-MNO sharing strategies, it can also be observed that the highest performance gain can be achieved when the multiple MNOs share their spectrum and service simultaneously.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology to provide smart radio environment. In contrast to the well-studied patch-array-based RISs, this work focuses on the metasurface-based RISs and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RISs where the elements have millimeter or even molecular sizes. For these meticulous metasurface structures, near-field effects are dominant and a continuous electric current distribution should be adopted for capturing their electromagnetic response instead of discrete phase-shift matrices. Exploiting the electric current distribution, a Green’s function method based channel model is proposed. Based on the proposed model, performance analysis is carried out for both transmitting/reflecting-only RISs and STAR-RISs. 1) For the transmitting/reflecting-only RIS-aided single-user scenario, closed-formed expressions for the near-field/far-field boundary and the end-to-end channel gain are derived. Then, degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) and the power scaling laws are obtained. It is proved that the near-field channel exhibits higher DoFs than the far-field channel. It is also confirmed that when communication distance increases beyond the field boundary, the near-field power scaling law degrades to the well-known far-field result. 2) For the STAR-RIS-aided multi-user scenario, three practical STAR-RIS configuration strategies are proposed, namely power splitting (PS), selective element grouping (SEG), and random element grouping (REG) strategies. The channel gains for users are derived within both the pure near-field regime and the hybrid near-field and far-field regime. Finally, numerical results confirm that: 1) metasurface-based RISs are able to to outperform patch-array-based RISs, 2) the received power scales quadratically with the number of elements within the far-field regime and scales linearly within the near-field regime, and 3) for STAR-RISs, SEG has the highest near-field channel gain among the three proposed strategies and PS yields the highest DoFs for the near-field channel.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the joint device activity and data detection in massive machine-type communications (mMTC) with a one-phase non-coherent scheme, where data bits are embedded in the pilot sequences and the base station simultaneously detects active devices and their embedded data bits without explicit channel estimation. Due to the correlated sparsity pattern introduced by the non-coherent transmission scheme, the traditional approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Therefore, we propose a deep learning (DL) modified AMP network (DL-mAMPnet) that enhances the detection performance by effectively exploiting the pilot activity correlation. The DL-mAMPnet is constructed by unfolding the AMP algorithm into a feedforward neural network, which combines the principled mathematical model of the AMP algorithm with the powerful learning capability, thereby benefiting from the advantages of both techniques. Trainable parameters are introduced in the DL-mAMPnet to approximate the correlated sparsity pattern and the large-scale fading coefficient. Moreover, a refinement module is designed to further advance the performance by utilizing the spatial feature caused by the correlated sparsity pattern. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-mAMPnet can significantly outperform traditional algorithms in terms of the symbol error rate performance.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes to leverage intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to realize radio-frequency-chain-free uplink-transmissions (RFCF-UT) for an integrated sensing, communication and computation system. In this communication paradigm, IRS works as an information carrier, whose elements are capable of adjusting their amplitudes and phases to collaboratively portray an electromagnetic image like a dynamic quick response (QR) code, rather than a familiar reflection device. Meanwhile, a dual-functional radar-communication base station (BS) is used as a scanner to collect and recognize the information on each IRS carrying the data of its associated user equipment, while detecting the radar target. Based on the established system model, partial and binary data offloading strategies are respectively considered. By defining a performance metric named weighted throughput capacity (WTC), two maximization problems of WTC are formulated. According to the coupling degree of optimization variables in the objective function and the constraints, each optimization problem is firstly decomposed into two subproblems. Then, the methods of linear programming, fractional programming, integer programming and alternative optimization are developed to solve the subproblems. The simulation results demonstrate the achievable WTC of the considered system, thereby validating RFCF-UT.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a non-coherent communication scheme for short packet communications (SPCs), called spectrally-efficient modulation on conjugate reciprocal zeros (SE-MOCZ). The proposed SE-MOCZ scheme is realized by combining the recently-proposed MOCZ and faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. Specifically, the pulses carrying the polynomial coefficients of MOCZ are accelerated beyond the Nyquist limit to enhance the spectral efficiency. The spectral efficiency enhancement, however, comes at the expense of inter-polynomial-coefficient interference (IPCI), which increases the number of received complex zeros in the z\n-domain of the polynomial representing the received signal. We design a partial-complex-zeros-removal filter at the receiver to partially remove the pre-defined zeros due to the FTN signaling. Furthermore, we also optimize the radius of the transmit complex zeros in SE-MOCZ to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance. We propose a maximum likelihood (ML) detector for the proposed SE-MOCZ scheme. To strike a balance between the BER performance and computational complexity, we adopt a root-finding minimum distance (RFMD)-based detector. Simulation results clearly show the performance advantage of the proposed SE-MOCZ when compared to MOCZ for a wide range of operating parameters.}

	abstract = {Index modulation is a MIMO technology where some transmit antennas are idle during each transmission interval, but the receiver requires knowledge of all link gains at all times. Even though index modulation is particularly sensitive to the cost of estimating the channel state information (CSI), the impact of CSI cost and imperfections on the capacity of index modulation has not been adequately characterized until now. As a result, the marginal cost/benefit of each additional antenna, and the optimal antenna alphabet have remained unclear. This study computes the spectral efficiency of index modulation subject to training and determines optimal antenna alphabets. Our approach involves a comprehensive examination of the influence of pilot power and degrees of freedom on the achievable rate of index modulation. The results include 2.5dB improvement over the best previously known bound for 4\\times2\nspatial modulation at 6b/s/Hz. Additionally, we determine the conditions under which single-antenna transmission is superior to spatial modulation, and vice versa. Moreover, this training-based spectral efficiency analysis is extended to the multiuser uplink, identifying the number of users that can be accommodated while maximizing the uplink sum-rate under spatial modulation.}

	abstract = {Network slicing at the radio access network (RAN) domain, called RAN slicing, requires elasticity, efficient resource sharing, and customization. In this scenario, radio resource scheduling (RRS) is responsible for dealing with scarce and limited frequency spectrum resources available at the RAN domain while fulfilling the slice intents. The wide variety of scenarios supported in 5G and beyond 5G networks makes the RRS problem in RAN slicing scenario a significant challenge. This paper proposes an intent-aware reinforcement learning method to perform the RRS function in a RAN slicing scenario. The slice’s quality of service intents is described in a common intent model in a service-level agreement. The proposed method tries to prevent intent faults by making the management of radio resources available among slices. This method uses slices’ and user equipment network metrics in the observation space. The proposed method is evaluated under different network conditions and outperforms different baselines considering the slices’ intents fulfillment.}

This paper is the first work to propose the intelligent omni surface (IOS)-assisted FD multi-input single-output (MISO) FD communication systems to mitigate SI, which solves the frequency-selectivity issue. In particular, two types of IOS are proposed, energy splitting (ES)-IOS and mode switching (MS)-IOS. We aim to maximize data rate and minimize SI power by optimizing the beamforming vectors, amplitudes and phase shifts for the ES-IOS and the mode selection and phase shifts for the MS-IOS. However, the formulated problems are non-convex and challenging to tackle directly. Thus, we design alternative optimization algorithms to solve the problems iteratively. Specifically, the quadratic constraint quadratic programming (QCQP) is employed for the beamforming optimizations, amplitudes and phase shifts optimizations for the ES-IOS and phase shifts optimizations for the MS-IOS. Nevertheless, the binary variables of the MS-IOS render the mode selection optimization intractable, and then we resort to semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and Gaussian randomization procedures to solve it. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithms’ efficacy and show the effectiveness of both the IOSs in mitigating SI compared to the case without an IOS.}

We use Jensen’s inequality to upper bound the spectral efficiency and leverage the relaxed objective to derive closed-form expressions for the optimal polarization angles at each antenna. We also derive upper bounds on the performance of a polarization reconfigurable system and develop an efficient procedure for polarization reconfiguration that aims to maximize these upper bounds.

Subsequently, we conceive a near-optimal RIS phase design for a single-user scenario to alleviate the beam-squint effect of the wideband system. As for the multi-user case, we provide a virtual-subarray-based phase shift design, which mitigates the beam-squint effect as well as the mitigates deleterious effects of beam concentration. Numerical results show that the achievable data rate can be significantly improved by the proposed schemes compared to the benchmarks both in the single-user and multi-user cases. Explicitly, in the multi-user system, by leveraging the virtual-subarray-based phase design, the achievable sum-rate can be doubled compared to the conventional benchmarks.}

However, the MAC algorithm given in Tang et al., (2018) only contains the component of “random access scheme”. The systematic extension presented in this paper takes the algorithm closer to practice by adding the components of “fast adaptation algorithm” and “random scheduling approach”. With a careful design to satisfy an independence assumption, such extension enabled the theoretical performance analysis of the MAC algorithm using the well known Markov model, as well as meaningful performance comparison with existing distributed MAC protocols such as the 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF). Simulation results demonstrated the significant potential in throughput improvement of the distributed MAC algorithm compared with the 802.11 DCF, due to the support of flexible multi-packet reception.}

In the considered model, one IRS is deployed to assist the communication from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to the multi-antenna users that are clustered into several groups. Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming matrices of the BS, the receive beamforming matrices of the users, and the phase shifts of the IRS. To solve this non-convex problem, we first use a block diagonalization method to represent the beamforming matrices of the BS and the users by the phase shifts of the IRS. Then, substituting the expressions of the beamforming matrices of the BS and the users, the original sum-rate maximization problem can be transformed into a problem that only needs to optimize the phase shifts of the IRS. To solve the transformed problem, a manifold method is used. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve up to 28.6% gain in terms of the sum rate of all users compared to the algorithm that optimizes the hybrid beamforming matrices of the BS and the users using our proposed scheme and randomly determines the phase shifts of the IRS.}

	abstract = {This paper considers improving wireless communication and computation efficiency in federated learning (FL) via model quantization. In the proposed bitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their local FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which, in turn, aggregates them into a quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to jointly determine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and the set of devices participating in FL training at each iteration. We pose this as an optimization problem that aims to minimize the training loss of quantized FL under a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay requirement. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve without (i) a concrete understanding of how quantization impacts global ML performance and (ii) the ability of the server to construct estimates of this process efficiently. To address the first challenge, we analytically characterize how limited wireless resources and induced quantization errors affect the performance of the proposed FL method. Our results quantify how the improvement of FL training loss between two consecutive iterations depends on the device selection and quantization scheme as well as on several parameters inherent to the model being learned. Then, to address the second challenge, we show that the FL training process can be described as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method to optimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL, this model-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical characterization of the FL training process to discover an effective device selection and quantization scheme without imposing additional device communication overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm can reduce the convergence time by 29% and 63% compared to a model free RL method and the standard FL method, respectively.}

The main idea is to resolve angular overlaps among the signals that base stations receive from users in the wireless network. In this method, users randomly become active and try to access their corresponding base stations. Then, they periodically participate in a carefully designed game wherein only winners get to remain active. In this game, the probability of winning among a group of contenders is a direct function of having relatively higher transmission power, better channel conditions, and more correlated directions of arrival to the angles that the base stations estimate. We analytically prove that this game can guarantee the resolution of the so-called angular overlap, which enables effective beamforming and leads to pilot decontamination. We also support our statements through Monte Carlo simulations.}

Compared with channel estimation methods based on predefined basis or offline dictionary learning, in this paper, we design an online two-timescale joint uplink/downlink dictionary learning and channel estimation (TTS-JDLCE) algorithm for dynamic scenarios, where the channel sparsity and angle reciprocity between uplink and downlink transmissions are both exploited to reduce the pilot overhead. The downlink channel estimation is constructed as a TTS stochastic optimization problem with a constraint coupled by the long-term dictionary and short-term sparse channel representations. Treating the dictionary as a learnable parameter, the proposed algorithm can capture dynamic spatial information for enhancing performance. By introducing a relaxed TTS primal-dual decomposition (PDD) framework, the original problem is decomposed into a long-term online dictionary learning subproblem and a family of short-term sparse channel estimation subproblems. Besides, the deep unfolding technique is employed to extract gradient information from short-term problems, which circumvents the non-closed form and non-convexity of long-term subproblem by constructing a convex surrogate problem. Finally, simulations show that the proposed method remarkably reduces the pilot overhead and achieves significant performance gains over various baselines.}

	abstract = {The existing multiple-input single-output (MISO) design to transmit data reliably to multiple mobile users (MUs) has become insufficient as MUs require fresh data, not just data. Therefore, in this paper, we consider multi-user MISO networks, where a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serves MUs that want to maintain data freshness. To analyze the data freshness in this network, we first define the age-of-information (AoI) violation ratio, which is the ratio of duration that the AoI is larger than the AoI violation threshold to a sensing period. We then obtain the upper bound on the AoI violation ratio using the smooth maximum/minimum unit. We consider an optimization problem that minimizes the AoI violation ratio of multiple MUs. We propose a generalized power iteration (GPI) precoding algorithm to find a principal precoding vector that satisfies a first-order optimality condition of the optimization problem. Furthermore, for the scenario where the BS has the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of MUs, we provide the upper bound on the AoI violation time using the lower bound on the ergodic spectral efficiency, and also design the GPI precoding algorithm. Simulation results show proposed methods outperform baseline methods and demonstrate the effect of network parameters on the AoI violation probability.}

	abstract = {On-demand deployment of mobile communication infrastructure has emerged as a promising solution for extending cellular coverage in rural areas. However, most current research focuses on theoretically optimizing the trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays/base stations in simplified geographic scenarios. These network-side attempts have failed to provide low-cost, practical solutions to remove today’s digital gap. This paper proposes a large-scale simulation methodology based on real-life, high-precision geographic data. With its help, we provide a user-centric approach to coverage extension using follow-me relays. We focus on the rural case exemplified by Indiana, U.S., and present quantitative coverage analyses via channel simulation. Our results show that one UAV relay added to follow the user of interest at 10m high can effectively bring over 20% more area into coverage from the user’s point of view. With the relay added at 50m, the most challenging channel the network has to deal with to guarantee 90% area-wise coverage will experience a 20dB path loss reduction. These site-specific analyses can also be applied to future wireless network planning problems, including network-side equipment deployment simulation and optimization for millimeter-wave and terahertz communications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the application of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in a two-tier wireless backhaul heterogeneous network (HetNet), where a macro base station (MBS) simultaneously transmits wireless access signals to multiple macro-cell users (MCUs) and wireless backhaul signals to small base stations (SBSs) by leveraging RSMA. Furthermore, to explore the potential advantage of common streams in RSMA systems, we develop a “Hybrid RSMA” scheme in which the MBS only employs RSMA to encode the backhaul messages while each MCU’s message is directly encoded without rate-splitting. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system’s spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly considering transmit precoding and rate allocation at the MBS and SBSs. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we first propose an iterative centralized algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we further develop an efficient decentralized algorithm that can be executed in parallel at the MBS and each SBS based on the local channel state information with fewer signaling exchanges. Simulation results show that the application of RSMA can achieve higher SE over conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space division multiple access (SDMA) under different network loads. Particularly, “Hybrid RSMA” has a greater performance improvement than “RSMA” in the underloaded system.}

	abstract = {The requirement for massive connectivity in 5G and beyond 5G systems pose new challenges to random access protocol design. As a promising technique to afford massive short packet connections, unsourced random access (URA) gains traction. However, the existing URA schemes were developed for static channels and not implementable in fast fading channels. In this paper, we propose a novel URA strategy tailored to time-varying Rayleigh fading channels when the system loads and instantaneous channels are unknown to the receiver. With a time slotted transmission framework, we devise a low-complexity error correcting code and a decoding algorithm leveraging successive interference cancellation (SIC). The receiver corrects errors across slots by using SIC to decode the transmitted messages from highly interfering superposed signals. The asymptotic error rate is derived and a trade-off between the minimum required energy required for reliable communication and the user density is analyzed. Our simulation results verify that the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal energy efficiency performance when the system load is in the moderate system load regime and a significant performance gain over the existing URA schemes in time varying fading channels.}

	abstract = {The conventional method of designing the desired beampattern in MIMO systems involves the computation of the waveform covariance and/or weight matrices. In this work, through some simple derivations, it is demonstrated that there are infinitely many covariance matrices that yield the same beampattern. Furthermore, when beam is created using weighted sums of orthogonal waveforms, there are infinitely many weight matrices that also generate the same beampattern. Thus, the conditions for the beampattern invariance are formulated with respect to the covariance and the weight matrices. This theoretical foundation allows the transmitted waveform to be altered, without changing the beampattern and the orthogonal radar waveforms. Methods for the computation of beampattern-invariant covariance and weight matrices are proposed. Consequently, it is demonstrated that there is additional degrees of freedom in the design space of many applications, such as the dual-function radar communication (DFRC), in which information can be embedded in radar transmissions while keeping the radar function intact. Other potential applications are peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction at the radar transmitter and deceptive jamming avoidance.}

In particular, the geographic information is employed to capture the blockage effects for air-to-ground (A2G) links caused by buildings, and a realistic blockage-aware A2G channel model is proposed to characterize the continuous variation of the channels at different locations. Based on the proposed channel model, we formulate the joint optimization problem of UAV three-dimensional (3-D) positioning and resource allocation, by power allocation, user association, and subcarrier allocation, to maximize the minimum achievable rate among users. To solve this non-convex combinatorial programming problem, we introduce a penalty term to relax it and develop a suboptimal solution via a penalty-based double-loop iterative optimization framework. The inner loop solves the penalized problem by employing the block successive convex approximation (BSCA) technique, where the UAV positioning and resource allocation are alternately optimized in each iteration. The outer loop aims to obtain proper penalty multipliers to ensure the solution of the penalized problem converges to that of the original problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over other benchmark schemes in terms of the minimum achievable rate.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel communication design, termed random orthogonalization, for federated learning (FL) in a massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. The key novelty of random orthogonalization comes from the tight coupling of FL and two unique characteristics of massive MIMO – channel hardening and favorable propagation. As a result, random orthogonalization can achieve natural over-the-air model aggregation without requiring transmitter side channel state information (CSI) for the uplink phase of FL, while significantly reducing the channel estimation overhead at the receiver. We extend this principle to the downlink communication phase and develop a simple but highly effective model broadcast method for FL. We also relax the massive MIMO assumption by proposing an enhanced random orthogonalization design for both uplink and downlink FL communications, that does not rely on channel hardening or favorable propagation. Theoretical analyses with respect to both communication and machine learning performance are carried out. In particular, an explicit relationship among the convergence rate, the number of clients, and the number of antennas is established. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of random orthogonalization for FL in massive MIMO.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a new multi-device edge artificial-intelligent (AI) system, which jointly exploits the AI model split inference and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to enable low-latency intelligent services at the network edge. In this system, multiple ISAC devices perform radar sensing to obtain multi-view data, and then offload the quantized version of extracted features to a centralized edge server, which conducts model inference based on the cascaded feature vectors. Under this setup and by considering classification tasks, we measure the inference accuracy by adopting an approximate but tractable metric, namely discriminant gain, which is defined as the distance of two classes in the Euclidean feature space under normalized covariance. To maximize the discriminant gain, we first quantify the influence of the sensing, computation, and communication processes on it with a derived closed-form expression. Then, an end-to-end task-oriented resource management approach is developed by integrating the three processes into a joint design. This integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) design approach, however, leads to a challenging non-convex optimization problem, due to the complicated form of discriminant gain and the device heterogeneity in terms of channel gain, quantization level, and generated feature subsets. Remarkably, the considered non-convex problem can be optimally solved based on the sum-of-ratios method. This gives the optimal ISCC scheme, that jointly determines the transmit power and time allocation at multiple devices for sensing and communication, as well as their quantization bits allocation for computation distortion control. By using human motions recognition as a concrete AI inference task, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance of our derived optimal ISCC scheme.}

However, due to the passive feature of the RIS, it is challenging to acquire the instantaneous channel state information for RIS-user links. This paper investigates the outage-constrained transmission design for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems under interference channel based on channel distribution information. The transmission design problem is formulated to maximize the sum transmission rate under constraints of the tolerable outage probability of each user, the power budget of each transmitter and the phase shift coefficient of each reflecting element. To solve the computational intractable problem, a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM)-based algorithm is proposed where the feasible set is separated w.r.t. variables into several blocks, and for each block, a computationally efficient surrogate subproblem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, the non-decreasing behavior and optimality performance of the proposed algorithms are theoretically analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is more computational efficient than traditional alternative optimization based algorithm, and the proposed the outage-constrained transmission design is able to suppress the average outage rate to a required level as well as maximizing the sum transmission rate.}

	abstract = {Since the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology can flexibly change wireless network links signal, the UAV-IRS network system is a potential solution to increase the communication performance gain. Motivated by the practicality of UAV-IRS networks, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) heterogeneous UAV communication system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is considered, which consists of multiple UAV base stations (UBSs), a macro base station (MBS), and multiple IRSs for auxiliary communications. This paper pursues a goal to receive the system energy efficiency (EE) maximization by resource allocation and reflecting design of IRSs. Due to the strong coupling among multiple parameters in the original problem, this complex non-convex problem is decomposed into three stages. In the first stage, this paper decouples the problem into two subproblems of NOMA subchannel assignment and SIC decoding order to find the optimal solution separately. For the second stage, under the constraints of UAV’s maximum transmit power, users’ quality of service (QoS) requirements, user energy harvesting threshold and cross-layer interference constraints, a beamforming design based on Lagrangian duality is exploited. For the third stage, the power splitting (PS) factors and the reflecting phases of the IRS are jointly optimized using the penalty-SDR algorithm to approximate the suboptimal solution. Finally, the simulation curves exhibit the validity and excellent performance of the co-design scheme in improving the system EE.}

We further derive some analytical results of the optimal weights for the statical combining in terms of minimizing the BER or maximizing the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that, in non-turbulent channels, the statical combining for maximizing the average SNR can always outperform the equal-gain combining, especially when the difference between signal strengths on different branches is large. Besides, more weights should be allocated to the branches with either larger signal strength or small turbulent variances. Fortunately, in practical SOC systems, the branch with larger signal strength usually enjoys smaller turbulent variance.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) full-duplex (FD) is a promising technique for improving capacity by maximizing the utilization of both time and the rich mmWave frequency resources. Still, it has restrictions due to FD self-interference (SI) and mmWave’s limited coverage. Therefore, this study dives into FD mmWave MIMO with the assistance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for capacity improvement. First, we demonstrate the angular-domain reciprocity of FD antenna arrays under the far-field planar wavefront assumption. Accordingly, a strategy for joint downlink-uplink (DL-UL) channel estimation is presented. For estimating the SI channel, the direct channel, and the cascaded channel, the Khatri-Rao product-based compressive sensing (KR-CS), distributed CS (D-CS), and two-stage multiple measurement vector-based D-CS (M-D-CS) frameworks are proposed, respectively. Additionally, we propose a passive beamforming optimization solution based on the angular-domain cascaded channel. With hybrid beamforming architectures, a novel hybrid weighted minimum mean squared error method for SI cancellation (H-WMMSE-SIC) is proposed. Simulations have revealed that joint DL-UL processing significantly improves estimation performance in comparison to separate DL/UL channel estimation. Particularly, when the interference-to-noise ratio is less than 35 dB, our proposed H-WMMSE-SIC offers spectral efficiency performance comparable to fully-digital WMMSE-SIC. Finally, the computational complexity is analyzed for our proposed methods.}

	abstract = {To reduce the downlink beam sweep overhead of mmWave systems, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based dynamic beam selection (DRL-DBS) method. A new learning motivation is presented by analyzing the dynamic change laws of high- and low-frequency channels in the spatial domain: to learn the index offset between the optimal beam of mmWave and sub-6 GHz spatial spectrum. In the DRL-DBS method, we propose a novel action space where actions can dynamically adjust the size of the beam sweep subset according to the high- and low-frequency channel propagation laws. Hence, the DRL-DBS method can predict a mmWave downlink beam sweep subset with dynamic size, and the optimal beamforming index is from beam sweep results on the subset. A dual-input dueling Q-network with noisy networks and prioritized experience replay is designed to select the optimal action. The DRL-DBS method can achieve a dynamic trade-off between mmWave beam selection quality and beam sweep overhead based on the reward function. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the DRL-DBS method compared with the existing strategies. Especially, the DRL-DBS method outperforms the exhaustive search algorithm in achievable rate because the overhead of mmWave beam sweep is considered.}

	abstract = {In the analysis of wireless networks, the standard signal-to-interference (SIR) distribution does not capture the performance at the individual link level. The meta distribution (MD) of the SIR resolves this problem by separating different sources of randomness, such as fading and point process(es). While it allows for a much sharper performance characterization, it can in most cases only be calculated based on the moments of the underlying conditional distribution, i.e., by solving a Hausdorff moment problem. Several methods to reconstruct MDs from the moments have been proposed but a rigorous analysis, comparison of their performance, and practical implementations are missing. In addition, a standard is needed for a consistent and objective comparison. This paper addresses the above-mentioned important shortcomings, introduces a tweaking mapping for adjusting approximations, presents terminology to categorize the quality of approximations, proposes the use of the Fourier-Legendre method, which has not previously been applied to MDs, and provides the achievable lower and upper bounds on the MD given the first n\nmoments. Further, to facilitate the use of MDs, we give comprehensive guidance on the selection of the best method to determine MDs, and we offer ready-to-use implementations of the proposed algorithms. This study fills an important gap in the literature by rigorously analyzing the MDs, comparing the performance of different methods, and offering user-friendly implementations for recovering MDs from moments.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is considered a promising modulation technology for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, which is robust against Doppler effects in time-frequency doubly-selective channels. However, limited by the communication bandwidth and frame duration, the fractional delay and Doppler problem in OTFS-ISAC systems, that is, the delay and Doppler of the channel are not integer multiples of the resolutions, leading to estimation errors. To help overcome this issue, in this work, we propose an amplitude barycenter calibration (ABC) algorithm, which uses observation points on the integer delay-Doppler grid to calibrate target estimates, thereby providing satisfactory sensing performance without broadening the bandwidth. In addition, the estimation error and Cramér–Rao lower bound of the ABC algorithm were derived by analyzing its sensing performance. The results demonstrated that the proposed ABC algorithm can improve distance and velocity sensing resolution while achieving acceptable communication performance.}

We provide approximations to the spatial bandwidth at the center of the receiving array, of the form C R^{-B}\n, where R\nis the radial distance, and C\nand B\nare directional-dependent and piecewise constant in R\n. The approximations are valid in the entire radiative region, that is, for R\ngreater than a few wavelengths. When the length of the receiving array is small relative to R\n, the product of the array length and the spatial bandwidth provides an estimate of the available spatial degree-of-freedom (DOF) in the channel. In a case study, we apply these approximations to the evaluation of spatial multiplexing regions under random orientation conditions. The goodness-of-fit of the approximations is demonstrated and some interesting findings about the DOF performance of the channel under 3D and 2D orientation restrictions are obtained, e.g., that, under some conditions, it is better to constrain the receiving array orientation to be uniform over the unit circle in the 2D ground plane rather than uniform over the 3D unit sphere.}

	abstract = {Federated multi-task learning (FMTL) is a promising edge learning framework to fit the data with non-independent and non-identical distribution (non-i.i.d.) by leveraging the statistical correlations among the personalized models. For many practical applications in wireless communications, the sensory data are not only heterogeneous but also non-stationary due to the mobility of terminals and the randomness of link connections. The non-stationary heterogeneous data may lead to model divergence and staleness in the training stage and poor test accuracy in the inference stage. In this paper, we shall develop an adaptive FMTL framework, which works well with non-stationary data. We further propose to optimize the model updating and cluster splitting schemes in the training stage to accelerate model convergence. We also design low-complexity model selection schemes and pruning schemes in both the training and inference stages to select the best model for fitting the current data and delete redundant models, respectively. The proposed framework is validated in the edge learning model, namely, the linear regression problem for wireless indoor localization and graph neural network for wireless power control. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accelerate the model training convergence and reduce the computation complexity while ensuring model accuracy.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated access and backhaul (IAB) has recently received considerable interest for its advantage in reducing the expenses related to the deployment of fiber optics, such as the Terragraph proposed by Meta’s Connectivity Lab. Terragraph networks aim to provide high-speed internet access to dense urban environments. However, due to the vulnerability to blockages and high path loss associated with mmWave frequencies, the proper deployment planning of mmWave networks is required to achieve the desired service quality. By obtaining a stable power supply through its tether connected to the ground, tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted base station (BS) can provide reliable communication service with the sacrifice of limited mobility. In this paper, we investigate the potential of incorporating tethered UAVs into Terragraph-like networks. To this end, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that aims to minimize the overall deployment cost by optimizing the number of required UAVs and terrestrial BSs (TBSs), the hovering positions of deployed UAVs, and the multi-hop backhauling topology. Unlike the conventional DRL frameworks that focus on maximizing the expected cumulative or average reward, we formulate the proposed framework based on the max-Bellman optimality equation in order to maximize the maximum reward. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to yield significant reduction in terms of deployment cost. We also use case studies from cities in Asia, Europe, and North America to verify the practical applicability of the proposed framework.}

This paper studies a long-term average energy transaction expenditure minimization problem for smart-grid powered heterogeneous cellular networks (SG-HCNs) where renewable energy is introduced. Renewable energy and wireless channel dynamics evolve over different timescales. Thus, we seek a two-timescale dynamic resource management solution in SG-HCNs, where the real-time joint issue of flow control, power allocation, and energy sharing of renewable energy, and the ahead-of-time two-way energy trading are considered. Based on a two-layer Lyapunov framework, a two-timescale dynamic optimization (TTDO) algorithm is developed for the proposed problem. Specifically, the real-time joint issue is decoupled into two subproblems, addressed by linear programming and successive convex approximation methods. An approximate solution for ahead-of-time two-way energy trading is achieved via the stochastic subgradient approach, where past data of related random events is referred to as prior knowledge that is required but difficult to acquire. Theoretically, the proposed TTDO algorithm can attain an asymptotic optimum and ensure queue stability. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and reveal that the proposed TTDO algorithm can obtain lower energy transaction expenditure than benchmarks. Besides, the proposed TTDO algorithm presents an energy-saving property.}

Our simultaneous beam training and target sensing (SBTTS) scheme enables the base station to perform beam training with the user terminals (UTs) and the RIS, and simultaneously to sense the targets. Based on our findings, the energy of the echoes from the RIS is accumulated in the angle-delay domain while that from the targets is accumulated in the Doppler-delay domain. The SBTTS scheme can distinguish the RIS from the targets with the mixed echoes from the RIS and the targets. Then we propose a positioning and array orientation estimation (PAOE) scheme for both the line-of-sight channels and the non-line-of-sight channels based on the beam training results of SBTTS by developing a low-complexity two-dimensional fast search algorithm. Based on the SBTTS and PAOE schemes, we further compute the angle-of-arrival and angle-of-departure for the channels between the RIS and the UTs by exploiting the geometry relationship to accomplish the beam alignment of the ISAC system.

However, blockchain often results in lengthy access latencies and can hardly guarantee the quality of off-chain services. The problems stem from the intrinsic flaws of blockchain in dealing with off-chain services such as wireless access. In this study, we propose a unified framework that guarantees service quality and low establishment latency for blockchain-based systems, and incentivizes clients and service providers (SPs) to cooperate without a trusted third party. We use wireless access service in blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) as a typical example and provide a detailed implementation design. We model the service delivery process in our framework and identify the necessary condition for achieving trusting cooperation. Interestingly, we find the necessary condition is also sufficient for cooperation if the service framework is properly designed. Furthermore, we uncover a trade-off between system robustness and transmission efficiency, which offers insightful guidance for framework design in practice. Finally, we present simulation results to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed wireless access scheme.}

Despite the discrete nature of the RIS, current design approaches often treat the RIS as a continuous radiating surface, which is subsequently discretized. Here, we investigate the connection between the two approaches in an attempt to bridge the two different perspectives. We analytically find the factor that renders the two approaches equivalent and we demonstrate our findings with examples of RIS elements modeled as antennas with commonly used radiation patterns and properties consistent with antenna theory. We analyze the equivalence between the two theoretical approaches with respect to design aspects of the RIS elements, such as gain, directivity and coupling between elements, with the aim to provide insight into the observed discrepancies, the understanding of which is crucial for assessing the RIS efficiency.}

Practical codes and the fundamental limit of communications are unknown for interference channels as mathematical analysis becomes intractable. Hence, simple heuristic coding schemes are used in practice to mitigate interference, e.g., time division, treating interference as noise, and successive interference cancellation. These schemes are nearly optimal for extreme cases: when interference is strong or weak. However, there is no optimality guarantee for channels with moderate interference. Here we combine deep learning and network information theory to overcome the limitation on the tractability of analysis and construct finite-blocklength coding schemes for channels with various interference levels. We show that carefully designed and trained neural codes using network information theoretic insight can achieve several orders of reliability improvement for channels with moderate interference. Furthermore, we present the interpretation of the learned codes based on the codeword distance and the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) analysis.}

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important task due to its far-reaching applications, such as surveillance, healthcare systems, and human-computer interaction. Recently, Channel State Information (CSI)-based HAR has attracted increasing attention in the research community due to its ubiquitous availability, good user privacy, and fewer constraints on working conditions. Most of the existing methods for CSI-based HAR use various deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformers, to distinguish activities based on their temporal patterns. Despite their remarkable effectiveness, these methods solely focus on temporal patterns while ignoring the correlations among sub-carriers. This limitation prevents them from achieving further performance improvement. Moreover, recent works often involve advanced yet massive and inefficient neural architectures, like Transformers, to obtain satisfactory recognition accuracy. The performance gain is traded off with a steep increase in model complexity, which leads to low efficacy and high training/inference costs outsides the small time window. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight CSI-based HAR model. Our model makes the first effort to explore the graphical correlations of CSI sub-carriers, working in conjunction with a temporal causal convolution module. The high efficacy design enables our model to be highly effective without requiring excessive model complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including a strong Transformer-based baseline. It achieves an average improvement of 8 percentage points in recognition accuracy, with only 10% of the parameters compared to the Transformer-based method (4.95M vs. 49.24M). Additionally, our model is significantly faster, with empirical training and execution times at least 2.07 times faster than the baseline.}

	abstract = {As one of the significant supporting technologies for mobile virtual reality (MVR), computer vision is latency-sensitive and always requires real-time response and accurate object analysis. However, the limited computational resources of mobile devices lead to high service delay and low analysis quality, resulting in poor quality of service (QoS). By placing the edge service entities (SEs) of the video tasks on the edge server close to the mobile users, a satisfactory QoS can be obtained for MVR systems. Most of the previous works are restricted to optimizing QoS through service placement, while ignoring the key impact of the network access point and video frame resolution selections on QoS. In this paper, we propose an edge service entity placement model, which aims to jointly optimize service delay and analysis quality for MVR systems. Specifically, we design an efficient dynamic edge service entity placement scheme (EDSP-Edge) based on the block coordinate descent theory, which dynamically determines the selection strategies of network access points, service entities and video frame resolutions for users to effectively improve the QoS. We theoretically analyze the performance of EDSP-Edge and get the gap between EDSP-Edge and the optimal performance. Finally, extensive real-data driven simulations are conducted to show that the EDSP-Edge performs close to the optimal scheme and achieves at least 22% performance improvement compared with previous works.}

	abstract = {Channel aging poses a huge challenge for the MU-MIMO (Multi-user Multiple-Input-Multiple Output) communications. To alleviate the problem, channel prediction is widely regarded as a promising mean. Existing channel prediction methods usually rely heavily on the assumption of parametric models. Severe performance degradation might occur when modeling error exists, which is unfortunately common in practice due to the complicated nature of wireless channels. To address the problem, we propose to use nonparametric regression methods for prediction. Nonparametric methods enjoy the advantage of not relying on the model assumption at all, enabling it very suit for making inference from complex channel data. In this paper, we present two nonparametric regression methods for MU-MIMO’s channel prediction, i.e., k-nearest neighbors (kNN) regression and its improved version, local polynomial regression (LPR). In addition, we propose to employ the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to select the parameters in LPR, whereby we get the conclusion that local linear regression is recommended in practical applications. Furthermore, for the case of predicting the right singular matrix of the channel in specific, we provide a useful preprocessing procedure. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed nonparametric regression methods can outperform significantly the conventional parametric methods for channel prediction.}

While previous works in NOMA were mainly focused on either infinite blocklength performance or finite blocklength performance with Gaussian inputs, we obtain the information-theoretic achievable rates accurate up to second-order as a function of the blocklength for both NOMA users employing finite-alphabet inputs subject to the average total power constraint. Taking advantage of the theoretical results, we formulate the rate and error-rate performance optimization problems in the finite blocklength regime for finite-alphabet inputs, from which the optimal power allocation and constellation-rotation can be derived. Furthermore, polar codes and LDPC are employed to demonstrate how close their performances are from the second-order achievable bound when the blocklength is short. Our results are important in machine-type or IoT communications where lightweight modulations and short blocklength are more relevant compared with traditional Gaussian-inputs assumption.}

	abstract = {In recent years, long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) has attracted considerable attention due to its ability to realize massive machine-type communication (MTC); however, its throughput is limited by the duty cycle (DC). Packet-level index modulation (PLIM) can increase throughput by utilizing a data packet’s frequency channel and transmission timing as the information-bearing index. In PLIM, a node selects a specific transmission resource (frequency channel and timing) within a frame and transmits a packet. If the node cannot transmit the packet at the specific transmission resource, it discards the packet. This packet discard results in throughput degradation of each node. Thus, this paper proposes an index mapping scheme that divides a frame into multiple subframes to provide each node with multiple transmission opportunities. A node performs channel activity detection (CAD) at the selected transmission resource within a subframe; if the node cannot transmit a packet, it moves to the next subframe. The proposed scheme adaptively maps the information bit sequence onto a transmission resource within each subframe based on the wireless environment and communication quality. Computer simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves throughput by increasing the transmission opportunities and reducing the packet discard rate under the constraint of DC.}

However, the spherical-wavefront wireless transmission caused by large aperture array presents huge challenges for channel state information (CSI) acquisition and beamforming. Two independent parameters (physical angles and transmission distance) should be simultaneously considered in XL-MIMO beamforming, which brings severe overhead consumption and beamforming degradation. To address this problem, we exploit the near-field channel characteristic and propose two low-overhead hierarchical beam training schemes for near-field XL-MIMO system. Firstly, we project near-field channel into spatial-angular domain and slope-intercept domain to capture detailed representations. Then we point out three critical criteria for XL-MIMO hierarchical beam training. Secondly, a novel spatial-chirp beam-aided codebook and corresponding hierarchical update policy are proposed. Thirdly, given the imperfect coverage and overlapping of spatial-chirp beams, we further design an enhanced hierarchical training codebook via manifold optimization and alternative minimization. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the superior performances on beamforming and training overhead.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends unified wireless signals to estimate one sensing target and communicate with a multi-antenna communication user (CU) simultaneously. We consider two sensing target models, namely the point and extended targets, respectively. For the point target case, the BS estimates the target angle and the reflection coefficient as unknown parameters, and we adopt the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation as the sensing performance metric. For the extended target case, the BS estimates the complete target response matrix, and we consider three different sensing performance metrics including the trace, the maximum eigenvalue, and the determinant of the CRB matrix for target response matrix estimation. For each of the four scenarios with different CRB measures, we investigate the fundamental tradeoff between the estimation CRB for sensing and the data rate for communication, by characterizing the Pareto boundary of the achievable CRB-rate (C-R) region. In particular, we formulate a new MIMO rate maximization problem for each scenario, by optimizing the transmit covariance matrix at the BS, subject to a different form of maximum CRB constraint and its maximum transmit power constraint. For these problems, we obtain the optimal transmit covariance solutions in semi-closed forms by using advanced convex optimization techniques. For the point target case, the optimal solution is obtained by diagonalizing a composite channel matrix via singular value decomposition (SVD) together with water-filling-like power allocation over these decomposed subchannels. For the three scenarios in the extended target case, the optimal solutions are obtained by diagonalizing the communication channel via SVD, together with proper power allocation over two orthogonal sets of subchannels, one for both communication and sensing, and the other for dedicated sensing only. Finally, numerical results show the C-R region achieved by the optimal design in each scenario, which significantly outperforms that by other benchmark schemes such as time switching.}

	abstract = {When wideband signals propagate in a rich-scatterer environment, we obtain abundant resolvable multiple transmission paths to form a number of virtual antennas. Therefore, substantial spatial gain can be attained by carefully waveforming in all these resolvable transmission paths without additional antennas. This resultant spatial gain is then exploited for improving the performance of integrated-data-and-energy-transfer (IDET) from a single transmitter to multiple receivers. We aim to maximise the downlink fair-throughput and sum-throughput, while satisfying the energy harvesting requirements by jointly optimising the waveformers at the transmitter and the power splitters at the receivers. A low-complexity fractional-programming (FP) based alternating algorithm is proposed to solve these non-convex optimisation problems. The non-convex wireless energy transfer (WET) constraints are transformed to be convex with a modified quadratic transform (MQT) method. As a result, the stationary points for both the fair-throughput and the sum-throughput maximisation problems are obtained. The numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed algorithm over a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) scheme, a zero-forcing (ZF) scheme and a time-reversal (TR) scheme. Simulation results show that the wireless data transfer (WDT) performance of our scheme outperforms the single-input-single-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiple-access (SISO-OFDMA) when the output direct current (DC) power requirement is high. When we have a practical individual subcarrier power constraint, the WDT performance of our scheme outperforms multiple-input-single-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplex-access (MISO-OFDMA).}

We derive a received signal in terms of optical analysis to consider the variability of the focal region for different carrier frequencies in a wideband multi-carrier system. By taking full advantage of the beam squint effect for multiple pilot signals with different frequencies, we propose a novel reconfiguration of antenna array (RAA) for the sparse LAA and a max-energy antenna selection (MS) algorithm for the AoA estimation. In addition, this paper presents an analysis of the received power at the single antenna with the maximum energy and compares it to simulation results. In contrast to previous studies on LAA that assumed a large number of antennas, which can require high complexity and hardware costs, the proposed RAA with MS estimation algorithm is shown that meets the requirements of 5G V2X in a vehicular environment while utilizing limited RF hardware and has low complexity.}

By leveraging the UAV’s high altitude and mobility, it can proactively establish short-distance line-of-sight links with devices to mitigate the communication straggler effect and improve communication efficiency in FL. Specifically, we present the convergence analysis of FL without convexity assumptions, demonstrating the effect of device scheduling on the global gradients. Based on the derived convergence bound, we aim to minimize the completion time of FL training by jointly optimizing device scheduling, UAV trajectory, and time allocation. This problem explicitly incorporates the devices’ energy budgets, dynamic channel conditions, and convergence accuracy of FL constraints. Despite the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its structure to decompose it into two sub-problems and further derive the closed-form solutions via the Lagrange dual ascent method. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the tradeoff between completion time and test accuracy compared to existing benchmarks.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the rigid body localization (RBL) problem using an unsynchronized sensor network, where clock offsets between sensors and anchors are present. We first investigate RBL using unsynchronized time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem by analyzing the rank of the Fisher Information Matrix. When the condition is fulfilled, a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) problem is formulated to jointly estimate the position and rotation angles of the rigid body together with the clock offsets. Besides the non-convex nature, the CWLS problem contains nonlinear constraints resulting from the orthogonality property of the rotation matrix. To solve this difficult problem, we propose to apply semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to relax it as a convex semidefinite program. Furthermore, we investigate the RBL problem using hybrid TOA and angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis shows better performance of RBL by hybrid TOA-AOA than by AOA only when more than one anchors are used. The CWLS problem is extended to include the AOAs and the associated SDR method is derived. Finally, mean square error analysis shows that the proposed methods are able to achieve the CRLB performance under small Gaussian noise. Numerical results confirm the theoretical analyses and validate the performance of the proposed methods.}

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution to supporting resource-intensive applications on mobile devices (MDs), which enables computation offloading from MDs to edge servers at their proximities. However, the quality of the communication links and the limited communication and computing resources significantly impact the performance of MEC systems. In this paper, we leverage the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to assist the computation offloading and balance the computing workloads in a multi-server MEC system with limited communication and computing resources. Specifically, when a nearby edge server is overwhelmed by multiple computing tasks, some MDs can be redirected to potentially distant but lighter-loaded edge servers by employing passive beamforming enabled by RISs. Thus, to maximize the task completion rate, we formulate a joint optimization problem for user association, passive beamforming at RISs, receive beamforming at BSs, and computing resource allocation on edge servers. Since the problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is challenging to solve, we first decompose it into two tractable subproblems through the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and then solve them by the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method and a swap matching-based algorithm, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that the task completion rate can be significantly increased by incorporating RISs into multi-server MEC systems. Besides, the proposed algorithms outperform other benchmark schemes in terms of both the task completion rate and the design complexity.}

This paper proposes an efficient and standard-compliant PKG scheme in 802.11 MIMO-OFDM (multiple-input multiple-output, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) networks. Firstly, we propose to extract secret keys from a novel feature referred to relative channel state information (RCSI), which can eliminate the non-reciprocity caused by transceiver mismatch and synchronization errors. Specifically, the RCSIs are derived through dividing the channel state informations (CSIs) of non-reference antennas by those of reference antennas. By setting the spatial mapping matrices of the sounding packets as permutation matrices, the reference antennas are determined implicitly without the need for information exchange. Secondly, based on the 802.11 low-density parity-check code (LDPC), we propose an adaptive information reconciliation algorithm, which is flexible to fit the various scenarios with different key lengths and bit disagreement ratios. At last, the overall PKG procedure with detailed frame format design is provided. The proposed scheme is evaluated through an 802.11ax link-level simulation. Numerical results show that the key generation rate of the proposed scheme can achieve 0.47~14Mbps for practical settings.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel deep learning-based algorithm for channel prediction and energy efficiency (EE) optimisation in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided Terahertz communication system. Specifically, a multi-antenna base station with an IRS with massive reflecting elements is designed to serve multiple moving users. A deep learning-based prediction-optimisation scheme is presented where we first propose a transformer encoder with channel index embedding (TE-CIE) deep learning model for time-varying channel prediction. With the help of channel prediction, an EE optimisation algorithm is then designed to maximise the EE in advance based on the predicted channel state information (CSI). Finally, we combine both methods to construct a deep learning-based prediction-optimisation scheme. Specifically, the future CSI is predicted by TE-CIE and the IRS phase-shift and precoding matrices are optimised in advance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed channel prediction method achieves close-to-optimal performance in terms of low mean absolute error and a much faster speed than the two baseline models. We demonstrate that the proposed EE optimisation algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of much better EE under diverse parameter settings. Finally, the proposed prediction-optimisation scheme achieves at least twice the EE improvement compared to the baseline methods in the literature.}

	abstract = {The emerging deterministic networking (DetNet) has stimulated an increasing enthusiasm for the investigation of supporting deterministic, ultra-reliable, and low-latency services. However, the time-varying channel characteristics and bursty data traffic bring uncertainties for transmission, thereby making the assurance of deterministic quality-of-service (QoS) a challenging issue in practice. In this paper, we are interested in supporting the deterministic QoS demand in a massive access scenario by reducing the bit dropping rate incurred by delay violation. To minimize the bit dropping rate, a cross-layer scheduling scheme with joint channel and buffer awareness is highly desired to efficiently adjust the resource allocation among users, whose complexity increases exponentially with the number of users. Fortunately, the complexity issue can be relieved by adopting the mean-field approximation approach, which can substantially simplify the design and analysis of the cross-layer scheduling scheme with massive users. Two threshold-based scheduling policies are proposed, which have low computational complexity. Besides, we also derive the deadline-constrained capacity for massive access, which is substantially superior to that of single user transmissions. Numerical results will demonstrate the effectiveness of the mean-field approximation based cross-layer scheduling scheme.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as an important enabling technology for the sixth-generation (6G) network. Recently, modulating information in reflection patterns of RIS, referred to as reflection modulation (RM), has been proven in theory to have the potential of achieving higher transmission rate than existing passive beamforming (PBF) schemes of RIS. To fully unlock this potential of RM, we propose a novel superimposed RIS-phase modulation (SRPM) scheme for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where tunable phase offsets are superimposed onto predetermined RIS phases to bear extra information messages. The proposed SRPM establishes a universal framework for RM, which retrieves various existing RM-based schemes as special cases.Moreover, the advantages and applicability of the SRPM in practice is also validated in theory by analytical characterization of its performance in terms of average bit error rate (ABER) and ergodic capacity. To maximize the performance gain, we formulate a general precoding optimization at the base station (BS) for a single-stream case with uncorrelated channels and obtain the optimal SRPM design via the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Furthermore, to avoid extremely high complexity in maximum likelihood (ML) detection for the SRPM, we propose a sphere decoding (SD)-based layered detection method with near-ML performance and much lower complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRPM, precoding optimization, and detection design. It is verified that the proposed SRPM achieves a higher diversity order than that of existing RM-based schemes and outperforms PBF significantly especially when the transmitter is equipped with limited radio-frequency (RF) chains.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) signals are sensitive to blockages in wireless channels. Traditional mmWave transceiver designs intend to harvest both beamsteering and spatial multiplexing gains, but without considering the potential change in the channel state incurred by sudden blockages. In this paper, we propose a blockage-resilient hybrid transceiver design for supporting robust data transmissions in the face of dynamic blockages. Upon exploiting the spatial structure of mmWave channels, we formulate a weighted spectral efficiency maximization problem by utilizing the statistical information concerning the potential future blockages of different path clusters, which uniquely distinguishes this work from existing transceiver optimization problems. On the basis of alternating optimization, we propose a two-stage algorithm to deal with the resultant non-convex problem riddled with highly coupled variables. First, we alternatively optimize the fully digital transmit precoder and receive equalizer by transforming the optimization problem into a quadratic form. Based on the Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) framework, the optimal fully digital precoder and equalizer can be found by exploiting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the matrix monotonic method. Then, inspired by the sparse signal recovery philosophy, the hybrid analog/digital transceiver structure is designed for approximating the fully digital solution. Our numerical results show that the proposed design strikes an improved throughput vs. blockage-resilience trade-off compared to existing schemes, which demonstrates its superiority.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit great advantages in data collection from ground sensors in vast tracts of fields. Due to their limited power supply, most works assume that the UAV simply traverses each sensor’s fixed transmission range to collect data, thereby shortening the flight path. However, they neglect the quality of collected data, which may deteriorate dramatically as the transmission distance increases. In this paper, by leveraging the physical-layer protocol - LoRa, we propose a Packet Reception Ratio (PRR)-based probabilistic coverage model to evaluate the quality of data transmission, which directly determines the data acquisition efficiency. On this basis, to minimize the energy consumption of UAV and sensors while ensuring high-quality data acquisition, we formulate the UAV trajectory planning as a joint Energy Consumption and data Acquisition Efficiency (ECAE) optimization problem. To tackle the ECAE problem, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based two-stage scheme. First, an attention-based encoder-decoder model is trained to generate an initial trajectory. Then an intuitive optimization algorithm is devised to further explore the optimal trajectory. Evaluation results show that our scheme can reduce the total energy cost of UAV and sensors by 27.1% as compared to the best baseline’s policy while maintaining a promising PRR.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose and study a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) architecture. In contrast to conventional single-functional RIS (SF-RIS) that only reflects signals, the proposed MF-RIS simultaneously supports multiple functions with one surface, including reflection, refraction, amplification, and energy harvesting of wireless signals. As such, the proposed MF-RIS is capable of significantly enhancing RIS signal coverage by amplifying the signal reflected/refracted by the RIS with the energy harvested. We present the signal model of the proposed MF-RIS, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of multiple users in an MF-RIS-aided non-orthogonal multiple access network. We jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, power allocations as well as the operating modes and parameters for different elements of the MF-RIS and its deployment location, via an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results are provided which show significant performance gains of the MF-RIS over SF-RISs with only some of its functions available. Moreover, we demonstrate that there exists a fundamental trade-off between sum-rate maximization and harvested energy maximization. In contrast to SF-RISs which can be deployed near either the transmitter or receiver, the proposed MF-RIS should be deployed closer to the transmitter for maximizing its communication throughput with more energy harvested.}

Therefore, the locations of dedicated BSs and TBSs are modeled by a Poisson-line-Cox-process (PLCP) and Poisson point process (PPP), respectively. For the proposed network, we first compute the aerial coverage probability and show that the deployment of dedicated BSs improves the coverage probability in both high dense areas and rural areas. We then consider a cellular-connected UAV that has a flying mission and optimize its trajectory to maximize the minimal achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) (Max-Min SINR). To obtain the Max-Min SINR and minimal time trajectory that satisfies the Max-Min SINR, we proposed two algorithms that are practical in large-scale networks. Finally, our results show that the optimal density of dedicated BSs which maximizes Max-Min SINR decreases with the increase of the road densities.}

While mismatched permutation property to a policy may degrade the learning performance and overlooked permutations incurs low sample efficiency, there is still lacking a systematical approach for modeling graph and designing structure of GNNs to harness all permutation properties. Moreover, the information of input feature may lose during updating hidden representations with GNNs, which leads to poor learning performance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to learn permutable wireless policies with multidimensional GNNs, which update the hidden representations of hyper-edges to avoid the information loss. We provide a method to construct graph for a policy, over which a GNN with proper parameter sharing can exploit all possible permutations of the policy. We also investigate the permutability of wireless channels that affects the sample efficiency, and show how to trade off the training, inference, and design complexities of GNNs. To showcase how to design the GNNs within the framework, we consider precoding optimization in different systems. Simulation results validate the gain of the proposed GNNs over existing counterparts from exploiting the permutation prior and avoiding the information loss.}

	abstract = {Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has been expected as a promising architecture that can make full use of computing resources of idle vehicles to increase computing capability. However, most current VFC architectures only focus on the local region and ignore the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of computing resources, resulting in that some regions have idle computing resources while others cannot satisfy the requirements of tasks. To further improve the overall computing resource utilization in the whole network, in this work, we propose a hierarchical VFC architecture, where neighboring regions can share their idle computing resources. Considering the high complexity of both inter- and intra-region cooperative task offloading in such a hierarchical VFC architecture, we put forward a distributed task offloading strategy based on multi-agent reinforcement learning in which the multi-agent reinforcement learning method is designed to learn each task vehicle’s offloading strategy in a distributed manner. Moreover, to tackle the inefficiency caused by the multi-agent credit assignment problem, we provide the counterfactual multi-agent reinforcement learning approach which exploits a counterfactual baseline to evaluate the action of each agent. Simulation results validate that the proposed hierarchical VFC architecture can effectively improve the global task computing efficiency and the proposed mechanism outperforms the baseline algorithms.}

However, the cost and hardware complexity of full-digital beamforming in existing related studies are high, especially for the systems with massive antennas. This paper studies the robust secure transmission for IRS-aided NOMA networks with cost-effective hybrid beamforming. Specifically, we deploy an IRS to assist the secure transmission from a base station with cost-effective hybrid beamforming to a cell-center user (U1) and a cell-edge user (U2), with the existence of a potential eavesdropper. Two schemes are proposed for guaranteeing the secure transmission of U1 with the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI), respectively. With the perfect CSI, the secrecy rate of U1 is maximized subject to the constant modulus constraint and the quality of service (QoS) constraint of U2 via optimizing the hybrid beamforming and phase shifts of IRS. With the imperfect CSI, the achievable rate at U1 is maximized, satisfying its worst-case eavesdropping rate constraint, the constant modulus constraint and the QoS constraint of U2. Because of the non-convexity, we first decompose each problem into two subproblems, respectively. Then, the subproblems are solved via the penalty-based algorithm and the successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that the two proposed schemes have higher energy efficiency and can boost the security of IRS-aided NOMA networks with perfect and imperfect CSI, respectively.}

Existing deep learning architectures for downlink CSI feedback and recovery show promising improvement of UE feedback efficiency and eNB/gNB CSI recovery accuracy. One notable weakness of current deep learning architectures lies in their rigidity when customized and trained according to a preset number of antenna ports for a given compression ratio. To develop flexible learning models for different antenna port numbers and compression levels, this work proposes a novel scalable deep learning framework that accommodates different numbers of antenna ports and achieves dynamic feedback compression. It further reduces computation and memory complexity by allowing UEs to feedback segmented DL CSI. We showcase a multi-rate successive convolution encoder with under 500 parameters. Furthermore, based on the multi-rate architecture, we propose to optimize feedback efficiency by selecting segment-dependent compression levels.

In this paper, we propose a {s} tructured matrix {r} ecovery {t} echnique (SMART) for CM DOA estimation via fully exploiting the two structures. In particular, we reformulate the highly nonconvex CM DOA estimation problems in the noiseless and noisy cases as equivalent rank-constrained Hankel-Toeplitz matrix recovery problems, in which the Vandermonde structure is captured by a series of Hankel-Toeplitz block matrices, of which the number equals the number of snapshots, and the CM structure is guaranteed by letting the block matrices share a same Toeplitz submatrix. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is applied to solve the resulting rank-constrained problems and the DOAs are uniquely retrieved from the numerical solution. Extensive simulations are carried out to corroborate our analysis and confirm that the proposed SMART outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the maximum number of locatable sources and statistical efficiency.}

	abstract = {Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been regarded as a viable solution to the spectrum shortage problem. To find idle spectrum, partial spectrum sensing could be employed by selecting a suitable sensing window (SW). Since the SW selection determines how many available bands to access, the transmission performance after the access could be used to guide the SW selection. Hence, a sophisticated joint design on spectrum sensing and access is necessary, which, however, is a challenging task when considering the dynamic nature of spectrum environment, and also the mutual impact among different secondary users (SUs). In this paper, we propose a joint partial spectrum sensing and power allocation (PA) scheme to facilitate SUs to make the best decisions on SW and PA to maximize the network throughput with reduced mutual interference. Considering the environmental dynamics and spectrum uncertainty, we develop a viable solution based on hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HMADRL). Our solution enables mutual design with two stages: making each SU learn the best SW and PA strategies autonomously while adapting to the dynamic environment. By using both simulated spectrum data and real spectrum data measured by SAM60-BX, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The integration of millimeter wave and higher frequencies into 5G and 6G networks raises concerns about potential conflicts with existing satellite services that operate in the same or adjacent frequency bands. This paper analyzes the co-channel interference and out-of-band (OOB) leakage power from terrestrial networks to satellites, and offers design criteria for terrestrial networks to protect existing satellite services. Specifically, we establish the power spectral density of a multicarrier transmitted signal, enabling us to derive the in-band and OOB emission powers for arbitrary pulse shaping and interpolation filters employed in a terrestrial transmitter. We then establish the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the aggregated interference from terrestrial networks to a satellite receiver using stochastic geometry tools. Based on this CDF, we derive closed-form expressions that impose limits on terrestrial node density and spectrum emission masks, ensuring a near-zero satellite outage probability. By defining an interference threshold based on satellite protection criteria, our analysis enables the identification of an optimal trade-off between terrestrial node density and transmit power, providing robust theoretical guidance for formulating regulations pertaining to terrestrial networks. Extensive simulations validate our analysis results, demonstrating as an example the feasibility of cellular coexistence with LEO satellites in the 47.2-50.2 GHz band. Our approach effectively controls both in-band interference from a terrestrial network to fixed satellite services and OOB interference to passive Earth exploration satellite services in the adjacent band, while satisfying the required satellite interference thresholds.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the sensing-aided physical layer security (PLS) towards Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. A well-known limitation of PLS is the need to have information about potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The sensing functionality of ISAC offers an enabling role here, by estimating the directions of potential Eves to inform PLS. In our approach, the ISAC base station (BS) firstly emits an omnidirectional waveform to search for potential Eves’ directions by employing the combined Capon and approximate maximum likelihood (CAML) technique. Using the resulting information about potential Eves, we formulate secrecy rate expressions, which is a function of the Eves’ estimation accuracy. We then formulate a weighted optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the secrecy rate with the aid of the artificial noise (AN), and minimize the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) of targets’/Eves’ estimation. By taking the possible estimation errors into account, we enforce a beampattern constraint with a wide main beam covering all possible directions of Eves. This implicates that security needs to be enforced in all these directions. By improving estimation accuracy, the sensing and security functionalities provide mutual benefits, resulting in improvement of the mutual performances with every iteration of the optimization, until convergence. Our results avail of these mutual benefits and reveal the usefulness of sensing as an enabler for practical PLS.}

The proposed approach partitions RIS to optimize the channel conditions for NOMA users, improving NOMA gain and eliminating the requirement for uplink (UL) power control. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated under four practical operational regimes; 1) Quality-of-Service (QoS) sufficient regime, 2) RIS and power efficient regime, 3) max-min fair regime, and 4) maximum throughput regime, each subject to both UL and downlink (DL) QoS constraints. By leveraging decoupled nature of RIS portions and base station (BS) transmit power, closed-form solutions are derived to show how optimal RIS partitioning can meet UL-QoS requirements while optimal BS power control can ensure DL-QoS compliance. Analytical findings are validated by simulations, highlighting the significant benefits that RISs can bring to the NOMA networks in the aforementioned operational scenarios.}

	abstract = {Recently, Reduced Capability (RedCap) New Radio (NR) User Equipment (UE), which has smaller cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than normal NR UE, was introduced by 3GPP in R17. In particular, the UE energy consumption is an important metric of interest. Small Data Transmission (SDT) technology has been proposed by 3GPP to save UE power, which allows UEs to directly transmit small-sized uplink payloads in Inactive state without transitioning to Connected state. However, for a large number of RedCap UEs with bursty traffic, how to minimize UE energy consumption while ensuring the reliability of uplink payload transmission is still a challenge. Towards this end, we propose a novel Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-enhanced SDT scheme to tackle this challenge. Considering that the power level pool is an important component of NOMA to achieve performance gains and the power level pool design problem in multi-cell scenarios is still rarely studied, we present a Multi-Agent Dueling Double Deep Q Network (MAD3QN)-based algorithm to further improve the performances of the proposed scheme by optimizing the power level pool for each gNB with practical imperfect Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). Extensive numerical comparisons among the proposed scheme and multiple benchmarks show that the proposed scheme (with appropriate user pairing) can significantly improve the transmission reliability of large-scale RedCap UEs with a small cost of energy consumption.}

	abstract = {Edge-device co-inference refers to deploying well-trained artificial intelligent (AI) models at the network edge under the cooperation of devices and edge servers for providing ambient intelligent services. For enhancing the utilization of limited network resources in edge-device co-inference tasks from a systematic view, we propose a task-oriented scheme of integrated sensing, computation and communication (ISCC) in this work. In this system, all devices sense a target from the same wide view to obtain homogeneous noise-corrupted sensory data, from which the local feature vectors are extracted. All local feature vectors are aggregated at the server using over-the-air computation (AirComp) in a broadband channel with the orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing technique for suppressing the sensing and channel noise. The aggregated denoised global feature vector is further input to a server-side AI model for completing the downstream inference task. A novel task-oriented design criterion, called maximum minimum pair-wise discriminant gain, is adopted for classification tasks. It extends the distance of the closest class pair in the feature space, leading to a balanced and enhanced inference accuracy. Under this criterion, a problem of joint sensing power assignment, transmit precoding and receive beamforming is formulated. The challenge lies in three aspects: the coupling between sensing and AirComp, the joint optimization of all feature dimensions’ AirComp aggregation over a broadband channel, and the complicated form of the maximum minimum pair-wise discriminant gain. To solve this problem, a task-oriented ISCC scheme with AirComp is proposed. Experiments based on a human motion recognition task are conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed scheme over the existing scheme and a baseline.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel beam domain channel model (BDCM) for sixth generation (6G) ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems is proposed by transforming from an existing geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM). Both the GBSM and BDCM consider the special channel characteristics of ultra-massive MIMO, including spherical wavefront and spatial non-stationarity properties. Steering vectors of the spherical wavefront are derived by higher-order Taylor expansion. By sampling the angle and distance rings, steering matrices of the spherical wavefront can be transformed to unitary matrices. This helps to achieve a perfect transformation from the GBSM to the BDCM in the near-field condition. Meanwhile, it opens up a view of beam domain for channel characteristic analysis to reduce the model complexity. Common statistical properties of the GBSM and BDCM in the near-field and simplified far-field steering vector conditions are studied, including spatial cross-correlation functions (SCCFs), temporal autocorrelation functions (TACFs), frequency correlation functions (FCFs), etc. Specific statistical properties, such as the root mean square (RMS) angular spread of the GBSM and RMS beam spread of the BDCM, are studied. Channel capacities of the GBSM and BDCM are investigated and compared with measurement data. It turns out that simulated capacities considering near-field steering vector conditions show good agreements with measured capacities. On the other hand, simulated capacities considering far-field steering vector conditions show a large discrepancy with measured capacities. This indicates that near-field effects need to be included in the channel modeling and performance evaluation of 6G ultra-massive MIMO communication systems.}

	abstract = {Energy or time-efficient scheduling is of particular interest in wireless communications, with applications in sensor network design, cellular communications, and more. In many cases, wireless packets to be transmitted have deadlines that upper bound the times before their transmissions, to avoid staleness of transmitted data. In this paper, motivated by emerging applications in security-critical communications, age of information, and molecular communications, we expand the wireless packet scheduling framework to scenarios which involve strict limits on the time after transmission, in addition to the conventional pre-transmission delay constraints. As a result, we introduce the scheduling problem under two-sided individual deadlines, which captures systems wherein transmitting too late (stale) and too early (fresh) are both undesired. Subject to said two-sided deadlines, we provably solve the optimal (energy-minimizing) offline packet scheduling problem. Leveraging this result and the inherent duality between rate and energy, we propose and solve the completion-time-optimal offline packet scheduling problem under the introduced two-sided framework. Overall, the developed theoretical framework can be utilized in applications wherein packets have finite lifetimes both before and after their transmission (e.g., security-critical applications), or applications with joint strict constraints on packet delay and information freshness.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables communication users with limited computation power to offload computation-intensive tasks to the edge server, thus dramatically enhancing the limited computing capabilities of the users. As the reality of scarce spectrum resources and the energy-constrained nature of communication users, this paper introduces non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) techniques to achieve more efficient task offloading in MEC. To minimize the number of computationally failed tasks while simultaneously satisfying different quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, a joint resource management problem of the spectrum, computation, and energy resources is formulated. Due to the non-convexity of the offloading optimization problem and the stochastic nature of the constructed MEC environment, a multiple agents deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based resource management algorithm is proposed to manage each user’s multidimensional resources without collaborating. The simulation results show that compared to other benchmark schemes, the proposed algorithm can effectively improve both the communication and computational performances in MEC.}

	abstract = {Delay alignment modulation (DAM) is a promising technology to achieve inter-symbol interference (ISI)-free single-carrier communication, by leveraging delay compensation and path-based beamforming, rather than the conventional channel equalization or multi-carrier transmission. In particular, when there exist a few strong time-dispersive channel paths, DAM is able to effectively align different propagation delays and achieve their constructive superposition, thus especially appealing for intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs)-aided communications with controllable multi-paths. In this paper, we apply single-carrier DAM to multi-IRS aided communication and study its design and achievable performance. We first provide an asymptotic analysis showing that when the number of base station (BS) antennas is much larger than the number of IRSs, an ISI-free channel can be established from the BS to the user with appropriate delay pre-compensation and the simple path-based maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. We then consider the general system setup and study the problem of joint path-based beamforming design at the BS and phase shifts design at the IRSs for DAM transmission, by considering the three classical beamforming techniques on a per-path basis, namely the low-complexity path-based MRT beamforming to maximize the desired signal power, the path-based zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming for ISI-free DAM communication, and the optimal path-based minimum mean-square error (MMSE) beamforming to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). As a comparison, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-IRS aided communication is considered for benchmarking. Simulation results are provided which demonstrate the significant performance gain of DAM over OFDM, in terms of spectral efficiency and bit error rate (BER), as well as its lower peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR).}

	abstract = {Coded edge computing is envisioned as a promising solution to cope with the ever-increasing large-scale and computation-intensive mobile applications. Besides alleviating the computation straggling issue, task encoding in coded edge computing is also beneficial to the transmission of computation results. Nonetheless, existing pioneering works in this direction mainly take an information-theoretical perspective and assume the ideal scenarios of high signal-to-noise ratio. To the best of our knowledge, the issue of power control still remains largely unexplored for coded edge computing. In this work, two novel power control schemes are developed for coded edge computing in dynamic wireless environments, which apply to the repetition encoded task computing and the general linearly encoded task computing, respectively. However, the corresponding optimization problems turn out to be non-convex and highly non-trivial. To this end, by exploiting the underlying structural property, a novel partition-based iterative optimization method is developed to obtain the closed-form expression of the optimal dynamic power control strategy for repetition encoded task computing. For the case of more general linearly encoded task computing, the corresponding problem is transformed into a sum-of-ratio problem and then solved iteratively. Simulations are conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where multiple ground devices offload portions of their latency-sensitive and mission-critical computational tasks to a UAV-carried MEC server for remote computing and compute the remaining portions locally. To meet the low-latency requirements of the MEC, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is used to offload tasks from the devices to the UAV. We minimize the maximum computation latency among all devices by jointly optimizing the computing times and CPU frequencies of the devices and the UAV, the offloading bandwidths of the devices, and the three-dimensional location of the UAV. We propose an algorithm that decomposes the joint optimization problem into three subproblems, which optimize the UAV’s horizontal location, the UAV’s altitude, and the offloading bandwidths and computing CPU frequencies, respectively. In solving the subproblems, the data rate expression of the devices’ finite-blocklength offloading is accurately approximated by a tractable logarithmic function, and the successive convex approximation technique is applied to tackle the non-convex structure. Furthermore, a semi-closed-form solution to the subproblem that optimizes the bandwidths and CPU frequencies is derived to reduce the complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the system’s computation latency compared to the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Upcoming large satellite constellations and the advent of tighter steerable beams will offer unprecedented flexibility. Consequently, this will require resource management strategies to be operated in high-dimensional and dynamic environments, as existing satellite operators are unaccustomed to operational flexibility and automation. Frequency assignment policies have the potential to drive constellations’ performance in this new context, but are no exception to scalability and fast operation requirements. Most of existing frequency assignment methods fail to fulfill these requirements, or are unable to meet them without falling short on efficiency. In this paper we propose a new frequency assignment method that prioritizes operational requirements. We present an algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming that fully defines a frequency plan while respecting key system constraints such as handovers, interference, and gateway dimensioning. We can encode goals such as bandwidth maximization or power reduction and optimize plans according to such objectives. In our experiments on systems with 20 to 5,000 beams, we find this method allocates at least 100% more bandwidth and reduces power consumption by 40% compared to previous benchmarks. To ensure scalability, we also introduce an iterative approach of the formulation, which achieves substantial gains in runtime with minimal loss of performance.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. Channel estimation (CE) of RIS device is a critical but also challenging issue for its development. The mainstream of existing CE methods is confined to the so-called cascaded channel (CscdChn) estimation scheme, which treats the multiplicative two-hop RIS channels as an effective one and measures it as a whole. This CscdChn training method suffers from severe double-fading attenuation loss, which significantly degrades the CE accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel RIS-transmitting (RIS-TX) based CE scheme, which has lower pilot overhead than CscdChn scheme and effectively overcomes the double-fading curse via incorporating only one single transmit radio frequency (RF)-chain into RIS. We develop highly efficient gradient descent (GD) and penalty duality decomposition (PDD)-based solutions to resolve the pilot design task for the RIS-TX CE scheme, which is a difficult quartic optimization problem. Our designed pilot signal outperforms the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) sequence, which is reported to be optimal for CscdChn scheme. Besides, both theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate that our proposed RIS-TX scheme exhibits distinct performance characteristics as opposed to its CscdChn counterpart and yields superior accuracy when RIS device is not extremely large.}

	abstract = {In the upcoming sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are regarded as one of the promising technological enablers, which can provide programmable signal propagation. Therefore, simultaneous radio localization and mapping (SLAM) with RISs appears as an emerging research direction within the 6G ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of RIS-enabled radio SLAM for wireless operation without the intervention of access points (APs). We first design the RIS phase profiles leveraging prior information for the user equipment (UE), such that they uniformly illuminate the angular sector where the UE is probabilistically located. Second, we modify the marginal Poisson multi-Bernoulli SLAM filter and estimate the UE state and landmarks, which enables efficient mapping of the radio propagation environment. Third, we derive the theoretical Cramér-Rao lower bounds on the estimators for the channel parameters and the UE state. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed method under scenarios with a limited number of transmissions, taking into account the channel coherence time. Our results demonstrate that the RIS enables solving the radio SLAM problem with zero APs, and that the consideration of the Doppler shift contributes to improving the UE speed estimates.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has drawn much attention due to its capability in massive connections. It enables various joint designs with advanced technologies, e.g., cooperative transmission and aerial base station (ABS)-assisted networks. In this paper, we consider an efficient NOMA enabled cross-tier joint transmission design. This design jointly applies zero-forcing beamforming and NOMA to realize joint transmission and regular transmission for the users in different tiers. We evaluate the performance of the design under a large-scale clustered ABS-assisted network scenario. Theoretical expressions for the outage probability and area outage spectral efficiency are derived. Numerical results show that, although splitting power may lead to slight degradation for the macro-cell users, the system can still expect a decreased overall outage probability because joint transmission improves the received signal quality for the ABS-tier users. The macro-cell users may not always suffer outage performance degradation since they can keep receiving signals instead of staying idle until the cross-tier joint transmission is suspended as in the orthogonal scheme. Besides, with properly selected NOMA power allocation coefficient, a more reliable communication link can be guaranteed for the macro-cell user, if compared with the conventional orthogonal scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper examines how to minimize the energy consumption of a user equipment (UE) when transmitting short data payloads. The receiving base station (BS) controls a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which requires additional pilot signals to be configured, to improve the channel conditions. The challenge is that the pilot signals increase the energy consumption and must be balanced against energy savings during data transmission. We derive a formula for the energy consumption, including both pilot and data transmission powers and the effects of imperfect channel state information and discrete phase-shifts. To shorten the pilot length, we propose dividing the RIS into subarrays of multiple elements using the same reflection coefficient. The pilot power and subarray size are tuned to the payload length to minimize the energy consumption. Analytical results show that there exists a unique energy-minimizing solution. For small payloads and when the direct path loss between the BS and UE is weak compared to the path loss via the RIS, the solution is using subarrays with many elements and low pilot power and vice versa. The optimal percentage of energy spent on pilot signaling is in the order of 10-40%.}

Different from conventional MIMO systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the proposed system can flexibly change the positions of transmit/receive MAs, such that the MIMO channel between them is reconfigured to achieve higher capacity. We aim to characterize the capacity of MA-enabled point-to-point MIMO communication systems, by jointly optimizing the positions of transmit and receive MAs as well as the covariance of transmit signals. First, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the position of each transmit/receive MA with the other variables being fixed. Next, we propose alternative algorithms of lower complexity for capacity maximization in the low-SNR regime and for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) cases. Numerical results show that our proposed MA systems significantly improve the MIMO channel capacity compared to traditional FPA systems as well as various benchmark schemes, and useful insights are drawn into the capacity gains of MA systems.}

	abstract = {This paper develops fundamental bounds for localization in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Specifically, we start from the assumption that the position and orientation of a RIS can be viewed as prior information for RIS-aided localization in wireless systems and derive Bayesian bounds for the localization of a user equipment (UE). To do this, we first derive the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (FIM) for channel parameters to derive the Bayesian localization bounds. Then, to focus on the geometric channel parameters, we derive the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) and show that it has a definite structure. Subsequently, we show through the information loss associated with the EFIM that when the RIS reflection coefficients remain constant across all OFDM symbols, and there is no prior information about the nuisance parameters, the corresponding submatrix in the EFIM related to the RIS angle parameters is a zero matrix. As a result of the EFIM being a zero matrix, estimating the RIS-related angle channel parameters is not possible when the RIS reflection coefficients remain constant across all OFDM symbols. This observation is crucial for the estimation of the RIS-related angle parameters. It dictates that to estimate the RIS-related angle parameters, there must be more than one OFDM transmission with differing RIS reflection coefficients. Furthermore, due to this observation, we note that localization of a single antenna UE through the signals received from reflections from a single RIS to the UE is not feasible in the far-field when the RIS reflection coefficients remain constant across all OFDM symbols. We also show that the FIM for the RIS-related channel parameters can be decomposed into i) information provided by the receiver, ii) information provided by the transmitter, and iii) information provided by the RIS components. We then transform the Bayesian EFIM for geometric channel parameters to the Bayesian FIM for the UE position and orientation parameters and examine its specific structure under a particular class of RIS reflection coefficients.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC), on the premise of a cost-effective enhancement in the computational ability of hardware-constrained wireless devices (WDs) comprising the Internet of Things (IoT). In a general multi-server multi-user MEC system, each WD has a computational task to execute and has to select binary (off)loading decisions, along with the analog-amplitude resource allocation variables in an online manner, with the goal of minimizing the overall energy-delay cost (EDC) with dynamic system states. While past works typically rely on the explicit expression of the EDC function, the present contribution considers a practical setting, where in lieu of system state information, the EDC function is not available in analytical form, and instead only the function values at queried points are revealed. Towards tackling such a challenging online combinatorial problem with only bandit information, novel Bayesian optimization (BO) based approaches are put forth by leveraging the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework. Per time slot, the discrete offloading decisions are first obtained via the MAB method, and the analog resource allocation variables are subsequently optimized using the BO selection rule. By exploiting both temporal and contextual information, two novel BO approaches, termed time-varying BO and contextual time-varying BO, are developed. Numerical tests validate the merits of the proposed BO approaches compared with contemporary benchmarks under different MEC network sizes.}

We utilize non-orthogonal pilot sequences followed by a polar codeword for transmission in each slot. At the receiver side, we first detect the transmitted pilot sequences by employing a generalized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm and utilize a linear minimum mean square error solution to estimate the channel vectors. We then perform an iterative decoding based on maximal ratio combining, single-user polar decoding, and successive interference cancellation with re-estimation of the channel vectors to recover the data bits. We also analyze the performance of the proposed scheme using normal approximations and provide a detailed complexity analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed scheme either outperforms the existing schemes in the literature or has a competitive performance with a lower complexity.

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance the wireless communication network coverage and capacity by dynamically controlling the radio signal propagation environment. In contrast to the existing works that considered active or passive IRS only, we propose in this paper a new hybrid active-passive IRS architecture that consists of both active and passive reflecting elements, thus achieving their combined advantages flexibly. Under a practical channel setup with Rician fading where only the statistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we study the hybrid IRS design in a multi-user communication system. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable ergodic capacity of the worst-case user by designing the hybrid IRS beamforming and active/passive elements allocation based on the statistical CSI, subject to various practical constraints on the active-element amplification factor and amplification power consumption, as well as the total active and passive elements deployment budget. To solve this challenging problem, we first approximate the ergodic capacity in a simpler form and then propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Moreover, we show that for the special case with all channels to be line-of-sight (LoS), only active elements need to be deployed when the total deployment budget is sufficiently small, while both active and passive elements should be deployed with a decreasing number ratio when the budget increases and exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, numerical results are presented which demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed hybrid IRS architecture and its optimal design over the conventional schemes with active/passive IRS only under various practical system setups.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) equalization for uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output communications. In particular, the transmitters adopt discrete-Fourier transform (DFT)-spread orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to send \\pi /2 -PAM or square-QAM symbols, possibly with frequency-domain spectrum shaping (FDSS). It is well known that, in such cases with improper-complex symbols, widely-linear (WL) equalizers can improve performance over linear equalizers, but at the cost of sometimes drastically increased computational complexity. To overcome this, we exploit the spectral correlation in the received signal induced by the impropriety from \\pi /2 -PAM symbols and the cyclostationarity from the FDSS. The key differences from conventional high-complexity structures are to represent all the symbols as equivalent PAM symbols that are subsequently \\pi /2 -modulated, and to factor the effective channel into the \\pi /2 -modulator, the DFT-spreader, and a partial channel defined in the frequency domain. These representation and factoring enable us to design a low-complexity structure of the WL-MMSE equalizer that performs the signal processing mostly in the frequency domain and involves only sparse and structured matrices. Numerical results show that the proposed structure achieves significantly lower complexity than the conventional structures and that it greatly outperforms the linear MMSE equalizer with a similar complexity.}

The IOS, without the need for additional sensors, divides the entire space into two parts: a communication part and a sensing part. The IOS serves multiple users by providing communication services while also creating a virtual line-of-sight (LOS) link for target sensing. Moreover, the IOS is utilized to ensure physical layer security. Due to the possibility of the sensing target intercepting communication information, it is crucial to limit the information leakage rate. To achieve this, we jointly design the communication beamformers, sensing beamformer, and the IOS’s two phase-shift matrices. This joint design maximizes the sensing beam pattern gain towards the target, while meeting the requirements of the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for communications and the maximum information leakage to possible malicious targets. To address this problem, we propose two types of alternative algorithms. The first type utilizes an independent phase-controlling model, while the second incorporates a coupled-phase model. Both algorithms aim to optimize the IOS’s phase-shift matrices.}

	abstract = {Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deemed a prospective candidate to compensate the double fading attenuation caused by the passive RIS, where each element can reflect and amplify the received signals through its low power integrating amplifiers. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) for a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system through a deployed active RIS to defend multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), where the practical discrete RIS phase shift designs are taken into account. To characterize the secrecy performance, analytical expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and effective secrecy throughput (EST) for an active RIS assisted NOMA (RIS-NOMA) system are derived based on heuristic approximations, which is in consideration of two scenarios with and without direct links. Furthermore, secrecy diversity orders are attained based on theoretical results, of which the convergence rates and gaps between the discrete and continuous phase shifting are further evaluated. The results reveal that a 4-bit quantization can achieve the secrecy diversity order of continuous phase shifts. Numerical results are furnished to corroborate the analyses, and illustrate that the security performance for active RIS-NOMA outperforms the passive RIS-NOMA and conventional cooperation communications under the same total power consumption. The impacts of phase quantization bit, amplification factor and the number of Eves as well as reflective elements on security performance are also substantiated by simulations.}

	abstract = {Next-generation wireless applications are expected to enable extended ultra-reliable low latency communication (xURLLC) to support high data rates along with ultra-high reliability and low end-to-end latency features beyond the capabilities of existing core services. These consolidated data rates and URLLC requirements in resource-constrained systems necessitate the shift from conventional architectures to more powerful and robust multiple access schemes. This paper investigates a multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to prompt an unconventional xURLLC service called mobile broadband reliable low latency communication (mBRLLC) for high spectral efficiency under finite block-length (FBL) transmission constraints. To enable spectral-efficient resource allocation, we formulate a sum throughput maximization problem for joint optimization of precoder design at the base-station (BS), block-length of common and private symbols of each user, and passive beamforming at each RIS. To solve the NP-hardness and non-convexity of the formulated problem, we use an alternating optimization technique to decouple the original problem into three sub-problems: active beamforming at the BS, block-length optimization, and passive beamforming at each RIS which are solved using general convex approximations. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation algorithm over conventional schemes. The considered RSMA system achieves high data rates even with lower latency and higher reliability. Additionally, the investigation encompasses the evaluation of RIS deployment implications, the analysis of the worst-case latency scenario, and the assessment of the influence of channel estimation errors.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a robust beamforming design in a downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with consideration of bounded channel uncertainty. The goal of the design is to minimize the transmit power by employing the symbol-level precoding (SLP) at the base station (BS), while satisfying the quality-of-service requirements of the primary users (PU) and secondary user (SU). Unlike most existing works where RIS is only a signal reflector, in this paper, RIS also operates as a transmitter and delivers the secondary information to SU by switching the reflecting beamformers. In single-PU scenario, the secondary information recovery (SIR) scheme is proposed and a power minimization problem is formulated. To tackle the non-convex problem, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems to alternately optimize the transmit and reflecting beamformers. Then, two algorithms namely the penalty-based algorithm and the monotone accelerated projected gradient-based algorithm are proposed to address the unit-modulus constraint on the reflecting beamformer. The problem is further extended to the multi-PU scenario and the extended SIR scheme is provided. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and exhibit the advantages of the SIR scheme.}

	abstract = {Fast and precise beam alignment is crucial for high-quality data transmission in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, where large-scale antenna arrays are utilized to overcome the severe propagation loss. To tackle the challenging problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based hierarchical beam alignment method for both multiple-input single-output (MISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which learns two tiers of probing codebooks (PCs) and uses their measurements to predict the optimal beam in a coarse-to-fine search manner. Specifically, a hierarchical beam alignment network (HBAN) is developed for MISO systems, which first performs coarse channel measurement using a tier-1 PC, then selects a tier-2 PC for fine channel measurement, and finally predicts the optimal beam based on both coarse and fine measurements. The propounded HBAN is trained in two steps: the tier-1 PC and the tier-2 PC selector are first trained jointly, followed by the joint training of all the tier-2 PCs and beam predictors. Furthermore, an HBAN for MIMO systems is proposed to directly predict the optimal beam pair without performing beam alignment individually at the transmitter and receiver. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HBANs are superior to the state-of-the-art methods in both alignment accuracy and signaling overhead reduction.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a promising technique to implement network intelligence for the sixth generation (6G) communication systems. However, the collected data in wireless networks is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which leads to severe deterioration of model performance. Although various enhanced schemes are proposed, it is still challenging to balance the communication cost and the model performance, due to the scarcity of radio resource for model update in wireless networks. In this paper, an ensemble federated learning paradigm is proposed for handling non-IID data, which is also optimized for its deployment in wireless networks in a cost efficient way. First, the framework of ensemble federated learning is designed. By formulating individual user clusters, intra-cluster federated learning models can be generated to reduce the impact of non-IID data, which can be integrated to adapt to various learning data via model ensemble. Second, the optimization of user cluster formation is studied to improve the performance of ensemble federated learning, which is modeled as a coalition formation game to design a Nash-stable algorithm. Finally, the simulation results on the public data sets are provided to verify the performance gains of our proposed schemes for deploying federated learning with non-IID data in wireless networks.}

In this LEO DLSN, a Distributed Inter-Layer Topology Optimization (DITO) method is proposed based on time-space relationships between two layers, which can maximize task-aware observation benefits with limited onboard resources. For practical purposes, we take link switching interval constraints into account for the recapture and track of laser transceivers. Besides, we put forward a new time-slot division method based on the link switching interval for the linear modeling of the time-sequential coupling problem. With the simulation results in four constellation systems, the proposed distributed interactive method can obtain an optimal solution close to the centralized global solution with much less time. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can support onboard optimization for future space networks.}

	abstract = {It is known that probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) can provide a shaping-gain of 1.53dB asymptotically as signal-to-noise (SNR) increases. This is however, under ideal assumptions that the system operates in optimal sense and can achieve the Shannon capacity. In practice, the system can operate well below the capacity. In this paper, we propose a PCS-transceiver for the fifth-generation new-radio (5G-NR) evolution that supports quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) constellations shaped with PCS, namely, PCS-QAM, in comparison to conventional uniform QAM constellations, namely, Uniform-QAM. We put a special interest in the throughput achieved under a stringent block-error rate (BLER) constraint, and validate the effectiveness of PCS under practical detection and decoding algorithms. We also analyze the properties of power-gain, entropy-loss, and peak-to-average power-ratio (PAPR), in connections to PCS. As a lower BLER does not necessarily indicate a higher throughput due to entropy-loss from PCS, we further prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for PCS-QAM to outperform Uniform-QAM in throughput is that the normalized entropy-loss with PCS-QAM is less than the BLER obtained with Uniform-QAM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PCS-transceiver is flexible in rate-adaptation without impacting the encoder, and can yield a better throughput-envelope in 5G-NR system.}

	abstract = {To realize an intelligent cooperative vehicle infrastructure system and high-level autonomous driving, the introduction of the joint communication and sensing (JCS) technique in vehicular networks is indispensable. With directional beamforming, the vehicles equipped with JCS systems could utilize unified radio-frequency transceivers and frequency band resources to achieve vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and sensing functions in different directions, respectively. In this concept, we study the computation offloading problem for JCS-based vehicular networks. Specifically, we formulate a long-term multi-objective problem that jointly optimizes the task execution latency and the sensing performance of multiple vehicles. Owing to the time-varying V2I channel gain, the time-varying impulse response of sensed target, and the stochastic traffic, we reformulate it as a Markov decision process and propose a double-stage deep reinforcement learning-based offloading and power allocation (DDOPA) strategy to determine the task offloading and power allocation for each vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy compared with different strategies, and show that the proposed DDOPA strategy can achieve a trade-off between execution latency and sensing performance.}

The sparsity of mmWave channel and the directivity gain of mmWave antenna arrays are considered in the proposed model, and the antenna directivity gain is affected by the beamwidth, i.e., the narrower the beam, the higher the antenna directivity gain. Also, the beamwidth affects the number of active clusters, i.e., the wider the beam, the more the active clusters. Based on the proposed beam channel model, the influence of antenna directivity gain on the channel statistical characteristics including space-time correlation, frequency correlation function, and achievable rate is investigated. It is found that the directional antenna arrays can reduce Doppler spread caused by the movement of UAV and receiver and the mmWave communication systems using directional antenna arrays with high directivity gains can achieve an equivalent performance gain to that of the mmWave communication systems using omni-directional large-scale antenna arrays. Furthermore, considering the correlation between transmit and receive antenna elements, we obtain a closed-form expression of the tight upper bound of achievable rate, which is validated by using previously reported analytical upper bound and the simulation results.}

With practical channel estimation, the packet error probability (PEP) does not have a closed-form expression. To solve the problem, we develop novel model-based and model-free unsupervised deep learning algorithms to train a deep neural network for resource allocation and data transmission. Two types of reliability constraints are considered over a wireless link: 1) average PEP constraint; 2) constraint on the probability that PEP is higher than a threshold. The simulation results show that the learning algorithms can guarantee both types of reliability constraints. Compared with a benchmark that maximizes the number of symbols for data transmission and uses the maximum ratio transmission precoding, the learning method with the codebook-based precoding achieves a lower average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), but improves the resource utilization efficiency by three times. It is because the resource utilization efficiency of URLLC is dominated by the tail distribution of SINR, not the average SINR, and the SINR of the benchmark has a much longer tail distribution than the learning method.}

	abstract = {Full frequency reuse combined with precoding is a promising solution for multibeam satellite systems (MSSs) to meet the evergrowing capacity demand. However, line-of-sight-dominant satellite-ground channels will cause severe channel correlation among the geographically clustered hotspot users (HUs), which restricts multiuser capacity over HUs. In this paper, we propose the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided hotspot capacity enhancement scheme for MSSs. We formulate a hotspot sum rate maximization problem with SINR constraints added on a different user set and present an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm for its solution. To reduce computational complexity, we propose a two-stage algorithm that sequentially optimizes RIS phase shift with manifold optimization and satellite precoding, no longer resorting to AO. The RIS phase shift design utilizes semi-orthogonal subspace maximization and pairwise channel decorrelation. This design effectively formulates the interplay between RIS phase shifts and transmit beamforming related to the SINR constraint. To circumvent high channel estimation overhead, we extend the algorithms to low-cost designs exploiting statistical channel state information. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed RIS-aided MSS designs substantially enhance HUs’ sum rate, attributed to the RIS-enabled channel refinement mechanism. Moreover, the two-stage algorithm achieves a comparable performance to the AO-based algorithm.}

	abstract = {In physical layer for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), most existing studies focus on the non-delay-sensitive metrics such as the spectral efficiency. In order to improve user’s quality of service (QoS) in delay-sensitive communications, however, effective capacity can be adopted to the NOMA system to consider the QoS metric while analyzing capacity. In this paper, we deduce the closed form expression for effective capacity in downlink NOMA and propose three optimization problems with delay and effective capacity constraints. Firstly, a joint rate and power allocation scheme is proposed to maximize the total effective capacity. Secondly, we deduce the optimal solution of the problem for maximizing the minimum delay QoS exponent. Thirdly, a minimum total transmit power allocation scheme is proposed with the effective capacity constraint. Since the problems of maximizing effective capacity and minimizing total transmit power are non-convex, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to find global optimization solutions. Simulation results show our proposed power and rate allocation scheme maximizes the effective capacity, which is better than orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Meanwhile, the optimal minimum delay QoS exponent and minimum total transmit power with effective capacity constraint have been achieved.}

This paper aims for enhancing the signal space diversity of sparse code multiple access (SCMA) by introducing quadrature component delay to the transmitted codeword of a downlink SCMA system in Rayleigh fading channels. Such a system is called SSD-SCMA throughout this work. By looking into the average mutual information (AMI) and the pairwise error probability (PEP) of the proposed SSD-SCMA, we develop novel codebooks by maximizing the derived AMI lower bound and a modified minimum product distance (MMPD), respectively. The intrinsic asymptotic relationship between the AMI lower bound and proposed MMPD based codebook designs is revealed. Numerical results show significant error performance improvement in the both uncoded and coded SSD-SCMA systems.}

	abstract = {We consider the problem of multi-flow transmission in wireless networks, where data signals from different flows can interfere with each other due to mutual interference between links along their routes, resulting in reduced link capacities. The objective is to develop a multi-flow transmission strategy that routes flows across the wireless interference network to maximize the network utility. However, obtaining an optimal solution is computationally expensive due to the large state and action spaces involved. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm called Dual-stage Interference-Aware Multi-flow Optimization of Network Data-signals (DIAMOND). The design of DIAMOND allows for a hybrid centralized-distributed implementation, which is a characteristic of 5G and beyond technologies with centralized unit deployments. A centralized stage computes the multi-flow transmission strategy using a novel design of graph neural network (GNN) reinforcement learning (RL) routing agent. Then, a distributed stage improves the performance based on a novel design of distributed learning updates. We provide a theoretical analysis of DIAMOND and prove that it converges to the optimal multi-flow transmission strategy as time increases. We also present extensive simulation results over various network topologies (random deployment, NSFNET, GEANT2), demonstrating the superior performance of DIAMOND compared to existing methods.}

	abstract = {This work investigates the secure resource collaboration among selfish edge servers for multi-access edge computing (MEC)-enabled VR systems in a dynamic scenario. Due to the time-varying and stochastic nature of VR user requests, the edge servers usually have significant differences in workload. To this end, we first propose a type judgment method to perceive their service capability and divide them into two types, i.e., the requesting node (RN) with a poor service capability and the cooperative node (CN) with a powerful service capability. To promote collaboration among self-interest nodes, we then model the competitive interactions among RNs and CNs as a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game. For the RN (as the leader), we design a novel pricing strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to motivate CNs to provide resource assistance. Meanwhile, an optimal selling strategy for the CN (as the follower) is presented to maximize its payoffs from the network. To overcome the security problem during the resource collaboration, we finally introduce the blockchain as a secure and trusted platform for resource publishing and trading, where an efficient consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Trust (PoT) is developed to improve the performance of blockchain. The simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have become a popular topic in recent years for their great potential for controlling the radio link environment of wireless networks. With this controlled environment, the coverage can be increased. This paper examines the coverage analysis of IRS-aided networks, considering both two-dimensional buildings and the product-distance path loss model for the first time. Leveraging the tools from stochastic geometry, the locations of base stations (BSs), buildings, and IRSs are modeled with a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). A Gamma approximation for the distribution of the nearest line-of-sight (LoS)-neighbor distance is proposed, leading to a closed-form expression for the distribution of the product-distance. Feasible BSs are defined as BSs which are reachable via an IRS deployed on a specific facade of a building, and the ratio of feasible BSs is derived. Simulations are performed, which confirm the proposed analytical methods. In the numerical results, it is observed that the IRSs can introduce up to a 45% coverage boost, and the effect of the IRS length on the coverage probability is limited beyond 1.2 meters at 60 GHz.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) for 5G is evolving into the extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) to increase the spectrum efficiency by orders of magnitude for 6G communications. ELAA introduces spherical-wave-based near-field communications, where channel capacity can be significantly improved for single-user and multi-user scenarios. Unfortunately, the near-field region at large incidence/emergence angles is greatly reduced with the widely studied uniform linear array (ULA). Thus, many randomly distributed users may fail to benefit from near-field communications. In this paper, we leverage the rotational symmetry of uniform circular array (UCA) to provide uniform and enlarged near-field regions at all angles, enabling more users to benefit from near-field communications. Specifically, by exploiting the geometrical relationship between UCA and users, the near-field beamforming technique for UCA is developed. Based on the analysis of near-field beamforming, we reveal that UCA is able to provide a larger near-field region than ULA in terms of the effective Rayleigh distance. Moreover, a concentric-ring codebook is designed to realize efficient codebook-based beamforming in the near-field region. In addition, we find out that UCA could generate orthogonal near-field beams along the same direction when the focal point of the near-field beam is exactly the zeros of other beams, which has the potential to further improve spectrum efficiency in multi-user communications compared with ULA. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis and feasibility of UCA to enable more users to benefit from near-field communications by broadening the near-field region.}

	abstract = {The development of the intelligent Internet of Things has facilitated the adoption of high-efficiency Multiple Targets Tracking (MTT) in many civil security applications. However, existing MTT technologies cannot offer full capability in accurate and real-time MTT for civil security. Many attractive applications in the next-generation wireless network, like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm, are envisioned to be exploited for enhanced MTT with the advantage of flexibility. Nonetheless, highly dynamic moving targets impose some new challenges. UAVs cannot always perform expected cooperative tracking in conventional architectures as well. To address these problems, we design a tiered Digital Twin-assisted tracking framework in this paper, which leverages multi-grained imitation for real-time and accurate MTT. We imitate a coarse-grained MTT to ensure a high successful tracking ratio. We then design a fine-grained imitation with a reaction-diffusion mechanism to explore the feasible cooperators based on trajectory prediction. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations demonstrate that our tiered framework can reduce 66.7% of the system latency overhead compared to the conventional DDPG benchmark while improving the successful tracking ratio by 30.6%.}

In the STMTCN, UT’s computation task can be processed at different computing entities and a multi-tier computation model named computing depth is proposed to better reflect the multi-tier computing process. Then, we formulate a weighted sum energy consumption minimization problem via jointly optimizing UT-satellite association, computing depth, multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) precoding, and computation resource allocation. The non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into four subproblems, each of which is solved iteratively. Specifically, the UT-satellite association subproblem is solved by quadratic transform based fractional programming and Lagrangian dual method and a closed-form expression is obtained. The computing depth for local tier and the satellite tier is solved respectively with first-order Taylor expansion. Then, MIMO precoding subproblem for UT and satellite offloading is solved by quadratic transform and interior point method (IPM). Finally, the computation resource allocation for UT and satellite is obtained in a closed-form expression and the GW computation resource allocation is solved by using IPM. Simulation results show that the proposed STMTCN and algorithms can fulfill the UT’s computing demands with low energy consumption.}

	abstract = {We present the Hybrid Polar Decoder (HyPD), a hybrid classical–quantum decoder design for Polar error correction codes, which are becoming widespread in today’s 5G and tomorrow’s 6G networks. HyPD employs CMOS processing for the Polar decoder’s binary tree traversal, and Quantum Annealing (QA) processing for the Quantum Polar Decoder (QPD)–a Maximum-Likelihood QA-based Polar decoder submodule. QPD’s design efficiently transforms a Polar decoder into a quadratic polynomial optimization form, then maps this polynomial on to the physical QA hardware via QPD-MAP, a customized problem mapping scheme tailored to QPD. We have experimentally evaluated HyPD on a state-of-the-art QA device with 5,627 qubits, for 5G-NR Polar codes with block length of 1,024 bits, in Rayleigh fading channels. Our results show that HyPD outperforms Successive Cancellation List decoders of list size eight by half an order of bit error rate magnitude, and achieves a 1,500-bytes frame delivery rate of 99.1%, at 1-dB signal-to-noise ratio. Further studies present QA compute time considerations. We also propose QPD-HW, a novel QA hardware topology tailored for the task of decoding Polar codes. QPD-HW is sparse, flexible to code rate and block length, and may be of potential interest to the designers of tomorrow’s 6G wireless networks.}

	abstract = {Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs), such as long-range wide area networks, are increasingly adopted as a communication standard for wireless sensor networks. LPWAN has been adopted for systems that periodically collect data from sensors, such as in environmental monitoring. However, continuous packet collisions may occur in periodic traffic systems owing to the adoption of a simple random-access scheme in LPWAN. In addition, the use of low-cost nodes results in clock drift, rendering the synchronization of nodes in the system challenging. Thus, this study proposes a wireless resource allocation scheme to avoid continuous packet collisions under the adverse effect of such clock drift. In the proposed scheme, the gateway determines the transmission offset and frequency channel for each node utilizing the periodic traffic feature and clock drift. Based on computer simulation results, the proposed scheme can improve the packet delivery rate by over 20% compared with benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {High-rank line-of-sight (LOS) MIMO systems have attracted considerable attention for millimeter wave and THz communications. The small wavelengths in these frequencies enable spatial multiplexing with massive data rates at long distances. Such systems are also being considered for multi-path non-LOS (NLOS) environments. In these scenarios, standard channel models based on plane waves cannot capture the curvature of each wave front necessary to model spatial multiplexing. This work presents a novel and simple multi-path wireless channel parametrization where each path is replaced by a LOS path with a reflected image source. The model is fully valid for all paths with specular planar reflections, and captures the spherical nature of each wave front. Importantly, it is shown that the model uses only two additional parameters relative to the standard plane wave model. Moreover, the parameters can be easily captured in standard ray tracing. The accuracy of the approach is demonstrated on detailed ray tracing simulations at 28GHz and 140GHz in a dense urban area.}

	abstract = {In federated learning (FL), local workers learn a global model collaboratively using their local data by communicating trained models to a central server for privacy concerns. Due to its local nature, FL is typically subject to various heterogeneities, including system and statistical heterogeneity. To address these concerns, Federated Proximal (FedProx) has been considered a promising FL paradigm to provide more stable learning convergence in the presence of computation stragglers and statistical heterogeneity. However, in wireless networks with unreliable communication channels, the errors of packet transmissions should be considered, introducing additional heterogeneity. For the first time, we rigorously prove the convergence of FedProx in the presence of transmission packet errors in heterogeneous networks. In addition, we propose a joint client selection and resource allocation strategy that maximizes the number of effective participating users for convergence acceleration. The method is combined with a random weight mechanism to reduce the statistical bias caused by the client selection strategy. An efficient low-complexity algorithm for solving the optimization problem is developed. The proposed method achieves faster convergence and requires fewer communication rounds to attain accuracy than existing state-of-the-art client selection methods.}

	abstract = {Semantic-aware communication is a novel paradigm that draws inspiration from human communication focusing on the delivery of the meaning of messages. It has attracted significant interest recently due to its potential to improve the efficiency and reliability of communication and enhance users’ quality-of-experience (QoE). Most existing works focus on transmitting and delivering the explicit semantic meaning that can be directly identified from the source signal. This paper investigates the implicit semantic-aware communication in which the hidden information, e.g., hidden relations, concepts and implicit reasoning mechanisms of users, that cannot be directly observed from the source signal must be recognized and interpreted by the intended users. To this end, a novel implicit semantic-aware communication (iSAC) architecture is proposed for representing, communicating, and interpreting the implicit semantic meaning between source and destination users. A graph-inspired structure is first developed to represent the complete semantics, including both explicit and implicit, of a message. A projection-based semantic encoder is then proposed to convert the high-dimensional graphical representation of explicit semantics into a low-dimensional semantic constellation space for efficient physical channel transmission. To enable the destination user to learn and imitate the implicit semantic reasoning process of source user, a generative adversarial imitation learning-based solution, called G-RML, is proposed. Different from existing communication solutions, the source user in G-RML does not focus only on sending as much of the useful messages as possible; but, instead, it tries to guide the destination user to learn a reasoning mechanism to map any observed explicit semantics to the corresponding implicit semantics that are most relevant to the semantic meaning. By applying G-RML, we prove that the destination user can accurately imitate the reasoning process of the source user and automatically generate a set of implicit reasoning paths following the same probability distribution as the expert paths. Compared to the existing solutions, our proposed G-RML requires much less communication and computational resources and scales well to the scenarios involving the communication of rich semantic meanings consisting of a large number of concepts and relations. Numerical results show that the proposed solution achieves up to 92% accuracy of implicit meaning interpretation.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate channel estimation in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user network while taking the mobility of users into consideration. Based on a time-varying channel model, we utilize Kalman filter (KF) that is able to exploit temporal correlation to track cascaded channel. In order to maintain a relatively low pilot overhead, we present a multiple sub-phases based transmission protocol where the number of pilot sequences in each sub-phase is less than the number of users, i.e., pilot contamination exists. For the sake of practicality, we directly utilize discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix as phase shift matrix. We analyze normalized mean square error and provide some asymptotic results. A more practical scenario with hardware impairments (HWI) at the transceiver and the RIS is also considered. Since HWI is also part of the measurement matrix and is unknown to the base station, we propose a joint estimation of the channel and HWI. Under this joint estimation framework, the underlying state space model becomes nonlinear. We develop an extended KF (EKF) algorithm to tackle the nonlinearity through which the model can be linearized. Numerical results show that the proposed KF and EKF algorithms outperform benchmark schemes under various scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance tradeoff for a multi-antenna integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with simultaneous information multicasting and multi-target sensing, in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends the common information messages to a set of single-antenna communication users (CUs) and estimates the parameters of multiple sensing targets based on the echo signals concurrently. We consider two target sensing scenarios without and with prior target knowledge at the BS, in which the BS is interested in estimating the complete multi-target response matrix and the target reflection coefficients/angles, respectively. First, we consider the capacity-achieving transmission and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the achievable rate and the multi-target estimation Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) accordingly. To this end, we design the optimal transmit signal covariance matrix at the BS to minimize the estimation CRB for each of the two scenarios, subject to the minimum multicast rate requirement and the maximum transmit power constraint. It is shown that the optimal covariance matrix consists of two parts for ISAC and dedicated sensing, respectively. Next, we consider the transmit beamforming designs, in which the BS sends one information beam together with multiple a-priori known dedicated sensing beams for effective ISAC and each CU can cancel the interference caused by the sensing signals. By exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, we develop efficient algorithms to obtain the joint information and sensing beamforming solutions to the resultant rate-constrained CRB minimization problems. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the CRB-rate (C-R) tradeoff achieved by our proposed designs, as compared to two benchmark schemes, namely the isotropic transmission and the joint beamforming without sensing interference cancellation. It is shown that the proposed optimal transmit covariance solution achieves much better C-R performance than the benchmark schemes and the proposed joint beamforming with sensing interference cancellation performs close to the optimal transmit covariance solution when the number of CUs is small. We also conduct simulations to show the practical estimation performance achieved by our proposed designs, by considering randomly generated information signals and practical estimators.}

	abstract = {Short-packet communications are applied to various scenarios where transmission covertness and reliability are crucial due to the open wireless medium and finite blocklength. Nonetheless, transmission covertness and reliability present a dilemma and significantly limit the throughput for short-packet communications. Intelligent reflection surface (IRS) is utilized in this paper to address this issue by enabling channel reconstruction, thereby releasing the fundamental limit between transmission covertness, reliability, latency (blocklength), and throughput. Specifically, to reveal the benefits brought by IRS, the achievable throughput without IRS is derived first in terms of the transmission covertness requirement, reliability requirement, and blocklength. Subsequently, the achievable throughput with IRS is derived, which releases the fundamental limit among the above-mentioned performance metrics. Besides, considering the phase uncertainty at IRS and limited channel estimation overhead, the cases where the warder/IRS knows instantaneous/statistical channel state information (CSI) of warder-related/legitimate links are all discussed, elucidating the impacts of CSI availability on the throughput. Furthermore, numerical results verify the accuracy of analytical results and demonstrate the benefits provided by IRS. Especially, the achievable covertness and reliability performance can be enhanced while the minimum required blocklength can be reduced by introducing IRS, which is crucial for short-packet communications.}

	abstract = {This paper considers an integrated sensing and communication system, where some radar targets also serve as communication scatterers. A location domain channel modeling method is proposed based on the position of targets and scatterers in the scattering environment, and the resulting radar and communication channels exhibit a two-dimensional (2-D) joint burst sparsity. We propose a joint scattering environment sensing and channel estimation scheme to enhance the target/scatterer localization and channel estimation performance simultaneously, where a spatially non-stationary Markov random field (MRF) model is proposed to capture the 2-D joint burst sparsity. An expectation maximization (EM) based method is designed to solve the joint estimation problem, where the E-step obtains the Bayesian estimation of the radar and communication channels and the M-step automatically learns the dynamic position grid and prior parameters in the MRF. However, the existing sparse Bayesian inference methods used in the E-step involve a high-complexity matrix inverse per iteration. Moreover, due to the complicated non-stationary MRF prior, the complexity of M-step is exponentially large. To address these difficulties, we propose an inverse-free variational Bayesian inference algorithm for the E-step and a low-complexity method based on pseudo-likelihood approximation for the M-step. In the simulations, the proposed scheme can achieve a better performance than the state-of-the-art method while reducing the computational overhead significantly.}

	abstract = {This paper explores the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in mitigating cross-system interference in spectrum sharing and secure wireless applications. Unlike conventional RIS that can only adjust the phase of the incoming signal and essentially reflect all impinging energy, or active RIS, which also amplify the reflected signal at the cost of significantly higher complexity, noise, and power consumption, an absorptive RIS (ARIS) is considered. An ARIS can in principle modify both the phase and modulus of the impinging signal by absorbing a portion of the signal energy, providing a compromise between its conventional and active counterparts in terms of complexity, power consumption, and degrees of freedom (DoFs). We first use a toy example to illustrate the benefit of ARIS, and then we consider three applications: 1) spectral coexistence of radar and communication systems, where a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize the Frobenius norm of the channel matrix from the communication base station to the radar receiver; 2) spectrum sharing in device-to-device (D2D) communications, where a max-min scheme that maximizes the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the D2D links is developed and then solved via fractional programming; 3) physical layer security of a downlink communication system, where the secrecy rate is maximized and the resulting nonconvex problem is solved by a fractional programming algorithm together with a sequential convex relaxation procedure. Numerical results are then presented to show the significant benefit of ARIS in these applications.}

	abstract = {Wireless short-packet communications pose challenges to the reliability and security of the transmission. Besides, the proactive warder compounds these challenges, who detects and interferes with the potential transmission. Thus, the tradeoff among reliability, covertness, latency (blocklength) and transmission rate is crucial, and efficient system design schemes are required for short-packet communications against the proactive warder. To address these issues, we investigate the reliable and covert performance of above systems. Specifically, detection error probabilities and their approximations are derived for cases where the warder knows the instantaneous/statistical channel state information. Besides, the decoding error probability is derived. The asymptotic relationship among the detection/decoding error probability, blocklength and transmission rate is established, revealing the non-trivial tradeoff between reliability and covertness performance. Furthermore, to maximize the effective throughput, an optimization framework is proposed under reliability and covertness constraints. Numerical results verify the tightness of the approximations and the feasibility of the optimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown that the proactive warder severely degrades the throughput compared to the passive one. And longer blocklength is always beneficial to improve the throughput for systems with optimized transmission rates, whereas the optimal blocklength is not necessarily the maximum one when transmission rates are fixed.}

	abstract = {In backscatter communication (BC), a passive tag transmits information by just affecting an external electromagnetic field through load modulation. Thereby, the feed current of the excited tag antenna is modulated by adapting the passive termination load. This paper studies the achievable information rates with a freely adaptable passive load. As a prerequisite, we unify monostatic, bistatic, and ambient BC with circuit-based system modeling. We present the crucial insight that channel capacity is described by existing results on peak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels, because the steady-state tag current phasor lies on a disk. Consequently, we derive the channel capacity for the case of an unmodulated external field, for general passive, purely reactive, or purely resistive tag loads. We find that modulating both resistance and reactance is important for very high rates. We discuss the capacity-achieving load statistics, rate asymptotics, technical conclusions, and rate losses from value-range-constrained loads (which are found to be small for moderate constraints). We then demonstrate that near-capacity rates can be attained by more practical schemes: 1) amplitude-and-phase-shift keying on the reflection coefficient and 2) simple load circuits of a few switched resistors and capacitors. Finally, we draw conclusions for the ambient BC channel capacity in important special cases.}

This work proposes a novel hybrid-stochastic ultra-wideband channel model for sub-THz bands, developed within the framework of a class of spatio-temporal stochastic processes called the ambit-process. The proposed model is capable of supporting bandwidths of upto 1GHz. The spatio-temporal evolution of the ambit framework allows for a spatially consistent, reasonably accurate and tractable characterization of the fading statistics and multipath propagation of the cellular channels. We leverage a recently proposed convolution-based low-complexity algorithm with necessary modifications to study key features of the microcellular sub-THz channel like associated diffused reflection and scattering, molecular absorption, spatio-temporal correlations, and consistency between the time-evolving delay and Doppler of the multipaths. Simulation results on path loss, shadowing, delay spread, and channel correlations indicate that the ambit model accurately captures the typicalities of an urban microcellular sub-THz channel and agrees well with the measurement results reported in the literature.}

Closed-form analytical expressions for the time average AoI achieved by NOMA assisted grant-free transmission are obtained, and asymptotic studies are carried out to demonstrate that the use of the simplest form of NOMA is already sufficient to reduce the AoI of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) by more than 40%. In addition, the developed analytical expressions are also shown to be useful for optimizing the users’ transmission attempt probabilities, which are key parameters for grant-free transmission.}

We extend OAM multiplexing to OAM-MIMO multiplexing technology, which effectively combines the advantage of OAM multiplexing with that of MIMO-based digital signal processing with multiple uniform circular arrays (multi-UCAs) for line-of-sight wireless transmission. Basically, OAM-MIMO is classified as a practical form of analog-digital hybrid MIMO technology. Our multi-UCA-based OAM-MIMO multiplexing transmission system has two hybrid analog-digital architectures. We evaluated its performance through a comparison with different antenna arrangements and configurations. We implemented antennas of quadruple UCAs, with each UCA having a broadband Butler matrix circuit that generates and separates OAM modes as an analog part of hybrid MIMO on a 28-GHz frequency band. We experimentally demonstrated 130-Gbit/s wireless data transmission with 11 streams using five OAM modes (0, ±1, ±2) at a distance of 10 m. We also demonstrated simultaneous use of OAM-MIMO and polarization multiplexing and achieved wireless transmission over 200 Gbit/s with 21 streams. These results indicate the practicality and effectiveness of our system for high-capacity wireless communication.}

	abstract = {With discrete modulation techniques, such as quadrature amplitude modulation and phase-shift keying, maximum likelihood (ML) signal detection in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems fundamentally relies on convex integer programming, executed efficiently through linear operations. However, for 1-bit massive MIMO systems, the nonlinearity introduced by 1-bit quantization impedes the linear realization of the ML detector. To achieve ML detector performance with manageable computational costs, researchers have proposed a two-stage strategy consisting of relaxed continuous convex programming followed by refinement using discrete search within the candidate solution set surrounding the optimal solution of the relaxed continuous convex programming. This article specifically examines the refinement stage. We demonstrate that it is possible to approximate the ML detection’s log-likelihood function using a 1-degree freedom quadratic function. We subsequently modify the decomposition algorithm for convex integer quadratic programming (CIQP) with a d\n-degree freedom matrix and box constraint. Finally, we employ the modified decomposition algorithm for refinement to obtain an initial candidate solution set, which is then expanded and pruned. This method is referred to as the improved CIQP-based algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the improved CIQP-based algorithm outperforms existing approaches in this domain.}

We treat two settings of multiple users and targets. In the first, we use a single RIS to enhance the communication performance of the ISAC system and design beams with good cross-correlation properties to match a desired beampattern while guaranteeing a desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each user. In the second setting, we use two dedicated RISs to aid the ISAC system, wherein the beams are designed to maximize the worst-case target illumination power while guaranteeing a desired SINR for each user. We propose solvers based on alternating optimization as the design problems in both cases are non-convex optimization problems. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of RIS-assisted ISAC systems. In particular, we show that the proposed single-RIS assisted ISAC system improves the minimum user SINR while suffering from a moderate loss in radar target illumination power. On the other hand, the dual-RIS assisted ISAC system improves both minimum user SINR as well as worst-case target illumination power at the targets, especially when the users and targets are not directly visible to the ISAC transmitter.}

We formulate an optimization problem for both coverage and capacity– in both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL)– which configures the tilt angle, vertical half-power beamwidth (HPBW), and horizontal HPBW of each cell’s antenna array across the network. The novel data-driven framework proposed for this nonconvex problem, inspired by Bayesian optimization (BO) and differential evolution algorithms, is sample-efficient and converges quickly, while being scalable to large networks. By jointly optimizing DL and UL performance, we take into account the different signal power and interference characteristics of these two links, allowing a graceful trade-off between coverage and capacity in each one. Our experiments on a state-of-the-art 5G NR cellular system-level simulator developed by AT&T Labs show that the proposed algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the 3GPP default settings, random search, and conventional BO. In one realistic setting, and compared to conventional BO, our approach increases the average sum-log-rate by over 60% while decreasing the outage probability by over 80%. Compared to the 3GPP default settings, the gains from our approach are considerably larger. The results also indicate that the practically important combination of DL throughput and UL coverage can be greatly improved by joint UL-DL optimization.}

This study investigates the delay and backlog violation behavior of URLLCs and eMBB multiplexing systems supported by different technologies, e.g. RIS and DF relay, for different scheduling policies of static priority, nonpreemption, and earliest deadline first. A tight analysis approach based on the Martingale theory was proposed to evaluate the serviceability of URLLC and eMBB multiplexing systems. On this basis, the Martingale theory analyzes the delay and backlog bounds by transforming the arrival and service processes into exponential forms of the moment generating function. Furthermore, this study derives the closed-form expression of delay and backlog bound for the URLLCs and eMBB multiplexing in two-hop heterogeneous communication networks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Martingale-based tightly analytical method outperforms the state-of-the-art classic stochastic network calculus for evaluating delay and backlog violation in URLLC and eMBB multiplexing systems.}

	abstract = {We consider a broadband over-the-air computation empowered model aggregation approach for wireless federated learning (FL) systems and propose to leverage an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to combat wireless fading and noise. We first investigate the conventional node-selection based framework, where a few edge nodes are dropped in model aggregation to control the aggregation error. We analyze the performance of this node-selection based framework and derive an upper bound on its performance loss, which is shown to be related to the selected edge nodes. Then, we seek to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) between the desired global gradient parameters and the actually received ones by optimizing the selected edge nodes, their transmit equalization coefficients, the IRS phase shifts, and the receive factors of the cloud server. By resorting to the matrix lifting technique and difference-of-convex programming, we successfully transform the formulated optimization problem into a convex one and solve it using off-the-shelf solvers. To improve learning performance, we further propose a weight-selection based FL framework. In such a framework, we assign each edge node a proper weight coefficient in model aggregation instead of discarding any of them to reduce the aggregation error, i.e., amplitude alignment of the received local gradient parameters from different edge nodes is not required. We also analyze the performance of this weight-selection based framework and derive an upper bound on its performance loss, followed by minimizing the MSE via optimizing the weight coefficients of the edge nodes, their transmit equalization coefficients, the IRS phase shifts, and the receive factors of the cloud server. Furthermore, we use the MNIST dataset for simulations to evaluate the performance of both node-selection and weight-selection based FL frameworks.}

	abstract = {Various precoders have been recently studied by the wireless community to combat the channel fading effects. Two prominent precoders are implemented with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The WHT precoder is implemented with less complexity since it does not need complex multiplications. Also, spreading can be applied sparsely to decrease the transceiver complexity, leading to sparse DFT (SDFT) and sparse Walsh-Hadamard (SWH). Another relevant topic is the design of iterative receivers that deal with inter-symbol-interference (ISI). In particular, many detectors based on expectation propagation (EP) have been proposed recently for channels with high levels of ISI. An alternative is the maximum a-posterior (MAP) detector, although it leads to unfeasible high complexity in many cases. In this paper, we provide a relatively low-complexity computation of the MAP detector for the SWH. We also propose two feasible methods based on the Log-MAP and Max-Log-MAP. Additionally, the DFT, SDFT, and SWH precoders are compared using an EP-based receiver with one-tap FD equalization. Lastly, SWH-Max-Log-MAP is compared to the (S)DFT with EP-based receiver in terms of performance and complexity. The results show that the proposed SWH-Max-Log-MAP has a better performance and complexity trade-off for QPSK and 16-QAM under highly selective channels, but has unfeasible complexity for higher QAM orders.}

	abstract = {The strong scattering effects of ultraviolet (UV) signals in the atmosphere enables the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ability of UV communications, but introduces large time dispersion of the channel impulse response (CIR), which inevitably results in serious inter-symbol interferences (ISIs). Because a larger transmitting rate can introduce a larger ISI, it is meaningful to study the impact of CIR on the ISI and further quantify the achievable information rate (AIR) of NLOS UV communications. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of both coplanar and non-coplanar geometries on the CIR for multiple scattering effects and proposed a modified Gamma function (MGF) to precisely characterize the CIR. Based on the MGF model, we quantified the ISIs and derived the bit-error rate (BER) and the AIR under thermal noise for both on-off keying (OOK) modulation and 2-pulse-position modulation (2-PPM) using photon-counting receivers. The simulation results showed that the proposed MGF model can achieve higher fitting precision of both CIRs and BERs compared with the existing Gamma function model. Besides, we demonstrated that when the thermal noise photons are less than 10, the OOK and 2-PPM can achieve an AIR of 15 Mbit/s and 13 Mbit/s, respectively, under typical system geometries.}

	abstract = {The unprecedented growth of industrial Internet of Things applications requires the evolution of wireless networked control system (WNCS). WNCSs are becoming the fundamental infrastructure technologies for critical wireless control applications due to the main benefits of the reduced deployment and maintenance cost, as well as the enhanced flexibility and safety. However, independent designs between communication and control without considering their tight interaction in conventional WNCS lead to poor overall system performance and efficiency. Co-designs are expected to achieve the target control performance while improving the wireless resource efficiency. In this paper, by considering how to allocate wireless resource while guaranteeing control performance, a co-design framework is established based on the finite-time wireless system identification (WSI) - a fundamental problem in systems theory and intelligent control. To this end, two design problems are investigated aiming at maximizing the communication throughput or minimizing the power consumption while guaranteeing the WSI performance. In the former design, the joint optimization of power and channel allocations leads to a non-convex integer combinatorial problem, which is iteratively solved by optimizing the power allocation via Lagrangian method and obtaining the optimal channel allocation via Hungarian algorithm. The minimum number of data samples for guaranteeing the WSI accuracy under confidence level is further derived by exploiting the relationship between WSI accuracy and the number of state sampling processes, which leads to the maximum throughput with respect to both the communication and control processes. In the latter design for energy-efficient WSI, by exploiting the relationship between the power consumption and channel allocation given the WSI performance requirement, the optimization problem can be simplified and solved by Hungarian algorithm. Simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed solutions.}

	abstract = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is a promising solution for diverse applications, including cargo delivery and traffic control. However, it is still challenging to communicate with and control the UAV swarm with high reliability, low latency, and high energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a two-phase command and control (C&C) transmission scheme in a cellular-connected UAV swarm network, where the ground base station (GBS) broadcasts the common C&C message in phase I. In phase II, the UAVs that have successfully decoded the C&C message will relay the message to the rest of UAVs via device-to-device (D2D) communications in either broadcast or unicast mode, under latency and energy constraints. To maximize the number of UAVs that receive the message successfully within the latency and energy constraints, we formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process to find the optimal policy. To address this problem, we propose a decentralized constrained graph attention multi-agent Deep-Q-network (DCGA-MADQN) algorithm based on Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization, where a PID-controller algorithm is utilized to update the Lagrange Multiplier. Simulation results show that our algorithm could maximize the number of UAVs that successfully receive the common C&C under energy constraints.}

	abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and the increasing popularity of camera-equipped devices, many edge video analytics applications are emerging, calling for the deployment of computation-intensive AI models at the network edge. Edge inference is a promising solution to move computation-intensive workloads from low-end devices to a powerful edge server for video analytics, but device-server communications will remain a bottleneck due to limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a task-oriented communication framework for edge video analytics, where multiple devices collect the visual sensory data and transmit the informative features to an edge server for processing. To enable low-latency inference, this framework removes video redundancy in spatial and temporal domains and transmits minimal information that is essential for the downstream task, rather than reconstructing the videos on the edge server. Specifically, it extracts compact task-relevant features based on the deterministic information bottleneck (IB) principle, which characterizes a tradeoff between the informativeness of the features and the communication cost. As the features of consecutive frames are temporally correlated, we propose a temporal entropy model (TEM) to reduce the bitrate by taking the previous features as side information in feature encoding. To further improve the inference performance, we build a spatial-temporal fusion module on the server to integrate features of the current and previous frames for joint inference. Extensive experiments on video analytics tasks evidence that the proposed framework effectively encodes task-relevant information of video data and achieves a better rate-performance tradeoff than existing methods.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key enabling technology for next-generation communication systems. In massive MIMO cellular networks, coordinated beamforming (CBF), which jointly designs the beamformers of multiple base stations (BSs), is an efficient method to enhance the network performance. In this paper, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem in a massive MIMO mobile cellular network, where in each cell a multi-antenna BS serves multiple mobile users simultaneously via downlink beamforming. Although existing optimization-based CBF algorithms can provide near-optimal solutions, they require real-time and global channel state information (CSI), in addition to their high computation complexity. Due to the non-negligible delay of practical backhaul networks and the high-complexity optimization process, it is almost impossible to apply them in mobile cellular networks. Noting that the considered problem under the practical constraints can be modeled as a networked distributed partially observable Markov decision process, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based distributed dynamic coordinated beamforming (DDCBF) scheme, which enables each BS to determine the beamformers with only local CSI and some historical information from other BSs. Besides, the beamformers can be calculated with a considerably lower computational complexity by exploiting neural networks and expert knowledge, i.e., a solution structure observed from the iterative procedure of the centralized optimization algorithms. Moreover, we provide extensive numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based approach. With lower computational complexity and less required information, the results show that the proposed approach can achieve comparable performance to the centralized iterative optimization algorithms.}

We describe a single metallic patch and patch array, as well as their interactions with multiple incident electromagnetic (EM) waves using continuous and discrete strategies. Our models take into account the effect of the incident and scattered angles, polarization features, and the topology and geometry of RISs. In particular, we propose a simple system of linear equations to characterize the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) behaviors of RISs under appropriate assumptions. This model can be used as a fundamental tool for analyzing and optimizing the performance of RIS-aided systems in the far-field regime.

	abstract = {Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) superimposes signals of multiple users and transmits them simultaneously. To be implemented in 5G and beyond orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, it must adhere to the constraint imposed by the standard that the same modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and power must be used across all physical resource blocks (PRBs) assigned to each user. However, the PRBs have different gains in wideband channels and the MCSs must belong to a discrete, pre-specified set. We propose a method that uses the exponential effective signal-to-noise ratio mapping (EESM) to systematically determine whether a feasible power allocation exists for a given choice of MCSs, and to find the MCSs that maximize the weighted sum rate for multiple user NOMA. We then propose a novel power-normalized EESM with backtracking (PB) method. It develops and exploits explicit analytical criteria to check for feasibility. We prove that it is a relaxation of the original problem under various conditions and is exact for narrowband channels. The average weighted sum rate of PB is indistinguishable from that of the EESM-used method despite its lower complexity. It is higher than that of wideband orthogonal multiple access, which is currently employed by 5G.}

We also provide two additional analytical formulations for the PDF and the CDF: ( {i} ) in terms of a continuous mixture of \\kappa - \\mu shadowed distributions, and (ii) as an infinite discrete mixture of Gamma distributions. Such expressions enable to conduct performance analysis under MFTR fading by directly leveraging readily available results for the \\kappa - \\mu shadowed or Nakagami- m cases, respectively. We demonstrate that the MFTR fading model provides a much better fit than FTR and \\kappa - \\mu shadowed models for small-scale measurements of channel amplitude in outdoor Terahertz (THz) wireless links. Finally, the performance of wireless communications systems undergoing MFTR fading is exemplified in terms of classical benchmarking metrics like the outage probability, both in exact and asymptotic forms, and the amount of fading.}

We study in this paper how cell-free massive MIMO can support federated edge learning. Taking advantage of the additive nature of the wireless multiple access channel, over-the-air computation is exploited, where the clients send their local updates simultaneously over the same communication resource. Such an approach, known as over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL), is proven to alleviate the communication overhead of federated learning over wireless networks. Considering channel correlation and only imperfect channel state information available at the central server, we propose a practical implementation of OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO. The convergence of the proposed implementation is studied analytically and experimentally, confirming the benefits of cell-free massive MIMO for OTA-FL.}

	abstract = {Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is of crucial importance in the sixth generation wireless communication networks. Deep learning (DL)-based AMC schemes have attracted extensive attention due to their superior accuracy compared with the conventional methods. However, a pure data-driven DL method relies on a large amount of labeled training samples and the classification accuracy is poor, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In order to tackle this problem, two data-and-knowledge dual-driven AMC schemes are designed. A novel data and semantic knowledge driven AMC scheme is proposed by exploiting the semantic attribute information of different modulations. Moreover, a prior knowledge driven multi-task learning visual model is established to improve the classification performance in low SNR. Furthermore, another novel data and multi-domain knowledge joint driven AMC scheme is proposed by using the semantic attribute knowledge and the prior knowledge based multi-task learning visual model. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed data-and-knowledge dual-driven AMC schemes achieve the best performance compared with the benchmark schemes in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that the expert knowledge spawns for AMC accuracy improvement and a decrease in the required number of training samples.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting is a promising device authentication technique for securing the Internet of Things. It exploits the intrinsic and unique hardware impairments of the transmitters for device identification. Recently, due to the superior performance of deep learning (DL)-based classification models on real-world datasets, DL networks have been explored for RF fingerprinting. Most existing DL-based RF fingerprinting models use a single representation of radio signals as the input, while the multi-channel input model can leverage information from different representations of radio signals and improve the identification accuracy of RF fingerprints. In this work, we propose a multi-channel attentive feature fusion (McAFF) method for RF fingerprinting. It utilizes multi-channel neural features extracted from multiple representations of radio signals, including in-phase and quadrature samples, carrier frequency offsets, fast Fourier transform coefficients and short-time Fourier transform coefficients. The features extracted from different channels are fused adaptively using a shared attention module, where the weights of neural features are learned during the model training. In addition, we design a signal identification module using a convolution-based ResNeXt block to map the fused features to device identities. To evaluate the identification performance of the proposed method, we construct a Wi-Fi dataset using commercial Wi-Fi end-devices as the transmitters and a Universal Software Radio Peripheral platform as the receiver. Experimental results show that the proposed McAFF method significantly outperforms the single-channel-based as well as the existing DL-based RF fingerprinting methods in terms of identification accuracy and robustness.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective solution to improve wireless communication performance through just passive reflection. Recently, the concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) has appeared but the study of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) remain open. In addition to previous works on STAR-RIS, we consider a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) base station (BS) serving multiple user equipments (UEs) at both sides of the RIS. Specifically, in this work, focusing on the downlink of a single cell, we derive the minimum SINR obtained by the optimal linear precoder (OLP) with HWIs in closed form. The OLP maximises the minimum SINR subject to a given power constraint for any given passive beamforming matrix (PBM). Next, we obtain deterministic equivalents (DEs) for the OLP and the minimum SINR, which are then used to optimise the PBM. Notably, based on the DEs and statistical channel state information (CSI), we optimise simultaneously the amplitude and phase shift by using a projected gradient ascent algorithm (PGAM) for both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) STAR-RIS operation protocols with reduced feedback, which is quite crucial for STAR-RIS systems that include the double number or variables compared to reflecting only RIS. Simulations verify the analytical results, shed light on the impact of HWIs, and demonstrate the better performance of STAR-RIS compared to conventional RIS. Also, a benchmark full instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) based design is provided and shown to result in higher SINR but lower net achievable sum-rate than the statistical CSI based design because of large overhead associated with the acquisition of full I-CSI acquisition. Thus, not only do we evaluate the impact of HWIs but we also propose a statistical CSI based design that provides higher net sum-rate with low overhead and complexity.}

	abstract = {The federated learning is a promising machine learning technique to bring about advanced services and application for future industries. It has been known that the federated learning secures the privacy of the participants well so far. However, various attacks appear recently which are possible to extract the private information of them in the federated learning systems. Consequently, development of privacy preserving schemes for the federated learning is paramount. In this paper, we consider the over-the-air computation based federated learning system, and adopt the concept of differential privacy to prevent the private information leakage. During the training process, when a sum of local gradients is received via over-the-air computation, they conceal each other and appear to be random to the parameter server. Motivated by this fact, the differential privacy of the over-the-air computation based federated learning is analyzed by considering the inherent randomness of the local gradients. We analytically quantify required amount of the artificial noise to be added to preserve privacy. Furthermore, a parameter estimation based algorithm is proposed which is applicable in real scenarios. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for preserving privacy.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are recognized as one of the key ingredients of the sixth generation (6G) network. A challenging topic in ISAC is the design of a single waveform combining both communication and sensing functionalities on the same time-frequency-space resources, allowing tuning the performance of both with partial or full hardware sharing. This paper proposes a dual-domain waveform design approach that superposes onto the frequency-time (FT) domain both the legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal and a sensing one, purposely designed in the delay-Doppler domain. With a proper power downscaling of the sensing signal w.r.t. OFDM, it is possible to exceed regulatory bandwidth limitations proper of legacy multicarrier systems to increase the sensing performance while leaving communication substantially unaffected. Numerical and experimental results prove the effectiveness of the dual-domain waveform, notwithstanding a power abatement of at least 30 dB of the signal used for sensing compared to the one used for communication. The dual-domain ISAC waveform outperforms both OFDM and orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) in terms of Cramér-Rao bound on delay estimation (up to 20 dB), thanks to its superior resolution, with a negligible penalty on the achievable rate.}

Each RRH receives the signals from devices over the wireless link and forwards the signals to the server via the fronthaul link. We rigorously develop an energy consumption model for the local training at devices through the use of QNNs and communication models over Cloud-RAN. Based on the proposed energy consumption model, we formulate an energy minimization problem that optimizes the fronthaul rate allocation, device transmit power allocation, and QNN precision levels while satisfying the limited fronthaul capacity constraint and ensuring the convergence of the proposed FL model to a target accuracy. To solve this problem, we analyze the convergence rate and propose efficient algorithms based on the alternative optimization technique. Simulation results show that the proposed FL framework can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to other conventional approaches. We draw the conclusion that the proposed framework holds great potential for achieving a sustainable and environmentally-friendly FL in Cloud-RAN.}

	abstract = {Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) beamforming has been recognized as a key element to support challenging requirements in the vehicular communication environment. In order to provide accurate beam alignment and tracking results in the high mobility scenario, the mobility induced channel prediction mechanism has been proposed in the line-of-sight (LOS) fading environment, while the application to the practical mixed LOS and non-LOS fading environment is still open. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility and channel prediction combined beamforming (MCPCB) scheme to deal with this issue. Specifically, we rely on per-cluster angular based information and non-linear tracking scheme for angular-delay profile to obtain reliable single input multiple output (SIMO) channel prediction. By linking the estimated mobility parameters and the per-cluster beam directions, our proposed MCPCB scheme is able to provide a higher receiving energy with reduced prediction errors, and achieve more robust prediction performance when the cluster level channel blocking happens. Through analytical and numerical results, we show that the proposed MCPCB scheme can achieve about −50.6 dB and −87.7 dB of average received power gain in the LOS and NLOS scenarios, respectively, and outperform many conventional channel prediction methods.}

The basic idea of MC-VLP is to utilize multiple cameras to simultaneously capture the beacon signal transmitted by a light-emitting diode (LED) mounted on the mobile terminal. Since the pinhole camera can achieve high imaging accuracy and the fish-eye camera has a wide field of view (FOV), both of them can be adopted as the receiver to improve the positioning accuracy and coverage area. Meanwhile, the positioning errors along X -axis, Y -axis, and Z -axis are derived to evaluate the performance of the MC-VLP algorithm. Based on the derived expression of positioning error, we optimize the camera layout and tilt angle to minimize the positioning error in the coverage area. Simulation results show that higher positioning accuracy can be achieved via optimizing the camera layout and tilt angle. Experimental results show that the mean 3D positioning accuracy is 1.7 mm with 3 pinhole cameras at height 2.5 m.}

We propose to perform user-centric AP cooperation for computation burden alleviation and introduce a generalized sliding-window detection strategy for fully exploiting the temporal correlation in activity. By establishing the probabilistic model associated with the factor graph representation, we propose a scalable Dynamic Compressed Sensing-based Multiple Measurement Vector Generalized Approximate Message Passing (DCS-MMV-GAMP) algorithm from the perspective of Bayesian inference. Therein, the activity likelihood is refined by performing standard message passing among the activities in the spatial-temporal domain and GAMP is employed for efficient channel estimation. Furthermore, we develop two schemes of quantize-and-forward (QF) and detect-and-forward (DF) based on DCS-MMV-GAMP for the finite-fronthaul-capacity scenario, which are extensively evaluated under various system limits. Numerical results verify the significant superiority of the proposed approach over the benchmarks. Moreover, it is revealed that QF can usually realize superior performance when the antenna number is small, whereas DF shifts to be preferable with limited fronthaul capacity if the large-scale antenna arrays are equipped.}

Based on the proposed framework, firstly, we derive two exact channel statistics to characterize the equivalent channel gains of prioritized and non-prioritized users, respectively. Then, by taking into account the influence of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and successive interference cancellation (SIC), the approximate expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for all users of one cluster under MISO-NOMA and MISO-OMA transmissions are analyzed to obtain their corresponding system throughput. Moreover, by utilizing the above results, we also determine the diversity order and high slope of these users to attain more viewpoints. Finally, simulation results prove our analyses and reveal that: 1) enhancing the estimated accuracy of CSI and the ability of SIC process can remarkably enhance the system performance; 2) the performance of priority users will be significantly improved with the increase of the number of reflecting elements and Rician factor; 3) heterogeneous quality of service requirements and deployment behaviors of users are beneficial for NOMA, while homogenous settings are competitive for OMA.}

	abstract = {We consider unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless systems where downlink communications between a multi-antenna UAV and multiple users are assisted by a hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We aim at a fairness design of two typical UAV-enabled networks, namely the static-UAV network where the UAV is deployed at a fixed location to serve all users at the same time, and the mobile-UAV network which employs the time division multiple access protocol. In both networks, our goal is to maximize the minimum rate among users through jointly optimizing the UAV’s location/trajectory, transmit beamformer, and RIS coefficients. The resulting problems are highly nonconvex due to a strong coupling between the involved variables. We develop efficient algorithms based on block coordinate ascend and successive convex approximation to effectively solve these problems in an iterative manner. In particular, in the optimization of the mobile-UAV network, closed-form solutions to the transmit beamformer and RIS passive coefficients are derived. Numerical results show that a hybrid RIS equipped with only 4 active elements and a power budget of 0 dBm offers an improvement of 38%–63% in minimum rate, while that achieved by a passive RIS is only about 15%, with the same total number of elements.}

	abstract = {Utilizing low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a practical solution to decrease power consumption. The performance gap between the low and high-resolution systems is small at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, at high SNR and with high modulation orders, the achievable rate saturates after a finite SNR value due to the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon. This paper proposes a novel pseudo-random quantization (PRQ) scheme by modifying the quantization thresholds that can help compensate for the effects of SR and makes communication with high-order modulation schemes such as 1024-QAM in one-bit quantized uplink massive MIMO systems possible. Moreover, modified linear detectors for non-zero threshold quantization are derived, and a two-stage uplink detector for single-carrier (SC) multi-user systems is proposed. The first stage is an iterative method called Boxed Newton Detector (BND) that utilizes Newton’s Method to maximize the log-likelihood with box constraints. The second stage, Nearest Codeword Detector (NCD), exploits the first stage solution and creates a small set of most likely candidates based on sign constraints to increase performance. The proposed two-stage method with PRQ outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors from the literature with comparable complexity while supporting high-order modulation schemes.}

This paper proposes user-centric cooperation for cache-enabled UAV networks to exploit both contents and transmission diversity, and optimizes the probabilistic caching distribution to minimize system outage probability considering UAV interference topology dynamics. Specifically, user-centric UAV group (UAVG) is formed for each user to increase both aggregated cache size and transmission resources, considering UAVs can’t realize inter-nodes cache file transform due to limited wireless backhaul. Users will search the required content within the UAVG and associate to the cache hit UAV that provides the strongest signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), thus the intrinsic gain of transmission diversity can be achieved. If the required content can’t be successfully transmitted by UAVG, the macro base stations (MBSs) will help transmit the target content. In addition, based on analytical results, the optimal content distribution (OCD) probability is optimized by Lagrange multiplier, thus the tradeoff between content diversity gain and limited cache size is exploited. Analytical results show that, compared with caching the most popular contents policy, our proposed OCD model can decrease system average outage probability by 44.8%.}

	abstract = {A framework is proposed for developing and evaluating algorithms for extracting multipath propagation components (MPCs) from measurements collected by channel sounders at millimeter-wave frequencies. Sounders equipped with an omni-directional transmitter and a receiver with a uniform planar array (UPA) are considered. An accurate mathematical model is developed for the spatial frequency response of the sounder that incorporates the non-ideal cross-polar beampatterns for the UPA elements. Due to the limited Field-of-View (FoV) of each element, the model is extended to accommodate multi-FoV measurements in distinct azimuth directions. A beamspace representation of the spatial frequency response is leveraged to develop three progressively complex algorithms aimed at solving the single-snapshot maximum likelihood estimation problem: greedy matching pursuit (CLEAN), space-alternative generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE), and RiMAX. The first two are based on purely specular MPCs whereas RiMAX also accommodates diffuse MPCs. Two approaches for performance evaluation are proposed, one with knowledge of ground truth parameters, and one based on reconstruction mean-squared error. The three algorithms are compared through a demanding channel model with hundreds of MPCs and through real measurements. The results demonstrate that CLEAN gives quite reasonable estimates which are improved by SAGE and RiMAX. Lessons learned and directions for future research are discussed.}

	abstract = {This paper considers intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel (IFC), where multiple transmitters (Txs) serve their corresponding receivers (Rxs) in a shared spectrum with the aid of IRSs. Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of the Rxs by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrices at the Txs, the phase shifts at the IRSs, and the resource allocation subject to the individual energy harvesting (EH) constraints at the Rxs. Towards this goal and based on the well-known power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receiver structures, we consider three practical transmission schemes, namely the IRS-aided hybrid TS-PS scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided TDMA-D scheme. The latter two schemes differ in whether the Txs employ deterministic energy signals known to all the Rxs. Despite the non-convexity of the three optimization problems corresponding to the three transmission schemes, we develop computationally efficient algorithms to address them suboptimally, respectively, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Moreover, we conceive feasibility checking methods for these problems, based on which the initial points for the proposed algorithms are constructed. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed IRS-aided schemes significantly outperform their counterparts without IRSs in terms of sum rate and maximum EH requirements that can be satisfied under various setups. In addition, the IRS-aided hybrid TS-PS scheme generally achieves the best sum rate performance among the three proposed IRS-aided schemes, and if not, increasing the number of IRS elements can always accomplish it.}

In this work, to promote the advancement of URLLC, we target at exploring the fundamental trade-offs in finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Taking the short blocklength impacts into account, we integrate broadcasting into time-division multiple access (TDMA) strategy and adopt a hybrid broadcasting-TDMA (BC-TDMA) strategy for the multiple access URLLC services. Within hybrid BC-TDMA, user grouping has been implemented, such that grouped users can be served over the shared large blocklength and thus get rid of the performance hindrance from short blocklengths. We formulate a problem for fairly minimizing the error probability for all users via optimizing the user grouping decision together with the joint power and blocklength allocation. For given grouping, we characterize four necessary optimality conditions for the joint resource allocation and accordingly construct the optimal closed-form resource allocation solution. The analytical characterizations have also enabled two criteria for efficiently filtering out the optimal grouping in an iterative manner. Finally, via simulations, we examine our proposed algorithms for both obtaining optimal resource allocation and filtering the optimal grouping. The extremely low complexity and significant reliability advantages of our proposed hybrid BC-TDMA solution are also highlighted in comparison to benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom), as an emerging paradigm focusing on meaning delivery, has recently been considered a promising solution for the inevitable crisis of scarce communication resources. This trend stimulates us to explore the potential of applying SemCom to wireless vehicular networks, which normally consume a tremendous amount of resources to meet stringent reliability and latency requirements. Unfortunately, the unique background knowledge matching mechanism in SemCom makes it challenging to simultaneously realize efficient service provisioning for multiple users in vehicle-to-vehicle networks. To this end, this paper identifies and jointly addresses two fundamental problems of knowledge base construction (KBC) and vehicle service pairing (VSP) inherently existing in SemCom-enabled vehicular networks in alignment with the next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) requirements. Concretely, we first derive the knowledge matching based queuing latency specific for semantic data packets, and then formulate a latency-minimization problem subject to several KBC and VSP related reliability constraints. Afterward, a SemCom-empowered Service Supplying Solution ( \\text{S}^{{4}} ) is proposed along with the theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of \\text{S}^{{4}} in terms of average queuing latency, semantic data packet throughput, user knowledge matching degree and knowledge preference satisfaction compared with two benchmarks.}

	abstract = {As a revolutionary technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been deemed as an indispensable part of the 6th generation communications due to its inherent ability to regulate the wireless channels. However, passive RIS (PRIS) still suffers from some pressing issues, one of which is that the fading of the entire reflection link is proportional to the product of the distances from the base station to the PRIS and from the PRIS to the users, i.e., the productive attenuation. To tackle this problem, active RIS (ARIS) has been proposed to reconfigure the wireless propagation condition and alleviate the productive attenuation. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of the ARIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with the attendance of external and internal eavesdroppers. To be specific, the closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy system throughput are derived by invoking both imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC. The secrecy diversity orders of legitimate users are obtained at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the theoretical expressions and indicate that: i) The SOP of ARIS assisted NOMA networks exceeds that of PRIS-NOMA, ARIS/PRIS-assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA); ii) Due to the balance between the thermal noise and residual interference, introducing excess reconfigurable elements at ARIS is not helpful to reduce the SOP; and iii) The secrecy throughput performance of ARIS-NOMA networks outperforms that of PRIS-NOMA and ARIS/PRIS-OMA networks.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been regarded as a key technology for 6G wireless communications, in which large-scale multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) array with higher and wider frequency bands will be adopted. However, recent studies show that the beam squint phenomenon can not be ignored in wideband MIMO system, which generally deteriorates the communications performance. In this paper, we find that with the aid of true-time-delay lines (TTDs), the range and trajectory of the beam squint in near-field communications systems can be freely controlled, and hence it is possible to reversely utilize the beam squint for user localization. We derive the trajectory equation for near-field beam squint points and design a way to control such trajectory. With the proposed design, beamforming from different subcarriers would purposely point to different angles and different distances, such that users from different positions would receive the maximum power at different subcarriers. Hence, one can simply localize multiple users from the beam squint effect in frequency domain, and thus reduce the beam sweeping overhead as compared to the conventional time domain beam search based approach. Furthermore, we utilize the phase difference of the maximum power subcarriers received by the user at different frequencies in several times beam sweeping to obtain a more accurate distance estimation result, ultimately realizing high accuracy and low beam sweeping overhead user localization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {Transmitter channel state information (CSIT) is indispensable for the spectral efficiency gains offered by massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In a frequency-division-duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO system, CSIT is typically acquired through downlink channel estimation and user feedback, but as the number of antennas increases, the overhead for CSI training and feedback per user grows, leading to a decrease in spectral efficiency. In this paper, we show that, using uplink pilots in FDD, the downlink sum spectral efficiency gain with perfect downlink CSIT is achievable when the number of antennas at a base station is infinite by leveraging the partial channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels. Specifically, the key idea showing our result is the mean squared error-optimal downlink channel reconstruction method using uplink pilots, and the robust downlink precoding method harnessing the reconstructed channel with the error covariance matrix. Our simulation results show that our proposed precoding method can attain comparable sum spectral efficiency to zero-forcing precoding with perfect downlink CSIT, without CSI training and feedback.}

In this work, joint anonymous transceiver design at the physical (PHY) layer is investigated. We first present sender detection error rate (DER) performance analysis, where closed-form expression of DER is derived for a generic precoding scheme applied at the transmitter side. Based on the tight DER expression, a fully DER-tunable anonymous transceiver design is demonstrated. An alias channel-based combiner is first proposed, which helps the receiver find a Euclidean space that is close to the propagation channel of the received signal for high quality reception, but does not rely on the recognition of the real sender’s channel. Then, two novel anonymous precoders are proposed under a given DER requirement, one being able to provide full multiplexing performance, and the other flexibly adjusting the number of multiplexing streams with further consideration of the receive-reliability. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed joint transceiver design can always guarantee the subscribed DER performance, while well striking the trade-off among the multiplexing, diversity and anonymity performance.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication (SC) is an effective approach to communicate reliably with minimal data transfer while simultaneously providing seamless connectivity. In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) framework is proposed. This ESC system is composed of two key components: A signaling game for emergent language design and a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal reasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using an alternating maximization between the transmit and receive nodes utilities. The generalized Nash equilibrium is characterized, and it is shown that the resulting transmit and receive signaling strategies lead to a local equilibrium solution. As such, the emergent language not only creates an efficient (in physical bits transmitted) transmit vocabulary dependent on communication contexts but it also aids the reasoning process (and enables generalization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex received messages into simpler reasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description (symbolic component) at the transmitter is then modeled using the emerging AI framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets), whose parameters are optimized for higher semantic reliability. Using the reconstructed causal state, the receiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its task. This evaluation of logical formulas is done by combining GFlowNet, with the logical expressiveness of the symbolic structure, inspired from logical neural networks. The ESC system is also designed to enhance the novel semantic metrics of information, reliability, distortion and similarity that are designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby generalizing the metrics beyond Shannon’s notion of uncertainty. Simulation results confirm that the ESC system effectively communicates with reduced bits and achieves superior semantic reliability compared to conventional wireless systems and state-of-the-art SC systems lacking causal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, the overhead involved in language creation diminishes over time, validating the system’s ability to generalize across multiple tasks.}

We show that the average of a set of real-valued parameters can be calculated approximately by using the average of the corresponding numerals, where the numerals are obtained based on a balanced number system. By exploiting this key property, the proposed scheme encodes the local stochastic gradients into a set of numerals. Next, it determines the positions of the activated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers by using the values of the numerals. To eliminate the need for precise sample-level time synchronization, channel estimation overhead, and channel inversion, the proposed scheme also uses a non-coherent receiver at the edge server (ES) and does not utilize a pre-equalization at the edge devices (EDs). We theoretically analyze the MSE performance of the proposed scheme and the convergence rate for a non-convex loss function. To improve the test accuracy of FEEL with the proposed scheme, we introduce the concept of adaptive absolute maximum (AAM). Our numerical results show that when the proposed scheme is used with AAM for FEEL, the test accuracy can reach up to 98% for heterogeneous data distribution.}

To improve system spectral efficiency, we firstly design an orthogonal baseband waveform for FDA with the exact expression, then the corresponding receiver structure is proposed. Further, considering that the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm suffers from high complexity, an output combined maximum likelihood (OCML) approach is presented. Moreover, the closed-form expressions for the upper bound on bit error rates (BERs) of both ML and OCML methods are derived, as well as the counterpart of the system capacity. The simulation results show that the capacity of the proposed FOIM scheme outperforms the MIMO scheme, and meanwhile, our method achieves a higher communication rate when compared with the quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) scheme. Additionally, the proposed OCML algorithm can lead the BER performance of FOIM to be superior to that of the aforementioned approaches with significantly lower computational complexity.}

In this work, we study the CE problem in a downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. As the prior probability, we propose the Markov chain two-state Gaussian mixture with large variance differences (TSGM-LVD) model to exploit the structured sparsity in the angle-frequency domain of the channel. Existing single and combined MP rules cannot deal with the message computation of the proposed probability model. To overcome this issue, we present a general method to derive the hybrid message passing (HMP) rule, which allows the calculation of messages described by mixed linear and non-linear functions. Accordingly, we design the HMP-TSGM-LVD algorithm under the structured turbo framework (STF). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges faster and obtains better and more stable performance than its counterparts. In particular, the gain of the proposed approach is maximum (3 dB) in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, while benchmark approaches experience oscillating behavior due to the improper prior model characterization.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel UAV aided ground nodes (GNs) localization and communication integrated framework, where the age of information (AoI) is introduced to evaluate the system timeliness. We aim to jointly optimize the UAV trajectory, localization accuracy, bandwidth and beamwidth, to guarantee the information freshness. Specifically, we give a two-stage method, where a low complexity initial UAV trajectory searching algorithm is firstly proposed, based on the rough position information of GNs. Afterwards, we formulate a joint UAV location and resource optimization problem. This essential mixed integer problem can be solved by efficient successive convex approximation based iterative algorithm. Simulations show that the localization and communication integrated framework can obtain about 50% performance gain compared with the UAV communication aid only solution, and over 37% performance gain via proper resource allocation. Moreover, the analysis reveals that our proposed scheme strikes a balance among the time durations of localization, data transmission and UAV movement. Additionally, we conduct practical experiments to draw valuable insights into the system design and implementations (An experimental can be found on the supplementary materials, or online at https://youtu.be/OX6Bgz6naUA).}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capability is envisioned as one key feature for future cellular networks. Classical half-duplex (HD) radar sensing is conducted in a “first-emit-then-listen” manner. One challenge to realize HD ISAC lies in the discrepancy of the two systems’ time scheduling for transmitting and receiving. This difficulty can be overcome by full-duplex (FD) transceivers. Besides, ISAC generally has to comprise its communication rate due to realizing sensing functionality. This loss can be compensated by the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology. This paper considers the joint design of beamforming, power allocation and signal processing in a FD uplink communication system aided by RIS, which is a highly nonconvex problem. To resolve this challenge, via leveraging the cutting-the-edge majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we develop an iterative solution that optimizes all variables via using convex optimization techniques. Besides, by wisely exploiting alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and optimality analysis, we further develop a low complexity solution that updates all variables analytically and runs highly efficiently. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the significant performance boosting by employing RIS in the FD ISAC system.}

	abstract = {Future scenarios foresee the deployment of a large amount of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) covering buildings and objects to control the propagation of waves and to realize smart radio environments (SREs). Several works have already investigated the possibility to have a large-scale deployment of RISs indoors and outdoors, providing insightful considerations about the coverage and outage probability, especially in the absence of a direct base station (BS)-user (UE) link. Unfortunately, such works typically consider simplified propagation channels and assume ideal or random phase profiles at the RIS, which do not always fit real scenarios. This paper proposes a communication outage analysis that accounts for realistic RIS selection mechanisms and phase shift profiles. Differently from the literature, we first discuss some RIS association mechanisms and provide a general outage analysis, which is then specialized to the cascaded double Rician fading channel BS-RIS-UE. Finally, we provide extensive numerical evaluation, validated through simulations, to corroborate the proposed model to allow discussing the trade-off in terms of the number of employable RIS antennas and the number of quantization bits for each RIS element, which should be accounted for in the system design.}

Then, we propose an innovative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based power control algorithm that incorporates predictive management and distributed optimization architecture, which provides a dynamic strategy for addressing high-dimension signal processing problems. Specifically, we compare various MARL-based algorithms, which shows that the proposed MARL-based algorithm effectively strikes a balance between spectral efficiency (SE) performance and convergence time. Moreover, we consider a double-layer power control architecture based on the large-scale fading coefficients between antennas to suppress interference within dynamic systems. Compared to the single-layer architecture, the results obtained unveil that the proposed double-layer architecture has a nearly 24% SE performance improvement, especially with massive antennas and smaller antenna spacing.}

To this end, first, for the performance evaluation of the STAR-RIS-assisted BAC-NOMA system, we derive the statistical distribution of the channels under Nakagami- m fading. Second, by leveraging the derived statistical channel distributions, we present the effective capacity analysis under the delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In particular, we derive the closed-form expressions for the effective capacity of the reflecting and transmitting backscatter nodes (BSNs) under the energy-splitting protocol of STAR-RIS. To obtain more insight into the performance of the considered system, we provide the asymptotic analysis, and derive the upper bound on the effective capacity, which represents the ergodic capacity. Our simulation results validate the analytical analysis, and reveal the effectiveness of the STAR-RIS-assisted BAC-NOMA system over the conventional RIS (C-RIS)- and orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based counterparts. Finally, to highlight the trade-off between the effective capacity and energy consumption, we analyze the link-layer energy efficiency. Overall, this paper provides useful guidelines for the performance analysis and design of the STAR-RIS-assisted BAC-NOMA systems.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided device-to-device (D2D) networks have attracted great interests with the development of 5G/6G communications, while there are several challenges about resource scheduling in UAVs-aided D2D networks. In this work, we formulate a UAVs-aided D2D network resource scheduling optimization problem (NetResSOP) to comprehensively consider the number of deployed UAVs, UAV positions, UAV transmission powers, UAV flight velocities, communication channels, and UAV-device pair assignment so as to maximize the D2D network capacity, minimize the number of deployed UAVs, and minimize the average energy consumption over all UAVs simultaneously. The formulated NetResSOP is a mixed-integer programming problem (MIPP) and an NP-hard problem, which means that it is difficult to be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, there are trade-offs between the optimization objectives, and hence it is also difficult to find an optimal solution that can simultaneously make all objectives be optimal. Thus, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III with a Flexible solution dimension mechanism, a Discrete part generation mechanism, and a UAV number adjustment mechanism (NSGA-III-FDU) for solving the problem comprehensively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed NSGA-III-FDU under different scales and settings of the D2D networks.}

	abstract = {As one of the core technologies for 5G systems, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) introduces dramatic capacity improvements along with very high beamforming and spatial multiplexing gains. When developing efficient physical layer algorithms for massive MIMO systems, message passing is one promising candidate owing to its superior performance. However, as their computational complexity increases dramatically with the problem size, the state-of-the-art message passing algorithms cannot be directly applied to future 6G systems, where an exceedingly large number of antennas are expected to be deployed. To address this issue, we propose a model-driven deep learning (DL) framework, namely the AMP-GNN for massive MIMO transceiver design, by considering the low complexity of the AMP algorithm and adaptability of GNNs. Specifically, the structure of the AMP-GNN network is customized by unfolding the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and introducing a graph neural network (GNN) module into it. The permutation equivariance property of AMP-GNN is proved, which enables the AMP-GNN to learn more efficiently and to adapt to different numbers of users. We also reveal the underlying reason why GNNs improve the AMP algorithm from the perspective of expectation propagation, which motivates us to amalgamate various GNNs with different message passing algorithms. In the simulation, we take the massive MIMO detection to exemplify that the proposed AMP-GNN significantly improves the performance of the AMP detector, achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art DL-based MIMO detectors, and presents strong robustness to various mismatches.}

Mobile edge computing (MEC) can provide multi-dimensional resources and network functions at the edge of the network and reduce the delay of wireless networks. At the same time, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows traffic to share resources and improve the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical NOMA-based network slicing architecture in the 6G novel full-spectrum scalable cell-free radio access network with MECs and conduct joint allocation of communication, computing and caching resources at different resource granularity to meet the requirements of latency-critical applications with different latency. In order to realize the hierarchical joint resource allocation to improve system efficiency, we propose to address the optimal computing resource allocation and cache placement problem firstly through conventional optimization methods to reduce the action space and then use the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm for solving other complex coupling strategies. Simulation results further verify the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent network slicing scheme.}

Considering the CoMP transmission, the problem of maximizing the sum downlink rate possesses two-timescale characteristics, i.e., trajectory planning varies of aerial base station in a long-timescale manner whereas CoMP resource allocation varies in a short-timescale manner. To solve it, a two-timescale parallel framework is proposed. Specifically, the initial two-timescale problem is decomposed into multiple single-timescale subproblems via the alternating direction method of multipliers and then all subproblems are parallelly solved. Furthermore, to resolve the high complexity arising from continuous-discrete hybrid variables in each single-timescale subproblem, we propose an online algorithm that embeds optimization programming (OP) into deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Particularly, discrete CoMP cluster variables in sequential time slots are optimized with DRL to eliminate the need for large-scale combinatorial optimization. Then, the continuous resource allocation variables in each time slot are solved by OP, which is embedded between the output and reward of DRL, to speed up the convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves less than a 7% total downlink data gap while decreasing the computation time by more than an order of magnitude compared with numerical optimization.}

The spatial diversity of MISO has been leveraged in these wireless networks to improve the capacity. Furthermore, several recent studies have utilised redundancies in the content request along with this spatial diversity for further capacity improvements. In such systems, the MISO Max-Min Fair (MMF) Beamforming schemes based on SDMA, NOMA, OMA and Rate-Splitting are shown to improve the delivery rates. However, in these studies the key aspects such as the queueing delays in the downlink and the user dynamics have generally been ignored. In this work, we study how queueing, beamforming and user dynamics affect the Quality-of-Service (user delay) of downlink in MU-MISO content centric networks (CCNs). We also show that a Simple Multicast Queue (SMQ) developed for SISO, when adapted to MU-MISO provides good performance due to its inherent stability. However, we observe that MMF Beamforming coupled with SMQ can be unfair to users with good channels. Thus, we propose an alternative scheme, called Dual-SMQ to address this problem. We also provide theoretical approximations for the mean delay experienced by the users in such systems.}

Nevertheless, the performance gain achieved by the conventional passive RISs is limited due to the multiplicative fading effect. In this paper, we investigate an unconventional framework of active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) aided multi-user (MU) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system to captivate better performance for the SWIPT system. Particularly, we focus on the problem of power minimization via joint beamforming design at the base station (BS) and the ARIS for the considered SWIPT system under statistical channel estimation error (CEE) while guaranteeing the minimum rate requirement and the minimum energy-harvested constraints for information and energy receivers, respectively. Owing to the non-convex and NP-hard nature of the formulated problem, we first utilize a minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach to transform the problem into its simplified form, and later utilize an alternating optimization framework which solves the problems of beamforming design at the BS and the ARIS independently in an iterative manner using general approximations. Simulation results confirm that the ARIS can significantly reduce the required transmission power by 50-60% when compared to passive RIS while satisfying given QoS constraints for SWIPT system under the CEE model.}

	abstract = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) are gaining great attention for their ability to achieve full-space coverage. In this paper, the queue-aware STAR-RIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication system is investigated to ensure system stability. To tackle the challenge of infinite time periods for stability, the long-term stability-oriented problem is reformulated as a per-slot queue-weighted sum rate (QWSR) maximization problem using Lyapunov drift theory. Particularly, the allocated rate weight for each user is determined by the corresponding data queue at the base station (BS). By jointly optimizing the NOMA decoding order, the active beamforming coefficients at the BS, and the passive transmission and reflection coefficients at the STAR-RIS, three STAR-RIS operating protocols are considered, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). An equivalent-combined channel gain based scheme is proposed to obtain the desired decoding order. For ES, the highly coupled and non-convex problem is solved iteratively and alternatively by invoking the blocked coordinate descent and the successive convex approximation methods. This approach is further expanded to a penalty-based two-loop algorithm to solve the binary amplitude constrained problem for MS. For TS, the problem is decomposed into two subproblems, each of which is solved similarly as ES. Simulation results show that: i) our proposed STAR-RIS assisted NOMA communication achieves superior performance to the conventional schemes; ii) the reformulated QWSR maximization problem is proven to ensure the system stability; and iii) TS performs best in both the QWSR and the average queue length.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm for supporting emerging wireless services and applications that require both high-throughput data transmission and accurate environment sensing. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient channel sharing aided ISAC with sensing scheduling, in which the ISAC base station (BS) can simultaneously sense multiple targets by reusing the channel of conventional cellular users. To investigate this problem, we formulate a joint optimization of the multi-target sensing scheduling, the BS’s transmitting beamforming, and its receiving beamforming for each sensing target, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency for radar sensing while guaranteeing each cellular user’s throughput requirement. Despite that the formulated joint optimization problem is strictly non-convex, we exploit a framework of alternating optimization and propose the corresponding algorithms for solving the problem. Specifically, we address the fractional structure of the objective function by utilizing Dinkelbach’s method. Then, we identify the convexity of the problem after semidefinite relaxation and obtain the beamforming by utilizing the Lagrange duality. Furthermore, we formulate the sensing scheduling problem as a matching game and solve it by adopting the swap matching. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms compared to some benchmark algorithms and show the performance advantage of our channel sharing aided ISAC in comparison with different schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel hierarchical game framework for physical layer security (PLS) aware wireless communications with dynamic trilateral coalitions is studied. In the considered system, legitimate users (LUs) aim to transmit secret data to associated base stations (BSs) via uplink communications under the threat of eavesdroppers (EVs), while there also exist jammers (JAs) which may choose to form coalitions with either LUs for increasing their secrecy transmission rates or EVs for increasing their eavesdropping rates in exchange for potential rewards. Different from the existing work, we explore such complicated while dynamic coalition relationships under uncertainties of wireless systems (e.g., time-varying channel conditions), and formulate a hierarchical game integrated with a dynamic trilateral coalition formation game to model strategic interactions among LUs, JAs and EVs. Particularly, we first analyze stability requirements of the trilateral coalitions and propose a hedonic coalition selection and formation algorithm for reaching a stable coalition partition in each time slot. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based solution, which can achieve the equilibrium with long-term performance guarantees for the hierarchical game running over multiple time slots with dynamic evolutions. Simulations evaluate the proposed solution and show its superiority over its counterparts.}

	abstract = {Spatial non-stationarity channel estimation for uplink massive MIMO systems can be formulated as a non-uniform block sparse signal recovery problem, in which the hierarchical sparsity of the channel matrix is classified as row sparsity and in-row sparsity. This paper proposes an efficient threshold-enhanced hierarchical estimation (TEHE) algorithm without prior information. More precisely, the non-zero rows of spatial non-stationarity channel matrix are estimated according to the in-row correlation in the first layer; while the non-zero elements of the estimated non-zero rows are further refined in the second layer. Different from the existing two-layer iteration algorithms, an adaptive threshold is designed to estimate the non-zero elements replacing the iterative algorithm in the second layer. In the proposed TEHE algorithm, row-wise sparse adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) is used to find the non-zero rows in the first layer, which has high precision and lower complexity, compared to the conventional SAMP. To further improve the efficiency of the row estimation for larger antenna array, an adaptive threshold-enhanced hierarchical estimation (A-TEHE) algorithm is proposed. In addition, a sufficient condition and a halting condition for theoretical guarantee to obtain accurate row estimation are developed. Finally, the computation complexity is analyzed and compared. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed threshold-enhanced hierarchical spatial non-stationary channel estimation algorithms achieve better performance compared to various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of support set estimation, channel coefficient estimation, and computational efficiency. Specifically, the proposed algorithms are robust to the in-row sparsity.}

	abstract = {Holographic massive-input-massive-output (HMI MO) is expected to play an important role in 6G, which integrates numerous antennas or reconfigurable elements into a compact surface to form a continuous aperture. However, it is not energy efficient to implement the HMIMO with conventional phased arrays, since hundreds of energy-intensive phase shifters are required, leading to inevitably huge power consumption and degraded energy efficiency. Compared with the phased array, metasurface-based antennas, also referred to as reconfigurable refractive surface (RRS), can significantly improve the energy efficiency, since they are free of those energy-hungry phase shifters. In this paper, we consider an RRS-enabled multi-user HMIMO system, where the energy efficiency of the system is maximized by optimizing the size of the RRS. However, different from the traditional metasurfaces that locate far from the base station (BS) and work as relays, the RRS is much closer to the BS such that the BS antennas cannot be assumed to locate in the far field of the RRS. Therefore, it is challenging to maximize the energy efficiency of the RRS-aided system. To cope with this issue, the capacity and power consumption of this system are analyzed first, based on which the energy efficiency is maximized by optimizing the number of RRS elements. The maximized energy efficiency is then compared against that obtained by the phased array. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we verify that the RRS is a more energy efficient solution to HMIMO than the phased array when the power consumption per RRS element is lower than a derived closed-form threshold.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the one-bit precoding problem for the multiuser downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with phase shift keying (PSK) modulation. We focus on the celebrated constructive interference (CI)-based problem formulation. We first establish the NP-hardness of the problem (even in the single-user case), which reveals the intrinsic difficulty of globally solving the problem. Then, we propose a novel negative \\ell _{1} penalty model for the considered problem, which penalizes the one-bit constraint into the objective by a negative \\ell _{1} -norm term, and show the equivalence between (global and local) solutions of the original problem and the penalty problem when the penalty parameter is sufficiently large. We further transform the penalty model into an equivalent min-max problem and propose an efficient alternating proximal/projection gradient descent ascent (APGDA) algorithm for solving it, which performs a proximal gradient decent over one block of variables and a projection gradient ascent over the other block of variables alternately. The APGDA algorithm enjoys a low per-iteration complexity and is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the min-max problem and a local minimizer of the penalty problem. To further reduce the computational cost, we also propose a low-complexity implementation of the APGDA algorithm, where the values of the variables will be fixed in later iterations once they satisfy the one-bit constraint. Numerical results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art CI-based algorithms, both of the proposed algorithms generally achieve better bit-error-rate (BER) performance with lower computational cost.}

	abstract = {Communication by jointly precoded transmission from many distributed access points (APs), called cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO), is a promising concept for beyond 5G systems. One of the challenging aspects of CF mMIMO is the efficient management of the radio resources. We propose both reinforcement learning (RL)-based and heuristic precoding aware radio resource scheduling (RRS) algorithms aiming at maximizing sum spectral efficiency (SE). The proposed algorithms allocate resources for Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), Regularised Zero-Forcing (RZF), and Optimized Zero Forcing (OZF) precoders. For the resource allocation, both the set of serving APs and the physical resource blocks are considered. In high noise scenarios, the proposed RL-based RRS algorithm combined with the MRT precoder shows 2.4 times higher sum SE than the standard Round Robin scheduler. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed heuristic algorithms offer similar sum SE while significantly reducing the complexity compared to the RL-based solution. We also show that the RZF and OZF precodings, which are superior to the ZF precoding in noisy environments, result overall in more transmitted power. Therefore, assuming the same radio resource schedule and precoding strategy in the neighboring cells, it will result in more inter-cell interference and an overall reduced performance.}

This method learns a parameterized functional transformation of key WMMSE variables using graph neural networks (GNNs), where the channel and interference components of a wireless network constitute the underlying graph. These GNNs are trained through gradient descent on a network utility metric using multiple instances of the beamforming problem.

To address this challenge, this paper presents a lightweight semantic knowledge base (SKB)-enabled multi-level feature extractor that projects the image into visual, semantic, and intermediate feature spaces. Then, this paper proposes a novel SKB-enabled multi-level feature transmission framework, which utilizes SKB and multi-level feature extractor at both transmitter and receiver. The semantic loss and required transmission latency at each level are characterized, and a multi-level feature transmission optimization problem is formulated to minimize the semantic loss under transmission latency constraint. However, this optimization problem is a multi-choice knapsack problem, which is challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this issue, an enhanced convex concave procedure is proposed to obtain an efficient solution. Furthermore, this paper theoretically analyzes the effects of SKBs on the communication performance when the feature extractors at both ends are the same. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms the benchmarks and provide insights into the impact of SKBs at both ends on performance as well as the tradeoff between transmission latency and zero-shot classification accuracy.}

	abstract = {Current mobile networks are facing dramatic growth in wireless traffics due to the prosperity of streaming media services. Cooperative edge caching, enabling multiple edge nodes to cache and share contents by exploiting the spatial/temporal user request differentiation, is regarded as a promising method to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE). However, frequent content sharing between BSs consumes operation cost such as the usage of cross-edge bandwidth and energy consumption. Therefore, new challenges incurred by performance-cost trade-off arise. In this paper, we propose a user preference-aware content caching and migration (PACM) scheme for video content delivery in a cost-efficient edge network. In this scheme, the dynamic user request preference and the long-term content migration cost budget are considered for content placement and delivery. To navigate a good performance-cost trade-off, we formulate the content caching and migration to be a long-term optimization problem. Then, the Lyapunov optimization method is used to decompose the problem into a series of real-time optimizations. As the decomposed problem is NP-hard, we design a novel collective reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm that can realize online efficient decision-making by interacting with training experience. Simulation results show that the CRL algorithm has a high convergence rate and the proposed scheme can achieve quasi-optimal performance in terms of user-perceived latency, cache hit rate, and video stalling rate.}

	abstract = {Constructing earth-fixed cells with low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) has been the most promising paradigm to enable global coverage. The limited computing capabilities on LEO satellites however render tackling resource optimization within a short duration a critical challenge. Although the sufficient computing capabilities of the ground infrastructures can be utilized to assist the LEO satellite, different time-scale control cycles and coupling decisions between the space- and ground-segments still obstruct the joint optimization design for computing agents at different segments. To address the above challenges, in this paper, a multi-time-scale deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is developed for achieving the radio resource optimization in NTNs, in which the LEO satellite and user equipment (UE) collaborate with each other to perform individual decision-making tasks with different control cycles. Specifically, the UE updates its policy toward improving value functions of both the satellite and UE, while the LEO satellite only performs finite-step rollout for decision-makings based on the reference decision trajectory provided by the UE. Most importantly, rigorous analysis to guarantee the performance convergence of the proposed scheme is provided. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in balancing the transmission performance and computational complexity.}

In this paper, a novel orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based pattern division multiple access (PDMA) scheme, shortened as OTFS-PDMA, is proposed to meet the low-latency, high-reliability, and massive connection requirements of 6G networks in high-mobility scenarios. A combined detection approach is proposed for the OTFS-PDMA scheme based on the expectation propagation algorithm (EPA). To mitigate the detrimental effect of base station antenna correlation, we design a vector EPA (V-EPA) receiver by combining different receive antennas at each delay-Doppler domain resource element. A pattern-aware serial mechanism is proposed to facilitate the convergence of the proposed EPA and V-EPA receivers by exploiting the convergence-amenable property of the PDMA scheme. An iterative detection and decoding (IDD) structure with parallel interference cancellation (PIC) is integrated into the proposed receivers to further improve the system performance. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed OTFS-PDMA scheme with EPA-based receivers achieves significant performance gains over the conventional OTFS-OMA scheme. Moreover, the proposed V-EPA receiver provides a good performance-complexity trade-off, particularly in spatially correlated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.}

	abstract = {Attaining ultra-reliable communication (URC) in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks requires deriving statistics of channel in ultra-reliable region by modeling the extreme events. Extreme value theory (EVT) has been previously adopted in channel modeling to characterize the lower tail of received powers in URC systems. In this paper, we propose a multivariate EVT (MEVT)-based channel modeling methodology for tail of the joint distribution of multi-channel by characterizing the multivariate extremes of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The proposed approach derives lower tail statistics of received power of each channel by using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Then, tail of the joint distribution is modeled as a function of estimated GPD parameters based on two approaches: logistic distribution, which utilizes logistic distribution to determine dependency factors among the Fréchet transformed tail sequence and obtain a bi-variate extreme value model, and Poisson point process, which estimates probability measure function of the Pickands angular component to model bi-variate extreme values. Finally, validity of the proposed models is assessed by incorporating the mean constraint on probability measure function of Pichanks coordinates. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superiority of proposed methodology compared to the conventional extrapolation-based methods in providing the best fit to the multivariate extremes.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology for wireless communications, thanks to its powerful capability to engineer the radio environment. However, in practice, this benefit is attainable only when the passive IRS is of sufficiently large size, for which the conventional uniform plane wave (UPW)-based far-field model may become invalid. In this paper, we pursue a near-field modeling and performance analysis for wireless communications with extremely large-scale IRS (XL-IRS). By taking into account the directional gain pattern of IRS’s reflecting elements and the variations in signal amplitude across them, we derive both the lower- and upper-bounds of the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the generic uniform planar array (UPA)-based XL-IRS. Our results reveal that, instead of scaling quadratically and unboundedly with the number of reflecting elements M as in the conventional UPW-based model, the SNR under the new non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW)-based model increases with M with a diminishing return and eventually converges to a certain limit. To gain more insights, we further study the special case of uniform linear array (ULA)-based XL-IRS, for which a closed-form SNR expression in terms of the IRS size and locations of the base station (BS) and the user is derived. Our result shows that the SNR is mainly determined by the two geometric angles formed by the BS/user locations with the IRS, as well as the dimension of the IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the necessity of proper near-field modeling for wireless communications aided by XL-IRS.}

	abstract = {Hybrid analog/digital beamforming is a promising technique to realize millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems cost-effectively. However, existing hybrid beamforming designs mainly rely on real-time channel training or beam sweeping to find the desired beams, which incurs prohibitive overhead due to a large number of antennas at both the transmitter and receiver with only limited radio frequency (RF) chains. To resolve this challenging issue, in this paper, we propose a new environment-aware hybrid beamforming technique that requires only light real-time training, by leveraging the useful tool of channel knowledge map (CKM) with the user’s location information. CKM is a site-specific database, which offers location-specific channel-relevant information to facilitate or even obviate the acquisition of real-time channel state information (CSI). Two specific types of CKM are proposed in this paper for hybrid beamforming design in mmWave massive MIMO systems, namely channel angle map (CAM) and beam index map (BIM). It is shown that compared with existing environment-unaware schemes, the proposed environment-aware hybrid beamforming scheme based on CKM can drastically improve the effective communication rate, even under moderate user location errors, thanks to its great saving of the prohibitive real-time training overhead.}

	abstract = {The integration of directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain and mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising means to enable computation-intensive, delay-sensitive, and secure task execution in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, off-chain task execution results are not credible even if the results have been recorded on the chain, since blockchain cannot extend the trust of on-chain data to off-chain. To make the off-chain and on-chain trust consistent, we first develop a trusted MEC (T-MEC) framework by employing a DAG blockchain-aided decentralized trust management (DAG-DTM) mechanism. Specifically, DAG-DTM evaluates the off-chain trust of edge nodes according to the quality of task execution results, and the trust can be further verified off the chain by any edge node under the same trust management rule. Moreover, the approval time for recording the execution result of the edge node on the chain is positively correlated with the verified off-chain trust, which can further promote on-chain transaction security of trusted edge node. Second, we jointly optimize the bandwidth and computation resource allocation to minimize the system latency that consists of off-chain task execution delay and on-chain transaction confirmation delay. Numerical results compare system latency and security performance between the optimized T-MEC and the benchmark schemes. In particular, the optimized T-MEC can achieve a 33.12% gain of computation delay and a 10.19% gain of system latency at an affordable cost of transaction confirmation delay (i.e., 3.21%) over T-MEC, while meeting the requirements of off-chain task execution latency and on-chain transaction security simultaneously.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas can generate narrow and high-gain beams to overcome the severe propagation loss and accurately locate the users. However, even with MIMO, the space resources provided by the basestations (BSs) are still limited. This motivates the study of the collaboration of multiple BSs with massive MIMO antennas, which has the potential to efficiently exploit the space resources and reduce the inter-user interference. In this paper, we study the joint beam allocation of multiple BSs based on the positioning information. We assume that several users are randomly located in a circular area, and one or two BSs are available to serve the users. If two users are in the same beam of a BS, the signals from the BS to these users would interference with each other. To avoid the inter-user interference, we propose the beam allocation scheme for the users based on their position information. Further, we derive the closed-form probability of no inter-user interference for one or two BSs. Simulation and analytical results show that the joint beam allocation of two BSs can reduce the inter-user interferences compared with just exploiting one BS.}

	abstract = {This work develops a novel approach toward performance guarantees for all links in arbitrarily large wireless networks. It introduces a spatial network calculus, consisting of spatial regulation properties for stationary point processes and the first steps of a calculus for this regulation, which can be seen as an extension to space of the classical network calculus. Specifically, two classes of regulations are defined: one includes ball regulation and shot-noise regulation, which are shown to be equivalent and upper constraint interference; the other one includes void regulation, which lower constraints the signal power. These regulations are defined both in the strong and weak sense: the former requires the regulations to hold everywhere in space, whereas the latter only requires the regulations to hold as observed by a jointly stationary point process. Using this approach, we derive performance guarantees in device-to-device, ad hoc, and cellular networks under proper regulations. We give universal bounds on the SINR for all links, which give link service guarantees based on information-theoretic achievability. They are combined with classical network calculus to provide end-to-end latency guarantees for all packets in wireless queuing networks. Such guarantees do not exist in networks that are not spatially regulated, e.g., Poisson networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, beam training and beam tracking are investigated for extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output communication systems with partially-connected hybrid combining structures. Firstly, we propose a two-stage hybrid-field beam training scheme for both the near field and the far field. In the first stage, each subarray independently uses multiple far-field channel steering vectors to approximate near-field ones for analog combining. To find the codeword best fitting for the channel, digital combiners in the second stage are designed to combine the outputs of the analog combiners from the first stage. Then, based on the principle of stationary phase and the time-frequency duality, the expressions of subarray signals after analog combining are analytically derived and a beam refinement based on phase shifts of subarrays (BRPSS) scheme with closed-form solutions is proposed for high-resolution channel parameter estimation. Moreover, a low-complexity near-field beam tracking scheme is developed, where the kinematic model is adopted to characterize the channel variations and the extended Kalman filter is exploited for beam tracking. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

This framework can provide a suboptimal solution for a large family of optimization problems in which the objective and/or constraints are linear functions of the rates and/or energy efficiency (EE) of users. Using this framework, we show that RSMA and RIS can be mutually beneficial tools when the system is overloaded, i.e., when the number of users per cell is higher than the number of base station (BS) antennas. Additionally, we show that the benefits of RSMA increase when the packets are shorter and/or the reliability constraint is more stringent. Furthermore, we show that the RSMA benefits increase with the number of users per cell and decrease with the number of BS antennas. Finally, we show that RIS (either diagonal or BD) can highly improve the system performance, and BD-RIS outperforms regular RIS.}

An IRS can relax the requirement of a line-of-sight (LoS) link between Alice and Bob for FSO quantum key distribution (QKD) applications. The IRS focuses the laser beam toward Bob by introducing a phase shift to the incoming incident beam from Alice. Both discrete variable QKD (DV-QKD) and continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) protocols for IRS-assisted QKD systems are studied. For DV-QKD, we characterize the average quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the achievable secret key rate (SKR) under a log-normal fading turbulence model. For CV-QKD, we present the ultimate quantum information-theoretic bounds for the SKR and entanglement distribution rates. We also characterize the achievable SKR of a practical CV-QKD protocol implemented using Gaussian coherent states. Our results reveal that Alice and Bob can generate a quantum secure key even if the LoS link between them is blocked by utilizing the IRS. Furthermore, with a quadratic phase shift profile, the IRS-assisted link achieves a higher SKR as compared to the direct LoS link and a relay-assisted link for large transmission distances.}

	abstract = {This paper integrates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) into a wireless powered communication network. With the assistance of the RIS, multiple passive Internet of Things devices (IoTDs) gather energies from the signals of an energy station (ES) to power them to communicate with the UAV in time division multiple access mode. Given that the ES and the IoTDs are deployed by different service providers, an energy trading mechanism with price incentive is established through hierarchical Stackelberg game. By paying for the wireless charging service provided by the ES, the IoTDs aim to maximize the difference between achievable rate benefit and monetary payment, while the ES aims to maximize the difference between monetary payment and energy cost. To evaluate the impact of fairness, we propose sum-rate maximization (SRM) scheme and minimum-rate maximization (MRM) scheme, which take the sum-rate and minimum-rate of the IoTDs as achievable rate benefits, respectively. Specifically, in the follower game problem, an alternating optimization algorithm with majorization-minimization is utilized to alternately optimize energy beamforming and energy phase shifts (PSs) before optimal ES transmit power is achieved in closed form. In the leader game problem, a block coordinate descent algorithm with successive convex approximation is utilized to alternately optimize energy price, time allocation, and UAV trajectory after information PSs and transmit power of the IoTDs are achieved in closed form. Numerical results show that the combination of RIS and UAV significantly enhances the IoTD utility. Compared with the MRM scheme, the SRM scheme obtains higher IoTD utility at the cost of rate fairness and energy consumption.}

	abstract = {Employing large antenna arrays is a key characteristic of millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz communication systems. Due to the hardware constraints and the lack of channel knowledge, codebook based beamforming/combining is normally adopted to achieve the desired array gain. However, most of the existing codebooks focus only on improving the gain of their target user, without taking interference into account. This can incur critical performance degradation in dense networks. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient online reinforcement learning based beam pattern design algorithm that learns how to shape the beam pattern to null the interfering directions. The proposed approach does not require any explicit channel knowledge or any coordination with the interferers. Simulation results show that the developed solution is capable of learning well-shaped beam patterns that significantly suppress the interference while sacrificing tolerable beamforming/combing gain from the desired user. Furthermore, a hardware proof-of-concept prototype based on mmWave phased arrays is built and used to implement and evaluate the developed online beam learning solutions in realistic scenarios. The learned beam patterns, measured in an anechoic chamber, show the performance gains of the developed framework and highlight a promising machine learning based beam/codebook optimization direction for mmWave and terahertz systems.}

This paper investigates an unconventional framework of RIS-aided full-duplex (FD) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication and analyzes its resource efficiency (RE), a preferable performance metric for realizing trade-off between SE and EE maximization. In particular, we focus on the RE maximization problem via a joint optimization of transmit covariance, optimal receive covariance, and phase-shift matrices for each RIS subject to the given constraint on the power budget. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we propose two optimization approaches: a) policy gradient-based deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on a Markov decision process formulation for a stochastic-time varying channel and b) alternate optimization (AO) algorithm based on general approximations and majorization-minimization (MM) for static channel conditions. Simulation results validate the out-performance of the considered RIS-aided FD-MIMO system compared to the counterpart system with half-duplex (HD) mode and without RIS case. The proposed DRL algorithm achieves comparable RE performance with reduced computational complexity and running time compared to the traditional AO-based algorithm.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication using lens antenna array has emerged as a promising techique for the next generation wireless communication systems, which has the advantage of considerably reducing the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, the beamspace channel estimation is a challenging problem due to the fact that the number of RF chains is much smaller than that of transmit/receive antennas at the base station (BS). In this paper, motivated by the sparsity structure of lens-antenna based beamspace channels, we first model beamspace channel estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem, which can be solved by the compressed sensing (CS) algorithms. Then, we propose a simplified learned approximate message passing (SL-AMP) network by pre-learning the prior parameters of beamspace channel. Specifically, we use the Wasserstein generative adversarial net (GAN) to learn the underlying channel distribution and generate the corresponding samples to address the lack of training data problem. Next we choose the Bernoulli Gaussian mixture distribution to capture the channel prior and derive the corresponding shrinkage function. Finally, simulations results show that the proposed SL-AMP network can achieve relatively better performance with much lower training complexity compared with the existing LAMP network.}

	abstract = {Cellular networks are becoming increasingly heterogeneous with higher base station (BS) densities and ever more frequency bands, making BS selection and band assignment key decisions in terms of user service rate and coverage. In this paper, we decompose the mobility-aware user association task into (i) forecasting of user data rate and then (ii) convex utility maximization for user association accounting for the effects of BS load and handover overheads. Using a linear combination of normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) as a novel loss function, a recurrent deep neural network is trained to reliably forecast the mobile users’ future data rates. Based on the forecast, the controller optimizes the association decisions to maximize the service rate-based network utility using our computationally efficient (speed up of 100\\times versus generic convex solver) algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe method. Using an industry-grade network simulator developed by Meta, we show that the proposed model predictive control (MPC) approach improves the 5th percentile service rate by 3.5\\times compared to the traditional signal strength-based association, reduces the median number of handovers by 7\\times compared to a handover agnostic strategy, and achieves service rates close to a genie-aided scheme. Furthermore, our model-based approach is significantly more sample-efficient (needs 100\\times less training data) compared to model-free reinforcement learning (RL), and generalizes well across different user drop scenarios.}

	abstract = {Software-defined satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (SDSTNs) are seen as a promising paradigm for achieving high resource flexibility and global communication coverage. However, low latency service provisioning is still challenging due to the fast variation of network topology and limited onboard resource at low earth orbit satellites. To address this issue, we study service provisioning in SDSTNs via joint optimization of virtual network function (VNF) placement and routing planning with network dynamics characterized by a time-evolving graph. Aiming at minimizing average service latency, the corresponding problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming under resource, VNF deployment, and time-slotted flow constraints. Since exhaustive search is intractable, we transform the primary problem into an integer linear programming by involving auxiliary variables and then propose a Benders decomposition based branch-and-cut (BDBC) algorithm. Towards practical use, a time expansion-based decoupled greedy (TEDG) algorithm is further designed with rigorous complexity analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the optimality of BDBC algorithm and the low complexity of TEDG algorithm. Meanwhile, it is indicated that they can improve the number of completed services within a configuration period by up to 58% and reduce the average service latency by up to 17% compared to baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) in the wireless communication domain have been shown to be hardly generalizable to scenarios where the train and test datasets follow a different distribution. This lack of generalization poses a significant hurdle to the practical utilization of DNNs in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a generalizable deep learning approach for millimeter wave (mmWave) beam selection using sub-6 GHz channel state information (CSI) measurements, referred to as PARAMOUNT. First, we provide a detailed discussion on physical aspects of the electromagnetic wave scattering in the mmWave and sub-6 GHz bands. Based on this discussion, we develop the augmented discrete angle delay profile (ADADP) which is a novel linear transformation for the sub-6 GHz CSI that extracts the angle-delay attributes and provides a semantic visual representation of the multi-path clusters. Next, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that can learn the signatures of the path clusters in the sub-6 GHz ADADP representation and transform it to mmWave band beam indices. We demonstrate by extensive simulations on several different datasets that PARAMOUNT can generalize beyond the training dataset which is mainly due to transfer learning principles that allow transferring information from previously learned tasks to the learning of new unseen tasks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel spatially non-stationary fading channel model is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with extremely-large aperture service-array (ELAA). The proposed model incorporates three key factors which cause the channel spatial non-stationarity: 1) link-wise path-loss; 2) shadowing effect; 3) line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS state. With appropriate parameter configurations, the proposed model can be used to generate computer-simulated channel data that matches the published measurement data from practical ELAA-MIMO channels. Given such appealing results, the proposed fading channel model is employed to study the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of ELAA-MIMO channel capacity. For all of our studied scenarios, it is unveiled that the ELAA-MIMO channel capacity obeys the skew normal distribution. Moreover, the channel capacity is also found close to the Gaussian or Weibull distribution, depending on users’ geo-location and distribution. More specifically, for single-user equivalent scenarios or multiuser scenarios with short user-to-ELAA distances (e.g., 1 m), the channel capacity is close to the Gaussian distribution; and for others, it is close to the Weibull distribution. Finally, the proposed channel model is also employed to study the impact of channel spatial non-stationarity on linear MIMO receivers through computer simulations. The proposed fading channel model is available at https://github.com/ELAA-MIMO/non-stationary-fading-channel-model.}

	abstract = {Directional modulation and artificial noise (AN)-based methods have been widely employed to achieve physical-layer security (PLS). However, these approaches can only achieve angle-dependent secure transmission. This paper presents an AN-aided decomposed and distributed directional modulation (D3M) scheme for secure wireless communications, which takes advantage of the spatial signatures to achieve an extra range-dimension security apart from the angles. Leveraging decomposed and distributed structure, each of modulated signal is represented by mutually orthogonal in-phase and quadrature branches, which are transmitted by two distributed transmitters to enhance PLS. In particular, we first aim to minimize transmit message power by integrated design of the transmit beamformers, subject to prescribed received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the legitimate user (LU) and no inter-branch interference. This guarantees reliable and accurate transmission for the LU with the minimum transmit message power. Considering the leakage power on the sidelobes, AN is superimposed on the messages to try to mask the confidential information transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the security enhancement of our proposed D3M system.}

	abstract = {As a key enabler of Terahertz (THz)-based wireless technologies, large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output systems are well known for their advantages in both communication and localization. Contrary to existing works that mostly focus on planar arrays, this paper first explores the potential of three-dimensional (3D) spatial array structures in joint localization and communication coverage enhancement. We consider a THz-band wireless system where a user is equipped with a 3D array receiving downlink far-field signals from multiple base stations with known positions and orientations over Rician fading channels. First, we derive the constrained Cramér-Rao bound (CCRB) for the localization (i.e., position and orientation estimation) performance, based on which we define the localization coverage metrics. Then, we derive the communication key performance indicators (KPIs) including instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio, outage probability, and ergodic capacity, and define the corresponding coverage metrics. To facilitate localization applications using 3D arrays, a maximum likelihood-based algorithm for joint user equipment (UE) position and orientation estimation is proposed, which is initialized by a least squares-based solution. Our numerical results show that the 3D array configuration offers overall higher coverage than the planar array w.r.t. both localization and communication KPIs, although with minor performance loss in certain UE positions and orientations. The proposed localization algorithm is also verified to be efficient in simulations as it attains the derived CCRB.}

	abstract = {Much exploration has been conducted to ensure the successful implementation of underground applications based on wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs). However, most of them only focus on the communication aspect while neglecting location information. As a matter of fact, for scenarios such as earthquake and mine emergency rescue, it is necessary to achieve communication and positioning simultaneously. Nevertheless, accomplishing this goal is challenging, as the underground environment not only causes tremendous attenuation but also has limited hardware resources. Long range (LoRa) technology has high reception sensitivity and a simple structure, making it well suited for underground emergency rescue. Therefore, we propose a LoRa-based joint communication and localization system called LoRaAid. When a disaster occurs, the wearable LoRa device transmits sensing information to surrounding buried nodes. Through collaboration between nodes, diversity reception of signals and location acquisition of the target can be achieved simultaneously. Two different schemes are proposed to achieve correct demodulation, and the closed-form expression for bit error rate (BER) is also derived. While implementing communication, LoRaAid uses the mapping relationship between noise-reduced received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and distance to achieve trilateral localization. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that LoRaAid can enable long-range communication while achieving decimeter-level positioning accuracy.}

	abstract = {Recently, channel state information (CSI) extracted from Wi-Fi signals has enabled a variety of Wi-Fi sensing applications beyond communications. However, the extraction of CSI relies on specific Wi-Fi devices, which severely limits the CSI-based sensing applications. In this paper, we exploit the beamforming matrix, a compressed version of CSI that is fed back from the beamformee to the beamformer without encryption, for Wi-Fi sensing. In order to recover more channel information from the beamforming matrix for sensing, a QR decomposition (QRD)-based beamforming feedback scheme is proposed in this paper. We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed QRD-based scheme in terms of sensing and communication performance. Simulation results show that the Doppler frequency shift, time of flight, angle of departure, as well as the amplitude information can be recovered using the proposed scheme and at the same time, the spectral efficiency of the proposed QRD-based scheme is comparable to that of the existing SVD-based scheme. We implement the proposed scheme on IEEE 802.11ac/ax based Wi-Fi devices. The experimental results on human respiration and finger tracking demonstrate that the proposed scheme works well for practical Wi-Fi sensing.}

The D2D network underlays a downlink cellular network to reuse the cellular spectrum and is enabled for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). In the D2D network, the D2D transmitters communicate with the D2D receivers, and the D2D receivers extract information and energy from their received radio-frequency (RF) signals. In the meantime, the adversaries aim to detect the D2D transmission. The D2D network applies power control and leverages the cellular signal to achieve covert communication (i.e., hide the presence of transmissions) so as to defend against the adversaries. We model the interaction between the D2D network and adversaries by using a two-stage Stackelberg game. Therein, the adversaries are the followers minimizing their detection errors at the lower stage and the D2D network is the leader maximizing its network utility constrained by the communication covertness and power outage at the upper stage. Both power splitting (PS)-based and time switch (TS)-based SWIPT schemes are explored. We characterize the spatial configuration of the large-scale D2D network, adversaries, and cellular network by stochastic geometry. We analyze the adversary’s detection error minimization problem and adopt the Rosenbrock method to solve it, where the obtained solution is the best response from the lower stage. Taking into account the best response from the lower stage, we develop a bi-level algorithm to solve the D2D network’s constrained network utility maximization problem and obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium. We present numerical results to reveal interesting insights. For example, the PS-based SWIPT scheme outperforms the TS-based SWIPT scheme in terms of both network performance (e.g., link reliability and power outage probability) and resistance to the adversary, i.e., steady network utility against increasing aggressiveness of the adversary.}

Nevertheless, high penetration loss due to large blockages in harsh propagation environments is often an issue that severely degrades communication performance. Considering that intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is capable of constructing digitally controllable reflection links in a low-cost manner, we investigate an IRS-enhanced downlink cell-free MIMO network in this paper. We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all the users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BSs and the reflection coefficients at the IRS. To address the optimization problem, we propose a fully distributed machine learning algorithm. Different from the conventional iterative optimization algorithms that require a central processing at the central processing unit (CPU) and large amount of channel state information and signaling exchange between the BSs and the CPU, in the proposed algorithm, each BS can locally design its beamforming vectors. Meanwhile, the IRS reflection coefficients are determined by one of the BSs. Simulation results show that the deployment of IRS can significantly boost the WSR and that the proposed algorithm can achieve a high WSR with a low computational complexity.}

	abstract = {This work presents a novel K-Repetition based Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) scheme for uplink sparse code multiple access (SCMA) systems. Our core idea is to apply network coding (NC) principle to re-encode different packets (after channel coding and interleaving) or their fragments, where K-Repetition is an emerging HARQ technique (recommended in 3GPP Release 15) for enhanced reception in future massive machine-type communications. Such a proposed scheme is referred to as the NC aided K-repetition SCMA (NCK-SCMA) in this paper. We aim to understand the optimal NCK-SCMA design criteria for maximizing the channel diversity as well as the efficient receiver processing for superior error rate performances. It is found that NC can enable a larger diversity order for NCK-SCMA with fewer resources (i.e., higher spectrum efficiency). Toward this objective, some novel design criteria are developed for the efficient configuration of NCK-SCMA. Moreover, we propose an iterative network decoding and SCMA detection (INDSD) algorithm for robust and low-complexity recovery of the transmit data from a low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded uplink NCK-SCMA system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NCK-SCMA lead to higher throughput and improved reliability over the conventional K-SCMA.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), the complexity of network management has increased. To intelligently manage large-scale networks, we propose a Knowledge-Defined Edge Computing Networks (KDECN) architecture. Edge Nodes (ENs) deployed in the KDECN architecture are responsible for collecting and preprocessing the relevant information uploaded by User Devices (UDs), and provide computation resources for UDs. Futhermore, since multiple UDs share system computation resources, one computing decision will affect the subsequent decision-making of other UDs. Thus, accurately predicting the demands for UD task requests is a key challenge to maximize long-term execution utility. To this end, we deploy the LSTM-based Task Request Demand Prediction (TRDP) method on the management plane of KDECN architecture to predict the task request quantity of UDs in each future time slot. In order to maximize long-term execution utility of the system, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based Long-term Computation Offloading and computation Resource Allocation (L-CORA) algorithm. Specifically, the proposed L-CORA algorithm makes computing decisions based on the prediction of the offloading task quantity and the personalized demands of UDs to ensure the long-term quality of computing service.

	abstract = {In order to achieve high data rate and ubiquitous connectivity in future wireless networks, a key task is to efficiently manage the radio resource by judicious beamforming and power allocation. Unfortunately, the iterative nature of the commonly applied optimization-based algorithms cannot meet the low latency requirements due to the high computational complexity. For real-time implementations, deep learning-based approaches, especially the graph neural networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated with good scalability and generalization performance due to the permutation equivariance (PE) property. However, the current architectures are only equipped with the node-update mechanism, which prohibits the applications to a more general setup, where the unknown variables are also defined on the graph edges. To fill this gap, we propose an edge-update mechanism, which enables GNNs to handle both node and edge variables and prove its PE property with respect to both transmitters and receivers. Simulation results on typical radio resource management problems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher sum rate but with much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on different numbers of base stations and users, different noise variances, interference levels, and transmit power budgets.}

	abstract = {The utilization of a large-scale antenna array has led to substantial performance improvements in anti-jamming communications. However, due to the practical constraints of hardware cost and power consumption, deploying such a large-scale antenna array at the user side is impractical. Inspired by the remarkable advantages of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we propose an active-passive cascaded RIS-aided receiver architecture that facilitates the cost- and energy-efficient deployment of a large-scale antenna array at the user side, while also providing additional degrees-of-freedom for effective beamforming design. Building upon this architectural framework and taking into account the practical imperfections in the angular channel state information (CSI), we formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization problem for anti-jamming communications. To address the challenges posed by the intractable non-convex design problem, we present a low-complexity optimization framework that obtains semi-closed-form solutions. Specifically, we first develop a Pareto-dual scheme to handle the general power constraints in devising the optimal precoder for the base station. Subsequently, by introducing a novel anti-jamming criterion and employing the discretization method to transform the imperfect CSI of jammers into a robust form, we derive two jamming-nulling feasibility conditions and a unified unit-modulus zero-forcing scheme to determine the coefficients of the passive RIS. To strike a satisfactory balance between complexity and performance, we further design three computationally-efficient algorithms based on alternating majorization-minimization (AMM) and conventional/modified cyclic coordinate descent (C/M-CCD) methods to obtain the coefficients of the active RIS. Finally, through comprehensive numerical simulations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and optimization framework, demonstrating their capacity to achieve exceptional performance in a cost-effective manner.}

	abstract = {The sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to offer a new paradigm of cellular integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, due to the intrinsic difference between wireless sensing and communication in terms of coverage requirement, current cellular networks that are deliberately planned mainly for communication coverage are difficult to achieve seamless sensing coverage. Therefore, this paper studies the coverage issue for cellular ISAC systems, which aims to concurrently sense a prescribed region while serving a group of communication users equipment (UEs). Towards this end, the radar sensing signal processing procedures and communication signal models are presented in a general multi-static cellular ISAC system with coordinated multi-point joint transmission (CoMP-JT), and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the worst-case sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the prescribed sensing coverage region, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement for each communication UE. To gain useful insights, we first investigate the basic bi-static ISAC system, for which a closed form expression of the optimal beamforming is obtained for the special case with one UE and one sensing point. Then, the general case with multiple communication UEs and contiguous regional sensing coverage is further studied, in which the mesh grid approach and direction discretization approach are proposed for ease of solving the optimization problem. Afterward, we further investigate the beamforming optimization in the multi-static ISAC system to maximize the probability of detection of the prescribed sensing coverage region. We show that the problem is equivalent to maximize the sum of sensing SNR from the different transmit BSs. The formulated problems are non-convex, and we propose an efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ISAC design is able to achieve seamless sensing coverage in the prescribed region while guaranteeing the communication requirements of the UEs.}

	abstract = {The use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can improve wireless communication by modifying the wireless link to create virtual line-of-sight links, bypass blockages, suppress interference, and enhance localization. However, enabling the RIS to modify the wireless channel requires careful optimization of the RIS phase-shifts. Although discrete RIS is more practical given hardware limitations, continuous RIS phase-shift optimization has attracted significantly more attention than discrete RIS optimization, which suffers from issues like quantization error and scalability. To overcome these issues, we develop a comprehensive probabilistic technique to transform discrete optimization problems into optimization problems of continuous domain probability parameters by interpreting the discrete optimization variable as a categorical random vector and computing expectations with respect to those parameters. We rigorously establish that for the unconstrained case, the optimal points of the reformulation and the original problem coincide. For the constrained case, we prove that the transformed problem is a relaxation of the original problem. We apply the proposed technique to two canonical discrete RIS applications: SINR maximization and overhead-aware rate and energy efficiency (EE) maximization. The reformulation enables both stochastic and analytical interpretations of the original problems, as we demonstrate in our RIS applications. The former interpretation yields a stochastic sampling technique, whereas the latter yields an analytical gradient descent (GD) approach that employs closed-form approximations for the expectation. We have explicitly derived the worst-case computational complexities of the proposed algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed technique is applicable to a variety of discrete RIS optimization problems and outperforms other general approaches, such as closest point projection (CPP) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods.}

	abstract = {To provide seamless communication service, the integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN) has attracted lots of interest, where the promising dynamic spectrum sharing technology is widely used to improve spectrum efficiency. Meanwhile, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has recently emerged due to the advantages of flexible multiple access and robust interference management. Based on the two promising technologies, we design joint satellite-terrestrial RSMA schemes in overlay and underlay spectrum sharing modes for ISTN, which considers both cases with and without inter-beam interference. Furthermore, we propose two adaptive RSMA schemes based on the hybrid spectrum sharing mode for adapting dynamic ISTN, where the number of terminals and spectrum resources available to satellite are unevenly distributed and time-varying due to the broad communication coverage. Finally, we consider the quality of service rate requirements and formulate joint optimization problems to maximize the weighted sum rate. To solve these non-convex optimization problems, we introduce an improved alternating optimization algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error. Simulation results verify that the proposed schemes have significant performance gains compared with SDMA and NOMA schemes and can better adapt to the dynamic changes in the number of terminals and spectrum resources.}

	abstract = {Localized channel modeling is crucial for offline performance optimization of wireless networks, but existing channel models are not well suited for wireless network optimization. In this paper, we propose a physics-based and data-driven localized statistical channel model for wireless network optimization. The proposed channel modeling solely relies on the reference signal receiving power (RSRP). The key is to build the statistical relationship between the RSRP and the angular power spectrum (APS). Based on it, we formulate the task of channel modeling as a sparse recovery problem where the non-zero entries of the APS indicate the channel paths’ powers and angles of departure. Although such problem typically can be handled by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-type algorithms, our problem is more challenging due to the non-uniform and closely parallel columns of the coefficient matrix. To address these issues, we propose the weighted non-negative OMP (WNOMP) and the second-order-statistics-based WNOMP (SWOMP) algorithms. The WNOMP algorithm can alleviate the effect of non-uniform columns, while the SWOMP algorithm can further identify the closely parallel columns correctly. Finally, comprehensive experiments based on synthetic and real-world RSRP are presented to demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classic methods in terms of accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE).}

In this regard, we formulate two main placement problems, namely the sum rate and minimum rate maximization problems, and discuss the challenges associated with solving the underlying optimization problems with the help of some simple scenarios. As a practical solution to the AP placement problem, we suggest a vector quantization (VQ) approach. The suitability of the VQ approach to cell-free AP placement is investigated by examining three VQ-based solutions. First, the standard VQ approach, that is the Lloyd algorithm (using the squared error distortion function) is described. Second, the tree-structured VQ (TSVQ), which performs successive partitioning of the distribution space is applied. Third, a probability density function optimized VQ (PDFVQ) procedure is outlined, enabling efficient, low complexity, and scalable placement, and is aimed at a massive distributed multiple-input-multiple-output scenario. While the VQ-based solutions do not explicitly solve the cell-free AP placement problems, numerical experiments show that their sum and minimum rate performances are good enough, and offer a good starting point for gradient-based optimization methods. Among the VQ solutions, PDFVQ, with its distinct advantages, offers a good trade-off between sum and minimum rates.}

This paper studies distributed learning in wireless data center networks, which contain a central edge server and multiple edge workers to collaboratively train a shared global model and benefit from parallel computing. However, the distributed nature causes the vulnerability of the learning process to faults and adversarial attacks from Byzantine edge workers, as well as the severe communication and computation overhead induced by the periodical information exchange process. To achieve fast and reliable model aggregation in the presence of Byzantine attacks, we develop a signed stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD)-based Hierarchical Vote framework via over-the-air computation (AirComp), where one voting process is performed locally at the wireless edge by taking advantage of Bernoulli coding while the other is operated over-the-air at the central edge server by utilizing the waveform superposition property of the multiple-access channels. We comprehensively analyze the proposed framework on the impacts including Byzantine attacks and the wireless environment (channel fading and receiver noise), followed by characterizing the convergence behavior under non-convex settings. Simulation results validate our theoretical achievements and demonstrate the robustness of our proposed framework in the presence of Byzantine attacks and receiver noise.}

In this paper, a two-stage joint hybrid precoding/combining algorithm based on masterful row and column selection (MCUR) decomposition is proposed for the MIMO-OFDM system with subsystems, named as MCUR-TS. During the first stage, the analog precoder/combiner are found by the MCUR and viewpoint of subsystems, which includes the analog precoding/combining subsystems. Then, using the MCUR and notion of equivalent channel, the digital precoder/combiner are acquired. Different from the existing singular value decomposition (SVD)-based algorithms, the proposed MCUR-based algorithm preserves the sparsity of original data while reducing the computational complexity. Meanwhile, the MCUR with the truncated rotated orthogonal triangular factorization and the gravity centers of column subspaces enhances the performance of hybrid precoding/combining. Furthermore, the phase shifter quantization and imperfect channel state information are applied to decrease energy consumption and improve practicality, respectively. Extensive simulations and theoretical analyses illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of spectral efficiency and achievable sum rate with lower complexity while providing with better robustness to channel errors.}

	abstract = {High-reliability and low-latency communication is essential for timely information exchange in vehicle platooning. As a key enabler of this, the cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X) network uses a sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) protocol, where radio resources are reserved for a number of transmissions with reduced resource re-allocation and control overhead. However, consecutive access collisions may be caused by reservation conflict, which leads to long delay and threatens platoon’s stability and safety. In this paper, a coordinating resource reservation (CRR) protocol is proposed for vehicle platooning. By implementing error detection with coordination among platoon vehicles, the resource reservation is improved for reduced collisions and delay. Specifically, packet reception/loss information is sent out by platoon vehicles through their own packets. Such information is shared with transmitters and guides them to reserve new resources when access collision occurs. As a result, long delay is avoided while no extra feedback packet is introduced. Furthermore, Markov analysis is presented to evaluate the performance of SPS and the proposed CRR for vehicle platooning, providing the quantified performance gains. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CRR in reducing packet loss and latency, compared with the legacy SPS and other state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access has been regarded as a viable approach to accommodate access for a massive number of machine-type devices with small data packets. The sporadic activation of the devices creates a multiuser setup where it is suitable to use compressed sensing in order to detect the active devices and decode their data. We consider asynchronous access of machine-type devices that send data packets of different frame sizes, leading to data length diversity. We address the composite problem of activity detection, channel estimation, and data recovery by posing it as a structured sparse recovery, having three-level sparsity caused by sporadic activity, symbol delay, and data length diversity. We approach the problem through approximate message passing with a backward propagation algorithm (AMP-BP), tailored to exploit the sparsity, and in particular the data length diversity. Moreover, we unfold the proposed AMP-BP into a network, termed learned AMP-BP (LAMP-BP), which enhances detection performance. The results show that the proposed LAMP-BP outperforms existing methods in activity detection and data recovery accuracy.}

	abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system has been the defining mobile communications technology in recent generations. With the ever-increasing demands looming towards the sixth generation (6G), we are in need of additional degrees of freedom that deliver further gains beyond MIMO. To this goal, fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a new way to obtain spatial diversity using reconfigurable position-switchable antennas. Considering the case with more than one ports activated on a 2D fluid antenna surface at both ends, we take the information-theoretic approach to study the achievable performance limits of the MIMO-FAS. First of all, we propose a suboptimal scheme, referred to as QR MIMO-FAS, to maximize the rate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) via joint port selection, transmit and receive beamforming and power allocation. We then derive the optimal diversity and multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of MIMO-FAS. From the DMT, we highlight that MIMO-FAS outperforms traditional MIMO antenna systems. Further, we introduce a new metric, namely q\n-outage capacity, which can jointly consider rate and outage probability. Through this metric, our results indicate that MIMO-FAS surpasses traditional MIMO greatly.}

	abstract = {Image transmission over wireless communications can be used in a variety of applications, such as smart cities, surveillance systems, and Metaverse construction. In this paper, we propose a task-oriented semantic information transmission (SIT) framework with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for image transmission. As such, only the semantic information of interest is transmitted to each user, and RSMA is adopted to improve transmission efficiency. We also design the quality of experience (QoE) for the framework as a performance metric, which can be used for transmission-parameter optimization. Specifically, we first optimize power allocation with the top- N common message selection strategy. To further improve system performance, we jointly optimize power allocation and common message selection. Simulation results show that the proposed task-oriented SIT framework with RSMA outperforms the space-division multiple access (SDMA)-based benchmark, which reflects the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the results show that optimizing power allocation can improve performance significantly as compared with fixing power allocation, and the joint optimization of power allocation and common message selection has an obvious performance gain over optimizing only power allocation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed optimization algorithms.}

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications have been regarded as an emerging application in next-generation wireless networks. However, guaranteeing high-quality wireless communications in high-mobility scenarios remains a major challenge. In this paper, we investigate the deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for improving the communication performance of V2I systems. In particular, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals are exploited to facilitate sensing-assisted beamforming. Aiming at maximizing the achievable rate, two deep learning-based predictive beamforming mechanisms are proposed. First, a two-stage beamforming design is devised, where the channel state information (CSI) is estimated based on the echo signals and predicted by a dedicated neural network for time-varying channels. Then, the transmit beamforming vector at the base station (BS) and the reflect beamforming matrix at the RIS are jointly optimized. To further reduce the computational complexities, we develop an end-to-end beamforming design by employing the parameter sharing mechanism and weighted loss function. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve an outstanding data rate that approaches the upper bound exploiting perfect CSI. In particular, the end-to-end design exhibits remarkable robustness against the impact of noise and achieves outstanding sensing-assisted beamforming performance, especially at the low signal-to-noise ratio region.}

	abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities for the promotion of deep neural network (DNN)-based applications. However, the large amount of parameters and computational complexity of DNN makes it difficult to deploy it on edge devices which are resource-constrained. An efficient method to address this challenge is model partition/splitting, in which DNN is divided into two parts which are deployed on device and server respectively for co-training or co-inference. In this paper, we consider a split federated learning (SFL) framework that combines the parallel model training mechanism of federated learning (FL) and the model splitting structure of split learning (SL). We consider a practical scenario of heterogeneous devices with individual split points of DNN. We formulate a joint problem of split point selection and bandwidth allocation to minimize the system latency. By using alternating optimization, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems and solve them optimally. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our work in latency reduction and accuracy improvement.}

	abstract = {Ensuring security in terahertz (THz)-based communications is the prime objective in 6G-based systems. This paper investigates the information-theoretic security of a THz-based communication system over fluctuating two-ray (FTR) fading. We analyze the system from a partial secrecy regime and utilize fractional equivocation to obtain closed-form expressions for the generalized secrecy outage probability (GSOP), the average fractional equivocation (AFE), and the average information leakage rate (AILR) metrics. Further, the effect of fading parameters, such as the fading severity index, the average power ratio factor, and the dominant waves similarity index, on the secrecy metrics are also analyzed. Numerical results show that with increasing average power ratio factor, the system’s secrecy is compromised from the AFE and AILR perspectives, whereas from the GSOP perspective, increasing the average power ratio factor results in secrecy improvement. Concurrently, degradation in the system’s secrecy in terms of the GSOP is observed for increasing similarity index and fractional equivocation values. However, from AFE and AILR metrics perspective, increasing the similarity index results in secrecy improvement. Finally, the confidential information rate effect on the system’s secrecy is also analyzed. Increasing the confidential information rate leads to secrecy compromisation, as observed by increasing GSOP and AILR and decreasing AFE.}

	abstract = {A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system is proposed. More particularly, an STAR-RIS is deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), where two practical STAR-RIS operating protocols, namely energy splitting (ES) and time switching (TS), are employed. Under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) condition, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) framework, that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested power, is employed to investigate the fundamental rate-energy trade-off between IUs and EUs. To obtain the optimal robust resource allocation strategy, the MOOP is first transformed into a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the \\epsilon\n-constraint method, which is then reformulated by approximating semi-infinite inequality constraints with the S-procedure. For ES, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to jointly design AP active beamforming and STAR-RIS passive beamforming, where a penalty method is leveraged in STAR-RIS beamforming design. Furthermore, the developed algorithm is extended to optimize the time allocation policy and beamforming vectors in a two-layer iterative manner for TS. Numerical results reveal that: 1) deploying STAR-RISs achieves a significant performance gain over conventional RISs, especially in terms of harvested power for EUs; 2) the ES protocol obtains a better user fairness performance when focusing only on IUs or EUs, while the TS protocol yields a better balance between IUs and EUs; 3) the imperfect CSI affects IUs more significantly than EUs, whereas TS can confer a more robust design to attenuate these effects.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technique that enables privacy-preserving distributed learning. Most related works focus on centralized FL, which leverages the coordination of a parameter server to implement local model aggregation. However, this scheme heavily relies on the parameter server, which could cause scalability, communication, and reliability issues. To tackle these problems, decentralized FL, where information is shared through gossip, starts to attract attention. Nevertheless, current research mainly relies on first-order optimization methods that have a relatively slow convergence rate, which leads to excessive communication rounds in wireless networks. To design communication-efficient decentralized FL, we propose a novel over-the-air decentralized second-order federated algorithm. Benefiting from the fast convergence rate of the second-order method, total communication rounds are significantly reduced. Meanwhile, owing to the low-latency model aggregation enabled by over-the-air computation, the communication overheads in each round can also be greatly decreased. The convergence behavior of our approach is then analyzed. The result reveals an error term, which involves a cumulative noise effect, in each iteration. To mitigate the impact of this error term, we conduct system optimization from the perspective of the accumulative term and the individual term, respectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach and the effectiveness of system optimization.}

High-throughput multi-user hybrid-transmit beamforming is conceived by maximizing the minimum rate of the users. For the sake of energy-efficient signal transmission, the array-of-subarrays structure is used for analog beamforming relying on low-resolution phase shifters. We develop a convex-solver based algorithm, which iteratively invokes a convex problem of the same beamformer size for its solution. We then introduce the soft max-min rate objective function and develop a scalable algorithm for its optimization. Our simulation results demonstrate the striking fact that soft max-min rate optimization not only approaches the minimum user rate obtained by max-min rate optimization but it also achieves a sum rate similar to that of sum-rate maximization.

	abstract = {In this paper, a mobile edge computing (MEC) assisted multi-layer architecture is proposed to support the implementation of federated learning in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In this architecture, when performing a federated learning based task, data samples can be partially offloaded to MEC servers and cloud server rather than only processing the task at the IoT devices. After collecting local model parameters from devices and MEC servers, cloud server makes an aggregation and broadcasts it back to all devices. An optimization problem is presented to minimize the total federated training latency by jointly optimizing decisions on data offloading ratio, computation resource allocation and bandwidth allocation. To solve the formulated NP hard problem, the optimization problem is converted into quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) and an efficient algorithm is proposed based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method. Furthermore, the scenario with the constraint of indivisible tasks in devices is considered and an applicable algorithm is proposed to get effective offloading decisions. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions can get effective resource allocation strategy and the proposed multi-layer federated learning architecture outperforms the conventional federated learning scheme in terms of the learning latency performance.}

Recently, deep learning (DL) has been introduced for CSI feedback enhancement through massive collected training data and lengthy training time, which is quite costly and impractical for realistic deployment. In this article, a knowledge-driven meta-learning approach is proposed, where the DL model initialized by the meta model obtained from meta training phase is able to achieve rapid convergence when facing a new scenario during target retraining phase. Specifically, instead of training with massive data collected from various scenarios, the meta task environment is constructed based on the intrinsic knowledge of spatial-frequency characteristics of CSI for meta training. Moreover, the target task dataset is also augmented by exploiting the knowledge of statistical characteristics of wireless channel, so that the DL model can achieve higher performance with small actually collected dataset and short training time. In addition, we provide analyses of rationale for the improvement yielded by the knowledge in both phases. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach from the perspective of feedback performance and convergence speed.}

	abstract = {Underwater acoustic (UWA) channels present diverse sparsity, which is challenging for UWA communications and underwater networked applications. Conventional methods fail to adapt to the uncertain sparsity due to inflexible adjustment rules or improper assumptions. This paper investigates the estimation of channels with uncertain sparsity and model-driven deep learning (DL) based estimation networks are proposed. We construct the channel estimation as sparse signal recovery model and exploit the channel sparsity based on the approximate message passing (AMP) method. Then the learned AMP network with soft-thresholding shrinkage function (ST-LAMP) is designed as a generalized estimator and suitable to random sparse UWA channels. Moreover, to achieve the Bayesian optimal solution, Gaussian mixture (GM) prior is imposed for UWA channels and the GM-LAMP network is formulated with the derived shrinkage function based on the minimum mean squared error criterion. The proposed networks incorporate the learning ability of DL methods by exploiting marine data and the domain knowledge from the classical model to realize parameter configuration and adaptive optimization. Experimental results verify that the proposed networks outperform benchmarks over UWA channels with diverse sparsity in terms of adaptability and effectiveness. Especially, real tests present the feasibility of proposed networks for on- line deployments.}

	abstract = {Filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) is emerging as a promising approach to combat the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) sensitivity to synchronization errors for machine-type communication (MTC). However, related designs in FBMC-MTC fail to meet the requirements of transmitting diverse data between machines as well as eliminating the effects of FBMC’s inherent imaginary interference. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an FBMC-MTC system with deep learning (DL) assistance. Specifically, we first construct a hybrid packet transmission architecture to meet the delay and throughput requirements of different packets. Second, we further present a DL-based receiver consists two modules driven by communication domain knowledge to enhance data reliability. The dense and convolutional layers are used in two different modules since the two types of packets have different pilot structures and propagation properties. Finally, we deploy the proposed FBMC-MTC system via universal software radio peripheral (USRP) and mobile robots and test the DL-based receiver over the air (OTA). Both simulation and OTA test results show that the proposed FBMC-MTC system can operate in various channel environments, and its receiver is better than the previously advanced OFDM and FBMC receivers.}

We aim to maximize the sum rate by incorporating practical issues such as amplifying power constraints of active IRS and a nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model. Since jointly optimizing IRS beamforming in wireless power transfer (WPT), IRS beamforming in wireless information transfer (WIT), and time allocation (TA) is computationally challenging, we resort to an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm in a computationally efficient manner. Additionally, we propose a one-shot (OS) optimization approach for shared amplitude control that provides closed-form expressions for IRS beamforming in WPT and WIT to be computed at a low latency. This OS solution can also serve as the initial point of the proposed AO algorithm and is used for throughput analysis in line-of-sight channels. It is shown that the proposed AO algorithm reduces the complexity of the benchmark and our proposed OS approach, despite its low computational complexity, provides a performance comparable to that of the AO solution. It is also shown that the amplifying power limit of active IRS elements affects the performance severely while the effect of nonlinear EH is not so prominent. Furthermore, the results from analysis and simulation elucidate favorable system configurations for the active IRS-aided WPCN with NOMA when compared with its passive IRS counterpart.}

However, acquiring accurate channel state information in HMT-assisted wireless communication systems is critical for achieving these goals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for learning the optimal phase-shifts at an HMT for the far-field channel model. Our proposed algorithm exploits the structure of the channel gains in the far-field regions and learns the optimal phase-shifts in the presence of noise in the received signals. We prove that the probability that the optimal phase-shifts estimated by our proposed algorithm deviate from the true values decays exponentially in the number of pilot signals. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical guarantees and also demonstrate significant gains as compared to the state-of-the-art policies.}

	abstract = {To support complex communication scenarios in next-generation wireless communications, this paper focuses on a generalized MIMO (GMIMO) with practical assumptions, such as massive antennas, practical channel coding, arbitrary input distributions, and general right-unitarily-invariant channel matrices (covering Rayleigh fading, certain ill-conditioned and correlated channel matrices). The orthogonal/vector approximate message passing (OAMP/VAMP) receiver has been proved to be information-theoretically optimal in GMIMO, but it is limited to high-complexity linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE). To solve this problem, a low-complexity memory approximate message passing (MAMP) receiver has recently been shown to be Bayes optimal but limited to uncoded systems. Therefore, how to design a low-complexity and information-theoretically optimal receiver for GMIMO is still an open issue. To address this issue, this paper proposes an information-theoretically optimal MAMP receiver and investigates its achievable rate analysis and optimal coding principle. Specifically, due to the long-memory linear detection, state evolution (SE) for MAMP is intricately multi-dimensional and cannot be used directly to analyze its achievable rate. To avoid this difficulty, a simplified single-input single-output (SISO) variational SE (VSE) for MAMP is developed by leveraging the SE fixed-point consistent property of MAMP and OAMP/VAMP. The achievable rate of MAMP is calculated using the VSE, and the optimal coding principle is established to maximize the achievable rate. On this basis, the information-theoretic optimality of MAMP is proved rigorously. Furthermore, the simplified SE analysis by fixed-point consistency is generalized to any two iterative detection algorithms with the identical SE fixed point. Numerical results show that the finite-length performances of MAMP with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are 0.5 \\sim 2.7 dB away from the associated constrained capacities. It is worth noting that MAMP can achieve the same performances as OAMP/VAMP with 4\\% of the time consumption for large-scale systems.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as an enabling technology for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications since it can provide an extra reflection link to increase the macrodiversity gains and improve the transmission performance. These advantages principally rely on the assumption that the blocking of direct and reflection links is mutually independent. However, due to the non-negligible sizes of blockages in some practical cases, both links may be simultaneously blocked by the same blockage, which is the so-called blockage correlation. To this end, in this work we investigate the impact of blockage correlation in the IRS-assisted mmWave communication systems. Firstly, we provide a new joint line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight (LOS/NLOS) probability model by considering blockage correlation. The correlation coefficient of direct and reflection link states is also derived. Secondly, we study the effects of blockage correlation on the system performance of IRS-assisted mmWave communication systems by deriving the expression of transmission success probability. Moreover, we provide a deployment optimization algorithm for IRS when blockage correlation is considered. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results and validate the IRS deployment optimization algorithm. It is shown that the widely-used independent blocking assumption not only always incur an overestimation of the performance of IRS-assisted mmWave communication systems, but also misdirect the optimal deployment of IRS.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have been proposed in millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) systems to achieve both coverage and capacity enhancement, where the design of hybrid precoders, combiners, and the IRS typically relies on channel state information. In this paper, we address the problem of uplink wideband channel estimation for IRS aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with hybrid architectures. Combining the structure of model driven and data driven deep learning approaches, a hybrid driven learning architecture is devised for joint estimation and learning the properties of the channels. For a passive IRS aided system, we propose a residual learned approximate message passing as a model driven network. A denoising and attention network in the data driven network is used to jointly learn spatial and frequency features. Furthermore, we design a flexible hybrid driven network in a hybrid passive and active IRS aided system. Specifically, the depthwise separable convolution is applied to the data driven network, leading to less network complexity and fewer parameters at the IRS side. Numerical results indicate that in both systems, the proposed hybrid driven channel estimation methods significantly outperform existing deep learning-based schemes and effectively reduce the pilot overhead by about 60% in IRS aided systems.}

We first develop a method to quantify the mutual coupling effect among the antennas in an array. The developed coupling model is general and applicable to arrays with arbitrary distribution of any type of antennas with arbitrary structure, physical size and radiation power pattern. In particular, it reduces to a neat analytical expression for arbitrarily deployed isotropic antenna arrays. We then discuss the beamforming design for holographic surfaces, and in particular provide analytical beamforming characterizations for arrays with two arbitrarily spaced isotropic antennas. Numerical results indicate that, by accounting for the mutual coupling effect between antennas, the array densification by packing more antennas in a given surface aperture can significantly enhance both the beamforming gain and spatial resolution of the system. The beamforming gain enhancement and beamwidth reduction can be several dBs higher than, and more than half of, those achieved by the conventional half-wavelength spaced antenna arrays in the same surface aperture. The gains of densification become saturated when the antenna spacing is below a critical value, and the saturated gain reduces as the surface aperture increases.}

	abstract = {To meet the rising demand for data rates, the next generation of wireless communication will need to deploy more antennas at the base stations (BSs) while also addressing sustainability and power efficiency concerns. Recently, metasurfaces, specifically dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), have been suggested as potential solutions. Specifically, researchers have demonstrated the potential throughput performance of DMAs as basestation antennas. In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem for DMAs, modeled as correlated multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. We first propose a system model that details the noise sources in these systems. Then, exploiting the fast response time of DMAs, we consider the possibility of multiple channel measurements during a single symbol. Adopting a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) based approach and assuming availability of the long-term channel correlation matrices at the receiver and transmitters, then, we formulate the channel estimation problem. We first solve this problem assuming full-control over the DMA. We then propose a more practical algorithm to map the full-control solution to the DMA structure, thereby accounting for the limitations imposed by the DMA. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed practical algorithm suffers only a minor performance loss compared to the full-control case.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) on device activity detection in massive machine-type communications (mMTC). The low-resolution ADCs induce two challenges on the device activity detection compared with the traditional setup with the assumption of infinite ADC resolution. First, the codebook design for signal quantization by the low-resolution ADC is particularly important since a good design of the codebook can lead to small quantization error on the received signal, which in turn has significant influence on the activity detector performance. To this end, prior information about the received signal power is needed, which depends on the number of active devices K . This is sharply different from the activity detection problem in traditional setups, in which the knowledge of K is not required by the BS as a prerequisite. Second, the covariance-based approach achieves good activity detection performance in traditional setups while it is not clear if it can still achieve good performance in this paper. To solve the above challenges, we propose a communication protocol that consists of an estimator for K and a detector for active device identities: 1) For the estimator, the technical difficulty is that the design of the ADC quantizer and the estimation of K are closely intertwined and doing one needs the information/execution from the other. We propose a progressive estimator which iteratively performs the estimation of K and the design of the ADC quantizer; 2) For the activity detector, we propose a custom-designed stochastic gradient descent algorithm to estimate the active device identities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the communication protocol.}

Complexity analyzes indicate that in large-antenna regimes the proposed FA approaches require less computational complexity than their corresponding interior point methods (IPMs) do, yet demand a higher complexity than the iterative and the successive convex approximation (SCA) approaches do. Simulation results reveal that the proposed FA attains the same global optimal solution as that of the IPM for an optimization problem in cognitive beamforming. On the other hand, the proposed FA approaches outperform the iterative, IPM and SCA in terms of obtaining better solution for optimization problems, respectively, for a classic transmit beamforming, RIS-aided transmit beamforming and RIS-aided WPT.}

	abstract = {Recently, massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel tracking in the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) systems has attracted intensive interest. By exploiting the dynamic sparsity of massive MIMO channels, it is possible to design a high-accuracy channel tracking scheme. However, the existing channel estimation/tracking algorithms often ignore the practical imperfections in real systems, such as the channel aging effect due to the hopping Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) pattern, the time offset, phase noise, and multi-user SRS interference. In this paper, we propose a robust multi-user uplink channel tracking scheme, which is compatible with 5G NR systems and robust against various system imperfections. Specifically, we propose a sparse Markov channel model to capture the dynamic sparsity of massive MIMO-OFDM channels under the consideration of imperfect factors. Then, we propose a robust multi-user channel tracking scheme, which iterates between two components until convergence. Particularly, in the channel estimation component, we employ the Turbo-CS method to exploit the channel dynamic sparsity to perform efficient multi-user channel estimation under non-orthogonal SRSs, where a multi-stage successive interference cancellation (MSIC) scheme is proposed to mitigate the multi-user SRS interference. Then, in the imperfection parameter estimation component, we further estimate the unknown imperfection parameters based on the updated Bayesian channel estimates from the channel estimation component. Simulation results verify the superior channel tracking performance of our proposed scheme over the baselines.}

We formulate the problem of maximizing the fairness between communication users and the sensing target by jointly designing the transmit beamforming vectors of the base station (BS) and the coefficient matrices of the STAR-RIS. For tackling the challenging optimization problem, a low-complexity algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques is proposed for obtaining the transmit beamforming vectors and the STAR-RIS coefficient matrices. For the ISAC system with a single user, we further derive the closed-form expression of the BS transmit beamforming vector for reducing the complexity of the algorithm. Then, the non-convex optimization problem of the STAR-RIS coefficient matrices can be solved efficiently by transforming it into a convex problem. Simulation results show that the fairness of the proposed STAR-RIS-NOMA assisted ISAC system outperforms the conventional RIS-NOMA assisted ISAC system and the conventional RIS and orthogonal multiple access (RIS-OMA) assisted ISAC system.}

	abstract = {A challenge of ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems is signal recovery because the transmitted information bits are embedded in the ambient RF signals and these are unknown and uncontrollable. To meet this challenge, averaging-based energy detectors are typically used but consequently the data rate is low and there is an error floor. Here we propose a new detection strategy based on the ratio between signals received from a multiple-antenna Reader. The advantage of using the ratio is that ambient RF signals are removed directly from the embedded signals without averaging and hence it can increase data rates and avoid the error floor. Different from the original ratio detector that uses the magnitude ratio of the signals between two Reader antennas, in our proposed approach, we utilize the complex ratio so that phase information is preserved and propose an accurate linear channel model approximation. This allows the application of existing linear detection techniques from which we can obtain a minimum distance detector and closed-form expressions for bit error rate (BER). Methods for the estimation of channel state information (CSI) are also provided. In addition, coding and interleaving are also included to further enhance the BER. The results are also general, allowing any number of Reader antennas to be utilized in the approach. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed approach performs better than approaches based on energy detection and the original ratio detectors.}

	abstract = {Train stations, as one of the most significant buildings on a high-speed railway (HSR), have been rarely studied for their millimeter-wave (mmWave) propagation characteristics. This paper presents the first 41 GHz mmWave band channel measurements on a HSR closed station at ultra-high speeds (up to 288 km/h). Multi-dimensional channel measurement data at different azimuth angles and speeds from inside to outside the station are obtained. It is found that the received signal strength indication (RSSI) experiences a significant attenuation caused by the influence of the station gate. In combination with the Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) model, an improved time delay clustering algorithm is used to cluster the power delay profile (PDP). According to the clustering results, parameters such as inter-cluster duration, cluster arrival rate, and intra-cluster delay spread are obtained. Most of the large- and small-scale fading characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, PDP, angle spread, small-scale fading characteristic quantity, small-scale amplitude fading, and Rician K factor are investigated. The measurement and modeling results fill the gaps of channel measurements in closed HSR station scenarios and provide valuable suggestions for the design and modelling of HSR station communication systems.}

	abstract = {A wireless federated learning system is investigated by allowing a server and multiple workers to exchange uncoded information via orthogonal wireless channels. Since the workers frequently upload local gradients to the server via band-limited channels, the uplink transmission from the workers to the server becomes a communication bottleneck. Therefore, a one-shot distributed principal component analysis (PCA) is leveraged to reduce the dimension of uploaded gradients to relieve the communication bottleneck. A PCA-based wireless federated learning (PCA-WFL) algorithm and its accelerated version (i.e., PCA-AWFL) are proposed based on the low-dimensional gradients and the Nesterov’s momentum. For the non-convex empirical risk, a finite-time analysis is performed to quantify the impacts of system hyper-parameters on the convergence of the PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms. The PCA-AWFL algorithm is theoretically certified to converge faster than the PCA-WFL algorithm. Besides, the convergence rates of PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms quantitatively reveal the linear speedup with respect to the number of workers over the vanilla gradient descent algorithm. Numerical results are used to demonstrate the improved convergence rates of the proposed PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms over the benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is an enabler for a seamless transition from 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) to 5G New Radio (NR) by utilizing existing LTE bands without static spectrum re-farming. In this paper, we propose a cross-band DSS scheme that utilizes the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) feature of an LTE network and the Multicast Broadcast Service (MBS) feature of an NR network. The proposed DSS scheme utilizes LTE and NR resource controllers to assign muted MBSFN subframes on the LTE band and muted MBS subframes on the NR band based on traffic needs. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, the proposed DSS scheme does not require a coordination signaling channel between the LTE and NR networks. Instead, a machine learning-based Technology Recognition and Traffic Characterization (TRTC) system is used to identify and characterize traffic patterns. The LTE and NR resource controllers use the TRTC to sense the muted subframes and offload traffic accordingly. On average, the proposed DSS, as compared to static band configuration, improves the LTE throughput, NR throughput, LTE band spectrum utilization efficiency, and NR band spectrum utilization efficiency by 13.5%, 8.3%, 11.8%, and 20.7%, respectively.}

	abstract = {A multi-scale attention based channel estimation framework is proposed for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, in which hardware imperfections and time-varying characteristics of the cascaded channel are investigated. By exploiting the spatial correlations of different scales in the RIS reflection element domain, we construct a Laplacian pyramid attention network (LPAN) to realize the high-dimensional cascaded channel reconstruction with limited pilot overhead. In LPAN, we leverage the multi-scale supervision learning to progressively capture the spatial correlations of the cascaded channel, where the attention mechanism based dual-branch architecture is designed. To balance network performance and complexity of LPAN, we further propose a lightweight LPAN-L architecture. In LPAN-L, the partial standard convolutional layers are decomposed into the group convolution, dilated convolution and point-wise convolution, which forms a sparse convolutional filter set to extract the channel feature with less computation cost. Furthermore, we leverage parameter sharing and recursion strategy to reduce the space complexity. Moreover, a selective fine-tuning strategy is developed to realize the domain adaption. Simulation results show that the proposed LPAN can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing estimation schemes, while the LPAN-L architecture with a close performance to LPAN efficiently reduces the network complexity.

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving distributed learning framework where a server aggregates models updated by multiple devices without accessing their private datasets. Hierarchical FL (HFL), as a device-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, can enjoy both the cloud server’s access to more datasets and the edge servers’ efficient communications with devices. However, the learning latency increases with the HFL network scale due to the increasing number of edge servers and devices with limited local computation capability and communication bandwidth. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce model pruning for HFL in wireless networks to reduce the neural network scale. We present the convergence analysis of an upper on the l_{2}\n-norm of gradients for HFL with model pruning, analyze the computation and communication latency of the proposed model pruning scheme, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the convergence rate under a given latency threshold by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation. By decoupling the optimization problem and using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, closed-form solutions of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation are derived. Simulation results show that our proposed HFL with model pruning achieves similar learning accuracy compared with the HFL without model pruning and reduces about 50% communication cost.}

	abstract = {Delay alignment modulation (DAM) is an emerging technique for achieving inter-symbol interference (ISI)-free wideband communications using spatial-delay processing, without relying on channel equalization or multi-carrier transmission. However, existing works on DAM only consider multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems and assume time-invariant channels. In this paper, by extending DAM to time-variant frequency-selective multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, we propose a novel technique termed delay-Doppler alignment modulation (DDAM). Specifically, by leveraging delay-Doppler compensation and path-based beamforming, the Doppler effect of each multi-path can be eliminated and all multi-path signal components may reach the receiver concurrently and constructively. We first show that by applying path-based zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and receive combining, DDAM can transform the original time-variant frequency-selective channels into time-invariant ISI-free channels. The necessary and/or sufficient conditions to achieve such a transformation are derived. Then an asymptotic analysis is provided by showing that when the number of base station (BS) antennas is much larger than that of channel paths, DDAM enables time-invariant ISI-free channels with the simple delay-Doppler compensation and path-based maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. Furthermore, for the general DDAM design with some tolerable ISI, the path-based transmit precoding and receive combining matrices are optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency. Numerical results are provided to compare the proposed DDAM technique with various benchmarking schemes, including MIMO-orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), MIMO-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) without or with carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation, and beam alignment along the dominant path.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a data detection problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with hardware impairments. To address challenges posed by nonlinear and unknown distortion in received signals, two learning-based detection methods, referred to as model-driven and data-driven, are presented. The model-driven method employs a generalized Gaussian distortion model to approximate the conditional distribution of the distorted received signal. By using the outputs of coarse data detection as noisy training data, the model-driven method avoids the need for additional signaling overhead beyond traditional pilot overhead for channel estimation. An expectation-maximization algorithm is devised to accurately learn the parameters of the distortion model from noisy training data. To resolve a model mismatch problem in the model-driven method, the data-driven method employs a deep neural network (DNN) for approximating a-posteriori probabilities for each received signal. This method uses the outputs of the model-driven method as noisy labels and therefore does not require extra training overhead. To avoid the overfitting problem caused by noisy labels, a robust DNN training algorithm is devised, which involves a warm-up period, sample selection, and loss correction. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed methods outperform existing solutions with the same overhead under various hardware impairment scenarios.}

Both the time-switching protocol (TS) and energy splitting (ES) protocol are considered for the STAR-RIS. To characterize system performance, the channel statistics are first provided, and the Gamma approximation is adopted for general cascaded \\kappa - \\mu fading. Afterward, the closed-form expressions for both the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC) are derived. To obtain further insights, the asymptotic performance for the secrecy diversity order and the secrecy slope are deduced. The theoretical results show that 1) the secrecy diversity orders of the strong LU and the weak LU depend on the path loss exponent and the distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio, respectively; 2) the secrecy slope of the ES protocol achieves the value of one, higher than the slope of the TS protocol which is the mode operation parameter of TS. The numerical results demonstrate that: 1) there is an optimal STAR-RIS mode operation parameter to maximize the secrecy performance; 2) the STAR-RIS-NOMA significantly outperforms the STAR-RIS-orthogonal multiple access.}

	abstract = {Full duplex (FD) radios have attracted extensive attention due to their co-time and co-frequency transceiving capability. However, the potential gain brought by FD radios is closely related to the management of self-interference (SI), which imposes high or even stringent requirements on SI cancellation (SIC) techniques. When the FD deployment evolves into next-generation mobile networking, the SI problem will become more complicated, significantly limiting its potential gains. In this paper, we consider a multi-cell FD networking scheme by deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) at the cell boundary to configure the radio environment proactively. To achieve the full potential of the system, we aim to maximize the sum rate (SR) of multiple cells by jointly optimizing the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices at FD base stations (BSs) and users, as well as the phase shift matrix at the RIS. Since the original problem is non-convex, we reformulate and decouple it into a pair of subproblems by utilizing the relationship between the SR and minimum mean square error (MMSE). The optimal solutions of TPC matrices are obtained in closed form, while both complex circle manifold (CCM) and successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithms are developed to resolve the phase shift matrix suboptimally. Our simulation results show that introducing an RIS into an FD networking system not only improves the overall SR significantly but also enhances the cell edge performance prominently. More importantly, we validate that the RIS deployment with optimized phase shifts can reduce the requirement for SIC and the number of BS antennas, which further reduces the hardware cost and power consumption, especially with a sufficient number of reflecting elements. As a result, the utilization of an RIS enables the originally cumbersome FD networking system to become efficient and practical.}

	abstract = {To reap the promising benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, accurate channel state information (CSI) is required through channel estimation. However, due to the complicated wireless propagation environment and large-scale antenna arrays, precise channel estimation for massive MIMO systems is significantly challenging and costs an enormous training overhead. Considerable time-frequency resources are consumed to acquire sufficient accuracy of CSI, which thus severely degrades systems’ spectral and energy efficiencies. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention-based channel estimation network (DACEN) to realize accurate channel estimation via low-density pilots, by jointly learning the spatial-temporal domain features of massive MIMO channels with the temporal attention module and the spatial attention module. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose a parameter-instance transfer learning approach to transfer the channel knowledge learned from the high-density pilots pre-acquired during the training dataset collection period. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DACEN-based method achieves better channel estimation performance than the existing methods under various pilot-density settings and signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, with the proposed parameter-instance transfer learning approach, the DACEN-based method achieves additional performance gain, thereby further demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.}

In this paper, we first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensor network (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solution based on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solution that is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energy constraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identification algorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expected reward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more arms in each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of our multi-objective and cost-aware algorithm. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our approach.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computing (AirComp) has recently attracted considerable attention as an efficient method of data fusion by integrating uncoded communication transmissions with computation thanks to the signal superposition offered by the multiple access channels. However, appropriate processing is required to neutralize the wireless channel effect. As, internet-of-things (IoT) applications through low-cost devices is the main target of AirComp, perfect availability of channel state information (CSI) is not always practical, there is the need to investigate the effect of imperfect CSI on AirComp. Specifically, we present novel closed-form expressions for tight approximations that can be used to design and evaluate AirComp systems. Furthermore, we design a general optimization framework that takes into account both magnitude and phase errors in the CSI. Finally, a pilot retransmission policy is designed, that offers trade-off between resources cost and the gain in the accuracy of the computations. In order to validate its application, a utility function of the cost of retransmission is introduced, namely, Retransmission Policy Cost (RPC), which can incorporate the power or throughput cost opposing to the expected gain of the selected policy. Simulations show the deterioration caused by the imperfect CSI and highlight the added value of the proposed policy under various system conditions.}

This paper focuses on improving the quality of service (QoS) and user satisfaction in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multicast multi-group systems by managing the actual transmitted data instead of sending all source data. A key challenge of this problem is determining the ergodic capacity when the signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) distribution in IRS-assisted wireless systems is significantly complicated. To address this issue, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based framework to predict the long-term network capacity accurately. We adapt well-known zero-forcing (ZF) and block diagonalization (BD) techniques to achieve efficient and secure solutions in IRS-assisted multi-cast multi-group systems. Furthermore, we consider the system in case of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Adopting the three-phase channel estimation, we propose a two-stage learning framework to enhance the accuracy of the estimated channel. Based on predicted results, we investigate adjustment algorithms to adapt to environmental changes, thus increasing the received QoS and user satisfaction. Our numerical results confirm the efficiency of the proposed design, with the channel estimation error being significantly smaller than that of the three-phase channel estimation algorithm in the literature.}

We address UE mobility in the downlink (DL) with imperfect channel state information (CSI) and pilot training. Aiming at extending traditional handover concepts to the challenging AP-UE association strategies of cell-free networks, distributed algorithms for joint pilot assignment and cluster formation are proposed in a dynamic environment considering UE mobility. The algorithms provide a systematic procedure for initial access and update of the serving APs and assigned pilot sequence to each UE. The principal goal is to limit the necessary number of AP and pilot changes, while limiting computational complexity. We evaluate the performance, in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), with maximum ratio and regularized zero-forcing precoding. Results show that our proposed distributed algorithms effectively identify the essential AP-UE association refinements with orders-of-magnitude lower computational time compared to the state-of-the-art. It also provides a significantly lower average number of pilot changes compared to an ultra-dense network (UDN). Moreover, we develop an improved pilot assignment procedure that facilitates massive access to the network in highly loaded scenarios.}

A suboptimal detector is proposed, in which the beam direction is first demodulated according to the received beam strength, and then the remaining information is demodulated by adopting the maximum likelihood algorithm. Based on the proposed suboptimal detector, we derive the conditional pairwise error probability expression. Further, the exact numerical integral and closed-form expressions of unconditional pairwise error probability (UPEP) are derived via two different approaches. To provide more insights, we derive the upper bound and asymptotic expressions of UPEP. In addition, the diversity gain of the RIS-DSSM scheme was also given. Furthermore, the union upper bound of average bit error probability (ABEP) is obtained by combining the UPEP and the number of error bits. Simulation results are provided to validate the derived upper bound and asymptotic expressions of ABEP. We found an interesting phenomenon that the ABEP performance of the proposed system-based phase shift keying is better than that of the quadrature amplitude modulation. Additionally, the performance advantage of ABEP is more significant with the increase in the number of RIS elements.}

In this work, we study the performance of RSMA in downlink overloaded networks, where the number of transmit antennas is smaller than the number of users. RSMA has been investigated in overloaded networks in previous works by formulated optimization problems and their solutions by interior-point methods. This limits the practical use of such designs in practical systems. Our aim is to develop low-complexity precoding, rate, and power allocation techniques for RSMA for its use in practical overloaded networks. First, we provide analysis and closed-form expressions for optimal power and rate allocations considering max-min fairness when low-complexity precoders are employed. The derived closed-form solutions are used to propose a low-complexity RSMA system design for precoder selection and resource allocation for arbitrary number of users and antennas under perfect and imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). We compare the performance of the proposed design with benchmark designs based on Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) with and without user scheduling. By numerical results, we show that the proposed low-complexity RSMA design achieves a significantly higher rate compared to the SDMA-based benchmark designs under perfect and imperfect CSIT.}

	abstract = {Deep learning-empowered semantic communication is regarded as a promising candidate for future 6G networks. Although existing semantic communication systems have achieved superior performance compared to traditional methods, the end-to-end architecture adopted by most semantic communication systems is regarded as a black box, leading to the lack of explainability. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a novel semantic communication system with a shared knowledge base is proposed for text transmissions. Specifically, a textual knowledge base constructed by inherently readable sentences is introduced into our system. With the aid of the shared knowledge base, the proposed system integrates the message and corresponding knowledge from the shared knowledge base to obtain the residual information, which enables the system to transmit fewer symbols without semantic performance degradation. In order to make the proposed system more reliable, the semantic self-information and the source entropy are mathematically defined based on the knowledge base. Furthermore, the knowledge base construction algorithm is developed based on a similarity-comparison method, in which a pre-configured threshold can be leveraged to control the size of the knowledge base. Moreover, the simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of transmitted data size and sentence similarity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the superposition of chirp waveforms for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) applications. Exploiting the chirp waveform characteristics enables us to superimpose multiple chirps, thereby allowing transmission of the same number of waveforms over less bandwidth. This enables us to perform subband selection when operating over set of orthogonal subbands. Furthermore, we consider a user equipped with a diplexer-based integrated receiver (DIR), which enables to extract radio frequency power and decode information from the same signal without splitting. Thereby, incorporating chirp superposition and subband selection, a transmission scheme is proposed to exploit both the diode’s nonlinearity and frequency diversity. We derive novel closed-form analytical expressions of the average harvested energy (HE) via transmission of superimposed chirp over selected subbands based on tools from order statistics. We also analyze the downlink information rate achieved at the user. Through our analytical and numerical results, for the considered system setup, we show that superimposed chirp-based SWIPT provides an improvement of 30% in average HE performance as compared to multisine waveforms consisting of a set of fixed-frequency cosine signals, improves the minimum level of HE in a multiuser network, and extends the operating range of energy transfer as compared to fixed-frequency waveforms. Furthermore, we illustrate that the inclusion of DIR at the receiver for SWIPT enlarges the energy-information transfer region when compared to the widely considered power splitting receiver.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been advocated as a promising waveform for achieving integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) due to its superiority in high-mobility adaptability and spectral efficiency. Despite its advantages, due to the complex input-output relation of the OTFS processing, the current OTFS based ISAC schemes require high computation complexity/latency to achieve satisfactory sensing accuracy. In this paper, a concisely fast/slow-time representation for the OTFS input-output relation is derived, which can clearly reveal the physical interactions between the OTFS signals and sensing channels. Under this basis, a novel delay-Doppler spectrum matching assisted active sensing framework is proposed for the OTFS based ISAC systems. The framework consists of three sequentially operated modules, i.e., a coarse searching and triangular spectrum matching module, a local fine tune and quadratic spectrum matching module, and a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) target detection module. The three modules work coordinately to realize joint target detection and high-accuracy target range/velocity estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves better detection performance and range/velocity estimation accuracy with much less computations when compared with the reference schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel antenna architecture called movable antenna (MA) to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) that undergo random wireless channel variation, the MAs with the capability of flexible movement can be deployed at positions with more favorable channel conditions to achieve higher spatial diversity gains. To characterize the general multi-path channel in a given region or field where the MAs are deployed, a field-response model is developed by leveraging the amplitude, phase, and angle of arrival/angle of departure (AoA/AoD) information on each of the multiple channel paths under the far-field condition. Based on this model, we then analyze the maximum channel gain achieved by a single receive MA as compared to its FPA counterpart in both deterministic and stochastic channels. First, in the deterministic channel case, we show the periodic behavior of the multi-path channel gain in a given spatial field, which can be exploited for analyzing the maximum channel gain of the MA. Next, in the case of stochastic channels, the expected value of an upper bound on the maximum channel gain of the MA in an infinitely large receive region is derived for different numbers of channel paths. The approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum channel gain is also obtained in closed form, which is useful to evaluate the outage probability of the MA system. Moreover, our results reveal that higher performance gains by the MA over the FPA can be acquired when the number of channel paths increases due to more pronounced small-scale fading effects in the spatial domain. Numerical examples are presented which validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the MA system can reap considerable performance gains over the conventional FPA systems with/without antenna selection (AS), and even achieve comparable performance to the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) beamforming system.}

Particularly, we propose utilizing a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a reduced number of parameters for codebook construction, feedback encoding, and precoder design. The GMM is fitted offline at the base station (BS) to uplink training samples to approximate the channel distribution of all possible mobile terminals (MTs) within the BS cell. Subsequently, a codebook is constructed, with each element based on one GMM component. Extracting directional information from the codebook or exploiting the GMM’s sample generation ability facilitates joint precoder design for a multi-user MIMO system using state-of-the-art precoding algorithms. After offloading the GMM to the MTs, they can easily determine their feedback by selecting the index of the GMM component with the highest responsibility for their received pilot signal. This strategy exhibits low complexity and supports parallelization. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods, which either estimate the channel and utilize a Lloyd codebook or use a deep neural network to determine the feedback in terms of spectral efficiency or sum-rate. The performance gains can be exploited to deploy systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.}

	abstract = {This paper aims to present a simple multiple access scheme for massive connectivity that enables a large number of mobile user equipments (UEs) to occupy the same time-frequency channel without the need of precoding and power control at the base station (BS) and interference cancellation at each UE. The proposed approach does not even require the UEs to know their signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) and each UE also needs only two radio-frequency (RF) chains to operate. The proposed scheme is inspired by the emerging concept of fluid antenna system (FAS) which enables high-resolution position-switchable antenna to be deployed at each UE. Instead of activating only one port of FAS for reception, each UE activates an ultra massive number of ports to receive the signal. The activated ports are chosen to ensure that the in-phase and quadrature components of the desired signal at the ports are added constructively while the interference signals superimpose randomly. This approach is referred to as compact ultra massive antenna array (CUMA) which can also be realized by deploying a dense, fixed massive antenna array at each UE. We derive the exact probability density function (pdf) of the SIR of a CUMA UE which leads to the data rate analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that even with mutual coupling and under finite scattering, more than 10 UEs can be supported by having a 25\\times 13 -port FAS of size 15 {\\mathrm{ cm}}\\times 8 {\\mathrm{ cm}} at each UE. Considering quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), CUMA delivers a network data rate of 10.7 bps per channel use serving 10 UEs at 26 GHz, and the rate is risen to 15.1 bps per channel use if 20 UEs are accommodated at 40 GHz with a 40\\times 21 -port FAS at every UE. In the case without mutual coupling and under rich scattering, CUMA can even support hundreds of UEs per channel use.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework where clients jointly train a global model without sharing their local datasets. In each communication round of FL, a subset of clients are scheduled to participate in training. Recent research has shown that diversity-based FL can improve the convergence performance of FL, especially when the client datasets are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In this paper, we show that by considering the channel state information and age of information (AoI) of each client, the convergence of FL can further be improved. We formulate a channel-aware joint AoI and diversity-based client scheduling problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). By using Lagrangian index and one-step lookahead approaches, we develop a two-stage online algorithm which is scalable and has a low computational complexity. For FL tasks with non-IID client datasets, our results show that the proposed algorithm can speed up the convergence of FL by up to 71%, through reducing the duration of uplink transmission, when compared with three state-of-the-art FL algorithms.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication, has been considered widely as one of the revolutionary technologies for next generation networks. However, due to the novel propagation characteristics of RISs, underlying RIS channel modeling and measurement research is still in its infancy and not fully investigated. In this paper, we conduct multi-scenario broadband channel measurements and modeling for RIS-assisted communications at the sub-6 GHz band. The measurements are carried out in three scenarios covering outdoor, indoor, and outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) environments, which suffer from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation inherently. Three propagation modes including intelligent reflection with RIS, specular reflection with RIS and the mode without RIS, are taken into account in each scenario. In addition, considering the cascaded characteristics of RIS-assisted channel by nature, two modified empirical models including floating-intercept (FI) and close-in (CI) are proposed, which cover distance and angle domains. The measurement results rooted in 2096 channel acquisitions verify the prediction accuracy of these proposed models. Moreover, the propagation characteristics for RIS-assisted channels, including path loss (PL) gain, PL exponent, spatial consistency, time dispersion, frequency stationarity, etc., are compared and analyzed comprehensively. These channel measurement and modeling results may lay the groundwork for future applications of RIS-assisted communication systems in practice.}

	abstract = {Secure communications are of paramount importance in spectrum sharing networks due to the allocation and sharing characteristics of spectrum resources. To further explore the potential of intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) in enhancing spectrum sharing and secure transmission performance, a multiple intelligent reflection surface (multi-IRS)-assisted sensing-enhanced wideband spectrum sharing network is investigated by considering physical layer security techniques. An intelligent resource allocation scheme based on double deep Q networks (D3QN) algorithm and soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is proposed to maximize the secure transmission rate of the secondary network by jointly optimizing IRS pairings, subchannel assignment, transmit beamforming of the secondary base station, reflection coefficients of IRSs and the sensing time. To tackle the sparse reward problem caused by a significant amount of reflection elements of multiple IRSs, the method of hierarchical reinforcement learning is exploited. An alternative optimization (AO)-based conventional mathematical scheme is introduced to verify the computational complexity advantage of our proposed intelligent scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed intelligent scheme as well as the superiority of multi-IRS design in enhancing secrecy rate and spectrum utilization. It is shown that inappropriate deployment of IRSs can reduce the security performance with the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), and the arrangement of IRSs deserves further consideration.}

We leverage the observation that path angle information (PAI) varies more slowly than path gain information (PGI). Then, several dominant paths are selected among all the cascaded paths according to the known PAI for maximizing the spectral efficiency of downlink data transmission. To acquire the dominating path gain information (DPGI, also regarded as the path gains of selected dominant paths) at the base station (BS), we propose a DPGI estimation and feedback scheme by jointly beamforming design at BS and RIS. Both the required number of downlink pilot signals and the length of uplink feedback vector are reduced to the number of dominant paths, and thus we achieve a great reduction of the pilot overhead and feedback overhead. Furthermore, we optimize the active BS beamformer and passive RIS beamformer by exploiting the feedback DPGI to further improve the spectral efficiency. From numerical results, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the multistatic localization problem when the transmitter position is not known and the synchronizations among the receivers and with the transmitter are not available. Aided by a calibration object, the problem is solvable where the unknown object position, the transmitter position and the synchronization errors can be estimated using the time delay measurements from the direct paths between the transmitter and receivers, and the indirect paths reflected by the calibration and unknown objects. To solve this challenging problem, we propose a three-step estimation method that obtains a different unknown in each step. Specifically, the transmitter position is estimated by formulating a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) problem in the first step, and a linear weighted least squares estimator follows to determine the synchronization errors in the second step. Finally, the object position is estimated by formulating a different CWLS problem in the third step. The solutions are closed-form in all three steps, and thus, the proposed method is computationally efficient. Furthermore, the proposed method is extended to the more practical scenario in which the calibration object position error is present. The mean square error analysis validates that the object position estimate is able to achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound performance under small Gaussian noise, which is further confirmed by numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave transceivers use large antenna arrays to form narrow high-directional beams and overcome severe attenuation. Narrow beams require large signaling overhead to be aligned if no prior information about beam directions is available. Moreover, beams drift with time due to user mobility and may need to be realigned. Beam tracking is commonly used to keep the beams tightly coupled and eliminate the overhead associated with realignment. Hence, with periodic measurements, beams are adjusted before they lose alignment. We propose a model where the receiver adjusts beam direction “continuously” over each physical-layer sample according to a carefully calculated estimate of the continuous variation of the beams. In our approach, the change of direction is updated using the rate variation prediction of beam angles via three different solutions. Our approach incurs no additional overhead in pilots, yet, the performance of beam tracking is improved significantly. Numerical results reveal an SNR enhancement associated with reducing the MSE of the beam directions. In addition, our approach reduces the pilot overhead by 60% and up to 87% while achieving a similar total tracking duration as the state-of-the-art.}

Notably, the distortions introduced by wireless channels and noise can significantly undermine the accuracy of distributed computations. Unfortunately, existing distributed computing schemes inadequately address this critical issue. In this paper, we aim at resolving the numerical stability issue associated within wireless networks and building a new computationally accurate design framework which concretely integrates distributed computing and communication. To this end, we first explore the previous group algebra based coded matrix computation scheme, suitable for numerically stable computation in noisy network, in orthogonal multiple access channel and perform a thorough analysis of computational errors. Furthermore, to leverage the inherent communication structure constructed in distributed computing and thus more efficiently utilize limited wireless resources, we propose to combine the Compute-and-Forward scheme with coded matrix computation. Furthermore, we devise a novel transmission scheme for distributed computing called the Broadcast-and-Compute scheme, in which a master node broadcasts the same information, not transmitting differently encoded submatrices to worker nodes. We analyze the computation errors of Compute-and-Forward and Broadcast-and-Compute based coded matrix computation. The superiority of the proposed schemes is validated by various simulations.}

Codebooks comprised of customizable beamforming weights can be used to transmit reference signals and aid the channel state information (CSI) acquisition process.

In this paper, we unify the beam management stages–codebook design, beam sweeping, feedback, and data transmission–to characterize the impact of codebooks throughout the process. We then design a neural network to find codebooks that improve the overall system performance. The proposed neural network is built on translating codebook and feedback knowledge into a consistent beamspace basis similar to a virtual channel model to generate initial access codebooks. This beamspace codebook algorithm is designed to directly integrate with current 5G beam management standards without changing the feedback format or requiring additional side information. Our simulations show that the neural network codebooks improve over traditional codebooks, even in dispersive sub-6GHz environments. We further use our framework to evaluate CSI feedback formats with regard to multi-user spectral efficiency. Our results suggest that optimizing codebook performance can provide valuable performance improvements, but optimizing the feedback configuration is also important in sub-6GHz bands.}

Line-of-Sight (LOS) is considered crucial in maintaining reliable connections between transmitters and receivers, providing high quality of service and estimating the terminals’ locations accurately. Therefore, maximizing LOS availability improves performance and the localization process in the future systems. In this paper, we propose a general framework to investigate the impact of blockages’ characteristics on the probability of a terminal of interest provided with a number of LOS links simultaneously by taking into consideration the correlation among these links. A comparison among three scenarios, namely correlation, no correlation and two-dimensional is presented to validate the accuracy of these scenarios in different environment densities. The simulation results validate the accuracy of our analysis and show that considering different values of the base station (BS) number and height can improve the system performance. Maximizing the LOS availability can be achieved by considering a higher number of BSs in low and medium environment densities and by increasing the height of BSs for dense environments. Furthermore, unlike in the low environment densities, the correlation between links needs to be addressed carefully when studying LOS availability in dense environments in order to meet the future requirements.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the multi-antenna covert communications assisted by a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). In particular, to shelter the existence of covert communications between a multi-antenna transmitter and a single-antenna receiver from a warden, a friendly full-duplex receiver with two antennas is leveraged to make contributions where one antenna is responsible for receiving the transmitted signals and the other one transmits the jamming signals with a varying power to confuse the warden. Considering the worst case, the closed-form expression of the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at the warden is derived and utilized in a covert constraint to guarantee the system performance. Then, we formulate an optimization problem maximizing the covert rate of the system under the covertness constraint and quality of service (QoS) constraint with communication outage analysis. To jointly design the active and passive beamforming of the transmitter and STAR-RIS, an iterative algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and Dinkelbach’s algorithm is proposed to effectively solve the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed STAR-RIS-assisted scheme highly outperforms the case with conventional RIS, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as well as the superiority of STAR-RIS in guaranteeing the covertness of wireless communications.}

	abstract = {By encoding the video into different bitrate versions, dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) demonstrates its unique advantages in providing flexible bitrate adaption service in dynamic environments. But, the price is that the amount of video data is dramatically increased. The interaction of massive video data tends to exacerbate the network congestion and degrades the quality of experience (QoE) of users. Edge caching and mobile edge computing (MEC) have been adopted to solve this problem and enhance the QoE. But it is still difficult because of the highly coupled nature of caching and computing, which makes it extremely challenging to coordinate them across multiple edge nodes. To address the problem, this paper devotes itself to investigating collaborative edge caching and computing to maximize QoE for adaptive video streaming. In doing so, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly designing the caching, computing and user bitrate adaption, which turns out to be an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem and is NP-hard in strong sense. To solve it, we include caching placement, joint computing and bitrate adaption into a two-stage optimization framework. Specifically, considering the fact that the caching placement is implemented at a relatively long timescale, the caching problem is reformulated based on the statistics of user requests. The reformulated problem is a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP), which is solved by Lagrange dual method after relaxation. The joint computing and bitrate adaption problem is transformed into Markov decision process (MDP) problem, and is solved by deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve QoE when compared with state-of-the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {Recently, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) emerges as an effective technique for saving power consumption by customizing the wireless propagation environment. On the other hand, the symbol level precoding (SLP) technique provides a clever solution to interference exploitation by converting the multiuser interference (MUI) into a beneficial part of the desired signal. In this paper, we propose to jointly exploit IRS and SLP to cope with the power control and interference management issues in a heterogeneous network (HetNet). Considering the possible coordination between the macro base station (MBS) and the pico base station (PBS), we propose two corresponding schemes to manage the inter-cell and intra-cell interference. For both proposed schemes, the power minimization problems are studied by jointly optimizing the precoding matrices at the MBS and PBS as well as reflecting coefficients at the IRS. Due to the non-convexity of these problems, the precoding matrices and reflecting coefficients are optimized alternately. We propose two Lagrangian based algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions of the precoding matrices, where the precoding matrix of the MBS always yields a closed-form. A multiple-gradient descent algorithm based on the Riemannian manifold (MGD-RM) is proposed as well to enhance the received signal quality of each MUE and PUE for the reflecting design. Simulation results manifest a significant performance gain achieved by our proposed HetNet over benchmarks.}

	abstract = {We present a novel power-efficient and low-complexity scheme for cache-aided communication in networks with a multi-antenna base station that serves multiple single-antenna users. The scheme is based on transmitting coded messages to disjoint groups of users simultaneously and achieves an important trade-off between performance and complexity. The subpacketization level of the proposed scheme is sub-optimum compared to the state-of-the-art but is still feasible for a practical range of network parameters. On the other hand, the scheme achieves near-optimal performance and asymptotically achieves the same degrees of freedom (DoF) as the best-known schemes achieve. However, compared to other optimum achievable rates, the proposed scheme suffers from minor performance degradation due to power loss, which becomes negligible as the signal-to-noise ratio or the number of users grows. In return, the reductions in complexity and subpacketization allow for practical implementation of this scheme even for a large number of users. The presented scheme is also very flexible to the variation of the network topology and can easily be generalized to heterogeneous and dynamic scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of a two-timescale transmission design for uplink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. We consider the Rician channel model and design the passive beamforming of RISs based on the long-time statistical channel state information (CSI), while the central processing unit (CPU) utilizes the maximum ratio combining (MRC) technology to perform fully centralized processing based on the instantaneous overall channel, which is the superposition of the direct and RIS-reflected channels. Firstly, we derive the closed-form approximate expression of the uplink achievable rate for arbitrary numbers of access point (AP) antennas and RIS reflecting elements, which can be used to obtain energy efficiency through the proposed total power model. Relying on the derived expressions, we theoretically analyze the impact of important system parameters on the rate and draw explicit insights into the benefits of RISs. Then, based on the rate expression under statistical CSI, we optimize the phase shifts of RISs by using the genetic algorithm (GA) to maximize the sum rate and minimum rate of users, respectively. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the correctness of our expressions and the benefits of deploying large-size RISs into cell-free mMIMO systems. Also, we investigate the optimality and convergence behaviors of the GA to verify its effectiveness. To give a more beneficial analysis, we present numerical results to show the high energy efficiency of the system with the help of RISs. Besides, our results have revealed the benefits of distributed deployment of APs and RISs in the RIS-aided mMIMO system with cell-free networks.}

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communications are envisioned as a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) and beyond systems, owing to its unprecedented multi-gigahertz (GHz) bandwidth. In this paper, channel measurement campaigns in indoor scenarios at low-THz frequencies, i.e., 201–209 GHz, are reported. Four different communication scenarios including 90 transmitter-receiver pairs are measured in two channel measurement campaigns of a meeting room and an office room, respectively. The two measurement campaigns contains four scenarios, namely, a meeting room, cubicle area, hallway and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) case. The propagation of multi-path components (MPCs) in the four scenarios is characterized by the power-delay-angular profiles. Based on them, the temporal and spatial consistency for varying receiver locations in the complex hallway and NLoS scenarios are verified. To characterize, the large-scale best-direction and omni-directional path losses in indoor scenarios are separately analyzed and modeled by the close-in (CI) model. Furthermore, the small-scale channel parameters, e.g., the number of clusters, delay spread, angular spread, and cluster time-of-arrival are analyzed and modeled by proper distributions. As a general framework, a ray-tracing-statistical hybrid model is proposed for wireless propagation at 201–209 GHz, although, admittedly, the measurement results and analysis reveal that the channel characteristics in various indoor scenarios exhibit noticeable differences that need tailored parameter settings.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a novel technology that utilizes the superposition characteristic of the wireless multiple-access channel to accomplish communication and computation tasks simultaneously, which can be used to achieve efficient data fusion in wireless networks. However, the performance of AirComp can be compromised due to non-ideal conditions in practical systems, such as limited transmitting power budget, receiving noise, etc. In this paper, we first propose a joint transmitting-receiving power control scheme for over-the-air computation in the OFDM-based multicarrier wireless system, which can minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the received signal by taking into account of limited transmitting power budget and receiving noise. Based on the special structure of the problem, which depends on the set of users that either use up their power budget or not, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems, one deals with the power allocation at the transmitters, the other deals with the power scaling at the receiver. The optimal results are obtained by searching the set of users with used up power budget and solving these two sub-problems accordingly. We then propose an efficient channel state information (CSI) acquisition and feedback scheme for the AirComp power control scheme, and the effect of imperfect CSI is also considered accordingly. We provide extensive simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme under different network conditions.}

	abstract = {The impacts of channel estimation, beamforming adjustment, phase shift adjustment, and computation costs on an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted secure wireless communication system are severe in practice but are usually ignored for simplicity. In this paper, we consider a multi-antenna BS serving a single-antenna legitimate user with the help of a multi-element IRS in the presence of an eavesdropper. To maximally reduce the implementation cost, we investigate the no-instantaneous channel state information (ICSI) case with the legitimate user’s and eavesdropper’s statistical CSI (SCSI). First, we present a SCSI-adaptive (quasi-static) beamforming and phase shift design, also referred to as a quasi-static design, which has low channel estimation, beamforming adjustment, and phase shift adjustment costs. Then, we formulate the maximization of the achievable ergodic secrecy rate with respect to the quasi-static design as a challenging stochastic non-convex problem. Next, we propose two parallel iterative algorithms to obtain a stationary point and an approximate stationary point and present their respective quasi-static designs. Furthermore, we show that the quasi-static designs derived from the stationary point and approximate stationary point achieve lower implementation costs than existing designs. Finally, we numerically verify the analytical results and demonstrate notable gains of the two proposed quasi-static designs over existing designs.}

	abstract = {Security is an issue in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and partial-NOMA because a user may decode the message of its paired-user with which it shares a resource element (RE). Three scenarios are studied where, of the paired-users, the eavesdropper is: 1) an actively malicious strong-user, 2) a passive strong-user, 3) an actively malicious weak-user. We define the event of secure-communication in each scenario and derive the corresponding secrecy probabilities for partial-NOMA and NOMA. Our results highlight that with careful selection of the RE’s overlap \\alpha , partial-NOMA can significantly outperform NOMA in terms of secrecy probability. Further, careless selection of \\alpha can cause partial-NOMA to perform worse than NOMA. We show the non-trivial impact of incorporating the impact of intercell interference on secrecy. Our results shed light on parameter-selection if knowledge of the eavesdropper type is available highlighting that security can be improved without traditional techniques such as jamming that increase power consumption and interference. While NOMA decoding uses successive-interference-cancellation (SIC), partial-NOMA decoding employs receive-filtering followed by flexible-SIC (FSIC). We show that not employing receive-filtering or using SIC instead of FSIC can have a drastic negative impact on secrecy, highlighting the role of the partial-NOMA decoding approach in enhancing secure-communication.}

	abstract = {Single-user semantic communications have attracted extensive research recently, but multi-user semantic broadcast communication (BC) is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a practical robust features-disentangled multi-user semantic BC framework, where the transmitter includes a feature selection module and each user has a feature completion module. Instead of broadcasting all extracted features, the semantic encoder extracts the disentangled semantic features, and then only the users’ intended semantic features are selected for broadcasting, which can further improve the transmission efficiency. Within this framework, we further investigate two information-theoretic metrics, including the ultimate compression rate under both the distortion and perception constraints, and the achievable rate region of the semantic BC. Furthermore, to realize the proposed semantic BC framework, we design a lightweight robust semantic BC network by exploiting a supervised autoencoder (AE), which can controllably disentangle sematic features. Moreover, we design the first hardware proof-of-concept prototype of the semantic BC network, where the proposed semantic BC network can be implemented in real time. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust semantic BC network can significantly improve transmission efficiency.}

	abstract = {As an emerging distributed learning framework, federated edge learning (FEEL) can efficaciously resolve the delay requirements and privacy concerns by enabling collaborative modeling among the edge devices under the premise of data localization. However, the communication bottlenecks, e.g., model damage and signal deviation, will critically diminish the convergence performance due to the restricted resources and the undesirable wireless fading. To overcome this challenge, one feasible way is to integrate the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the FEEL system, to reinforce the communication quality by adaptively reconfiguring the signal propagation environment. However, the significant premise to effectively exploit the RIS in most of the prior works is the estimation of exact instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is extremely thorny and potentially incurs additional communication overhead. To tackle this issue, we investigate in this paper the RIS-aided FEEL system under the realistic supposition where only the statistical CSI is available among devices. Specifically, considering the wireless outage caused by the uncertainty of non-line-of-sight components, we rigorously derive an explicit convergence upper bound of the RIS enabled FEEL framework with outage. Accordingly, a resource configuration problem with the goal of minimizing the sum of outage-probability is further formulated by jointly configuring the RIS configuration matrix and the bandwidth allocation. To seek the solutions, we carefully design a general Bernstein-Type inequality in this paper, and thus the probabilistic outage objective function can be effectively handled in an equivalent manner. Simulation experiments verify that our design can accomplish a significant promotion compared against state-of-the-art baselines.}

However, the performance of HetNet with wireless backhaul is limited by its backhaul capacity and the severe wireless interference. To solve this problem, we introduce reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the wireless backhaul HetNets and employ reversed time division duplex (TDD) in the time domain and dynamic soft frequency reuse (SFR) in the frequency domain. In the proposed RIS-aided dual-layer HetNets system, we formulate a joint optimization problem of bandwidth allocation, RIS passive beamforming, and power allocation to maximize the overall data rate. Two schemes are considered to adapt to different situations, i.e., unified dynamic SFR (U-SFR) and individual dynamic SFR (I-SFR). We solve the different sub-problems in U-SFR and I-SFR modes with the alternate optimization method, and obtain closed-form expressions for bandwidth allocation and power allocation. The convergence, feasibility, and complexity of the proposed schemes are also analyzed. In numerical results, the overall data rate is shown to be significantly increased with the help of RIS.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has achieved great success as a privacy-preserving distributed training paradigm, where many edge devices collaboratively train a machine learning model by sharing the model updates instead of the raw data with a server. However, the heterogeneous computational and communication resources of edge devices give rise to stragglers that significantly decelerate the training process. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel FL framework named stochastic coded federated learning (SCFL) that leverages coded computing techniques. In SCFL, before the training process starts, each edge device uploads a privacy-preserving coded dataset to the server, which is generated by adding Gaussian noise to the projected local dataset. During training, the server computes gradients on the global coded dataset to compensate for the missing model updates of the straggling devices. We design a gradient aggregation scheme to ensure that the aggregated model update is an unbiased estimate of the desired global update. Moreover, this aggregation scheme enables periodical model averaging to improve the training efficiency. We characterize the tradeoff between the convergence performance and privacy guarantee of SCFL. In particular, a more noisy coded dataset provides stronger privacy protection for edge devices but results in learning performance degradation. We further develop a contract-based incentive mechanism to coordinate such a conflict. The simulation results show that SCFL learns a better model within the given time and achieves a better privacy-performance tradeoff than the baseline methods. In addition, the proposed incentive mechanism grants better training performance than the conventional Stackelberg game approach.}

In this paper, we design a content-aware sampling policy via a semantic-empowered metric, named Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) to evaluate the freshness and value of status updates simultaneously, and formulate a long-term average AoII minimization problem with three constraints, including average/peak power constraint, network stability and freshness requirement. By regarding the long-term average AoII and three constraints as Lyapunov penalty and Lyapunov drift, respectively, we transform the long-term average AoII minimization problem to minimize the upper bound of Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty (DPP). Then, we utilize the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to design our AoII minimization resource allocation scheme, and solve the non-convex Lyapunov optimization problem to enable the semantic-empowered downlink NOMA system. Simulation results show that our proposed SAC-AMPA scheme can achieve the optimal long-term average AoII performance under less power and bandwidth consumption than state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an enabling technology for next-generation network architectures to deliver more diversified communication services and meet more demanding quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. However, owing to the growing scale and heterogeneity of the networks, energy-efficient resource allocation in heterogeneous MEC (Het-MEC) networks faces great challenges. As an emerging research area, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is expected to realize autonomous resource allocation in Het-MEC networks by learning from trial and error. Nevertheless, existing MADRL-based solutions are usually not applicable to practical scenarios by the limitations of centralized control schemes or massive signaling overhead. To address the issue, we first formulate the energy-efficient resource allocation problem in Het-MEC networks as a time-variant mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Then, we propose a fully decentralized collaborative MADRL-based algorithm featuring the multi-actor shared-critic (MASC) architecture and the regional training distributed execution (RTDE) framework, which effectively stabilizes model training and reduces information exchange, respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm comprehensively outperforms several mainstream baseline methods in terms of convergence performance, scalability, and robustness.}

	abstract = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) incorporating multi-band terahertz (THz) and radio frequency (RF) communication have gained increasing attention in the 6G era. However, the heterogeneity, self-organization, and time-variability of SAGIN pose challenges in accurately modeling, quantitatively analyzing, and optimizing these networks. Additionally, the dynamic topology and randomness of the nodes, including low-earth orbit satellites and high-altitude platforms, make the conventional THz/RF channel allocation method of terrestrial networks unsuitable for SAGIN. To address these challenges, we construct an accurate model of SAGIN based on the binomial point process (BPP) model in stochastic geometry. Subsequently, we analyze the network performance, specifically the joint coverage and transmission rate, through the proposed model. We then propose a simulated annealing algorithm-based optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal THz and RF channel allocation, effectively improving the joint coverage and transmission rate performance. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm and provide insights into the deployment rules of SAGIN.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted localization has attracted extensive attention as it can enable and enhance localization services in extreme scenarios. However, most existing works treat RISs as anchors with known positions and orientations, which is not realistic in applications with mobile or uncalibrated RISs. This work considers the joint RIS calibration and user positioning (JrCUP) problem with an active RIS. We propose a novel two-stage method to solve the considered JrCUP problem. The first stage comprises a tensor-estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (tensor-ESPRIT), followed by a channel parameters refinement using least-squares. In the second stage, a two-dimensional search algorithm is proposed to estimate the three-dimensional user and RIS positions, one-dimensional RIS orientation, and clock bias from the estimated channel parameters. The Cramér-Rao lower bounds of the channel parameters and localization parameters are derived to verify the effectiveness of the proposed tensor-ESPRIT-based algorithms. In addition, simulation results reveal that the active RIS can significantly improve the localization performance compared to the passive case under the same system power supply in practical regions. Moreover, we observe the presence of blind areas with limited JrCUP localization performance, which can be mitigated by either leveraging more prior information or deploying extra base stations.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks with power splitting (PS) receivers and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). By exploiting the conjugated beamforming method, the closed-form expressions of the information rate and the total harvested power at each user equipment (UE) are derived. To improve the system spectral efficiency, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated subjecting to the quality of service requirement at each UE and the power budget constraint at each access point by optimizing the UE clustering, the power control coefficients, and the PS ratios. To solve the formulated non-convex and mixed combinatorial problem, a machine learning-based approach is designed. Particularly, the UE clustering is first optimized by using a K-means based method and then the power control coefficients and the PS ratios are jointly optimized by a proposed multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) based method. The impact of the discount factor of the MA-DQN based method on the derived result is discussed. It is proved that by setting the discount factor as zero, the performance loss is negligible. Based on this observation, a zero-discount MA-DQN (0- \\gamma MA-DQN) based method is further proposed to improve the computational efficiency. Also, the computational complexity of the proposed machine learning-based approach is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed machine learning-based approach outperforms various existing approaches. Moreover, it indicates that CF-mMIMO and NOMA could enhance the propagation performance of SWIPT while the proposed machine learning-based approach could facilitate resource allocation.}

	abstract = {The THz band has attracted considerable attention for next-generation wireless communications due to the large amount of available bandwidth that may be key to meet the rapidly increasing data rate requirements. Before deploying a system in this band, a detailed wireless channel analysis is required as the basis for proper design and testing of system implementations. One of the most important deployment scenarios of this band is the outdoor microcellular environment, where the Transmitter (Tx) and the Receiver (Rx) have a significant height difference (typically \\ge 10 m). In this paper, we present double-directional (i.e., directionally resolved at both link ends) channel measurements in such a microcellular scenario encompassing street canyons and an open square. Measurements are done for a 1 GHz bandwidth between 145–146 GHz and an antenna beamwidth of 13 degree; distances between Tx and Rx are up to 85 m and the Tx is at a height of 11.5 m from the ground. The measurements are analyzed to estimate path loss, shadowing, delay spread, angular spread, and multipath component (MPC) power distribution. These results allow the development of more realistic and detailed THz system performance assessment.}

	abstract = {Spatial reuse is an important factor in building highly efficient wireless local area networks. The key to maximizing spatial reuse is to support concurrent transmissions while avoiding packet losses due to interference. However, the current medium access control uses a conservative approach that discourages concurrent transmissions, and the recently introduced spatial reuse operation leads to a lot of packet collisions. This paper proposes two methods, CB-DCF (Contextual Bandit - Distributed Coordination Function) and CB-OBSS/PD (Contextual Bandit - Overlapping Basic Service Set / Preamble Detection), that can improve throughput and fairness of the network. In the proposed methods, nodes run contextual bandit agents that learn to transmit or defer under given states. In CB-DCF, a state consists of the packet destination, the interferer, and the interferer’s destination. Nodes periodically exchange Q tables to prevent concurrent transmissions from destroying the ongoing packet. In CB-OBSS/PD, instead of exchanging Q tables, a node reduces its transmit power when concurrently transmitting with the ongoing packet. While CB-OBSS/PD is simpler to implement, performance of CB-DCF is superior to CB-OBSS/PD. Through extensive simulations with the ns-3 simulator, we show that the proposed methods can achieve high throughput and fairness by intelligently controlling transmissions under various interference conditions.}

	abstract = {This paper is focused on multiuser load modulation arrays (MU-LMAs) which are attractive due to their low system complexity and reduced cost for millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The existing precoding algorithm for downlink MU-LMA relies on a sub-array structured (SAS) transmitter which may suffer from decreased degrees of freedom and complex system configuration. Furthermore, a conventional LMA codebook with codewords uniformly distributed on a hypersphere may not be channel-adaptive and may lead to increased signal detection complexity. In this paper, we conceive an MU-LMA system employing a full-array structured (FAS) transmitter and propose two algorithms accordingly. The proposed FAS-based system addresses the SAS structural problems and can support larger numbers of users. For LMA-imposed constant-power downlink precoding, we propose an FAS-based normalized block diagonalization (FAS-NBD) algorithm. However, the forced normalization may result in performance degradation. This degradation, together with the aforementioned codebook design problems, is difficult to solve analytically. This motivates us to propose a Deep Learning-enhanced (FAS-DL-NBD) algorithm for adaptive codebook design and codebook-independent decoding. It is shown that the proposed algorithms are robust to imperfect knowledge of channel state information and yield excellent error performance. Moreover, the FAS-DL-NBD algorithm enables signal detection with low complexity as the number of bits per codeword increases.}

	abstract = {The rapid growth of mobile network traffic poses major challenges for current wireless networks regarding bandwidth, delay, mobility, and stability. To overcome these obstacles, a new network architecture called Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged, effectively addressing these issues and enhancing content delivery efficiency. However, with the in-network content cache, anyone including unauthorized users can access the content from intermediate network nodes. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight ICN content access control framework based on a hybrid-coding mechanism that combines two or more encoding operations, which does not impose additional complexity on ICN routers. In the proposed scheme, the content is first divided into multiple original blocks, and these original blocks are encoded into encoded blocks using hybrid-coding operations. Each authorized user can obtain private decoding information from the content provider, and decode them into original content using its private decoding information. The proposed scheme can fully utilize ICN’s in-network cache capability and defend against a wide range of attacks. Furthermore, security analysis, ndnSIM-based simulation, and real-world experiments demonstrate the scheme’s security, performance, and scalability.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a promising way to proactively augment propagation environments for better transmission performance in wireless communications. Existing multi-RIS works mainly focus on link-level optimization with predetermined transmission paths, which cannot be directly extended to system-level management, since they neither consider the interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, nor the performance balancing between different transmission paths. To address this, we study an innovative multi-hop multi-RIS communication system, where a base station (BS) transmits information to a set of distributed users over multi-RIS configuration space in a multi-hop manner. The signals for each user are subsequently reflected by the selected RISs via multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links. To ensure that all users have fair access to the system to avoid excessive number of RISs serving one user, we aim to find the optimal beam reflecting path for each user, while judiciously determining the path scheduling strategies with the corresponding beamforming design to ensure the fairness. Due to the presence of interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, it is highly challenging to solve the formulated multi-RIS multi-path beamforming optimization problem. To solve it, we first derive the optimal RISs’ phase shifts and the corresponding reflecting path selection for each user based on its practical deployment location. With the optimized multi-reflection paths, we obtain a feasible user grouping pattern for effective interference mitigation by constructing the maximum independent sets (MISs). Finally, we propose a joint heuristic algorithm to iteratively update the beamforming vectors and the group scheduling policies to maximize the minimum equivalent data rate of all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed transmission framework achieves superior throughput performance than benchmark schemes. Useful insights on how to leverage multi-reflection paths over RISs to boost the throughput performance are also drawn under different settings for the multi-hop multi-RIS communication systems.}

A Lagrange-dual based method is developed to solve this challenging mixed integer program of weighted sum rate maximization, revealing that a “winner-takes-all” policy provides the almost surely optimal client, subchannel, and modulation selections. Experiments on multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks show that OFDMA- \\text{F}^{2}\\text{L}\nwith optimal selections can significantly improve the training convergence and accuracy, e.g., by about 18% and 5%, compared to potential alternatives.}

	abstract = {For the modulation classification problems, the deep learning approaches can determine the unknown modulation formats in high confidence. However, it has been maliciously used by eavesdroppers. In this paper, we consider the wireless communication scenario, in which Alice intends to communicate with Bob confidentially in the threat of Eve, who tries to determine the unknown modulation formats of Alice using some deep learning approach. Recent advancements in adversarial machine learning have demonstrated that the deep learning techniques are vulnerable to crafted perturbations. To prevent Eve from classifying Alice’s modulation formats, Alice transmits the modulation signal with the well-designed adversarial perturbation. We first formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimized adversarial perturbation, in which the objective is to mislead the modulation classifier of Eve subject to the communication constraints, i.e., the power efficiency, the achievable rate, and the reliability. Then, the augmented Lagrangian method is adopted to solve the perturbation optimization problem, in which the implicit objective is evaluated using the Monte Carlo method, and the gradients of the implicit constraints are obtained using the Gaussian-based estimation algorithm. We further extend the perturbation design to the both cases of Alice having and not having the prior knowledge of Eve. Finally, the input-independent universal perturbation for the specific modulation type is proposed, which is deployed via a lookup table method. Numerical results show that the designed perturbation with 10% power of the modulated signal can attack Eve’s modulation classifier with the great success while ensuring both the achievable rate and the reliability close to the ideal case (say, no perturbation). Compared to the existing methods, the designed perturbation achieves the better attack performance and is robust to the filtering, the oversampling, and the time/frequency offset. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the structure type of Eve’s model has a large impact on the attack performance, and verifies that the adversarial perturbation can effectively attack the modulation classifiers that resort to the expert knowledge.}

	abstract = {In distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, multiple geographically separated access points (APs) communicate simultaneously with a user, leveraging the benefits of multi-antenna coherent MIMO processing and macro-diversity gains from the distributed setups. However, time and frequency synchronization of the multiple APs is crucial to achieve good performance and enable joint precoding. In this paper, we analyze the synchronization requirement among multiple APs from a reciprocity perspective, taking into account the multiplicative impairments caused by mismatches in radio frequency (RF) hardware. We demonstrate that a phase calibration of reciprocity-calibrated APs is sufficient for the joint coherent transmission of data to the user. To achieve synchronization, we propose a novel over-the-air synchronization protocol, named BeamSync, to calibrate the geographically separated APs without sending any measurements to the central processing unit (CPU) through fronthaul. We show that sending the synchronization signal in the dominant direction of the channel between APs is optimal. Additionally, we derive the optimal phase and frequency offset estimators. Simulation results indicate that the proposed BeamSync method enhances performance by 3 dB when the number of antennas at the APs is doubled. Moreover, the method performs well compared to traditional beamforming techniques.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR) system, where an RIS acts as a secondary transmitter to transmit its information by leveraging the primary signal as its RF carrier and simultaneously assists the primary transmission. Conventionally, all reflecting elements of the RIS are used to transmit the secondary signal, which, however, would limit its capability for assisting the primary transmission. To address this issue, we propose a novel RIS partitioning scheme, where the RIS is partitioned into two sub-surfaces, one to assist the primary transmission and the other to transmit the secondary signal. Naturally, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between the assistance and transmission capabilities of RIS regarding the surface partitioning strategy. Considering the coupling effect between the primary and secondary transmissions, we focus on the detection of the composite signal formed by the primary and secondary ones, based on which we propose a novel two-step detector. Then, we formulate the assistance-transmission tradeoff problem to minimize the bit error rate (BER) of the composite signal by jointly optimizing the surface partitioning strategy and the phase shifts of the two sub-surfaces, such that the overall BER of RIS-assisted SR is minimized. By solving this problem, we show that the optimized surface partitioning strategy depends on the channel strength ratio of the direct link to the reflected link. Moreover, performance analysis shows that when the direct link is blocked, exchanging the number of reflecting elements used for assistance and transmission can still achieve almost the same BER of the composite signal thanks to the coupling effect. Finally, extensive simulations show that our proposed RIS partitioning scheme outperforms the conventional schemes which use all reflecting elements for either assistance or transmission.}

In this paper, we propose an optimization-based quantized FL algorithm, which can appropriately fit a general edge computing system with uniform or nonuniform computing and communication resources at the workers. Specifically, we first present a new random quantization scheme and analyze its properties. Then, we propose a general quantized FL algorithm, namely GQFedWAvg. Specifically, GQFedWAvg applies the proposed quantization scheme to quantize wisely chosen model update-related vectors and adopts a generalized mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method with the weighted average local model updates in global model aggregation. Besides, GQFedWAvg has several adjustable algorithm parameters to flexibly adapt to the computing and communication resources at the server and workers. We also analyze the convergence of GQFedWAvg. Next, we optimize the algorithm parameters of GQFedWAvg to minimize the convergence error under the time and energy constraints. We successfully tackle the challenging non-convex problem using general inner approximation (GIA) and multiple delicate tricks. Finally, we interpret GQFedWAvg’s function principle and show its considerable gains over existing FL algorithms using numerical results.}

	abstract = {We consider a multi-user multi-server mobile edge computing (MEC) system, in which users arrive on a network randomly over time and generate computation tasks, which will be computed either locally on their own computing devices or be offloaded to one of the MEC servers. Under such a dynamic network environment, we propose a novel task offloading policy based on hybrid online–offline learning, which can efficiently reduce the overall computation delay and energy consumption only with information available at nearest MEC servers from each user. We provide a practical signaling and learning framework that can train deep neural networks for both online and offline learning and can adjust its offloading policy based on the queuing status of each MEC server and network dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the average computation delay for a broad class of network environments compared to the conventional offloading methods. It is further shown that the proposed hybrid online–offline learning framework can be extended to a general cost function reflecting both delay- and energy-dependent metrics.}

Moreover, switching-off physical resource blocks (PRBs) and carrier shutdown saves energy in low load scenarios. However, the joint optimization of spectral PRB allocation and spatial layering in a heterogeneous network has not been completely solved yet. Therefore, we study a power consumption model for multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO 5G network, capturing the joint effects of both dimensions. We characterize the optimal resource allocation under practical constraints, i.e., limited number of available antennas, PRBs, base stations (BSs), and frequency bands. We observe a single spatial layer achieving lowest energy consumption in very low load scenarios, whereas, spatial layering is required in high load scenarios. Finally, we derive novel algorithms for energy efficient user (UE) to BS assignment and propose an adaptive algorithm for PRB assignment and power control. All results are illustrated by numerical system-level simulations, describing a realistic metropolis scenario. The results show that a higher frequency band should be used to support UEs with large rate requirements via spatial multiplexing and assigning each UE maximum available PRBs.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving distributed training scheme, where multiple devices collaborate to train machine learning models by uploading local model updates. To improve communication efficiency, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been applied to FL, which leverages analog modulation to harness the superposition property of radio waves such that numerous devices can upload their model updates concurrently for aggregation. However, the uplink channel noise incurs considerable model aggregation distortion, which is critically determined by the device scheduling and compromises the learned model performance. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic device scheduling framework for over-the-air FL, named PO-FL, to mitigate the negative impact of channel noise, where each device is scheduled according to a certain probability and its model update is reweighted using this probability in aggregation. We prove the unbiasedness of this aggregation scheme and demonstrate the convergence of PO-FL on both convex and non-convex loss functions. Our convergence bounds unveil that the device scheduling affects the learning performance through the communication distortion and global update variance. Based on the convergence analysis, we further develop a channel and gradient-importance aware algorithm to optimize the device scheduling probabilities in PO-FL. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed PO-FL framework with channel and gradient-importance awareness achieves faster convergence and produces better models than baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are viewed as a key component of 5G, 6G and beyond wireless networks to receive, store and forward information. Benefiting from swift deployment, low cost and high mobility, it has become a promising trend to leverage the UAVs to assist the covert communicator (Alice) against the detector’s (Willie’s) detection in a covert communication network. Nevertheless, once Willie notices the covert transmission process, the covert information is exposed to the risk of being cracked. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted covert communication asymmetric information game model (UCCAIG) that focuses on the covert communication countermeasure process based on information asymmetry. We introduce the UAV into covert communication relay assistant Alice and interference assistant Willie respectively, analyze the interaction between Alice and Willie, and derive the optimal strategies for both sides. We further prove the existence of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) in the UCCAIG. In addition, we evaluate our proposals on a covert communication testbed with software radio, and the numerical results show that our proposed strategy increases the payoffs of Alice, reduces the payoffs of Willie in a variety of scenarios, and improves the covert communication rate compared with UAV-relayed game (URG).}

	abstract = {In this paper, an efficient near-field channel reconstruction and user equipment (UE) localization scheme is proposed for extremely large antenna array (ELAA) systems using a subarray hybrid precoding architecture. Considering the non-negligible signal amplitude and phase variations across the different receive antennas, a more realistic channel model is adopted. The channel environment, with an approximate smooth ground surface, is modeled. In fact, the channel can be divided into a line-of-sight (LoS) path, a reflection path and some non-LoS (NLoS) paths. Based on the sparsity of the channel in the spatial domain, the damped Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (DNOMP) algorithm is also proposed to accurately estimate the multipaths, and reconstruct the channel. Then, a UE localization algorithm is proposed, which can detect the existence of the LoS path and locate the UE. A joint localization algorithm is also devised to further increase the positioning reliability. Simulation results verify that the DNOMP algorithm can reconstruct the channel with better NMSE performance than other schemes. The localization algorithm can locate the UE with low error whenever the LoS path exists or not, with an accuracy close enough to the position error bound (PEB), while the joint localization algorithm can further enhance the positioning reliability.}

	abstract = {Mounting reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called UAV-RIS, combines the benefits of these two techniques, which can further improve the communication performance. However, high-quality air-ground channel links are more vulnerable to both the adversarial eavesdropping and the malicious jamming. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliable and secure communication approach assisted by the UAV-RIS to maximize the secrecy rate, while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the legitimate user against both the eavesdroppers and the jammer. Specifically, with the imperfect channel state information and behaviors of mixed attacks, we try to maximize the achievable worst-case secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmit beamforming, artificial noise, UAV-RIS placement, and RIS’s passive beamforming. As the optimization problem is non-convex and the environment is highly dynamic, a post-decision state deep Q-network combined with Fourier feature mapping algorithm (called PDS-DQN-FFM) is further designed to effectively achieve the robust anti-attack transmission strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed learning based reliable and secure transmission approach significantly enhances both the secrecy rate and QoS satisfaction level as compared with existing approaches.}

To further improve performance, a model-driven deep learning (DL) approach is designed, where trainable variables and graph neural networks are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. We also extend the proposed method to include beamforming with imperfect channel state information and derive a two-timescale stochastic optimization algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of complexity and WSR. Specifically, the model-driven DL approach has a runtime that is approximately 3% of the state-of-the-art algorithm to achieve the same performance.

However, pure data-driven methods for learning precoding suffer from high complexity of training and poor generalizability to problem scales, while existing model-driven learning methods are either algorithm-specific or problem-specific. In this paper, we propose a model-based graph neural network (GNN) to learn precoding policies by harnessing their properties and relevant mathematical model. We first show that a vanilla GNN cannot learn zero-forcing precoding when the numbers of antennas and users are large, and is not generalizable to the numbers of users. Then, we conceive a new GNN structure by resorting to the iterative Taylor’s expansion of matrix pseudo-inverse, which can adapt to the interference strength among users. Simulation results show that the proposed GNN can well-learn different precoding policies (say spectral efficient and energy efficient precoding policies as well as coordinated beamforming) with low training complexity. Moreover, it can be generalized to the number of users, which is highly desirable in practice since the number of scheduled users may change in milliseconds.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in revolutionizing the traditional communications system. Many applications in communications have adopted DL techniques due to their powerful representation ability. However, the learning-based methods can be dependent on the training dataset and perform worse on unseen interference due to limited model generalizability and complexity. In this paper, we consider the semantic communication (SemCom) system with multiple users, where there is a limited number of training samples and unexpected interference. To improve the model generalization ability and reduce the model size, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) based system where Transformer based encoder-decoder is implemented as the semantic encoder-decoder and fully connected neural networks are implemented as the channel encoder-decoder. Specifically, four types of knowledge transfer and model compression are analyzed. Important system and model parameters are considered, including the level of noise and interference, the number of interfering users and the size of the encoder and decoder. Numerical results demonstrate that KD significantly improves the robustness and the generalization ability when applied to unexpected interference, and it reduces the performance loss when compressing the model size.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation is crucial to modern wireless systems and becomes increasingly challenging when the ultra-sized antenna is configured in sub-6GHz wireless communication systems. In an ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (U-MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) system, the channel demonstrates spatial non-stationarity. Additionally, the limited pilot location in the OFDM system further complicates the channel estimation process. In this paper, we propose a model-data dual-driven (MDD) scheme to jointly perform the model-driven non-stationary channel denoising and the data-driven channel interpolation in an end-to-end way, which is followed by a low-complexity channel refinement module to improve the robustness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, image contour extraction (ICE) is utilized to effectively eliminate the non-stationary noises in the channel matrices before being sent to the downstream interpolation network. An enhanced convolutional neural network (CNN)-based residual network (eCNN-RN) is developed to perform non-linear interpolations for recovering the U-MIMO-OFDM channels. Based on ICE, the proposed online refinement module can improve the generalizability of the learned model to a practical environment. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the cross-fertilization of the model-driven and data-driven approaches.}

	abstract = {The increased flexibility and density of spectrum access in 5G New Radio (NR) has made jamming detection and classification a critical research area. To detect coexisting jamming and subtle interference, we introduce a Bayesian Inference-assisted machine learning (ML) methodology. Our methodology uses cross-layer Key Performance Indicator data collected on a Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G NR testbed to leverage supervised learning models, and is further assessed, calibrated, and revealed using Bayesian Network Model (BNM)-based inference. The models can operate on both instantaneous and sequential time-series data samples, achieving an Area under Curve above 0.954 for instantaneous models and above 0.988 for sequential models including the echo state network (ESN) from the Reservoir Computing (RC) family, across various jamming scenarios. The 180 ms instantaneous detection time allows for continuous tracking of the dynamic jamming condition due to UE mobility. Our approach serves as a validation method and a resilience enhancement tool for ML-based jamming detection while also enabling root cause identification for observed performance degradation. The introduced BNM-based inference proof-of-concept is successful in addressing 72.2% of the erroneous predictions of the RC-based sequential detection model caused by insufficient training data samples, thereby demonstrating its near real-time applicability in 5G NR and Beyond-5G networks.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated sensing, navigation, and communication (ISNC) framework for safeguarding unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless networks against a mobile eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV). To cope with the mobility of the E-UAV, the proposed framework advocates the dual use of artificial noise transmitted by the information UAV (I-UAV) for simultaneous jamming and sensing to facilitate navigation and secure communication. In particular, the I-UAV communicates with legitimate downlink ground users, while avoiding potential information leakage by emitting jamming signals, and estimates the state of the E-UAV with an extended Kalman filter based on the backscattered jamming signals. Exploiting the estimated state of the E-UAV in the previous time slot, the I-UAV determines its flight planning strategy, predicts the wiretap channel, and designs its communication resource allocation policy for the next time slot. To circumvent the severe coupling between these three tasks, a divide-and-conquer approach is adopted. The online navigation design has the objective to minimize the distance between the I-UAV and a pre-defined destination point considering kinematic and geometric constraints. Subsequently, given the predicted wiretap channel, the robust resource allocation design is formulated as an optimization problem to achieve the optimal trade-off between sensing and communication in the next time slot, while taking into account the wiretap channel prediction error and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of secure communication. To account for the E-UAV state sensing uncertainty and the resulting wiretap channel prediction error, we employ a fully-connected neural network to model the complicated mapping between the state estimation error variance and an upper bound on the channel prediction error, which facilitates the development of a low-complexity suboptimal user scheduling and precoder design algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed design compared with baseline schemes and validate the benefits of integrating sensing and navigation into secure UAV communication systems. We reveal that the dual use of artificial noise can improve both sensing and jamming and that navigation is more important for improving the trade-off between sensing and communications than communication resource allocation.}

	abstract = {As the demand for vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) band in the 5.9 GHz increases, the millimeter-wave spectrum offers alternative options in unlicensed or radar-dedicated bands with wider bandwidth. Joint radar-communication (JRC) systems emerge as a comprehensive solution to effectively utilize these bands by integrating both functions within the same waveform and hardware. In this work, we present a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) JRC testbed, operating in the 24 GHz mmWave band, utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform that simultaneously carries data across all subcarriers. In particular, we develop a real-time operating, full-duplex JRC prototype with a fully-digital front-end and software-defined radios, providing enhanced flexibility and capability. Additionally, for systems with high computational power, we introduce a high-resolution range-angle processing method based on the MUSIC algorithm. Through mobile experiments with multiple targets, we showcase simultaneous data transmission and high-resolution radar processing capabilities enabled by the fully-digital MIMO architecture. By leveraging radar’s tracking capability, we propose a radar-assisted precoding approach, offering a low-complexity beamforming solution with reduced feedback overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed precoding method achieves comparable performance compared to the conventional precoding method.}

In order to optimize both the beamformers and power allocation while dealing simultaneously with outage minimization and sum rate maximization (SRM) requirements, a regularized sum-ofoutage minimization problem is formulated. The problem is then transformed into an empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem, solved via block stochastic learning and manifold optimization, with required learning rates derived and tuned to guarantee convergence. The method, which demands only a few radio frequency (RF) chains and relies only on knowledge of blockage probabilities, is shown via simulation results not only to outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) alternatives, but to actually achieve outage probabilities comparable to those a fully digital CoMP-SRM scheme with perfect knowledge of instantaneous blockages.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a hybrid ambient backscatter communication (ABC) assisted framework for radio frequency (RF) powered cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In these CRNs, the secondary users (SUs) can actively transmit data when the primary user network (PUN) is idle, and harvest energy from the primary signal and transmit their own information over the primary signal when the PUN is busy. The proposed CRNs adopt non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to further improve spectral efficiency. Considering two different spectrum sharing paradigms of the PUN and the SUs, we formulate two optimization problems by two Markov decision processes (MDPs) to maximize our long term throughputs for both underlay-interweave and overlay-interweave scenarios. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization algorithm, i.e., a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based joint reflection coefficients adjustment and resource allocation (JCARA) algorithm, to solve these two non-convex problems under the two constructed MDPs without the non-causal and the statistical information about the dynamic environment a-priori. For the underlay-interweave scenario, the proposed JCARA algorithm jointly optimizes the transmit power and the reflection coefficients of the SUs, while for the overlay-interweave scenario it optimizes the above two variables plus time resource simultaneously. Simulation results clearly show the higher throughput performance of this proposed algorithm for the proposed CRNs in the comparison with other algorithms.}

We selected 82 transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions and collected over 75,000 spatial and temporal channel impulse responses. The TX-RX distance ranged from 5 to 87 m. Steerable directional horn antennas were employed at both link ends and were switched between vertical and horizontal polarization. Measurements were conducted with low RX and high RX antenna heights of 0.5 m and 1.5 m to characterize the propagation channel for close-to-floor applications such as automated guided vehicles. Results show that the low RXs experience an average path loss increase of 10.7 dB and 6.0 dB at LOS and NLOS locations, respectively. In addition, channel enhancement measurements were conducted using a steerable large flat metal plate as a passive reflecting surface, demonstrating omnidirectional path loss reduction from 0.5 to 22 dB with a mean of 6.5 dB. This paper presents the first statistical channel characterization and path loss modeling for industrial scenarios at sub-THz frequencies, highlighting the potential for ultra-broadband factory communications in the 6G era.}

We develop an iterative algorithm to solve the non-convex problem globally optimally. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with the traditional schemes.}

	abstract = {Full-duplex (FD) is an attractive technology that can significantly boost the throughput of wireless communications. However, it is limited by the severe self-interference (SI) from the transmitter to the local receiver. In this paper, we propose a new SI cancellation (SIC) scheme based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), where small RISs are deployed inside FD devices to enhance SIC capability and system capacity under frequency-selective fading channels. The novel scheme can not only address the challenges associated with SIC but also improve the overall performance. We first analyze the near-field behavior of the RIS and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the SIC capability by controlling the reflection coefficients (RCs) of the RIS and allocating the transmit power of the device. The problem is solved with alternate optimization (AO) algorithm in three cases: ideal case, where both the amplitude and phase of each RIS unit cell can be controlled independently and continuously, continuous phases, where the phase of each RIS unit cell can be controlled independently, while the amplitude is fixed to one, and discrete phases, where the RC of each RIS unit cell can only take discrete values and these discrete values are equally spaced on the unit circle. For the ideal case, the closed-form solution to RC is derived with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Based on Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm, we optimize the RC for the case of continuous phases and then extend the solution to the case of discrete phases by the nearest point projection (NPP) method. Simulation results are given to validate the performance of our proposed SIC scheme.}

VoI is a performance metric to measure the importance of data packets with different levels of urgency. The proposed scheme aims to avoid collision with the ongoing packet transmission of static nodes without their accurate global information. In specific, the static node localization stage and the topology construction stage are carried out to obtain the local information. Furthermore, the transmission scheduling stage is implemented to avoid packet collision and formulates a combinatorial optimization problem maximizing VoI under the constraint of packet collision avoidance. To solve this complicated problem, a low-complexity distributed search algorithm is proposed, which exploits the spatial-temporal reuse to establish data packet collision constraints and then determines the next-hop node and data transmission time for AUVs. In addition, a collaborative search algorithm is proposed to avoid packet collision among different AUVs by enabling collaboration among AUVs. Extensive simulation results under various scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an innovative learning-based channel prediction scheme so as to achieve higher prediction accuracy and reduce the requirements of huge amounts and strict sequential format of channel data. Inspired by the idea of the neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE), we first prove that the channel prediction problem can be modeled as an ODE problem with a known initial value by analyzing the physical process of electromagnetic wave propagation within a mobile environment. Then, we design a novel physics-inspired spatial channel gradient network (SCGnet), which represents the derivative process of channel varying as a special neural network and can obtain the gradients at any relative displacement needed for the ODE solving. With the SCGnet, the static channel at any location served by the base station is accurately inferred through consecutive propagation and integration. Finally, we design an efficient recurrent positioning algorithm based on some prior knowledge of user mobility to obtain the velocity vector and propose an approximate Doppler compensation method to make up the instantaneous angular-delay domain channel. Only discrete historical channel data is needed for the training, whereas only a few fresh channel measurements are needed for the prediction, which ensures the scheme’s practicability. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed scheme is most efficient in representing, learning, and predicting mobile wireless channels.}

It is generally challenging to obtain the sample for deep learning-based hybrid precoding due to its need of massive precoding vector and channel matrix. To effectively solve this issue, a novel coordinated hybrid precoding algorithm based on unsupervised learning graph attention networks (CHP-ULGAT) is first developed by making full use of the underlying topology formed by the channel matrix. Subsequently, a more realistic situation of existing an ultra-low execution time is considered. A sub-optimal coordinated hybrid precoding based on unsupervised learning convolutional neural networks (CHP-ULCNN) is proposed to further reduce complexity. Moreover, we present effective ways to design the multi-matrix operation and the loss function to address the practicability of the algorithm. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed hybrid-precoding algorithms have obvious advantages in spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) improvement with ultra-low computational complexity, considering the different number of RF chains and deployment scenarios.}

	abstract = {Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology to improve wireless communication performance by varying the antenna position in a given finite area at the transceivers to create more favorable channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the MA-enhanced multiple-access channel (MAC) for the uplink transmission from multiple users each equipped with a single MA to a base station (BS) with a fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. A field-response based channel model is used to characterize the multi-path channel between the antenna array of the BS and each user’s MA with a flexible position. To evaluate the MAC performance gain provided by MAs, we formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the total transmit power of users, subject to a minimum-achievable-rate requirement for each user, where the positions of MAs and the transmit powers of users, as well as the receive combining matrix of the BS are jointly optimized. To solve this non-convex optimization problem involving intricately coupled variables, we develop two algorithms based on zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining methods, respectively. Specifically, for each algorithm, the combining matrix of the BS and the total transmit power of users are expressed as a function of the MAs’ position vectors, which are then optimized by using the proposed multi-directional descent (MDD) framework. It is shown that the proposed ZF-based and MMSE-based MDD algorithms can converge to high-quality suboptimal solutions with low computational complexities. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solutions for MA-enhanced multiple access systems can significantly decrease the total transmit power of users as compared to conventional FPA systems employing antenna selection under both perfect and imperfect field-response information.}

	abstract = {One key feature of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G is to support short packet transmission (SPT). However, the pilot overhead in SPT for channel estimation is relatively high, especially in high Doppler environments. In this paper, we advocate the adoption of differential modulation to support ultra-low latency services, which can ease the channel estimation burden and reduce the power and bandwidth overhead incurred in traditional coherent modulation schemes. Specifically, we consider a multi-connectivity (MC) scheme employing differential modulation to enable URLLC services. The popular selection combining and maximal ratio combining schemes are respectively applied to explore the diversity gain in the MC scheme. A first-order autoregressive model is further utilized to characterize the time-varying nature of the channel. Theoretically, the maximum achievable rate and minimum achievable block error rate under ergodic fading channels with PSK inputs and perfect CSI are first derived by using the non-asymptotic information-theoretic bounds. The performance of SPT with differential modulation and MC schemes is then analysed by characterizing the effect of differential modulation and time-varying channels as a reduction in the effective SNR. Simulation results show that differential modulation does offer a significant advantage over the pilot-assisted coherent scheme for SPT, especially in high Doppler environments.}

	abstract = {The exploitation of the substantial bandwidths available in the terahertz (THz) band has recently attracted considerable interest. However, beam squint effect is a significant obstacle in the design of wideband hybrid beamformers. The beam squint effect causes the radiation beam to deviate from the desired direction, resulting in substantial gain losses and hindering the effective utilization of available bandwidths. Delay-phase precoding (DPP), a combination of true time delay (TTD) elements and phase shifters (PSs) in the analog domain, has emerged as a potential solution to overcome the beam squint effect and maintain practical system design. However, existing hybrid precoding schemes that assume infinite resolution and unbounded range TTDs, as well as infinite resolution PSs, impose a significant burden in terms of hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, we introduce the Delta-Delay-Phase Precoding (DDPP) architecture, which significantly reduces the required delay range of TTDs, outperforming existing state-of-the-art solutions in the literature. Importantly, the proposed architecture maintains consistently superior performance, even as the number of antenna elements increases, making it scalable for UM-MIMO systems. Additionally, we propose hardware-aware designs for the hybrid analog precoder to combat beam squint effect while complying with the hardware limitations of TTDs and PSs. We formulate the design of TTDs and PSs as a joint optimization problem subject to their finite-resolution constraints. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative precoding algorithm based on alternating minimization. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid analog precoding schemes over recent literature works. Particularly, the proposed precoding schemes achieve near-optimal performance despite the hardware limitations of TTDs and PSs.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel hybrid precoding scheme, named group-and-codebook based two-timescale hybrid precoding (GC-THP), for reducing complexity in millimeter wave massive MIMO systems. The scheme clusters users into groups based on their statistical similarity and selects analog beams from a codebook with orthogonal beams. The base station time-shares among multiple analog precoders, each serving a subset of user groups, for fairness. At the slow timescale, the analog precoders, together with their corresponding group scheduling vectors and time-sharing factors, are jointly optimized, while at the fast timescale, short-term user scheduling and digital precoding are performed for a given analog precoder and its associated group scheduling vector. The proposed scheme employs beam-domain channel statistics with reduced dimension to optimize the proportional fairness utility. By applying user grouping and codebook based analog precoding, the proposed scheme significantly reduces complexity while retaining high performance levels. Moreover, the implementation complexity is tunable by adjusting the codebook size and the number of user groups, allowing for flexible performance-complexity tradeoffs. Simulation results confirm a superior performance-complexity tradeoff for the proposed GC-THP in comparison to the existing hybrid precoding schemes.}

	abstract = {Recently, deep learning (DL) based semantic communication systems have shown great potential to improve transmission efficiency in various tasks. However, the coexisting mechanism between semantic communications and other services remains unexplored, which limits the application of semantic communications in practical communication systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multiplexing and co-scheduling scheme for the semantic and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) traffic coexisting systems. In particular, a joint resource allocation and model training problem is formulated, which aims at maximizing the utility of semantic service while satisfying the latency requirement of URLLC traffic. To reduce the computational complexity, the original problem is simplified and decoupled into a joint resource allocation and model selection problem and a robust model training problem. In the resource allocation and model selection phase, the original problem is decomposed into three subproblems and an alternating optimization algorithm is then proposed to obtain the optimal resource allocation result. In the model training phase, a two-stage semantic communication network is designed, which can efficiently mitigate the impact of feature erasure brought by the random arrival of URLLC traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of semantic service while satisfying the latency requirement of URLLC traffic.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is recognized as a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm, given its potential to enable collaborative model training among distributed devices without sharing their raw data. However, supporting FL over wireless networks confronts the critical challenges of periodically executing power-hungry training tasks on energy-constrained devices and transmitting high-dimensional model updates over spectrum-limited channels. In this paper, we reap the benefits of both energy harvesting (EH) and over-the-air computation (AirComp) to alleviate the battery limitation by harvesting ambient energy to support both the training and transmission of local models, and to achieve low-latency model aggregation by concurrently transmitting local gradients via AirComp. We characterize the convergence of the proposed FL by deriving an upper bound of the expected optimality gap, revealing that the convergence depends on the accumulated errors due to partial device participation and model distortion, both of which further depend on dynamic energy levels. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint AirComp transceiver design and device scheduling problem, which is then tackled by developing an efficient Lyapunov-based online optimization algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that, by appropriately scheduling devices and allocating energy across multiple communication rounds, our proposed algorithm achieves a much better learning performance than benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Load balancing (LB) is a key challenge in hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets), due to the nature of heterogeneous access points (APs). Machine learning has the potential to provide a complexity-friendly LB solution with near-optimal network performance, at the cost of a non-trivial training process. The state-of-the-art learning-aided LB methods require retraining when the network environment (particularly the user number) changes, significantly limiting their practicability. In this paper a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure, named adaptive target-condition neural network (A-TCNN), is proposed to tackle the LB issue for a varying number of users, without the need for retraining. Unlike the existing LB methods conducting AP selection for all users together, the new method performs AP selection for a single target user, upon the condition of other users. Also, A-TCNN involves an adaptive mechanism which maps any smaller number of users to a preset number by splitting the users’ data rate requirements, without affecting the AP selection result for the target user. Once trained, A-TCNN can be used for any user numbers not exceeding the maximum user number that the network can support. Results show that apart from the adaptiveness to a varying user number, A-TCNN provides a higher network throughput (up to 45%) than the conventional DNN in most cases, especially for a larger scale of network. In terms of computational complexity, A-TCNN can achieve a sub-millisecond level runtime, which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than fuzzy logic and 3 orders of magnitude lower than game theory.}

	abstract = {Localization is envisioned as a key enabler to satisfy the requirements of communications and context-aware services in the fifth/sixth generation (5G/6G) communication systems. User localization can be achieved based on delay and angle estimation using uplink/downlink pilot signals. However, hardware impairments (HWIs) (such as phase noise and mutual coupling) distort the signals at both the transmitter and receiver sides and thus affect the localization performance. While this impact can be ignored at lower frequencies with less severe HWIs, and less stringent localization requirements, modeling and analysis efforts are needed for high-frequency bands to assess degradation in localization accuracy due to HWIs. In this work, we model various types of impairments for a mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output communication system and conduct a misspecified Cramér-Rao bound analysis to evaluate HWI-induced performance losses in terms of angle/delay estimation and the resulting 3D position/orientation estimation error. We also investigate the effect of individual and overall HWIs on communications in terms of symbol error rate (SER). Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that each type of HWI leads to a different level of degradation in angle and delay estimation performance, and the prominent impairment factors on delay estimation will have a dominant negative effect on SER.}

	abstract = {Ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) plays a critical role for the coming era of wireless industrial automation, which increases the flexibility without moderating the stringent requirements of latency and reliability. The task for URLLC is to deliver short packets from sensors to actuators via the central controller reliably and timely, during which large bandwidth is required for ensuring stringent quality-of-service (QoS) metrics. Due to the scarce spectrum resource shared by a large number of devices, and the dynamic channel changes over wireless links, it is challenging to achieve bandwidth-saving URLLC with one single method. Motivated by the observation that groups of devices working in close proximity to each other can form device-to-device (D2D) communications, this paper considers multi-connectivity (MC) together with other cross-layer methods including grant-free access, data replication, broadcasting, and processor-sharing server to minimize the total bandwidth under the QoS constraints of URLLC. With the cross-layer design, we fisrt derive the packet loss probability including the factors of collision due to the contention-based access scheme and decoding error due to the dynamic wireless channel, and hence the overall reliability of MC is provided. Then, we establish a framework to minimize the total bandwidth of MC, where the relationship of collision and packet loss probabilities, the monotonicity of collision and decoding error probabilities, and the relationship of the third type blocklength and size rule are proved to find the optimal resource allocation. Simulation results validate the analysis and show the performance gain by optimizing resource allocation with the considered cross-layer design.}

	abstract = {Model order estimation (MOE) is often a pre-requisite for Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation. Due to limits imposed by array geometry, it is typically not possible to estimate spatial parameters for an arbitrary number of sources; an estimate of the signal model is usually required. MOE is the process of selecting the most likely signal model from several candidates. While classic methods fail at MOE in the presence of coherent multipath interference, data-driven supervised learning models can solve this problem. Instead of the classic MLP (Multiple Layer Perceptions) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) architectures, we propose the application of Residual Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), with grouped symmetric kernel filters to deliver state-of-art estimation accuracy of up to 95.2% in the presence of coherent multipath, and a weighted loss function to eliminate underestimation error of the model order. We show the benefit of the approach by demonstrating its impact on an overall signal processing flow that determines the number of total signals received by the array, the number of independent sources, and the association of each of the paths with those sources. Moreover, we show that the proposed estimator provides accurate performance over a variety of array types, can identify the overloaded scenario, and ultimately provides strong DoA estimation and signal association performance.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has garnered significant research attention in recent years. However, previous research has overlooked the potential privacy disclosure problem caused by transmitting CSI datasets during the training process. In this study, we introduce a federated edge learning (FEEL)-based training framework for DL-based CSI feedback. This approach differs from the conventional centralized learning (CL)-based framework, where the CSI datasets are collected at the base station (BS) before training. Instead, each user equipment (UE) trains a local autoencoder network and exchanges model parameters with the BS. This approach provides better protection for data privacy compared to CL. To further reduce communication overhead in FEEL, we quantize the uplink and downlink model transmission into different bits based on their influence on feedback performance. Additionally, since the heterogeneity of CSI datasets among different UEs can degrade the performance of the FEEL-based framework, we introduce a personalization strategy to enhance feedback performance. This strategy allows for local fine-tuning to adapt the global model to the channel characteristics of each UE. Simulation results indicate that the proposed personalized FEEL-based training framework can significantly improve the performance of DL-based CSI feedback while reducing communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising technique for the sixth generation (6G) of mobile communication networks. The key feature of RIS is to reconfigure the propagation environment via smart signal reflections. In addition, active RIS schemes have been recently proposed to overcome the deep path loss attenuation inherent in the RIS-aided communication systems. Accordingly, this paper considers the secrecy performance of up-link RIS-aided multiple users multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems, in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. In contrast to the existing works, we investigate the impact of the RIS phase shift errors on the secrecy performance. Taking into account the complex environment, where a general Rician channel model is adopted for all the communication links, closed-form approximate expressions for the ergodic secrecy rate are derived for three RIS configurations, namely, i) passive RIS, ii) active RIS, iii) active RIS with energy harvesting (EH RIS). Then, based on the derived expressions, we optimize the phase shifts at the RIS to enhance the system performance. In addition, the best RIS configuration selection is considered for a given target secrecy rate and amount of the power available at the users. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis, and the impact of different system parameters on the secrecy performance is investigated. The results in this paper show that, an active RIS scheme can be implemented to enhance the secrecy performance of RIS-aided communication systems with phase shift errors, especially when the users have limited transmission power.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the integration of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in downlink cellular-connected UAV networks, which include both aerial users (AUs) and terrestrial users (TUs). AUs are categorized into CoMP-AUs and Non-CoMP AUs based on a comparison of the desired signal strength and the dominant interference strength. CoMP-AUs receive transmissions from two cooperative Base Stations (BSs) and form two exclusive NOMA clusters with two TUs, respectively. A Non-CoMP AU forms a NOMA cluster with a TU served by the same BS. Leveraging the tools from stochastic geometry, we propose an analytical framework to assess the performance of the CoMP-NOMA-based cellular-connected UAV network in terms of coverage probability and average ergodic rate. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CoMP-NOMA scheme by comparing it with three benchmark schemes, and further quantify the impacts of key system parameters on network performance. By harnessing the benefits of both CoMP and NOMA, we prove that the proposed scheme can provide a reliable connection for AUs using CoMP and enhance the average ergodic rate through the application of NOMA technique.}

	abstract = {Over-The-Air (OTA) measurement is considered the preferred method for measuring the antenna system and end-to-end performance of Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) devices under test. Spatial correlation has been widely utilized as a key metric for evaluating the accuracy of MIMO OTA measurements. However, there is no guarantee that the standard signal streams convoluted with specified impulse responses will be ideally independent of each other in the implementation of the MIMO OTA testing system. Thus, it is envisaged that the spatial correlation in practical MIMO OTA testing systems may not be exactly equivalent to the expected value of the ideal theoretical model. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework for evaluating the spatial correlation performance of MIMO OTA testing system. This evaluation framework provides a novel observation method for spatial correlation, which reflects the non-ideal configuration of the MIMO OTA testing system and can be utilized to predict or cross-validate spatial correlation errors that deviate from the theoretical model. The experimental and simulation results have been verified against the theoretical model, demonstrating good consistency between the theoretical model and the proposed evaluation framework. Furthermore, several test scenarios have been verified with the different varying factors.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a highly promising technology for future wireless communication networks. Very recently, a novel beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS architecture has been proposed. This new architecture remarkably extends the traditional diagonal RIS model and yields much more powerful beamforming capability. Meanwhile, however, the emerging symmetry and orthogonality conditions imposed onto BD-RIS’ reflection matrix make its optimization highly difficult, especially when BD-RIS must satisfy numerous additional constraints. This difficulty arises in many BD-RIS applications and has remained unsolved so far. To resolve the above challenge, leveraging the penalty dual decomposition methodology, this paper proposes a novel unified approach that can optimize BD-RIS configuration when it is involved in any number of nonconvex constraints. Especially, we utilize our new approach to solve the power minimization and energy efficiency maximization problems when BD-RIS involves multiple quality-of-service constraints, which have not yet been solved in the literature. Besides, our new approach can also efficiently solve the sum-rate maximization in the BD-RIS assisted system by providing a new analytic-update-based solution, which is more efficient than existing methods. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach and the significant benefit of BD-RIS over the conventional diagonal RIS.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel data-driven approach to allocate transmit power for federated learning (FL) over interference-limited wireless networks. The proposed method is useful in challenging scenarios where the wireless channel is changing during the FL training process and when the training data are not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) on the local devices. Intuitively, the power policy is designed to optimize the information received at the server end during the FL process under communication constraints. Ultimately, our goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the global FL model being trained. The proposed power allocation policy is parameterized using graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and the associated constrained optimization problem is solved through a primal-dual (PD) algorithm. Theoretically, we show that the formulated problem has a zero duality gap and, once the power policy is parameterized, optimality depends on how expressive this parameterization is. Numerically, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines under different wireless channel settings and varying degrees of data heterogeneity.}

In particular, we consider an RIS-assisted ISAC system in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) simultaneously performs multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) communications and radar sensing with the assistance of an RIS. We focus on both target detection and parameter estimation performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Cramér-Rao bound (CRB), respectively. Two optimization problems are formulated for maximizing the achievable sum-rate of the multi-user communications under an SNR constraint for target detection or a CRB constraint for parameter estimation, the transmit power budget, and the unit-modulus constraint of the RIS reflection coefficients. Efficient algorithms are developed to solve these two complicated non-convex problems. We then extend the proposed joint design algorithms to the scenario with imperfect self-interference cancellation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed joint beamforming and reflection designs compared with other schemes. In addition, it is shown that more RIS reflection elements bring larger performance gains for direct-of-arrival (DoA) estimation than for target detection.}

	abstract = {As aerial mobile receivers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) possess the capability to localize and track dynamically moving objects that broadcast signals. In practice, the performance of localization and tracking is heavily reliant on the observation sequence of time-variant received signal strength (RSS) from the dynamic object on UAVs. However, this sequence can be significantly distorted by complex land layouts. In this paper, we propose dynamic object tracking by muti-UAV with time-variant radio maps, which contain rich information on the impact of land layouts on RSS. We generate the time-variant radio maps from real-world topographic data, which can be highly complex, from the multi-UAV perspectives. Then, a grid-based method and a particle filter based method, both tailored to the observed RSS from the dynamic object and the generated time-variant radio maps, are derived for the case where both the UAVs and the object are dynamic. Simulations validate the two proposed algorithms and show that time-variant radio maps can significantly improve tracking precision and efficiency compared to other benchmarks for both the mountainous area and the urban area with highly complex layouts. In addition, the particle filter based method can reduce the computational complexity via Monte Carlo sampling of the time-variant radio maps with little sacrifice in tracking precision.}

	abstract = {Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) or massive access is a critical scenario in the fifth generation (5G) and the future cellular network. With the surging density of devices from millions to billions, unique pilot allocation becomes inapplicable in the user ID-incorporated grant-free random access protocol. Unsourced random access (URA) manifests itself by focusing only on unwrapping the received signals via a common codebook. In this paper, we propose a URA protocol for a massive access cellular system with multi-user single input multiple output (MIMO). The proposed scheme encompasses a codebook enabling construction of sparse transmission frame, a receiver equipped with dictionary learning and error-correcting codes and a collision resolution strategy for the collided codeword. Discrepant to the existing schemes with necessary overhead for preamble signals, no overhead or pre-defined pilot sequences are needed in the proposed scheme, which is favorable for energy-efficient transmission and latency reduction. Numerical results verify the viability of the proposed scheme in practical massive access scenario.}

Three efficient operating protocols for the S-IOS, namely time switching, power splitting, and mode switching, are proposed to enable the dual-functionality of energy harvesting and information transmission. For each protocol, we design a joint optimization framework of transmit beamforming at the AP, refraction/reflection beamforming at the S-IOS, and energy harvesting schedule at the S-IOS, to maximize the network sum rate. Despite the challenging non-convex optimization problems with highly coupled and/or integer optimization variables, we develop computationally-efficient algorithms to solve them in an iterative manner, which exploit the intrinsic structure of the problems and employ the penalty-based method and the successive convex approximation. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of our developed optimization algorithms, demonstrate the significant importance of the S-IOS for spectral and energy efficient wireless communications, and quantify the performance advantage of the proposed designs over the baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Intermittent connectivity of clients to the parameter server (PS) is a major bottleneck in federated edge learning frameworks. The lack of constant connectivity induces a large generalization gap, especially when the local data distribution amongst clients exhibits heterogeneity. To overcome intermittent communication outages between clients and the central PS, we introduce the concept of collaborative relaying wherein the participating clients relay their neighbors’ local updates to the PS in order to boost the participation of clients with poor connectivity to the PS. We propose a semi-decentralized federated learning framework in which at every communication round, each client initially computes a local averaging of a subset of its neighboring clients’ updates, and eventually transmits to the PS a weighted average of its own update and those of its neighbors’. We appropriately optimize these local averaging weights to ensure that the global update at the PS is unbiased with minimal variance – consequently improving the convergence rate. Numerical evaluations on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our collaborative relaying approach outperforms federated averaging-based benchmarks for learning over intermittently-connected networks such as when the clients communicate over millimeter wave channels with intermittent blockages.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of 5G networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to fulfill the stringent requirements for reliability-aware services in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, in such networks, the wireless channel states and the task arrivals are stochastic and hard to predict well. Under this scenario, tasks generated from mobile devices would pile up in the transmission queue and edge computing queue when offloading to the edge cloud via a 5G network, resulting in quality degradation for reliability-aware services. To tackle the above challenges, we introduce non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in MEC to meet the requirements of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), in which task queuing delay violation probability and transmission error probability are both considered. Furthermore, we explore the closed-form expression based on the effective capacity (EC) to derive the performance boundary of service reliability under a general model that multiple data sources are from different IoT devices and tasks are offloaded through two-stage transmission-computing tandem queues. Based on the above mathematical analysis for service reliability, we propose an efficient strategy combining power allocation and task offloading to reduce energy consumption for all devices in NOMA-enabled MEC. Extensive simulation studies are further conducted to validate the advantage of our strategy and show the significant performance gain of nearly up to 20% over other alternatives.}

However, existing works only consider path loss and cannot obtain sound HO parameters. In this paper, the HO events trigger locations are explicitly modeled as time-varying boundaries, where the UAV altitude and LoS/NLoS components are projected to geometric boundaries satisfying the conditions of HO events, and the fluctuation of boundaries is introduced by modeling their radii as random variables with fast fading coefficients. Based on specific received signal ratios of HO events, the distributions of HO event boundaries are derived via the projection criterion. Specifically, the HO trigger location is analyzed through the HO boundary considering the measurement period, then HO status during Time-to-Trigger is analyzed via HO event boundaries and user-UAV geometric relationship. Expressions of HO events in UAV-assisted networks, including HO, HOF, and ping-pong (PP), are obtained with and without fast fading. The results show more HOs, HOFs, and PPs occur with fast fading, which increase by 1.7\\times , 1.4\\times , and 3.1\\times when densities of the MBS and UAV are 10/\\rm {km^{2}} and 100/\\rm {km^{2}} .}

	abstract = {Accurately detecting symbols transmitted over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels is crucial in realizing the benefits of MIMO techniques. However, optimal MIMO detection is associated with a complexity that grows exponentially with the MIMO dimensions and quickly becomes impractical. Recently, stochastic sampling-based Bayesian inference techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have been combined with the gradient descent (GD) method to provide a promising framework for MIMO detection. In this work, we propose to efficiently approach optimal detection by exploring the discrete search space via MCMC random walk accelerated by Nesterov’s gradient method. Nesterov’s GD guides MCMC to make efficient searches without the computationally expensive matrix inversion and line search. Our proposed method operates using multiple GDs per random walk, achieving sufficient descent towards important regions of the search space before adding random perturbations, guaranteeing high sampling efficiency. To provide augmented exploration, extra samples are derived through the trajectory of Nesterov’s GD by simple operations, effectively supplementing the sample list for statistical inference and boosting the overall MIMO detection performance. Furthermore, we design an early stopping tactic to terminate unnecessary further searches, remarkably reducing the complexity. Simulation results and complexity analysis reveal that the proposed method achieves exceptional performance in both uncoded and coded MIMO systems, adapts to realistic channel models, and scales well to large MIMO dimensions.}

To tackle these challenges, this work proposes an adaptive model pruning-based FL (AMP-FL) framework, where the edge server dynamically generates sub-models by pruning the global model for devices’ local training to adapt their heterogeneous computation capabilities and time-varying channel conditions. Since the involvement of diverse structures of devices’ sub-models in the global model updating may negatively affect the training convergence, we propose compensating for the gradients of pruned model regions by devices’ historical gradients. We then introduce an age of information (AoI) metric to characterize the staleness of local gradients and theoretically analyze the convergence behaviour of AMP-FL. The convergence bound suggests scheduling devices with large AoI of gradients and pruning the model regions with small AoI for devices to improve the learning performance. Inspired by this, we define a new objective function, i.e., the average AoI of local gradients, to transform the inexplicit global loss minimization problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, model pruning, and resource block (RB) allocation design. Through detailed analysis, we derive the optimal model pruning strategy and transform the RB allocation problem into equivalent linear programming that can be effectively solved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches. The proposed AMP-FL is capable of achieving 1.9x and 1.6x speed up for FL on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in comparison with the FL schemes with homogeneous model settings.}

	abstract = {To reduce multiuser interference and maximize the spectrum efficiency in orthogonal frequency division duplexing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) estimated at the user equipment (UE) is required at the base station (BS). This paper presents a novel method for massive MIMO CSI feedback via a one-sided one-for-all deep learning framework. The CSI is compressed via linear projections at the UE, and is recovered at the BS using deep learning (DL) with plug-and-play priors (PPP). Instead of using handcrafted regularizers for the wireless channel responses, the proposed approach, namely CSI-PPPNet, exploits a DL based denoisor in place of the proximal operator of the prior in an alternating optimization scheme. In this way, a DL model trained once for denoising can be repurposed for CSI recovery tasks with arbitrary compression ratio. The one-sided one-for-all framework reduces model storage space, relieves the burden of joint model training and model delivery, and could be applied at UEs with limited device memories and computation power. Extensive experiments over the open indoor and urban macro scenarios show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a novel modulation scheme to handle the high Doppler effect under time-varying channels. In this paper, in order to improve channel estimation accuracy and to reduce pilot overhead, two types of two-dimensional (2D) pilots and the corresponding matched filters are designed for multi-antenna OTFS systems. Our 2D pilots are formed using perfect arrays (such as Frank array, Chu array, etc) or perfect-sequence based Kronecker array (PKA). Different from the previous multi-antenna OTFS pilots, these 2D pilots are placed on the same area in the delay-Doppler domain, using code division multiplexing to deal with the interference between pilots of different antennas, known as pilot pollution. To improve the channel estimation performance, matched filters are also designed to better compensate the phase shift of the 2D pilot response in the delay-Doppler domain. Compared with the conventional multi-antenna OTFS schemes, the proposed scheme achieves significantly better NMSE performance, while having lower pilot overhead under multi-antenna scenarios.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the issue of resource allocation for unmanned aerial vehicle and reconfigurable intelligent surface (UAV-RIS) assisted vehicular communication systems. To adapt the high dynamics of vehicular networks, we conceive a digital twin-based system over RIS-embedded environment towards environmental-aware communications. Specifically, a digital twin system can leverage data-driven models to predict the large-scale fading of future stages, while RIS is capable of controlling the propagation environments in real time, which can be utilized to mitigate prediction errors imposed by the small-scale fading. Using the capabilities of “prediction” and “reconfiguration”, we expect to comprehensively foresee the dynamic changes in vehicular networks. In particular, the above-mentioned issue is formulated as a multi-slot total power consumption minimization problem under the quality of service (QoS) and energy constraints. Considering the finite battery energy of the UAV and the circuit power of the RIS, the transmit power of the UAV and the number of active reflecting elements (REs) are jointly scheduled for a finite time horizon. To tackle this mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, we transform the original model into a discrete-time dynamic system. According to whether the dynamics of radio environments are predictable or not, the optimal offline and online policies are derived by using the deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming algorithms, respectively. To reduce the computation complexity, we further propose a novel online policy based on the idea of double-strategy selection. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed online policy exhibits near-optimal performances and outperforms other benchmarks in terms of transmission failure probability and effective power consumption.}

	abstract = {Sensing is envisioned as a key network function of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered sensing fuses features of multiple sensing views from devices distributed in edge networks for the edge server to perform accurate inference. This process, known as multi-view pooling, creates a communication bottleneck due to multi-access by many devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose a task-oriented simultaneous access scheme for distributed sensing called Over-the-Air Pooling (AirPooling). The existing Over-the-Air Computing (AirComp) technique can be directly applied to enable Average-AirPooling, which exploits the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel to implement fast over-the-air averaging of pooled features. However, despite being most popular in practice, the over-the-air maximization, called Max-AirPooling, is not AirComp realizable given the fact that AirComp addresses only a limited subset of functions. We tackle the challenge by proposing the novel generalized AirPooling framework that can be configured to support both Max- and Average-AirPooling by controlling a configuration parameter and extended to even other pooling functions. The former is realized by adding to AirComp the designed pre-processing at devices and post-processing at the server. To characterize the End-to-End (E2E) sensing performance in object recognition, the theory of classification margin is applied to relate the classification accuracy and the AirPooling error, which allows the latter to be a tractable surrogate of the former. Furthermore, the analysis reveals an inherent tradeoff of Max-AirPooling between the accuracy of the pooling-function approximation and the effectiveness of noise suppression. Using the tradeoff, we make an attempt to optimize the configuration parameter of Max-AirPooling, yielding a sub-optimal closed-form method of adaptive parametric control. Experimental results obtained on real-world datasets show that AirPooling provides sensing accuracies close to those achievable by the traditional digital air interface but dramatically reduces the communication latency, by up to an order of magnitude.}

For a disk-shaped continuous LIS and a terminal located on the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the LIS, we obtain expressions for the CRLBs in the form of a single integration. For the situation that the terminal is far from the LIS compared to the LIS radius and the situation with an asymptotically large LIS, closed-form approximations of the CRLBs are derived, based on which scalings and properties of the positioning precision with respect to different system parameters are obtained. For positioning a terminal with arbitrary location, we derive closed-form expressions of the CRLBs when the terminal is far from the LIS and the wavelength is small. When the surface area is small and the path-loss exponent is not larger than 5, the CRLBs of a CPL-terminal are smaller than those of a non-CPL terminal for all three dimensions, while the reverse may occur when the surface area grows large enough. We also carry out a comparative study of the continuous and discrete models of the LIS. Numerical results are presented to validate the precision of our theoretical analysis and approximated performance.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is considered as a key technology for future 6G communications. To realize effective precoding, channel estimation schemes are essential to acquire precise channel state information (CSI), while most existing schemes work relying on the spatial stationary assumption. However, in XL-MIMO systems, the spatial non-stationary effect naturally exists. Such an effect can hardly be recognized by most existing channel estimation schemes, leading to a severe accuracy loss of channel estimation. In order to deal with this problem, we study the spatial non-stationary channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems in this paper. Specifically, the spatial non-stationary channel in an XL-MIMO system is converted to a series of spatial stationary channels by a proposed group time block code (GTBC) based signal extraction scheme. The key idea is to artificially create the time-domain relevance of non-stationary effect, which brings XL-MIMO the ability to recognize such effect in the space domain. Based on the extracted signals, an on-grid GTBC-based polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (GP-SOMP) algorithm and an off-grid GTBC-based polar-domain simultaneous iterative gridless weighted (GP-SIGW) algorithm are proposed to effectively estimate the non-stationary channel. Then, analyses of the time complexity and performances of the above two algorithms are carried out and the Cramér-Rao lower bound is derived. Finally, numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithms can recognize the spatial non-stationary effect and realize a much more accurate channel estimation than existing schemes.}

We propose a strategy in which the user transmits pilots sequentially and the BS adaptively adjusts the sensing vectors, including the BS beamforming vector and multiple RIS reflection coefficients based on the observations already made, to eventually produce an estimated user position. This is a challenging active sensing problem for which finding an optimal solution involves searching through a complicated functional space whose dimension increases with the number of measurements. We show that the long short-term memory (LSTM) network can be used to exploit the latent temporal correlation between measurements to automatically construct scalable state vectors. Subsequently, the state vector is mapped to the sensing vectors for the next time frame via a deep neural network (DNN). A final DNN is used to map the state vector to the estimated user position. Numerical result illustrates the advantage of the active sensing design as compared to non-active sensing methods. The proposed solution produces interpretable results and is generalizable in the number of sensing stages. Remarkably, we show that a network with one BS and multiple RISs can outperform a comparable setting with multiple BSs.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial base stations (ABSs) to provide wireless connectivity for ground users (GUs) in various emergency scenarios. However, it is a NP-hard problem with exponential complexity in M\nand N\n, in order to maximize the coverage rate of M\nGUs by jointly placing N\nABSs with limited coverage range. The problem is further complicated when the coverage range becomes irregular due to site-specific blockages (e.g., buildings) on the air-ground channel, and/or when the GUs are moving. To address the above challenges, we study a multi-ABS movement optimization problem to maximize the average coverage rate of mobile GUs in a site-specific environment. The Spatial Deep Learning with Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (SDL-ME) algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenging problem by 1) partitioning the complicated ABS movement problem into ABS placement sub-problems each spanning finite time horizon; 2) using an encoder-decoder deep neural network (DNN) as the emulator to capture the spatial correlation of ABSs/GUs and thereby reducing the cost of interaction with the actual environment; 3) employing the emulator to speed up a quality-diversity search for the optimal placement solution; and 4) proposing a planning-exploration-serving scheme for multi-ABS movement coordination. In particular, the locations of ABSs/GUs are converted into grid pattern representations, whose dimension and associated DNN complexity are invariant with arbitrarily large M\nand/or N\n. Moreover, the virtual emulator-planning combined with the actual site-deployment effectively compensates for the prediction errors due to model approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the benchmark Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method and other two baselines in terms of average coverage rate, training time and/or sample efficiency. Moreover, with one-time training, our proposed method can be applied in scenarios where the number of ABSs/GUs dynamically changes on site and/or with different/varying GU speeds, which is thus more robust and flexible compared with conventional DRL-based methods.}

	abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices, federated learning (FL) has been widely considered for application in wireless networks for distributed model training. However, data heterogeneity, e.g., non-independently identically distributions and different sizes of training datasets among clients, poses major challenges to wireless FL. Limited communication resources complicate the implementation of fair scheduling which is required for training on heterogeneous data, and further deteriorate the overall performance. To address this issue, this paper focuses on performance analysis and optimization for wireless FL, considering data heterogeneity, combined with wireless resource allocation. Specifically, we first develop a closed-form expression for an upper bound on the FL loss function, with a particular emphasis on data heterogeneity described by a dataset size vector and a data divergence vector. Then we formulate the loss function minimization problem, under constraints on long-term energy consumption and latency, and jointly optimize client scheduling, uplink transmission power, channel allocation and the number of local epochs. Next, via the Lyapunov drift technique, we transform the optimization problem into a series of tractable problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other benchmarks in terms of the learning accuracy and energy consumption.}

Due to the property of GenSM, extrinsic bit log-likelihood ratio associated with each bit of the transmit antenna combination index and transmit symbol vector needs to be computed. By extending our sorting assisted successive sphere decoding algorithm (SA-SSDA) for the hard-output detection of GenSM signals, we study two-stage detection schemes here to conduct multiple single tree search sphere decoding algorithms (STS-SDAs) for the second stage computation, where the order of the multiple STS-SDAs is determined in the first stage computation. Unlike previous two-stage detectors, our emphasis is on studying the ordering metrics for determining the order of STS-SDAs and is on giving suggestions about the scenarios to use adequate ordering metrics for the purpose of complexity reduction. Accordingly, incorporating the tricks used by the SA-SSDA and STS-SDA, we arrive at a fast SA-SSTS-SDA for exactly max-log-MAP detection of GenSM signals. Our proposed detector is feasible for hardware implementation and may motivate future research on the SISO detection of coded GenSM signals.}

Due to the limited computation resources on ISAC devices and the latency as well as the reliability requirements, we propose a paradigm of mobile edge computing (MEC) aided ISAC with short-packet transmissions, where multiple ISAC devices adopt short-packet transmissions to offload their sensed radar data to an edge-server for analysis. We adopt the mutual information to measure the performance of radar sensing and quantify the reliability and latency performances for analyzing the radar-data via edge computing. We formulate an energy minimization problem that jointly optimizes the size of each short packet, the duration of each short packet, the computing-capacity allocations of edge-server, the beamforming of the radar sensing and the offloading transmission, while providing guaranteed performances for the radar sensing, the latency for radar-data analysis, and the reliability of offloading transmission. We identify the hierarchical structure of the formulated problem and divide the problem into three subproblems. For both the bottom-layer problem optimizing the computing-capacity allocations of the edge-server and the middle-layer problem optimizing the size of each short packet and the duration of each short packet, we derive their solutions analytically. Finally, for the top-layer problem optimizing the beamforming of the radar sensing and the offloading transmission, we transform it into a difference of convex (DC) problem which can be efficiently solved. We show the performance advantages of our proposed scheme. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can outperform the benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Deep mutual learning (DML) is one of the most high-profile technologies emerging in the field of machine learning during the past few years. DML has the potential of exchanging knowledge on the premise of ensuring data privacy, while retaining the characteristics of local models. In this paper, we design a novel system named as decentralized mutual learning over unlicensed spectrum (DML-U), which allows neighbor mobile devices to learn from each other via bidirectional device-to-device links over unlicensed spectrum (D2D-U). On this basis, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem for the one-to-one pairing scenario with the goal of minimizing the average communication energy cost for sharing knowledge. We further propose a two-layer iterative algorithm that includes the outer layer based on the enumeration method and the inner layer based on the sum-of-ratios optimization, aiming to find the optimal pairing scheme between devices and obtain the global optimal communication resource allocation scheme, respectively. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving the DML performance.}

The inconsistency of uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channels makes channel modeling in this scenario challenging. In this paper, a novel geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed for non-reciprocal terahertz (THz) channels. A directional effective scatterer generation algorithm is designed to depict the inconsistency of bidirectional propagation conditions. The correlation function between UL and DL is derived and analyzed, which validates the ability to characterize the non-reciprocal channels. To mimic THz propagation features, molecular absorption and diffuse scattering are introduced to the model, which is verified by measured data. In addition, the non-stationarities in space, time, and frequency domains are characterized, respectively. Statistical properties are compared between analytical and simulation results, and good agreements are shown. Finally, the accuracy of the model is verified by comparing with the ray tracing data.}

	abstract = {Short-packet communication (SPC) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to play crucial roles in the development of 5G-and-beyond wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a secure SPC system, where a UAV serves as a mobile decode-and-forward (DF) relay, periodically receiving and relaying small data packets from a remote IoT device to its receiver in two hops with strict latency requirements, in the presence of an eavesdropper. This system requires careful optimization of important design parameters, such as the coding blocklengths of both hops, transmit powers, and the UAV’s trajectory. While the overall optimization problem is nonconvex, we tackle it by applying a block successive convex approximation (BSCA) approach to divide the original problem into three subproblems and solve them separately. Then, an overall iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the final design with guaranteed convergence. Our proposed low-complexity algorithm incorporates robust trajectory design and resource management to optimize the effective average secrecy throughput of the communication system over the course of the UAV-relay’s mission. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to various benchmark schemes and provide useful design insights on the coding blocklengths and transmit powers along the trajectory of the UAV.}

Normally, once underwater sensors collect the data, it is transmitted to remote offices through a relay node stationed on the sea surface. In this study, our focus is on establishing and analyzing the performance of secrecy outage in an uplink hybrid radio frequency (RF)-UWOC space-ocean system that comprises a collection of underwater sensors, a relay floating on the ocean surface, a legitimate satellite receiver, and an eavesdropping satellite. In the considered system, the transmission performance from end-to-end is influenced by several factors. These include path loss, small-scale fading, position randomness of the satellites in RF links, propagation loss, turbulence-induced fading, and random location distribution of the underwater sensors in UWOC links. To enhance our understanding of system design, geometric probability theory is employed to investigate the end-to-end secrecy outage performance of the dual-hop RF-UWOC space-ocean uplink transmission while comprehensively considering the impacts of these factors. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed analysis models is verified through numerical results.}

The network contains two types of nodes, cache-equipped helper nodes (HNs) handling content-centric OMPMC, and cellular base stations (BSs) handling user-centric SPUC. The OMPMC service streams cached files across the network. Users whose demands cannot be satisfied by OMPMC, either because of poor signal quality or because the requested file is not cached at HNs, are served by SPUC; requested files are fetched from the core network and unicast to users using group-specific beamforming transmissions. We consider the overall network radio resource consumption to satisfy the users’ requests for a given outage probability. This yields a parametric constrained optimization problem over the cache and resource allocations of the OMPMC component, as well as the multi-user beamforming scheme of the SPUC component. We devise a surface-following approach on the basis of path-following method to find the optimal traffic streaming solution. Simulation results show that the hybrid scheme provides a more promising trade-off between resource consumption and service outage probability, compared to OMPMC-only and SPUC-only alternatives.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle positioning method for commodity multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) WIFI systems in indoor parking lots. To address the limitation of the small number of WIFI antennas, the proposed method first utilizes signal model rearrangement techniques, in which the abundant carrier frequency resources of WIFI are expanded into space resources. Then a rearranged off-grid sparse Bayesian learning (ROG-SBL) algorithm is developed for parameters estimation to achieve vehicle positioning. Specifically, by resorting to the Bayesian inference and Newton method, the position-related parameters are estimated iteratively by fitting the channel state information (CSI) measurement model, and thus the vehicle positioning is realized according to the geometric relationship. Moreover, we derive the CraméRao bound (CRB) as a performance reference for the proposed algorithm. Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed one improves the positioning performance of the vehicle with fewer carrier numbers and has more stable performance. Simulation results show that the performance curves of the proposed algorithm for parameters estimation are close to the corresponding CRBs, and the proposed algorithm can cope with more challenging cases when the line-of-sight (LOS) path does not exist.}

This paper introduces a distributed resource allocation method that aims to maximize energy efficiency (EE) while ensuring quality of service (QoS) for users. Specifically, to address the challenge of fast-varying wireless channel conditions, we propose a robust meta federated reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that enables local users to optimize transmit power and assign channels using locally trained neural network models. This approach offloads the computational burden from the cloud server to the local users, reducing transmission overhead associated with local channel state information. The BS performs the meta-learning procedure to initialize a general global model, enabling rapid adaptation to different environments and improved EE performance. The federated learning technique, based on decentralized reinforcement learning, promotes collaboration and mutual benefits among users. Analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MFRL framework accelerates the reinforcement learning process, decreases transmission overhead, and offloads computation, while outperforming the conventional decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm in terms of convergence speed and EE performance across various scenarios.}

On the other hand, due to the inherent data heterogeneity across wireless users, training a single model to serve all users can severely degrade individual user performance. Towards addressing this challenge, in this work we propose over-the-air clustered FL, where multiple models are trained concurrently over-the-air, and each model is adapted gradually to a group of users with similar data distributions. We introduce AirCluster, an over-the-air clustered FL framework with coordinated zero-forcing MIMO beamforming, along with a sketching-based dimensionality reduction mechanism to enable over-the-air training with limited number of antennas. Our theoretical analysis provides formal convergence guarantees for the trained models, while identifying the key performance trade-offs in terms of the convergence rate, compression ratio, channel quality, and the number of antennas. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we observe significant increase in the test accuracy for individual users over state-of-the-art FL benchmarks. Our results demonstrate over-the-air FL to be a promising approach in addressing the communication bottleneck of FL, even under severe data heterogeneity.}

The proposed centralized deployment combines the deep neural network (DNN)-based surrogate model with the zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) such that the deployment can be optimized via using the predicted network performance of the surrogate model. Since the accurate prediction of the DNN surrogate model is critical, we discuss its design and update approaches. To let UAVs update their locations for better network performance by exchanging local information with neighboring UAVs, the proposed decentralized deployment approaches combine distributed optimization frameworks with ZOO and DNN surrogate model. We conduct realistic simulations in different network scenarios with different performance metrics to evaluate our proposed approaches. Results show that our proposed can outperform all the reference schemes in all scenarios considering different performance metrics.}

	abstract = {Light fidelity (LiFi) is a potential key technology for future 6G networks. However, its feasibility of supporting mobile communications has not been fundamentally discussed. In this paper, we investigate the time-varying channel characteristics of mobile LiFi based on measured mobile phone rotation and movement data. Specifically, we define LiFi channel coherence time to evaluate the correlation of the channel timing sequence. Then, we derive the expression of LiFi transmission rate based on the m-pulse-amplitude-modulation (M-PAM). The derived rate expression indicates that mobile LiFi communications is feasible by using at least two photodiodes (PDs) with different orientations. Further, we propose two channel estimation schemes, and propose a LiFi channel tracking scheme to improve the communication performance. Finally, our experimental results show that the channel coherence time is on the order of tens of milliseconds, which indicates a relatively stable channel. In addition, based on the measured data, better communication performance can be realized in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenario with a rate of 36Mbit/s, compared to other scenarios. The results also show that the proposed channel estimation and tracking schemes are effective in designing mobile LiFi systems.}

	abstract = {Internet of meta-material things (meta-IoT) is a network of sensors composed of meta-materials with the advantages of low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and robust, showing great potential for the coming 6G communications. However, existing meta-IoT systems assume specular reflection on meta-IoT sensors, which limits their applications. For example, in chemical factories with harsh environments, receivers are often deployed on mobile robots. Due to their mobility, when measuring the signals, it is infeasible to ensure that the receivers are located at a certain angle relative to the meta-IoT sensors. Therefore, it is necessary to broaden the angle range of reflected signal coverage. In this paper, we propose a meta-IoT system capable of supporting receivers deployed at arbitrary angles in a broadened angle range. To be specific, we first propose an inhomogeneous structural design for meta-IoT sensors to achieve reflection coverage broadening. Then, we establish the signal transmission model from the transmitter to the receiver, going through the proposed meta-IoT sensor. To maximize the reflection coverage while ensuring accurate sensing results, we formulate a joint meta-IoT structure and sensing function optimization problem and propose efficient algorithms to solve it. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the design method for the proposed meta-IoT system to achieve reflection coverage broadening.}

The multi-satellite cooperation has great potential in extending communication coverage and increasing spectral efficiency. Considering that the on- board radio-frequency circuit resources and computation resources on each satellite are restricted, we aim to propose a low-complexity yet efficient multi-satellite cooperative transmission framework. Specifically, we first propose a hybrid beamforming method consisting of analog beamforming for beam alignment and digital beamforming for interference mitigation. Then, to establish appropriate connections between the satellites and GUs, we propose a heuristic user scheduling algorithm which determines the connections according to the total spectral efficiency increment of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Next, considering the intrinsic connection between beamforming and user scheduling, a joint hybrid beamforming and user scheduling (JHU) scheme is proposed to dramatically improve the performance of the multi-satellite cooperative network. In addition to the single-connection scenario, we also consider the multi-connection case using the JHU scheme. Extensive simulations conducted over different LEO satellite constellations and across various GU locations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes in both overall and per-user spectral efficiencies.}

	abstract = {The Holographic Interference Surface (HIS) provides a new paradigm for building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture. In this paper, we derive the principles of holographic interference theory for electromagnetic wave reception and transmission, whereby the optical holography is extended to communication holography and a channel sensing architecture for holographic interference surfaces is established. Unlike the traditional pilot-based channel estimation approaches, the proposed architecture circumvents complicated processes like filtering, analog to digital conversion (ADC), down conversion. Instead, it relies on interfering the object waves with a pre-designed reference wave, and therefore reduces the hardware complexity and requires less time-frequency resources for channel estimation. To address the self-interference problem in the holographic recording process, we propose a phase shifting-based interference suppression (PSIS) method according to the structural characteristics of communication hologram and interference composition. We then propose a Prony-based multi-user channel segmentation (PMCS) algorithm to acquire the channel state information (CSI). Our theoretical analysis shows that the estimation error of the PMCS algorithm converges to zero when the number of HIS units is large enough. Simulation results show that under the holographic architecture, our proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the CSI in multi-user scenarios.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a hybrid multiple access (MA) protocol for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided uplink transmission network by incorporating the IRS-aided time-division MA (I-TDMA) protocol and the IRS-aided non-orthogonal MA (I-NOMA) protocol as special cases. Two typical communication scenarios, namely the transmit power limited case and the transmit energy limited case are considered, where the device’s rearranged order, time and power allocation, as well as dynamic IRS beamforming patterns over time are jointly optimized to minimize the sum transmission delay. To shed light on the superiority of the proposed IRS-aided hybrid MA (I-HMA) protocol over conventional protocols, the conditions under which I-HMA outperforms I-TDMA and I-NOMA are revealed by characterizing their corresponding optimal solution. Then, a computationally efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the high-quality solution to the corresponding optimization problems. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design, and draw some useful insights. Specifically, it is found that the proposed protocol can significantly reduce the sum transmission delay by combining the additional gain of dynamic IRS beamforming with the high spectral efficiency of NOMA, which thus reveals that integrating IRS into the proposed HMA protocol is an effective solution for delay-aware optimization. Furthermore, it reveals that the proposed design reduces the time consumption not only from the system-centric view, but also from the device-centric view.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) play a vital role in future wireless systems with the capability of enhancing propagation environments by intelligently reflecting the signals toward the target receivers. However, optimal tuning of the phase shifters at the RIS is challenging due to the passive nature of reflective elements and the high complexity of acquiring channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, the joint active beamforming and RIS reflection beam design is a tedious task due to the high computational complexity and the dynamic nature of the wireless environment. Today’s cellular networks establish data transmission by relying on pre-defined generic beamforming codebooks, which are neither site-specific nor adaptive to the changes in the wireless environment. Moreover, identifying the best beam is typically performed using an exhaustive search approach that prohibits the use of large codebook sizes due to the resulting high beam training overhead. Depending merely on the binary received signal strength, this work develops a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) framework that jointly designs the active and the passive reflection beam codebooks for the BS and the RIS, reflectively. To accelerate learning convergence and reduce the search space, the proposed model divides the RIS into multiple partitions and associates beam patterns to the surrounding environments with low computational complexity. Moreover, a hierarchical beam training solution is proposed to further reduce the beam training overhead of the single-beam training approach. Simulation results show that the proposed MA-DRL approach can provide a 97% beam training overhead reduction over the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook.}

	abstract = {Hybrid beamforming has attracted considerable interest in the development of next-generation wireless communications operating in the terahertz (THz) band. The short wavelength of THz wave has enabled thousands of antennas to be tightly packed inside a small area to provide sharp and accurate beamforming. Unfortunately, the beam squint effect, which changes the direction of beams as the frequency shifts, can only be circumvented by introducing true-time-delay (TTD) lines in the hybrid beamformers. However, most previous works neglected the resolution limitation of the precoding hardware and assumed phase shifters (PSs) and TTDs with infinite resolution. This paper proposes two quantized hybrid beamforming algorithms for the PS-only hybrid architecture and the TTD-assisted hybrid beamformer. We use a gradient descent approach with differentiable soft quantization techniques to overcome quantizer discontinuity. The RF precoder and the baseband precoder are alternately updated to maximize the similarity with the optimal precoder. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The proposed 3-bit PS-only beamformer can achieve near-optimal performance and outperform other low-resolution precoding methods in a moderate squint scenario. The proposed low-resolution TTD-assisted architecture can effectively compensate severe squint effect and achieves near-optimal performance.}

However, insufficient training signal data in complicated channel environments and large-scale DL models are critical factors that make DL methods difficult to deploy in practice. Aiming to these problems, we propose a novel neural network named convolution-linked signal transformer (ClST) and a novel knowledge distillation method named signal knowledge distillation (SKD). The ClST is accomplished through three primary modifications: a hierarchy of transformer containing convolution, a novel attention mechanism named parallel spatial-channel attention (PSCA) mechanism and a novel convolutional transformer block named convolution-transformer projection (CTP) to leverage a convolutional projection. The SKD is a knowledge distillation method to effectively reduce the parameters and complexity of neural networks. We train two lightweight neural networks using the SKD algorithm, KD-CNN and KD-MobileNet, to meet the demand that neural networks can be used on miniaturized devices. The simulation results demonstrate that the ClST outperforms advanced neural networks on all datasets. Moreover, both KD-CNN and KD-MobileNet obtain higher recognition accuracy with less network complexity, which is very beneficial for the deployment of AMR on miniaturized communication devices.}

This paper proposes a novel air-to-ground communication model consisting of aerial base stations served by UAVs and terrestrial user equipments (UEs) by integrating the technique of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission with the theory of stochastic geometry. In particular, a CoMP set consisting of multiple UAVs is developed based on the theory of Poisson-Delaunay tetrahedralization. Effective UAV formation control and UAV swarm tracking schemes for two typical scenarios, including static and mobile UEs, are also developed using the multi-agent system theory to ensure that collaborative UAVs can efficiently reach target spatial positions for mission execution. Thanks to the ease of mathematical tractability, this model provides explicit performance expressions for a typical UE’s coverage probability and achievable ergodic rate. Extensive simulation and numerical results corroborate that the proposed scheme outperforms UAV communications without CoMP transmission and obtains similar performance to the conventional CoMP scheme while avoiding search overhead.}

An xURLLC-enabled massive MU-MIMO system model has been developed to accommodate xURLLC features. By leveraging and promoting SNC, we provide a quantitative statistical quality of service (QoS) provisioning analysis and derive the closed-form expression of upper-bounded statistical delay violation probability (UB-SDVP). Based on the proposed theoretical framework, we formulate the UB-SDVP minimization problem, which is first degenerated into a one-dimensional integer-search problem by deriving the minimum error probability (EP) detector, and then efficiently solved by the integer-form Golden-Section search algorithm. Moreover, two novel concepts, EP-based effective capacity (EP-EC) and EP-based energy efficiency (EP-EE), have been defined to characterize the tail distributions and performance tradeoffs for xURLLC. Subsequently, we formulate the EP-EC and EP-EE maximization problems, and the EP-EC maximization problem is proven to be equivalent to the UB-SDVP minimization problem, while the EP-EE maximization problem is solved with a low-complexity outer-descent inner-search collaborative algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce computational complexity compared to reference schemes and provide various tradeoffs and optimization performance of xURLLC concerning UB-SDVP, EP, EP-EC, and EP-EE.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has drawn extensive attentions as a promising alternative for classical phased-array antennas at the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitter, leading to cost-effective data transmission that is especially desirable at terahertz (THz) frequencies. In this article, we consider a multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) system equipped with a RIS-assisted transmitter: A RIS array is illuminated by unmodulated THz carriers through a feeding antenna, which is equally divided into a number of subarrays (SAs). Each activated SA serves one unique user equipment (UE) via directional beams. Then we develop a spectrum- and energy- efficient MU-MIMO scheme for THz communications by performing index modulation (IM) on the array-of-SA structure of the RIS, abbreviated as RIS-SA-IM. Specifically, the indices of the RIS-SAs allocated to different UEs, defined as SA allocation pattern (SAPs), are flexibly controlled by the information bits at each symbol period. Hence, aside from classical amplitude/phase modulation, additional energy-free bits (referred to as index bits) can be conveyed implicitly by the chosen SAP at the transmitter, thus attaining superior enhancement on spectrum- and energy- efficiencies. Furthermore, we design a distributed mapping rule between the SAPs and index bits, which guarantees that the index information for each UE is exclusively determined by the index of its allocated RIS-SA. Hence, the proposed mapping rule can enable localized demodulation of the index bits without inter-UE data exchange. In particular, a general form of the distributed mapping rule is provided based on the binary-tree structure, which can be extended to arbitrary number of UEs and index bits. Additionally, the error performance of the proposed RIS-SA-IM is evaluated through pairwise error probability (PEP) calculations. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RIS-SA-IM over its classical non-IM-aided counterpart.}

	abstract = {To fully exploit the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), the controllable channel state information (CSI) should be accurate for its future applications. Unfortunately, in vehicular communications, obtaining exact instantaneous CSI presents substantial challenges. Moreover, even with an instantaneous CSI acquisition, a processing latency for RIS phase shift adaption might occur before the vehicular system reacts to the instantaneous CSI information. To effectively introduce RIS into Internet of vehicle (IoV) networks, we employ a more realistic statistical CSI approach in designing RIS-assisted vehicular communication systems that are robust to the general characteristics of the channel, rather than its instantaneous fluctuations. We present a practical system framework, where a roadside unit employs an RIS to facilitate indirect wireless communications for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Particularly, the direct links between vehicles are susceptible to blockages caused by surrounding obstacles/vehicles. The deployment of RIS is to establish supplementary communication links between a multi-antenna vehicle source (VS) and multiple vehicular users (VUs) as they traverse areas with a poor service coverage. With the objective to maximize the time-averaged sum-rate of VUs, instead of instantaneous CSI, we rely on the delayed statistical CSI feedback to design active beamforming at the VS and passive beamforming at RIS. Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm, named JAPBNB, which leverages the fractional programming technique to find a stationary solution for the formulated sum-of-logarithms-of-ratio problem. Specifically, a non-convex block coordinate descent (BCD) approach, collaborating with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), is applied for the joint optimization of active and passive beamforming. Finally, the complexity and convergence of the proposed JAPBNB algorithm are thoroughly discussed and validated. Simulation results demonstrate that the time-averaged sum-rate obtained by the proposed JAPBNB algorithm approaches that obtained by the instantaneous CSI scheme, when the delayed statistical CSI feedback interval is adequately small.}

Estimating the Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) of a source oriented toward Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation is an intriguing topic in an IRS-aided wireless communication scenario. However, the existing optimization-based approaches are overly complex to be practically implemented. In this paper, we propose a polarized IRS architecture, in which both IRS and BS are equipped with arbitrarily placed Electromagnetic Vector Sensor (EMVS) arrays. A Normalized Vector-Cross Product (NVCP) estimator is developed for DOA estimation, which avoids the need for complicated data recovery or exhaustive grid search. The proposed framework enables Two-Dimensional (2D) DOA estimation for NLOS signals without requiring prior knowledge of the BS-IRS channel.

The uplink effective composite channels are estimated via linear minimum mean square error technique. The channel covariance matrices are adopted to optimize the RIS phase-shifts to maximize the average sum power gains of the composite channels pertaining to all users, while minimizing the inter-cell interference. The proposed transmit power control algorithm maximizes the minimum user rate across all cells to achieve a common rate, while ensuring user-fairness by negating near-far effects. The performance of these techniques is evaluated by deriving the achievable user rates in closed-form by presenting two lemmas and two corollaries. These new results can be useful in accurate performance analysis of RIS-aided massive MIMO without invoking typical approximations based on the central limit theorem and moment matching with Gamma distribution. The achievable user rate analysis can also be used to evaluate the impact of spatially correlated fading, erroneously estimated CSI, intra-cell co-channel interference, pilot contamination, and statistical CSI-based user signal decoding. The pilot overhead and computational complexity of the proposed techniques are quantified. Thereby, we reveal that the proposed phase-shift optimization technique is both computationally efficient and scalable with large numbers of reflective elements and BS antennas.

	abstract = {Condensed channel parameters, such as Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread and angular spread, are essential ways of representing results from the measurement of wireless propagation channels. However, real-world measurements are invariably affected by noise, which is not inherently reduced by the Fourier processing - in contrast to high-resolution parameter estimation. Even when the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively high, e.g., 20 dB, the impact of the noise on the condensed parameters can be significant and lead to erroneous estimates. This can be explained, e.g., for the computation of the RMS delay spread, where long delays (which often carry noise only) are “up-weighted” by the square of the delay. While techniques like noise thresholding are often applied, the reasons for choosing thresholds are usually not described in detail. This paper systematically analyzes noise thresholding for joint delay-angle measurements and derives equations for the impact of thresholds on the computation of delay and angle RMS spreads and window parameters under various measurement circumstances. The paper provides results based on closed-form equations, as well as MonteCarlo (MC) simulations, and application to real-world measurements in the sub-THz band.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses cooperative link scheduling problems for base station (BS) aided device-to-device (D2D) communications using limited channel state information (CSI) at BS. We first derive the analytical form of ergodic sum-spectral efficiency as a function of network parameters, assuming statistical CSI at the BS. However, the optimal link scheduling, which maximizes the ergodic sum-spectral efficiency, becomes computationally infeasible when network density increases. To overcome this challenge, we present a low-complexity link scheduling algorithm that divides the D2D network into sub-networks and identifies the optimal link scheduling strategy per sub-network. Furthermore, we consider the scenario when the statistical CSI is not available to the BS. In such cases, we propose a quasi-optimal scalable link scheduling algorithm that utilizes one-bit feedback information from D2D receivers. The algorithm clusters the links and applies the UCB algorithm per cluster using the collected one-bit feedback information. We highlight that even with reduced scheduling complexity, the proposed algorithm identifies a link scheduling action that ensures optimality within a constant throughput gap. We also demonstrate through simulations that the proposed algorithm achieves higher sum-spectral efficiency than the existing link scheduling algorithms, even without explicit CSI or network parameters knowledge.}

	abstract = {MDFL systems determine presence and location of objects and users not necessarily equipped with localization devices. For localization, multipath-enhanced device-free localization (MDFL) systems exploit user-induced changes in the power of all received signal components, including both line-of-sight and multipath components (MPCs). In this work, we therefore provide a statistical fading model that describes user-induced changes in received power specifically for MPCs. The model is derived and validated empirically using an extensive set of wideband and ultra-wideband measurement data. Since the localization performance of MDFL systems strongly depends on the information about the propagation paths within the wireless network, we further propose a Bayesian calibration approach that estimates the location of the reflection points of MPCs caused by single-bounce reflections. For MPCs caused by single-bounce reflections, the solution space of possible locations of reflection points is constrained to the delay ellipse, which allows the formulation of a computationally efficient one-dimensional estimation problem. Eventually, the problem is solved by sequential Bayesian estimation. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using measurement data. Independent of the underlying measurement system, the Bayesian calibration approach is shown to robustly estimate the locations of the reflection points in different environments. Finally, the localization results of MDFL for an indoor scenario confirm the applicability of the Bayesian calibration approach.}

	abstract = {A bidirectional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, in which a pair of transceivers carry out two-way communication and mutual sensing. Both full-duplex and half-duplex operations in narrowband and wideband systems are conceived for the bidirectional ISAC. 1) For the narrowband system, the conventional full-duplex and half-duplex operations are redesigned to take into account sensing echo signals. Then, the transmit beamforming design of both transceivers is proposed for addressing the sensing and communication (S&C) tradeoff. A one-layer iterative algorithm relying on successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed to obtain Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal solutions. 2) For the wideband system, the new full-duplex and half-duplex operations are proposed for the bidirectional ISAC. In particular, the frequency-selective fading channel is tackled by delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming. By redesigning the proposed SCA-based algorithm, the KKT optimal solutions for path-based beamforming for characterizing the S&C tradeoff are obtained. Finally, the numerical results show that: i) For both bandwidth scenarios, full-duplex mode may not always be preferable to half-duplex mode due to the presence of the sensing interference; and ii) For both duplex operations, it is sufficient to reuse communication signals for sensing in the narrowband system, while an additional dedicated sensing signal is required in the wideband system.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a multi-antenna networked integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, in which a set of multi-antenna base stations (BSs) employ the coordinated transmit beamforming to serve multiple single-antenna communication users (CUs) and concurrently perform joint target detection by exploiting the echo signals. To facilitate target sensing, the BSs transmit dedicated sensing signals combined with their information signals. We consider two types of CU receivers with and without the capability of canceling the interference from the dedicated sensing signals, respectively. We also investigate two scenarios with and without time synchronization among the BSs. For the scenario with synchronization, the BSs can exploit the target-reflected signals over both the direct links (BS-to-target-to-originated-BS links) and the cross-links (BS-to-target-to-other-BSs links) for joint detection, while in the unsynchronized scenario, the BSs can only utilize the target-reflected signals over the direct links. For each scenario under different types of CU receivers, we optimize the coordinated transmit beamforming at the BSs to maximize the minimum detection probability over a particular targeted area, while guaranteeing the required minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the CUs. These SINR-constrained detection probability maximization problems are recast as non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs), which are then optimally solved via the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique. Numerical results show that for each considered scenario, the proposed ISAC design achieves enhanced target detection probability compared with various benchmark schemes. In particular, enabling time synchronization and sensing signal cancellation at the BSs is always beneficial for further improving the joint detection and communication performance.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth in demands for mobile video services, the focus of cellular networks is evolving from the core network to the edge network to facilitate resource-intensive services and mitigate backhaul burdens. However, the overlapping in coverage and the user similarity in preferences lead to substantial cache redundancy. In addition, the mobility of users poses a significant challenge to smart devices for device-to-device (D2D) communications, which affects the content richness and hit ratio of the edge cache. In this paper, an adaptive cache partitioning and placement (ACPP) strategy is proposed for mobile edge computing (MEC) networks to minimize the average cost of content access. A practical two-layer collaborative caching model is presented, which comprises 5G base station (gNB) clusters and D2D caching. Besides, a public and private cache partitioning method is designed for gNBs to improve the content richness of local cache, and a static and dynamic cache partitioning method is developed for user devices to address the varying mobility patterns. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ACPP strategy in delivering content at a lower average cost, and achieve a better hit ratio with a relatively high energy consumption at user ends.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models, with model communication replacing direct data uploading. While over-the-air model aggregation improves communication efficiency, uploading models to an edge server over wireless networks can pose privacy risks. Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used quantitative technique to measure statistical data privacy in FL. Previous research has focused on over-the-air FL with a single-antenna server, leveraging communication noise to enhance user-level DP. This approach achieves the so-called “free DP” by controlling transmit power rather than introducing additional DP-preserving mechanisms at devices, such as adding artificial noise. In this paper, we study differentially private over-the-air FL over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channel. We show that FL model communication with a multiple-antenna server amplifies privacy leakage when the multiple-antenna server employs separate receive combining for model aggregation and information inference. Consequently, relying solely on communication noise, as done in the multiple-input single-output system, cannot meet high privacy requirements, and a device-side privacy-preserving mechanism is necessary for optimal DP design. We analyze the learning convergence and privacy loss of the studied FL system and propose a transceiver design algorithm based on alternating optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better privacy-learning trade-off compared to prior work.}

	abstract = {Bilayer intelligent omni-surface (BIOS) has recently attracted increasing attention due to its capability of independent beamforming on both reflection and refraction sides. However, its specific bilayer structure makes the channel estimation problem more challenging than the conventional intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) or intelligent omni-surface (IOS). In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem in the BIOS-assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output system. We find that in contrast to the IRS or IOS, where the forms of the cascaded channels of all user equipments (UEs) are the same, in the BIOS, those of the UEs on the reflection side are different from those on the refraction side, which is referred to as the heterogeneous channel property. By exploiting it along with the two-timescale and sparsity properties of channels and applying the manifold optimization method, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme to reduce the training overhead in the BIOS-assisted system. Moreover, we investigate the joint optimization of base station digital beamforming and BIOS passive analog beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation scheme can significantly reduce the training overhead with competitive estimation quality, and thus keeps the performance advantage of BIOS over IRS and IOS with imperfect channel state information.}

In this system, a multi-antenna hybrid access point (H-AP) transmits wireless signals to communicate with a multi-antenna information decoding (ID) receiver, wirelessly charges a multi-antenna energy harvesting (EH) receiver, and performs radar target sensing based on the echo signal concurrently. Under this setup, we aim to reveal the fundamental performance tradeoff limits among sensing, communication, and powering, in terms of the estimation Cramér-Rao bound (CRB), achievable communication rate, and harvested energy, respectively. In particular, we consider two different target models for radar sensing, namely the point and extended targets, for which we are interested in estimating the target angle and the complete target response matrix, respectively. For both models, we define the achievable CRB-rate-energy (C-R-E) region and characterize its Pareto boundary by maximizing the achievable rate at the ID receiver, subject to the estimation CRB requirement for target sensing, the minimum harvested energy requirement at the EH receiver, and the maximum transmit power constraint at the H-AP. We obtain partitionable optimal transmit covariance matrix solutions to the two formulated problems by applying advanced convex optimization techniques. The numerical results demonstrate the optimal C-R-E region boundary achieved by our proposed design, as compared to the benchmark schemes based on time division and eigenmode transmission (EMT).}

We explicitly concentrate on overloaded scenarios where\nK+J>M\nand\nK≥M\n. Our goal is to maximize the minimum throughput among all the IUs by optimizing the allocation of resources (including time, transmit beamforming at the AP, and reflect beamforming at the IRS), while guaranteeing the minimum amount of harvested energy at each EU. Towards this goal, we propose two user grouping (UG) schemes, namely, the non-overlapping UG scheme and the overlapping UG scheme, where the difference lies in whether identical IUs can exist in multiple groups. Different IU groups are served in orthogonal time dimensions, while the IUs in the same group are served simultaneously with all the EUs via spatial multiplexing. The two problems corresponding to the two UG schemes are mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems and difficult to solve optimally. We first provide a method to check the feasibility of these two problems, and then propose efficient algorithms for them based on the big-M formulation, the penalty method, the block coordinate descent, and the successive convex approximation. Simulation results show that: 1) the non-robust counterparts of the proposed robust designs are unsuitable for practical IRS-aided SWIPT systems with phase errors since the energy harvesting constraints cannot be satisfied; 2) the proposed UG strategies can significantly improve the max-min throughput over the benchmark schemes without UG or adopting random UG; 3) the overlapping UG scheme performs much better than its non-overlapping counterpart when the absolute difference between\nK\nand\nM\nis small and the EH constraints are not stringent.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) hold great potential as one of the key technological enablers for beyond-5G wireless networks, improving localization and communication performance under line-of-sight (LoS) blockage conditions. However, hardware imperfections might cause RIS elements to become faulty, a problem referred to as pixel failures, which can constitute a major showstopper especially for localization. In this paper, we investigate the problem of RIS-aided localization of a user equipment (UE) under LoS blockage in the presence of RIS pixel failures, considering the challenging single-input single-output (SISO) scenario. We first explore the impact of such failures on accuracy through misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis, which reveals severe performance loss with even a small percentage of pixel failures. To remedy this issue, we develop two strategies for joint localization and failure diagnosis (JLFD) to detect failing pixels while simultaneously locating the UE with high accuracy. The first strategy relies on \\ell _{1} -regularization through exploitation of failure sparsity. The second strategy detects the failures one-by-one by solving a multiple hypothesis testing problem at each iteration, successively enhancing localization and diagnosis accuracy. Simulation results show significant performance improvements of the proposed JLFD algorithms over the conventional failure-agnostic benchmark, enabling successful recovery of failure-induced performance degradations.}

	abstract = {The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a non-central \\chi ^{2} -distributed random variable (RV) is often used when measuring the outage probability of communication systems. For ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), it is important but mathematically challenging to determine the outage threshold for an extremely small outage target. This motivates us to investigate lower bounds of the outage threshold, and it is found that the one derived from the Chernoff inequality (named Cher-LB) is the most effective lower bound. This finding is associated with three rigorously established properties of the Cher-LB with respect to the mean, variance, reliability requirement, and degrees of freedom of the non-central \\chi ^{2} -distributed RV. The Cher-LB is then employed to predict the beamforming gain in URLLC for both conventional multi-antenna systems (i.e., MIMO) under first-order Markov time-varying channel and reconfigurable intellgent surface (RIS) systems. It is exhibited that, with the proposed Cher-LB, the pessimistic prediction of the beamforming gain is made sufficiently accurate for guaranteed reliability as well as the transmit-energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {A novel unified frequency diverse array (FDA) and spatial data focusing (SDF) approach is proposed to simultaneously overcome time-variance and precision constraints of conventional FDA in geocasting, i.e., spatially confined broadcasting, scenarios. This paper describes a free space FDA-based SDF (FDA-SDF) system model for 2-dimensional range-angle-based focusing, including a generalized multi-purpose baseband approach for time-invariant FDA, complemented by SDF processing for improved spatial focusing precision and reduced array size. Comprehensive analytical derivations – general for any frequency offset configuration – describe the geographical FDA-SDF properties and design rules, such as geocast delivery zone steering, location, uniqueness, and size. Simulations of the proposed scheme validate theoretical derivations and demonstrate FDA-SDF’s superior spatial precision and minimal design complexity. In particular, using novel alternating logarithmic frequency offsets, a 3-antenna FDA-SDF setup is shown to match the radial and azimuthal precision of its beamforming-based FDA counterpart using, respectively, 64 and 24 antennas.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is emerging as a promising technique for performance enhancement for next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the physical layer security of an RIS-assisted multiple-antenna communication system in the presence of random spatially distributed eavesdroppers. The RIS-to-ground channels are assumed to experience Rician fading. Using stochastic geometry, exact distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers located according to a Poisson point process (PPP) are derived, and closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) are obtained to provide insightful guidelines for system design. First, the secrecy diversity order is obtained as \\frac {2}{\\alpha _{2}} , where \\alpha _{2} denotes the path loss exponent of the RIS-to-ground links. Then, it is revealed that the secrecy performance is mainly affected by the number of RIS reflecting elements, N, and the impact of the number of transmit antennas and transmit power at the base station is marginal. In addition, when the locations of the randomly located eavesdroppers are unknown, deploying the RIS closer to the legitimate user rather than to the base station is shown to be more efficient. Moreover, it is also found that the density of randomly located eavesdroppers, \\lambda _{e} , has an additive effect on the asymptotic ESC performance given by \\log _{2}{\\left ({{{1}/{\\lambda _{e}}}}\\right)} . Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of these theoretical observations.}

	abstract = {A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) enabled edge caching system is proposed for reducing backhaul traffic and ensuring the quality of service. A novel Caching-at-STARS structure, where a dedicated smart controller and cache memory are installed at the STARS, is proposed to satisfy user demands with fewer hops and desired channel conditions. Then, a joint caching replacement and information-centric hybrid beamforming optimization problem is formulated for minimizing the network power consumption. As long-term decision processes, the optimization problems based on independent and coupled phase-shift models of Caching-at-STARS contain both continuous and discrete decision variables, and are suitable for solving with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. For the independent phase-shift Caching-at-STARS model, we develop a frequency-aware based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (FA-TD3) algorithm that leverages user historical request information to serialize high-dimensional caching replacement decision variables. For the coupled phase-shift Caching-at-STARS model, we conceive a cooperative TD3 & deep-Q network (TD3-DQN) algorithm comprised of FA-TD3 and DQN agents to decide on continuous and discrete variables respectively by observing the network external and internal environment. The numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The Caching-at-STARS-enabled edge caching system has advantages over traditional edge caching, especially in scenarios where Zipf skewness factors or cache capacity is large; 2) Caching-at-STARS outperforms the RIS-assisted edge caching systems; 3) The proposed FA-TD3 and cooperative TD3-DQN algorithms are superior in reducing network power consumption than conventional TD3.}

	abstract = {With the recent advancements in edge artificial intelligence (AI), future sixth-generation (6G) networks need to support new AI tasks such as classification and clustering apart from data recovery. Motivated by the success of deep learning, the semantic-aware and task-oriented communications with deep joint source and channel coding (JSCC) have emerged as new paradigm shifts in 6G from the conventional data-oriented communications with separate source and channel coding (SSCC). However, most existing works focused on the deep JSCC designs for one task of data recovery or AI task execution independently, which cannot be transferred to other unintended tasks. Differently, this paper investigates the JSCC semantic communications to support multi-task services, by performing the image data recovery and classification task execution simultaneously. First, we propose a new end-to-end deep JSCC framework by unifying the coding rate reduction maximization and the mean square error (MSE) minimization in the loss function. Here, the coding rate reduction maximization facilitates the learning of discriminative features for enabling to perform classification tasks directly in the feature space, and the MSE minimization helps the learning of informative features for high-quality image data recovery. Next, to further improve the robustness against variational wireless channels, we propose a new gated deep JSCC design, in which a gated net is incorporated for adaptively pruning the output features to adjust their dimensions based on channel conditions. Finally, we present extensive numerical experiments to validate the performance of our proposed deep JSCC designs as compared to various benchmark schemes. It is shown that our proposed designs simultaneously provide efficient multi-task services, and the proposed gated deep JSCC framework efficiently reduces the communication overhead with only marginal performance loss. It is also shown that performing the classification task on the feature space via coding rate reduction maximization is able to better defend the label corruption than the traditional label-fitting methods.}

Moreover, we derive the theoretical received power distribution of a user equipment (UE) across different APs and coverage areas and then formulate an optimization problem to determine a suitable parameter for fixed clustering.

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a promising technique for the next-generation communications in high-mobility scenarios. However, in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the received signals suffer from a decrease in power due to the non-coherent superposition of all symbols transmitted through wireless channels. To address this issue, this paper proposes the incorporation of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to assist the transmission for the OTFS systems, and jointly designs the OTFS frame structure and IRS phase shifts to achieve a coherent combination of the received signals. To address the problem of outdated channel state information in high-mobility systems, we propose a location-aided channel estimation strategy at the IRS. Additionally, to mitigate the adverse effects of the fractional Doppler shifts, a delay and shifted-Doppler domain-based channel estimation method is designed at the base station. By utilizing the well-designed OTFS frame structure and IRS phase shifts, we propose a low-complexity iterative interference cancellation (IIC) detector, and analyze the lower bound for its symbol error probability. To provide a clear understanding for the process of the considered systems, we describe a two-stage transmission protocol. Finally, the numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed estimation methods and IIC detector.}

We consider the memoryless polynomial model of nonlinear PAs, which is incorporated into the symbol-level precoding (SLP) design to allow the PA nonlinearities in the constructive interference (CI) exploitation. The optimization problem that aims to enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) without investing additional transmit signal power is formulated for both PSK and QAM signaling. Since the original optimization problem is nonconvex, we first introduce auxiliary variables to transform the optimization problem and adopt the alternating optimization framework for the new optimization problem. For non-convex subproblems, additional auxiliary variables are introduced and several approximations are employed to transform the problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) form, where the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method is adopted to obtain feasible solutions. In order to reduce the computational cost of the iterative algorithm, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm for the original PA-aware SLP optimization problem. Numerical results verify the superiority of our proposed PA-aware SLP approach in the presence of nonlinear PAs in the MU-MISO downlink in terms of the error-rate performance over the state-of-the-art.}

This paper investigates the design of finite resolution phase shifters at the RIS to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of a point-to-point multiple-input single output mmWave communication system. Both the transmitting antennas at the base station and the reflecting elements on the RIS are modeled as uniform planar arrays. The optimization of the discrete RIS design remains a computationally expensive procedure, especially for large reflecting surfaces and high resolution phase shifts. As a solution, we propose in this work a low-complexity suboptimal approach that exploits the structure of mmWave propagation channels. Specifically, the developed algorithms rely on decomposing the reflecting beamforming vectors and the channel path vectors into Kronecker products of factors of uni-modulus vectors. In addition to the computational complexity advantage, the proposed solutions also promise to require only partial information of the cascaded channel rather than the full one, the estimation of which is more practically convenient due to the passive nature of the RIS. To enable the proposed reflecting beamforming designs, we propose a channel estimation technique that invokes the atomic norm minimization framework to estimate the parameters of the channel, namely, the path’s magnitudes and their associated departure and arrival angles. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed reflecting design and channel estimation scheme as compared to other existing techniques.}

In this paper, we consider a receive diversity RIS-assisted wireless communication system employing IM schemes, namely, space-shift keying (SSK) with binary modulation and spatial modulation (SM) with M -ary modulation for data transmission. The RIS lies in close proximity to the transmitter, and the transmitted data is subjected to a fading environment with a prominent line-of-sight component statistically modeled by a Rician distribution. A receiver structure based on a greedy detection rule is employed to select the receive diversity branch with the highest received signal energy for demodulation. The performance of the considered system is evaluated by obtaining a series-form expression for the probability of erroneous index detection (PED) of the considered target antenna using a characteristic function approach. In addition, closed-form and asymptotic expressions at high and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for the bit error rate (BER) of the SSK-based system, and the SM-based system employing M -ary phase-shift keying and M -ary quadrature amplitude modulation schemes are derived. The dependencies of the system performance on various parameters are corroborated via numerical results. The asymptotic expressions and results of PED and BER at high and low SNR values lead to the observation of a performance saturation and the presence of an SNR value as a point of inflection, which is attributed to the greedy detector.}

This work introduces a new two-level learning method designed to address these challenges, along with a scalable over-the-air aggregation scheme for the uplink and a bandwidth-limited broadcast scheme for the downlink that efficiently use a single wireless resource. To provide resistance against data heterogeneity, we employ gradient aggregations. Meanwhile, the impact of uplink and downlink interference is minimized through optimized receiver normalizing factors. We present a comprehensive mathematical approach to derive the convergence bound for the proposed algorithm, applicable to a multi-cluster wireless network encompassing any count of collaborating clusters, and provide special cases and design remarks. As a key step to enable a tractable analysis, we develop a spatial model for the setup by modeling devices as a Poisson cluster process over the edge servers and rigorously quantify uplink and downlink error terms due to the interference. Finally, we show that despite the interference and data heterogeneity, the proposed algorithm not only achieves high learning accuracy for a variety of parameters but also significantly outperforms the conventional hierarchical learning algorithm.}

However, in time-division duplex (TDD) fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) systems, the channel extrapolation problem also arises due to the hopping uplink pilot pattern, which has not been fully researched yet. This paper addresses this gap by formulating a channel extrapolation problem in TDD massive MIMO-OFDM systems for 5G NR, incorporating imperfection factors. A novel two-stage two-dimensional (2D) channel extrapolation scheme in frequency-time domain is proposed, designed to mitigate the effects of imperfection factors and ensure high-accuracy channel estimation. Specifically, in the channel estimation stage, we propose a novel multi-band multi-timeslot based high-resolution parameter estimation algorithm to achieve 2D channel extrapolation in the presence of imperfection factors. Then, to avoid repeated multi-timeslot channel estimation, a channel tracking stage is designed during the subsequent time instants, where a sparse Markov channel model is formulated to capture the dynamic sparsity of massive MIMO-OFDM channels under the influence of imperfection factors. Next, an expectation-maximization (EM) based compressive channel tracking algorithm is designed to estimate unknown imperfection and channel parameters by exploiting the high-resolution prior information of the delay/angle parameters from previous timeslots. Simulation results underscore the superior performance of our proposed channel extrapolation scheme over baselines.}

	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient channel estimation algorithm for multi-user reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. In this paper, the concept of low rank matrix completion (LRMC) is exploited to reduce beam training overhead for channel estimation. The proposed beam training samples part of each channel matrix in a special pattern that is suitable for LRMC with less beam training overhead. Then, the beam training is followed by multi-user channel estimation. For computationally efficient channel estimation, the proposed algorithm exploits the property that all the channel matrices share the same low-rank subspace in multi-user RIS-aided systems. The shared subspace is derived by combining candidate subspaces, which are estimated by fast alternating least squares (FALS) from partially observed channels. With the shared subspace, all the missing entries of channels are recovered via computationally efficient linear estimation. The simulations and complexity analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows a superior accuracy-complexity trade-off compared to existing works.}

	abstract = {A potential 6G technology known as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently gained much attention from academia and industry. However, acquiring the optimized quantized phase shift (QPS) presents challenges for the IRS due to the phenomenon of signaling storms. In this paper, we attempt to solve the above problem by proposing two deep learning models, the global attention phase shift compression network (GAPSCN) and the simplified GAPSCN (S-GAPSCN). In GAPSCN, we propose a novel attention mechanism that emphasizes a greater number of meaningful features than traditional attention mechanisms. Additionally, S-GAPSCN is built with an asymmetric architecture to meet the practical constraints on the computation resources of the IRS controller. Moreover, in S-GAPSCN, to compensate for the performance degradation caused by simplifying the model, we design a low-computation complexity joint attention-assisted multi-scale network (JAAMSN) module in the decoder of S-GAPSCN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed global attention mechanism achieves prominent performance compared to the existing attention mechanisms and the proposed GAPSCN can achieve reliable reconstruction performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the proposed S-GAPSCN can approach the performance of the GAPSCN at a much lower computational cost.}

	abstract = {The increasing number of connected vehicles exacerbates the scarcity of spectrum resources in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. To optimize the utilization of wireless resources, it is crucial to allocate the limited spectrum blocks to each roadside unit (RSU) based on the real-time bandwidth demand of vehicles within their coverage. However, the complex mobility patterns of vehicles and dynamic traffic conditions make it challenging to accurately and promptly estimate the bandwidth demand. To address this issue, a spatial-temporal multi-attentional network (STMA-net) is designed to predict the future bandwidth demand of RSUs. Based on the predicted bandwidth demand, a prediction error-compensable proactive bandwidth allocation algorithm is proposed to adaptively allocate spectrum resources and narrow the discrepancy between predicted and actual demand. Experimental results with realistic traffic in Bologna demonstrate that the proposed STMA-net achieves 11.25% higher prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed proactive bandwidth allocation method outperforms existing methods, providing the highest throughput and serving 5% more vehicles while reducing the service drop rate by an order of magnitude.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates beam training for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems. By considering both the near field and far field, a triple-refined hybrid-field beam training scheme is proposed, where high-accuracy estimates of channel parameters are obtained through three steps of progressive beam refinement. First, the hybrid-field beam gain (HFBG)-based first refinement method is developed. Based on the analysis of the HFBG, the first-refinement codebook is designed and the beam training is performed accordingly to narrow down the potential region of the channel path. Then, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based and principle of stationary phase (PSP)-based second refinement methods are developed. By exploiting the measurements of the beam training, the ML is used to estimate the channel parameters. To avoid the high computational complexity of ML, closed-form estimates of the channel parameters are derived according to the PSP. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation (GA)-based third refinement method is developed. The hybrid-field neighboring search is first performed to identify the potential region of the main lobe of the channel steering vector. Afterwards, by applying the GA, a least-squares estimator is developed to obtain the high-accuracy channel parameter estimation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

However, a large number of antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in acquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter information. To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we first analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel tensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target sensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional communication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we associate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets in terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared training pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the channel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a canonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical expression. On this basis, we first investigate the uniqueness condition of the tensor factorization and the maximum number of resolvable targets by utilizing the specific Vandermonde structure. Then, we develop a unified tensor-based algorithm to estimate the parameters including angles, time delays, Doppler shifts, and reflection/path coefficients of the targets/channels. In addition, we propose a segment-based shared training pattern to facilitate the channel and target parameter estimation for the case with significant beam squint effects. Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed unified algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy, sensing resolution, and training overhead reduction.}

We aim to examine the coexistence of such a future heterogeneous LEO satellite network by proposing a tractable spatial model and analyzing the basic performance of downlink communications. We model a heterogeneous LEO satellite network as Cox point processes, ensuring satellites are located on various orbits. Then, we analyze two different access technologies for such a heterogeneous satellite network: closed access and open access. For both cases, we derive the coverage probability and prove that the coverage probability of the open access scenario outperforms that of the closed access, and this coverage enhancement applies to all users. By providing essential network performance statistics as key distributional parameters and by presenting the fact that the Cox point process approximates a forthcoming future constellation with slight variation, the developed framework and analysis will serve as a tractable instrument to design, evaluate, and optimize heterogeneous LEO satellite networks with numerous constellations.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) is an emerging technique to reduce the computation and communication overload caused by the orthogonal transmissions of the model updates in conventional federated learning (FL). This reduction is achieved at the expense of introducing aggregation error that can be efficiently suppressed by means of receive beamforming via large array-antennas. This paper studies OTA-FL in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with limited number of radio frequency (RF)-chains. For this setting, the beamforming for over-the-air model aggregation needs to be addressed jointly with antenna selection. This leads to an NP-hard problem due to its combinatorial nature. We develop three different algorithms to solve the problem. First, we use the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) technique and propose a two-tier algorithm for joint antenna selection and beamforming. The second algorithm interprets the antenna selection task as a sparse recovery problem and invokes the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) algorithm to approximate the sparse solution. The third algorithm invokes the same sparse recovery based interpretation, but employs the low-complexity method of fast iterative soft-thresholding to find a sparse solution. Convergence and complexity analysis is presented for all the algorithms. The numerical investigations depict that the two algorithms based on the sparse recovery interpretation outperform the PDD-based algorithm, when the number of RF-chains at the edge server is much smaller than its array size. However, as the number of RF-chains increases, the PDD-based algorithm outperforms. Our simulations further depict that learning performance with all the antennas being active at the parameter server (PS) can be closely tracked by selecting less than 20% of the antennas at the PS.}

The THz systems are expected to operate in the near, intermediate, as well as the far-field. As such, channel estimation strategies suitable for the near, intermediate, or far-field have been introduced in the literature. In this work, we propose a cross-field, i.e., able to operate in near, intermediate, and far-field, compressive channel estimation strategy. For an array-of-subarrays (AoSA) architecture, the proposed method compares the received signals across the arrays to determine whether a near, intermediate, or far-field channel estimation approach will be appropriate. Subsequently, compressed estimation is performed in which the proximity of multiple subarrays (SAs) at the transmitter and receiver is exploited to reduce computational complexity and increase estimation accuracy. Numerical results show that the proposed method can enhance channel estimation accuracy and complexity at all distances of interest.}

By exploiting a discrete (voxelated) representation of the environment, two novel ISAC schemes are derived with purpose-built message passing (MP) rules for the joint estimation of data symbols and status (filled/empty) of the discretized environment. The first relies on a modular feedback structure in which the data symbols and the environment are estimated alternately, whereas the second leverages a bilinear inference framework to estimate both variables concurrently. Both contributed methods are shown via simulations to outperform the state-of-the-art (SotA) in accurately recovering the transmitted data as well as the 3D image of the environment. An analysis of the computational complexities of the proposed methods reveals distinct advantages of each scheme, namely, that the bilinear solution exhibits a superior robustness to short pilots and channel blockages, while the alternating solution offers lower complexity with large number of UEs and superior performance in ideal conditions.}

In this paper, a UAV-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system is proposed for IoT, which simultaneously senses the status information around the IoT and sends the sensing information to both the IoT nodes and a data collection center. In order to assess the sensing performance of ISAC, the radar estimation rate is introduced as a significant metric from the perspective of information theory. Considering the mutual interference between sensing and communications, the radar estimation rate is maximized through the coordinated optimization of UAV task scheduling, transmit power allocation, and 3D flight parameters under the constraint of communication rate. The formulated non-convex mixed-integer programming problem is divided into three subproblems, including UAV task scheduling optimization, UAV sensing and communication power optimization, and UAV 3D flight parameters optimization. The optimal solutions can be achieved by proposing a three-layer iterative optimization algorithm to optimize the three subproblems iteratively. The simulation results show that the radar estimation rate can well measure the sensing performance of the ISAC, which can be effectively improved by optimizing the 3D UAV flight parameters.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the utilization of In-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD) technology has gained considerable attention as an effective solution to address limited spectrum resources. However, achieving an IBFD system necessitates the utilization of both passive suppression and active cancellation techniques to completely eliminate strong self-interference (SI) signals in the local receiver. This research paper aims to tackle this challenge by introducing the Multi-Domain Intelligent Cancellation (MDIC) method, which integrates analog-domain and digital-domain cancellation techniques through comprehensive nonlinear system modeling. Moreover, this study presents an extensive analysis of the underlying principles of MDIC, while evaluating the limits of SI suppression performance under the assumption of perfect channel estimation and no phase noise. The channel parameter estimation is conducted using the time-domain least squares method, without considering the effects of Gaussian white noise and phase noise. To enhance the performance of SI cancellation (SIC), a deep learning network (DLN) is introduced in the digital domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MDIC method achieves a substantial SIC performance of approximately 60 dB, which closely approaches the theoretical limit. Furthermore, experimental data indicates that the proposed deep learning approach exhibits superior SIC performance and broader adaptability to broadband signals compared to traditional methods.}

In particular, the RIS is leveraged to assist the joint transmission of the multiple base stations (BSs) to multiple users, while assisting cooperative sensing by multiple BSs to perform multiple targets sensing. We formulate a problem for the purpose of minimizing the transmit power via jointly designing the transmit beamforming of the BSs and phase shifts of the RIS, while guaranteeing the achievable communication rate requirements and the sensing mutual information requirements. To address this non-convex problem, a high-quality alternating optimization algorithm is developed to split the intractable problem into two sub-problems. Specifically, with the given phase shifts of the RIS, the transmit beamforming sub-problem is addressed by semidefinite relaxation-based algorithm. A successive convex approximation (SCA) method-based and penalty function-based convex-concave procedure algorithm is proposed to tackle the RIS phase-shift optimization sub-problem. To reduce the computational complexity, an efficient low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is developed. For the transmit beamforming design, an SCA method-based second-order cone programming algorithm is proposed, while for the RIS phase-shift design, a circle manifold optimization-based algorithm is introduced by utilizing penalty function. Simulation results validate the advancement of deploying RIS in enhancing the performance of cooperative multicell ISAC systems in terms of transmit power. Furthermore, our results illustrate the significant superiority of the proposed algorithms over the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Positioning is expected to support communication and location-based services in the fifth/sixth generation (5G/6G) networks. With the advent of reflective reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), radio propagation channels can be controlled, making high-accuracy positioning and extended service coverage possible. However, the passive nature of the RIS requires a signal source such as a base station (BS), which limits the positioning service in extreme situations, such as tunnels, dense urban areas, or complicated indoor scenarios where 5G/6G BSs are not accessible. In this work, we show that with the assistance of (at least) two RISs and sidelink communication between two user equipments (UEs), the absolute positions of these UEs can be estimated in the absence of BSs. A two-stage 3D sidelink positioning algorithm is proposed, benchmarked by the derived Cramér-Rao bounds. The effects of multipath and RIS profile designs on positioning performance are evaluated, and localization analyses are performed for various scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the promising positioning accuracy of the proposed BS-free sidelink communication system. Additionally, we propose and evaluate several solutions to eliminate potential blind areas where positioning performance is poor, such as removing clock offset via round-trip communication, adding geometrical prior or constraints, as well as introducing more RISs.}

	abstract = {This work focuses on the synergy of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) to enlarge the coverage, improve the performance, and save on antennas. Specifically, we employ a multi-sector BD-RIS modeled as a prism, which can achieve highly directional full-space coverage, in a multiuser multiple input single output communication system. With the multi-sector BD-RIS aided RSMA model, we jointly design the transmit precoder and BD-RIS matrix under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions. The robust design is performed by solving a stochastic average sum-rate maximization problem. With sample average approximation and weighted minimum mean square error-rate relationship, the stochastic problem is transformed into a deterministic one with multiple blocks, each of which is iteratively designed. Simulation results show that multi-sector BD-RIS aided RSMA outperforms space division multiple access schemes. More importantly, synergizing multi-sector BD-RIS with RSMA is an efficient strategy to reduce the number of active antennas at the transmitter and the number of passive antennas in BD-RIS.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler to address the increasing demands of spectrum and throughput for ubiquitous sensing and communication. Hereafter, we consider the channel estimation and localization for multi-user ISAC systems assisted by the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology. In order to acquire precise environmental information, we propose a novel circular RIS architecture with circularly arranged reflecting unit cells. By modeling the training signal as a low-rank third-order canonical polyadic tensor, we transform the channel estimation problem into a tensor deconstruction task. By leveraging the phase mode excitation principle, we develop a customized RIS training pattern, and retrieve the equivalent channel parameters by subspace estimation algorithms. By exploring the characteristics of RIS array manifolds and free-space propagation, we implement a unique decoupling of channel parameters for user localization, which cannot be supported by traditional linear RIS topologies. Moreover, the design degrees of freedom in the spatial and frequency dimensions are also exploited to further enhance the proposed algorithms. Simulation results indicate that the circular RIS-enabled channel estimation schemes can recover the propagation information with remarkable accuracy, thereby offering a high-level resolution of localization.}

	abstract = {In an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless communication system, obtaining the real-time channel state information (CSI) through channel estimation (CE) is crucial for achieving the IRS’s passive beamforming gain, which however shortens the effective data transmission time due to the CSI feedback overhead. It is of utmost importance to decide how often to estimate the channels in an IRS-assisted system. In this paper, we propose an integrated CE and beamforming scheme to jointly optimize the adaptive CE interval and passive beamforming strategy, based on the past observation sequences composed of imperfect CSI and data rate feedback. We formulate the two-stage optimization problem as a bilevel partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), aiming to maximize the expectation of cumulative throughput of the system. We propose two bilevel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, namely recurrent neural network (RNN) based proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and Belief-based PPO algorithm, to solve this problem. In these two algorithms, the CSI features from the past observation sequences are implicitly extracted by the RNN network or explicitly inferred by the belief network, which then serve as the inputs for the two-stage policy networks to determine the necessity of CE and the IRS beamforming vector based on the PPO algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed adaptive CE scheme over the periodic counterpart in terms of throughput. Moreover, the results show that it is profitable to estimate the channels less frequently if the channels exhibit a higher correlation across time.}

	abstract = {Given the frequently changing and potentially unreliable environment, the seamless handover authentication is essential to achieve zero-trust Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network with dramatically enhanced communication and transportation safety. The traditional centralized handover authentication schemes may suffer from the excessive latency and situation agnostic limitation, leading to potential interruption of critical services for fast moving vehicles. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel decentralized edge collaboration-based handover authentication scheme with the assistance of blockchain for providing continuous protections in zero-trust IoV. A distributed learning process is designed by involving multiple authentication cooperators (ACs) to collect device/location-related features of vehicles at network edge and then to verify their identities. During the movement of vehicles, the access point (AP) could select new ACs by transferring the security information from existing ACs to the new members for seamless handover authentication. A situation-aware AC selection and update algorithm is proposed for maximizing handover authentication accuracy. Moreover, a hierarchical blockchain-assisted security information transfer and reputation management mechanism is designed for reliable collaboration and efficient management in zero-trust IoV. Compared with the existing schemes, our results characterize the outperformance of the proposed scheme in authentication accuracy and time cost of handover.}

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback provides satisfactory reconstruction accuracy of downlink CSI for the base station in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although the introduction of codeword quantization improves the efficiency and feasibility of DL-based CSI feedback networks, the gradient problem caused by quantizers in the training stage compromises the performance of neural networks. In this paper, by considering the test channel as an equivalent of ideal rate-distortion quantization in a mutual information sense, we propose a test channel-based quantization module (TCQM) for DL-based CSI feedback networks which mitigates the gradient problem in the end-to-end training of CSI feedback networks. Moreover, the training of the CSI feedback network with TCQM is not dependent on the design of practical quantizer in the inference stage, which reduces the complexity of the training and design constraints of the CSI feedback system. Finally, for the setting of fixed feedback overhead, based on the idea of TCQM, we propose an adaptive training strategy for CSI feedback networks to evaluate the proper combination of codeword length and quantization rate of codeword elements to achieve the optimal reconstruction accuracy. Experiment results show that the proposed schemes outperform existing codeword quantization schemes in the literature.}

	abstract = {Most existing studies on massive grant-free access, proposed to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) for the Internet of things (IoT), assume Rayleigh fading and perfect synchronization for simplicity. However, in practice, line-of-sight (LoS) components generally exist, and time and frequency synchronization are usually imperfect. This paper systematically investigates maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based device activity detection under Rician fading for massive grant-free access with perfect and imperfect synchronization. We assume that the large-scale fading powers, Rician factors, and normalized LoS components can be estimated offline. We formulate device activity detection in the synchronous case and joint device activity and offset detection in three asynchronous cases (i.e., time, frequency, and time and frequency asynchronous cases) as MLE problems. In the synchronous case, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point of the MLE problem. In each asynchronous case, we propose two iterative algorithms with identical detection performance but different computational complexities. In particular, one is computationally efficient for small ranges of offsets, whereas the other one, relying on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT, is computationally efficient for large ranges of offsets. The proposed algorithms generalize the existing MLE-based methods for Rayleigh fading and perfect synchronization. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm for the synchronous case can reduce the detection error probability by up to 50.4% at a 78.6% computation time increase, compared to the MLE-based state-of-the-art, and the proposed algorithms for the three asynchronous cases can reduce the detection error probabilities and computation times by up to 65.8% and 92.0%, respectively, compared to the MLE-based state-of-the-arts.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the utilization of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) in supporting joint physical layer security (PLS) and covert communications (CCs) in a multi-antenna millimeter wave (mmWave) system, where the base station (BS) communicates with both covert and security users while defeating eavesdropping by wardens with the help of a STAR-RIS. Specifically, analytical derivations are performed to obtain the closed-form expression of warden’s minimum detection error probability (DEP). Furthermore, the asymptotic result of the minimum DEP and the lower bound of the secure rates are derived, considering the practical assumption that BS only knows the statistical channel state information (CSI) between STAR-RIS and the wardens. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated with the aim of maximizing the average sum of the covert rate and the minimum secure rate while ensuring the covert requirement and quality of service (QoS) for legal users by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamformers. Due to the strong coupling among variables, an iterative algorithm based on the alternating strategy and the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results indicate that the performance of the proposed STAR-RIS-assisted scheme greatly surpasses that of the conventional RIS scheme, which validates the superiority of STAR-RIS in simultaneously implementing PLS and CCs.}

	abstract = {Cooperative perception (CP) is a key technology to facilitate consistent and accurate situational awareness for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To tackle the network resource inefficiency issue in traditional broadcast-based CP, unicast-based CP has been proposed to associate CAV pairs for cooperative perception via vehicle-to-vehicle transmission. In this paper, we investigate unicast-based CP among CAV pairs. With the consideration of dynamic perception workloads and channel conditions due to vehicle mobility and dynamic radio resource availability, we propose an adaptive cooperative perception scheme for CAV pairs in a mixed-traffic autonomous driving scenario with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. We aim to determine when to switch between cooperative perception and stand-alone perception for each CAV pair, and allocate communication and computing resources to cooperative CAV pairs for maximizing the computing efficiency gain under perception task delay requirements. A model-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solution is developed, which integrates MARL for an adaptive CAV cooperation decision and an optimization model for communication and computing resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving high computing efficiency gain, as compared with benchmark schemes.}

This paper proposes a two-stage active user detection (AUD) consisting of the initial AUD stage and the false alarm correction stage. In the initial AUD stage, an initial active user set is efficiently estimated by the conventional cover decoder, which may still contain a few false alarms. Hence, a false alarm correction stage is further invoked, which consists of two cooperative and iterative detection components, namely, message passing algorithm (MPA) based data decoder and belief propagation (BP) based false alarm corrector. Based on users’ signature spreading sequences in the initial active user set, a tanner graph with potential redundant-edges is constructed, on which MPA is executed for data decoding. In turn, with the aid of decoded data symbols, the remaining false alarms in the initial active user set are further removed by the false alarm corrector. Hence, the tanner graph could evolve iteratively. Furthermore, the false alarm performance of the initial AUD stage is theoretically analyzed. Based on this analysis, the LDS matrix used in GF LDS-OFDM is optimized. Finally, the complexity of our proposal is also provided.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technique to control wireless propagation wireless environment for improving the communication performance cost-effectively and extending the wireless signal coverage of access point (AP). In order to reduce the path-loss of the cascaded user-IRS-AP channels, the IRS-integrated AP architecture has been proposed to deploy the antenna array of the AP and the IRSs within the same antenna radome. To reduce the pilot overhead for estimating all IRS-involved channels, in this paper, we propose a novel codebook-based IRS reflection design for the IRS-integrated AP to enhance the coverage performance in a given area. In particular, the codebook consisting of a small number of codewords is designed offline by employing an efficient sector division strategy based on the azimuth angle. To ensure the performance of each sector, we optimize its corresponding codeword for IRS reflection pattern to maximize the sector-min-average-effective-channel-power (SMAECP) by applying the alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. With the designed codebook, the AP performs the IRS reflection training by sequentially applying all codewords and selects the one achieving the best communication performance for data transmission. Numerical results show that our proposed codebook design can enhance the average channel power of the whole coverage area, as compared to the system without IRS. Moreover, the proposed codebook-based IRS reflection design is compared with several benchmark schemes, which achieves significant performance gain in both single-user and multi-user transmissions.}

However, with the growth of the number of devices, it is difficult for the Access Point (AP) to schedule uplink transmissions, which calls for an efficient access mechanism in the OFDMA uplink system. Based on Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), we propose a Mean-Field Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MFMAPPO) algorithm to improve the throughput and guarantee the fairness. Motivated by the Mean-Field games (MFGs) theory, a novel global state and action design are proposed to ensure the convergence of MFMAPPO in the massive access scenario. The Multi-Critic Single-Policy (MCSP) architecture is deployed in the proposed MFMAPPO so that each agent can learn the optimal channel access strategy to improve the throughput while satisfying fairness requirement. Extensive simulation experiments are performed to show that the MFMAPPO algorithm 1) has low computational complexity that increases linearly with respect to the number of stations 2) achieves nearly optimal throughput and fairness performance in the massive access scenario, 3) can adapt to various diverse and dynamic traffic conditions without retraining, as well as the traffic condition different from training traffic.}

	abstract = {Localization services for wireless devices play an increasingly important role in our daily lives and a plethora of emerging services and applications already rely on precise position information. Widely used on-device positioning methods, such as the global positioning system, enable accurate outdoor positioning and provide the users with full control over what services and applications are allowed to access their location information. In order to provide accurate positioning indoors or in cluttered urban scenarios without line-of-sight satellite connectivity, powerful off-device positioning systems, which process channel state information (CSI) measured at the infrastructure base stations or access points with deep neural networks, have emerged recently. Such off-device wireless positioning systems inherently link a user’s data transmission with its localization, since accurate CSI measurements are necessary for reliable wireless communication—this not only prevents the users from controlling who can access this information but also enables virtually everyone in the device’s range to estimate its location, resulting in serious privacy and security concerns. We therefore propose on-device attacks against off-device wireless positioning systems in multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems while remaining standard compliant and minimizing the impact on quality-of-service, and we demonstrate their efficacy using real-world measured datasets for cellular outdoor and wireless LAN indoor scenarios. We also investigate defenses to counter such attack mechanisms, and we discuss the limitations and implications on protecting location privacy in existing and future wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {Interleaved training has been studied for single-user and multi-user massive MIMO downlink with either fully-digital or hybrid beamforming. However, the impact of channel correlation on its average training overhead is rarely addressed. In this paper, we explore the channel correlation to improve the interleaved training for single-user massive MIMO downlink. For the beam-domain interleaved training, we propose a modified scheme by optimizing the beam training codebook. The basic antenna-domain interleaved training is also improved by dynamically adjusting the training order of the base station (BS) antennas during the training process based on the values of the already trained channels. Exact and simplified approximate expressions of the average training length are derived in closed-form for the basic and modified beam-domain schemes and the basic antenna-domain scheme in correlated channels. For the modified antenna-domain scheme, a deep neural network (DNN)-based approximation is provided for fast performance evaluation. Analytical results and simulations verify the accuracy of our derived training length expressions and explicitly reveal the impact of system parameters on the average training length. In addition, the modified beam/antenna-domain schemes are shown to have a shorter average training length compared to the basic schemes.}

	abstract = {Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) at millimeter-Wave (mmWave) frequencies is envisioned as a key technology for beyond 5G communication. Accurate channel modeling is crucial for the design and evaluation of such systems. Ray-Tracing (RT) can be used to accurately simulate the propagation channel. However, state-of-the-art RT for multi-antenna systems typically employs plane-wave extension under far-field conditions, failing to capture Near-Field (NF) and Spatial non-Stationary (SnS) properties that are observed in real-world mmWave massive MIMO channel measurements. This work aims at accurate and efficient RT simulations for massive MIMO systems, with a proposed coarse-refinement strategy capable of capturing NF and SnS. The channel is simulated using RT on a few sparsely located array elements and then interpolated onto other elements using spherical/astigmatic-wave approximation and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction, thus significantly reducing simulation complexity while maintaining accuracy. The proposed strategy is demonstrated to offer almost the same simulation accuracy as the brute-force method, with a dramatic reduction in complexity through experimental validation. The significance, novelty, effectiveness, and simplicity of the proposed framework make it highly valuable for massive MIMO channel research.}

	abstract = {In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication, beam search is usually time-consuming as the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) of IRS is usually very large. The hierarchical codebook is a widely accepted method for reducing the complexity of searching time. The performance of this method strongly depends on the design scheme of beamforming of different beamwidths. In this paper, a non-constant phase difference (NCPD) beamforming algorithm is proposed. To implement the NCPD algorithm, we first model the phase shift of IRS as a continuous function and then determine the parameters of the continuous function through the analysis of its array factor. Then, we propose a hierarchical codebook and two beam training schemes, namely the joint searching (JS) scheme and direction-wise searching (DWS) scheme by using the NCPD algorithm which can flexibly change the width, direction, and shape of the beam formed by the IRS array. Numerical results show that the NCPD algorithm is more accurate with smaller side lobes, and also more stable on IRS of different sizes compared to other wide beam algorithms. The misalignment rate of the beam formed by the NCPD method is significantly reduced. The time complexity of the NCPD algorithm is constant, thus making it more suitable for solving the beamforming design problem with practically large IRS.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a federated learning (FL) based system is investigated with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) dataset, where multiple devices participate in the global model aggregation through a limited number of sub-channels. By analyzing weight divergence and convergence rate, a new metric is proposed based on age-of-information (AoI), which incorporates latency and can provide an advanced device selection standard. After that, device selection, sub-channel assignment and resource allocation are jointly designed in an overall AoI minimization problem under the maximum energy consumption constraint. The formulated problem is decoupled into two sub-problems. After analyzing the feasibility, the resource allocation problem is transformed to a convex problem, and the closed-from solution is obtained based on KKT conditions. By introducing virtual sub-channels, device selection and sub-channel assignment are jointly solved by a matching based algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is able to outperform all baselines in terms of both test accuracy and sum AoI, and the developed strategies can achieve significant improvements for all schemes.}

Exploiting the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) to extend the half-space into full-space ISAC coverage intensifies the competition for wireless resources. To alleviate this fierce competition as well as ensure ISAC performance, the cluster-based NOMA (CB-NOMA) technique is employed to save the joint communication and sensing (C&S) beams. Furthermore, the dedicated sensing beam accompanied by the joint C&S beams supports the radio sensing functionality. A minimum beampattern gain maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the power allocation, active and passive beamformer (BF) design, subject to communication requirements. To solve this non-convex problem, a block coordinate descent (BCD) based integral matrix algorithm is proposed to reach a suboptimal solution. For the joint power allocation and active BF block, the semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation are employed to optimize the coupled variables. For the passive BF block, the penalty-based method is invoked. To further reduce the complexity of the passive BF design, a BCD-based element-wise algorithm is proposed, where the joint phase shift and amplitude coefficients of each STAR-RIS element are optimized one by one. Simulation results verified that our proposed algorithms achieve higher beampattern gain towards the intended targets than the benchmark schemes accompanying less mismatch error.}

Due to the sub-wavelength structure, mutual coupling among RIS elements is unavoidable, and it inherently leads to multiple reflection effects that are ignored in conventional (approximative) RIS models. We formulate a joint non-convex problem under the MMSE criterion and use alternative optimization to convert the non-convex problem into two sub-problems for downlink and uplink transmissions separately. In both transmissions, one sub-problem involves optimizing the phase-shift matrix of RIS. In downlink, the other sub-problem is the optimization of active precoding for the base station (BS), while the equivalent sub-problem in uplink is the optimization of the linear receiver matrix. We optimize the phase shift matrix under a physically-consistent model using the gradient descent algorithm for both transmissions. We use the Lagrange multiplier method to optimize active precoding in the downlink and apply the First Order Necessary Condition (FONC) to optimize the linear receiver in the uplink. Simulation results are represented for both lossless and lossy RIS scenarios under perfect and imperfect channel state information. We discuss the impact of changing the number of RIS elements and the RIS element spacing on system performance. The results show that, with optimized phase shifts and active precoding, the inherent multiple reflection effect can improve the performance of RIS-aided wireless communications systems.}

In this setting, the dual-functional radar and communications (DFRC) base station (BS) acts as a mono-static radar in the downlink (DL), for sensing purposes, while performing its DL communication tasks. Meanwhile, the communication users act as distributed bi-static radar nodes in the uplink (UL) following a frequency-division duplex protocol. The DFRC BS fuses the information available at different DL and UL resource bands to estimate the angles-of-arrival (AoAs) of the multiple targets existing in the scene. In this work, we derive the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion for the hybrid radar fusion problem at hand. Additionally, we design efficient estimators; the first algorithm is based on an alternating optimization approach to solve the ML criterion, while the second one designs an optimization framework that leads to an alternating subspace approach to estimate AoAs for both the target and users. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of both algorithms in different scenarios, and the gains offered by these proposed methods through numerical simulations.}

	abstract = {As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel system utilizing a hybrid relay-intelligent reflecting surface (HR-IRS) to boost the security performance of directional modulation (DM) is established. In particular, the malicious attacker works in full-duplex (FD) mode and it will eavesdrop on confidential message (CM) as well as send malicious jamming. To maximize the secrecy rate (SR), a joint problem of optimizing the receive beamforming, transmit beamforming, power allocation (PA) factor, and phase shift matrix (PSM) of HR-IRS is formulated. Since the optimization problem is un-convex and the variables are coupled with each other, we address this problem by iteratively optimizing these variables. First, the receive beamforming is designed based on the generalized Rayleigh-Ritz theorem. Then, the transmit beamforming and PA factor are optimized via Dinkelbach’s Transform and successive convex approximation methods. And for PSM, two strategies, called separate optimization of PSM (SO-PSM) and joint optimization of PSM (JO-PSM), are proposed. Thus, two iterative schemes are proposed accordingly, namely maximizing SR based on SO-PSM (Max-SR-SOP) and maximizing SR based on JO-PSM (Max-SR-JOP). The former has a better performance and the latter has a lower complexity. Simulation results show that given a sufficient power budget of HR-IRS, the proposed Max-SR-SOP and Max-SR-JOP can enable HR-IRS-aided DM network to obtain a higher SR than that aided by passive IRS.}

	abstract = {With the continuous growth of network traffic, optical wireless communication (OWC) technology based on orbital angular momentum (OAM) can meet the needs of large-capacity modern communication and is an effective way to substantially increase wireless information transmission capacity. However, the OAM beam distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence in the actual link and the limitations caused by phase singularities are major challenges faced by the OAM-OWC system. In this paper, we address these issues and propose a low-complexity nonprobe adaptive optics (AO) compensation technique based on Y-net which can achieve high-accuracy distortion compensation and OAM mode demodulation simultaneously. In this approach, only one CCD is required for the Y-net-aided AO (Y-net AO) technique without a traditional probe path while satisfyingly balancing OAM-based optical transmission system complexity and transmission performance. Extensive simulations show that the proposed Y-net-aided AO technique can indeed decontaminate distorted OAM beams in both single- and multiplexed-channel OAM links. Furthermore, a noise model is established to analyze the robustness of the Y-net AO technique. The Y-net AO technique exhibits less system complexity and better anti-noise performance than the ordinary convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AO scheme. In summary, Y-net AO technology for OAM-OWC systems with high correction accuracy and low structural complexity is considered for effectively improving the transmission performance in this paper. Key AO technologies for the high-quality and innovative development of large-capacity communications are also expected to be formed.}

	abstract = {Distributed edge computing has been advocated as a key enabling technology to tackle large-scale intelligence applications, which is however hampered by the straggling effect. To overcome straggling, coded edge computing emerges as a promising solution by creating judiciously designed redundant computations using coding theory. Nonetheless, existing transmission schemes for coded edge computing that make edge nodes (ENs) transmit independently are often sub-optimal, as the computation results are correlated due to coding redundancy. This entails a pressing need for more effective transmission for coded edge computing. With this consideration, a novel task-decoding assisted cooperative transmission scheme is proposed in this work to facilitate cooperative transmission in general coded edge computing settings. Specifically, by exploiting the structural relation among the encoded sub-tasks, a task-decoding mechanism is developed to enable ENs to reconstruct computation results of all other ENs, so that they can cooperatively transmit with any other EN by forming a virtual multi-antenna system. To characterize the delay performance of the proposed scheme, an analytic bound with closed-form expression is derived first, followed by a more accurate algorithmic bound for scenarios with a relatively small recovery threshold. Simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

Considering a single-user multiple-input multiple-output system, we formulate a weighted sum-rate maximization problem to jointly maximize the downlink and uplink system performance. To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, we adopt an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, in which two phase shift optimization techniques are developed to handle the unit-modulus constraints induced by the reflection coefficients at the RIS. The first technique exploits the manifold optimization-based algorithm, while the second uses a lower-complexity AO approach. Numerical results verify that the proposed techniques rapidly converge to local optima and significantly improve the overall system performance compared to existing benchmark schemes.}

To fully unlock the potential of ABSs, a high-capacity, flexible and dynamic wireless backhaul provision is necessitated and integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture comes into the picture. In this paper, we investigate the availability of IAB architecture in dynamic aerial-terrestrial networks in terms of coverage probability (CP) and further explore the feasible region of IAB to promote aerial-terrestrial coverage enhancement. Specifically, the results show that the capability of IAB to promote aerial-terrestrial coverage enhancement would be diminished with the increases of ABSs flight speed and GBS density. The reason is found that relying on fixed GBSs to provide dynamic backhaul for flying ABSs would come with frequent handovers, which degrades network CP. On this account, to make IAB adapt to dynamic aerial-terrestrial networks, a mobility-adaptable IAB scheme is proposed where a distance threshold L_{p} is set to alleviate the negative effect caused by handovers. With L_{p} optimized, the coverage performance of dynamic aerial-terrestrial IAB network is shown to be increased, especially in dense GBS regime.}

	abstract = {With the 5G systems being highly developed, the urge of the next generation networks is increasingly necessary, which demands extremely high data rates and low latency. As an emerging technology capable of reflecting and refracting the incident signals on both sides simultaneously, recently the intelligent omnidirectional surface (IOS) has been used to enhance the capacity of wireless networks. However, it is challenging to design an IOS-enabled beamforming scheme that can respond quickly in a varying mobile environment due to its high complexity. In this paper, we aim to maximize the sum rate in an IOS-aided multi-user system given dynamically changing channel states and user mobility. A novel meta-critic reinforcement learning framework named meta-critic deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to design the IOS-enabled beamforming scheme. We propose a meta-critic network that can recognize the environment change and automatically perform the self-renewal of the learning model. A stochastic explore-and-reload procedure is also tailored to reduce the high-dimensional action space problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other benchmarks including the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method in both achievable sum rate and convergence speed.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a massive ultrareliable and low-latency communication (mURLLC) network with multiple antennas at each transmitter. We formulate a distributed beamforming and power control problem by minimizing the logarithm-based average utility of decoding error probability for the worst link over different network topologies and channels, where the policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN). To reduce signaling overhead and computation delay for distributed inference, we first develop a GNN for mURLLC (G4U) framework, where the graph embedding of each node is updated according to its previous graph embedding. In addition, we represent the local message of each node by the amplitude and phase of its pilot signal, such that the graph convolution can be accomplished efficiently by broadcasting the pilot signals. To further reduce the overall latency, we propose the pipeline G4U (PG4U), where each node determines its policy solely based on the channel state information acquired in the previous frames. The feedforward neural networks in PG4U for graph convolution can be executed efficiently during data transmission. To train the GNNs in mURLLC where the decoding error probability is small, we develop a novel loss function based on the asymptotic expression of the Gaussian Q -function. Simulation results show that G4U and PG4U are scalable to a different number of links. They can outperform the existing GNN and other policies significantly in terms of the QoS outage probability. Moreover, PG4U is suitable for mURLLC networks with short frame durations and highly correlated channels, while G4U is suitable for moderate frame durations with low channel correlation coefficients.}

	abstract = {Location awareness plays an increasingly important role in wireless network applications. However, accurate localization in complex indoor environments remains challenging for existing radio frequency (RF)-based systems, among which the ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) technology ranks to be the most promising one due to its capability in providing channel information with fine time resolution. In this paper, we propose a multipath-assisted single-anchor localization framework that can provide high-accuracy positional information in complex indoor environments. Specifically, a deep variational learning method is proposed to produce calibrated estimates of position-related parameters, including distance, time-difference-of-arrival and angle-of-arrival, which are then fed into a multipath-assisted single-anchor localization algorithm. The proposed method is implemented on self-built UWB transceivers and assessed with real-world data from an indoor measurement campaign. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional machine learning-based error mitigation approaches and can achieve 0.15m root mean square position error in non-line-of-sight scenarios.}

	abstract = {Emerging autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with small size, low speed, and low noise characteristics have shown promising applications in underwater monitoring. However, this also makes passive localization of underwater non-cooperative targets more challenging. Most localization schemes aim to improve localization accuracy while giving less consideration to additional related costs such as range flexibility, security, and energy consumption. To reduce such costs while ensuring accuracy, a weak-control AUV formation-based cooperative passive localization scheme is proposed, where AUVs do not require strict formation control or rely on anchor nodes to obtain absolute positions. Initially, there is a loose formation of multiple AUVs patrols until a target signal is passively and synchronously detected. Subsequently, the formation calibration is triggered. A rough formation calibration method is proposed based on signal interaction, where stratification effect compensation is considered. A precise formation calibration method adopting an inertial measurement unit and an extended Kalman filter algorithm is proposed to obtain a more accurate formation position by compensating for AUV drift error during rough calibration. Finally, the target position can be localized based on precise AUV formation using time difference of arrival method. Simulation and sea experimental results corroborate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed localization scheme.}

With the possibility to introduce relatively large arrays on user devices with a small footprint, the ability to determine the user orientation becomes unlocked. The estimation of the full user pose (joint 3D position and 3D orientation) is referred to as 6D localization. Conventionally, the problem of 6D localization using antenna arrays has been considered difficult and was solved through a combination of heuristics and optimization. In this paper, we reveal a close connection between the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) and angle-of-departures (AoDs) and the well-studied perspective projection model from computer vision. This connection allows us to solve the 6D localization problem, by adapting state-of-the-art methods from computer vision. More specifically, two problems, namely 6D pose estimation from AoAs from multiple single-antenna base stations and 6D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on single- base station (BS) mmWave communication, are first modeled with the perspective projection model, and then solved. Numerical simulations show that the proposed estimators operate close to the theoretical performance bounds. Moreover, the proposed SLAM method is effective even in the absence of the line-of-sight (LoS) path, or knowledge of the LoS/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) condition.}

Different from the conventional schemes designed by assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) of both communication channels and jamming channels. We aim to design the HBF scheme by minimizing the dispersion of the output signals in statistics without the knowledge of the jamming channel information. Two partially-connected HBF architectures are considered. Specifically, we propose a two-stage robust HBF design by solving the formulated non-convex problem. First, we introduce an auxiliary vector that represents the product of an analog beamformer (ABF) and a digital beamformer (DBF), and propose a pseudo-Newton method assisted beamforming algorithm by relaxing the non-convex constraint on the ABF. In the second stage, we separately optimize the ABF and DBF for two different partially-connected HBF architectures by proposing a matrix decomposition-based alternating minimization method. Finally, simulation results are provided for demonstrating the superiority of our proposed robust HBF schemes over other benchmark schemes by considering the security threat of potential jamming attacks, especially when the number of snapshots is small.}

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate the performance of a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, augmented with backscattering capabilities, designed to facilitate integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Our primary objective is two-fold: first, to enhance the overall communication throughput, and second, to strengthen the sensing power for target detection. To achieve these goals, we introduce two novel dynamic user clustering algorithms namely composite distance and angle-based (CDA) and channel-oriented adaptive (COA) algorithm for grouping users into clusters with fixed base station and RIS positions, where the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed for effective communication within each pair. Moreover, we present a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly maximizes the sum rate and sensing power. This problem involves optimizing the transmit beamformer at the base station, the power allocation factors within each cluster, and the phase shifts at the RIS. This methodology not only adheres to strict power constraints and quality of service requirements at each receiving node but also ensures equitable resource allocation among the targets and enforces unit modulus phase shifts at each RIS element. To tackle the complex interdependencies and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we introduce an advanced iterative algorithm based on alternative optimization (AO). This state-of-the-art technique employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to systematically address this multifaceted problem. Finally, the simulation results empirically validate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness, considering the number of RIS elements, maximum power budget, number of targets, and imperfect channel state information (CSI) while showing the trade-off between communication and sensing performance.}

	abstract = {Traditional physical layer secure beamforming is achieved via precoding before signal transmission using channel state information (CSI). However, imperfect CSI will compromise the performance with imperfect beamforming and potential information leakage. In addition, multiple RF chains and antennas are needed to support the narrow beam generation, which complicates hardware implementation and is not suitable for resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Moreover, with the advancement of hardware and artificial intelligence (AI), low-cost and intelligent eavesdropping to wireless communications is becoming increasingly detrimental. In this paper, we propose a multi-carrier based multi-band waveform-defined security (WDS) framework, independent from CSI and RF chains, to defend against AI eavesdropping. Ideally, the continuous variations of sub-band structures lead to an infinite number of spectral features, which can potentially prevent brute-force eavesdropping. Sub-band spectral pattern information is efficiently constructed at legitimate users via a proposed chaotic sequence generator. A novel security metric, termed signal classification accuracy (SCA), is used to evaluate the security robustness under AI eavesdropping. Communication error probability and complexity are also investigated to show the reliability and practical capability of the proposed framework. Finally, compared to traditional secure beamforming techniques, the proposed multi-band WDS framework reduces power consumption by up to six times.}

Specifically, the transmission schemes of wireless fronthaul and access links are jointly designed, while addressing the characteristics of ultra-dense networks, such as base station diversity and high probability of line-of-sight transmission. Aiming at maximizing the security energy efficiency, we jointly optimize the power allocation in the fronthaul and the resource allocation in the access link which includes beamforming for information and energy transmission, on/off of remote radio heads (RRHs), and user-RRH association. We propose an iterative algorithm based on the Dinkelbach’s transform to deal with the fractional objective function. To solve the mix-integer non-convex inner problem, we design: (1) a successive convex approximation (SCA) based method in which the problem at each iteration is a mixed-integer second-order cone program; (2) and an alternating optimization algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to further balance the complexity and performance. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. Moreover, the proposed SCA method can achieve excellent performance while preserving integer variables, which inevitably increases algorithm complexity.

These are extremely sensitive to interference from artificial signals, thus the spectrum above 100 GHz features several bands which are protected from active transmissions under current spectrum regulations. To provide more agile access to the spectrum for both services, active and passive users will have to coexist without harming passive sensing operations. In this paper, we provide the first, fundamental analysis of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) that large-scale terrestrial deployments introduce in different satellite sensing systems now orbiting the Earth. We develop a geometry-based analysis and extend it into a data-driven model which accounts for realistic propagation, building obstruction, ground reflection, for network topology with up to 105 nodes in more than 85 km2. We show that the presence of harmful RFI depends on several factors, including network load, density and topology, satellite orientation, and building density.

	abstract = {This work examines a novel wireless knowledge caching framework where machine learning models (i.e., knowledge) are cached at local small cell base-stations (SBSs) to facilitate both federated training and access of the models by users. We first consider a single-SBS scenario, where the caching decision, user selection, and wireless resource allocation are jointly determined by minimizing a training error bound subject to constraints on the cache capacity, the communication and computation latency, and the energy consumption. The solution is obtained by first computing the minimum achievable training loss for each model, followed by the optimization of the binary caching variables, which reduces to a 0-1 knapsack problem. The proposed framework is then extended to the multiple-SBS scenario where the user association among SBSs is further examined. We adopt a dual-ascent method where Lagrange multipliers are introduced and updated in each iteration to regularize the dependence among user selection and association. Given the Lagrange multipliers, the caching decision, user selection, resource allocation and user association variables are optimized in turn using a block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a training error bound that is lower than preference-only and random caching policies in both scenarios.}

	abstract = {The advantages of graph neural networks (GNNs) in leveraging the graph topology of wireless networks have drawn increasing attentions. This paper studies the GNN-based learning approach for the sum-rate maximization in multiple-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) networks subject to the users’ individual data rate requirements and the power budget of the base station (BS). By modeling the MU-MISO network as a graph, a GNN-based architecture named complex residual graph attention network (CRGAT) is proposed to directly map channel state information to beamforming vectors. The attention-enabled aggregation and the residual-assisted combination are adopted to enhance the learning capability and mitigate the oversmoothing issue. Furthermore, a novel activation function is proposed for the constraint due to the limited power budget at the BS. The CRGAT is trained via unsupervised learning with two proposed loss functions. An evaluation method is proposed for the learning-based approaches, based on which the effectiveness of the proposed CRGAT is validated in comparison with several convex optimization and learning based approaches. Numerical results are provided to reveal the advantages of the CRGAT including the millisecond-level response with limited optimality performance loss, the scalability to different number of users and power budgets, and the adaptability to different system settings.}

	abstract = {Age of Information (AoI) has been studied recently for satisfying the timeliness requirements of the emergent applications, i.e. smart cities and smart wearables in future Internet of Everything (IoE). In order to integrate multiple information flows i wireless powered sensor network (WPSN), we propose age of sensing (AoS) for measuring freshness of the fused information, which is defined as the time elapsed from the generation moment of the sensing information used for generating the fresh reliable fused information. Specifically, a wireless power transfer (WPT) aided wireless sensor network (WSN) is studied. Multiple batteryless sensors cooperatively sense common objects and then timely upload the sensing information to a fusion center (FC). The FC fuses the correctly decoded information from different sensors and finally evaluates the reliability of the fused information. The number of time slots for WPT and the deployment of the sensors are then jointly optimised, in order to minimise the average AoS. A Fibonacci aroused integer programming approach is then proposed to solve the nonlinear integer problem having NP-hard complexity. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis for the AoS, while also demonstrating that our algorithm achieves the superb performance by referring to the optimal exhaustive method.}

We target the minimization of the sum of the maximum mean squared errors (MSEs) over the multicast groups, which is then approximated with a weighted sum MSE minimization to simplify the computation and signaling. To design the joint network-wide multi-group multicast precoders at the base stations (BSs) and the combiners at the user equipments (UEs) in a fully distributed fashion, we adopt an iterative bi-directional training scheme with UE- and/or group-specific precoded uplink pilots and group-specific precoded downlink pilots. To this end, we introduce a new group-specific over-the-air uplink training resource that entirely eliminates the need for backhaul signaling for the channel state information (CSI) exchange. The precoders are optimized locally at each BS by means of either best-response or gradient-based updates, and the convergence of the two approaches is analyzed with respect to the centralized implementation with perfect CSI. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed distributed methods greatly outperform conventional cell-free massive MIMO precoding designs that rely solely on local CSI.}

	abstract = {Many emerging technologies for the next generation wireless network prefer line-of-sight (LOS) propagation conditions to fully release their performance advantages. This paper studies 3D unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement to establish LOS links for two ground terminals in deep shadow in a dense urban environment. The challenge is that the LOS region for the feasible UAV positions can be arbitrary due to the complicated structure of the environment. While most existing works rely on simplified stochastic LOS models and problem relaxations, this paper focuses on establishing theoretical guarantees for the optimal UAV placement to ensure LOS conditions for two ground users in an actual propagation environment. It is found that it suffices to search a bounded 2D area for the globally optimal 3D UAV position. Thus, this paper develops an exploration-exploitation algorithm with a linear trajectory length and achieves above 99% global optimality over several real city environments being tested in our experiments. To further enhance the search capability in an ultra-dense environment, a dynamic multi-stage algorithm is developed and theoretically shown to find an \\delta\n-optimal UAV position with a search length O(1/\\delta)\n. Significant performance advantages are demonstrated in several numerical experiments for wireless communication relaying and wireless power transfer.}

	abstract = {Emerging intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) significantly improve system performance, but also pose a huge risk for physical layer security. Existing works have illustrated that a disco IRS (DIRS), i.e., an illegitimate IRS with random time-varying reflection properties (like a “disco ball”), can be employed by an attacker to actively age the channels of legitimate users (LUs). Such active channel aging (ACA) generated by the DIRS can be employed to jam multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems without relying on either jamming power or LU channel state information (CSI). To address the significant threats posed by DIRS-based fully-passive jammers (FPJs), an anti-jamming precoder is proposed that requires only the statistical characteristics of the DIRS-based ACA channels instead of their CSI. The statistical characteristics of DIRS-jammed channels are first derived, and then the anti-jamming precoder is derived based on the statistical characteristics. Furthermore, we prove that the anti-jamming precoder can achieve the maximum signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR). To acquire the ACA statistics without changing the system architecture or cooperating with the illegitimate DIRS, we design a data frame structure that the legitimate access point (AP) can use to estimate the statistical characteristics. During the designed data frame, the LUs only need to feed back their received power to the legitimate AP when they detect jamming attacks. Numerical results are also presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-jamming precoder against the DIRS-based FPJs and the feasibility of the designed data frame used by the legitimate AP to estimate the statistical characteristics.}

	abstract = {Providing rich and useful information regarding spectrum activities and propagation channels, radiomaps characterize the detailed distribution of power spectral density (PSD) and are important tools for network planning in modern wireless systems. Generally, radiomaps are constructed from radio strength measurements by deployed sensors and user devices. However, not all areas are accessible for radio measurements due to physical constraints and security considerations, leading to non-uniformly spaced measurements and blanks on a radiomap. In this work, we explore distribution of radio spectrum strengths in view of surrounding environments, and propose two radiomap inpainting approaches for the reconstruction of radiomaps that cover missing areas. Specifically, we first define a propagation-based priority before integrating exemplar-based inpainting with radio propagation model for fine-resolution small-size missing area reconstruction on a radiomap. We next introduce a novel radio depth map and propose a two-step template-perturbation approach for large-size restricted region inpainting. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed propagation priority and radio depth map in capturing PSD distribution, as well as their efficacy in radiomap reconstruction.}

Such a joint APS&BF optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the whole system. Fractional programming (FP)-based and alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms with weighted l_{1}\n-norm approximation are proposed to solve this MINP problem. However, the latter performs better than the former, with higher complexity. A lightweight multi-head single-body graph neural network (MHSB-GNN) algorithm is proposed, where the nodes and structures are innovatively designed. The MHSB-GNN benefits from the different node updating modules for different user equipment (UE), which introduce extra prior information into the graph and mine specific information of different UEs. Moreover, the equivalence between GNN and FP-based algorithm is proved to provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees for MHSB-GNN. The analysis of convergence and complexity validates the accuracy and effectiveness of the FP and AO-based algorithms. Leveraging the existing APS and BF solver, it is shown that the three proposed algorithms guarantee comparable performance as the exhaustive search algorithm in performance and complexity.}

A dropout-and-constellation-deletion parametric bilinear generalized approximate message passing (DCDP-BIG-AMP) algorithm is developed, and then applied for joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) in the hybrid-MIMO. Compared to parametric bilinear generalized approximate message passing (P-Bi-GAMP), DCDP-BIG-AMP randomly selects only a portion of variables to be updated and deletes constellation points which are changed slightly during the DCDP-BIG-AMP iterations. Consequently, the computational complexity is decreased significantly with the cost of minor performance degradation based on our experimental results. Its core operation is cyclic convolution, which is accelerated by fast Fourier transform (FFT). Subsequently, it is suitable for parallel hardware implementation. Moreover, the expectation maximization (EM) framework is combined to learn the unknown prior distribution parameters of channel. Simulation results show that DCDP-BIG-AMP successfully exploits the nonlinear magnitude measurements, and enables hybrid-MIMO to outperform the traditional MIMO on communication performance and energy-efficiency. DCDP-BIG-AMP based JCDE alternatively enhances the channel estimation (CE) and multiuser detection (MUD) performances, and converges quickly after only about 5 iterations. The dropout and constellation deletion mechanisms well balance between computational complexity and performance degradation.}

	abstract = {We consider a Static Reflecting Surface (SRS) assisted communication system, with an SRS deployed to assist communication in an area of a cell with poor connection to a massive multiple-input multiple-output Base Station (BS). The SRS has a high number of reflecting elements, with a static phase shift matrix, optimized offline at installation for serving a user population in the coverage area. To find the phase shift matrix at the SRS and the BS beamformer, we formulate a joint optimization problem aiming to maximize the average spectrum efficiency in the area, assuming line-of-sight communication between SRS and BS, as well as between SRS and the area. To tackle the problem, we decouple the BS beamforming and SRS phase shifter design problems. We assume that the BS beamforming is optimized in the operation phase based on the instantaneous end-to-end channel. Based on this we formulate the phase shifter design problem considering an upper bound of the spectrum efficiency, and a collection of sample locations in the area. Projected gradient ascent and convex relaxation approaches are used to obtain the phase shifters. In addition, we consider wide-beam designs for the SRS to steer energy evenly at the target area. For this, we numerically find an approximate ideal wide beam, as well as constant moudulus prolate spheroidal sequences. We evaluate the spectrum efficiency performance of the designed phase shifters both in a single- and multi-user scenario, considering a single and multiple SRSs, where each SRS is optimized to serve the area. In the simulated scenario, an SRS loses between 37% and 60% in average spectrum efficiency, as compared to a fully dynamic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) of the same size with real-time electronic control of the phase shifter. The performance gap between a dynamically optimized RIS and an SRS shrinks with an increasing number of simultaneous users.}

	abstract = {Using communications signals for dynamic target sensing is an important component of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In this paper, we propose to utilize the beam squint effect to realize fast non-cooperative dynamic target sensing in massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) Terahertz band communications systems. Specifically, we construct a wideband channel model of the echo signals, and design a beamforming strategy that controls the range of beam squint by adjusting the values of phase shifters and true time delay lines. With this design, beams at different subcarriers can be aligned along different directions in a planned way. Then the received echo signals at different subcarriers will carry target information in different directions, based on which the targets’ angles can be estimated through sophisticatedly designed algorithm. Moreover, we propose a supporting method based on extended array signal estimation, which utilizes the phase changes of different frequency subcarriers within different orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols to estimate the distances and velocities of dynamic targets. Interestingly, the proposed sensing scheme only needs to transmit and receive the signals once, which can be termed as You Only Listen Once (YOLO). Compared with the traditional ISAC methods that require time consuming beam sweeping, the proposed one greatly reduces the sensing overhead. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}

	abstract = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems, where UAVs act as aerial relays to forward tasks from ground users (GUs) to remote edge servers (ESs) for processing, a crucial observation is that the computing power in the system depends on the computing capabilities at a single ES and the number of ESs covered by the UAV. The latter is essentially influenced by the UAV altitude, ES density, transmit power of the UAV, channel condition, etc. In this paper, we model a UAV-assisted MEC system featuring adjustable UAV altitude, random GU distribution, and random ES distribution. We adopt the signal-to-noise ratio-based coverage probability and derive a computing model to characterize communication-aware altitude-dependent computing power. Upon this, we model the sequential task-processing process, including task uploading, forwarding, and computing, as a three-stage tandem queue ( M/D/1 \\rightarrow D/1\\rightarrow D/1\n). Employing queueing theory, we derive analytical results for the end-to-end (e2e) service latency. Besides, we address the optimization problem of maximizing the number of completed tasks within the e2e latency constraint, referred to as task service throughput. Simulation and analytical results show that optimal UAV altitudes, yielding the maximum task computing throughput, can be obtained under given network parameters.}

We optimize the above trade-off for a two-phase training scheme. In the first phase, the base station (BS) estimates the channel from the uplink pilots and configures the RIS. In the second phase, the user equipment estimates the channel from the downlink pilots and coherently demodulates the data. We derive an expression for the achievable rate that accounts for the impact of the channel estimation errors on the RIS phase-shift configuration and data demodulation. Our analysis uses a novel tractable approximation for the effective downlink channel gain and a novel proof that it is asymptotically Gaussian even in the presence of spatial correlation. Our analysis applies to the scenario where enough pilots are sent to estimate the cascaded channels and the cascaded channel grouping scenario that uses fewer pilots. We also study two channel models that depend on the location of the RIS relative to the BS. We derive insightful, closed-form expressions for the optimal powers and training durations. The optimal solution highlights the importance of boosting the pilot powers.}

In this paper, we identify and characterize the asymmetric impact of jitter on the angular domain information in the UAV mmWave channels, showing how it can lead to significant performance degradation if not properly handled. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive hybrid beamforming for the UAV mmWave communications to maximize the average transmission rate against the asymmetric jitter. The proposed adaptive hybrid beamforming consists of an optimal beam angular range design and an adaptive beamforming vector design. Specifically, we first analytically derive a compact expression of the average transmission rate of our systems. Based on the derived expression, we optimize the beam angular range to maximize the average transmission rate under arbitrary asymmetric jitter. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic expression of the optimal beam angular range in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. We further develop a simple-yet-efficient algorithm to obtain an adaptive beamforming vector that delivers the optimal beam angular range. Through numerical results, we verify the destructive impacts of the asymmetric jitter, and demonstrate how our proposed scheme can be robust to it, compared to the existing methods without considering the asymmetric jitter.}

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) estimation is a critical issue in the design of modern massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. With the increasing number of users, assigning orthogonal pilots to everyone incurs a large overhead that strongly penalizes the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. It becomes thus necessary to reuse pilots, giving rise to pilot contamination, a vital performance bottleneck of mMIMO networks. Reusing pilots among the users of the same cell is a very desirable operation condition from the perspective of reducing training overheads; however, the intra-cell pilot contamination might become even worse due to the users’ proximity. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are capable of smartly controlling the wireless channel, can be leveraged to achieve intra-cell pilot reuse. In this paper, our main contribution is an RIS-aided approach for intra-cell pilot reuse and the corresponding channel estimation method. Relying upon the knowledge of only statistical CSI, we then optimize the RIS phase-shifts based on a manifold optimization framework and the RIS positioning based on a deterministic approach. The extensive numerical results highlight the remarkable performance improvements achieved by the proposed scheme (for both uplink and downlink transmissions) compared to other alternatives.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic unsourced random access (URA) framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink access. Unlike the existing studies, where the quasi-static channel models and the unchanged user states (active or idle) are assumed, we take the dynamics in both the channels and the states of user devices into consideration. Such a framework supports the high mobility of user devices, and facilitates their abrupt terminates and accesses during the whole transmission process. To model the dynamics, we adopt steady-state Gaussian Markov processes for all the channel coefficients of user devices, and introduce a series of latent variables to indicate the user states. We design a two-step algorithm, including the approximate message passing (AMP)-based inner decoding algorithm and the variational message passing (VMP)-based outer decoding algorithm, to decode the information sequences for all the user devices that have accessed the network. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms all the baselines when there are dynamics in the channels of user devices, and our proposed method has robustness to deal with the abrupt changes of user states by equipping the large number of antennas at the base station.}

	abstract = {Grant-free access is a key enabler for connecting wireless devices with low latency and low signaling overhead in massive machine-type communications (mMTC). For massive grant-free access, user-specific signatures are uniquely assigned to mMTC devices. In this paper, we first derive a sufficient condition for the successful identification of active devices through maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in massive grant-free access. The condition is represented by the coherence of a signature sequence matrix containing the signatures of all devices. Then, we present a design framework of non-orthogonal signature sequences in a deterministic fashion. The design principle relies on unimodular sequences with low correlation, which are applied as masking sequences to the columns of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For example constructions, we use four polyphase masking sequences represented by characters over finite fields. Leveraging algebraic techniques, we show that the signature sequence matrix of proposed non-orthogonal sequences has theoretically bounded low coherence. Simulation results demonstrate that the deterministic non-orthogonal signatures achieve excellent performance in joint activity and data detection using ML- and approximate message passing (AMP)-based algorithms for massive grant-free access in mMTC.}

	abstract = {In this paper, practical utilization of multiple distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are able to conduct group-specific operations, for multi-group multicasting systems is investigated. To tackle the inter-group interference issue in the multi-group multicasting systems, the block diagonalization (BD)-based beamforming is considered first. Without any inter-group interference after the BD operation, the multiple distributed RISs are operated to maximize the minimum rate for each group. Since the computational complexity of the BD-based beamforming can be too high, a multicasting tailored zero-forcing (MTZF) beamforming technique is proposed to efficiently suppress the inter-group interference, and the novel design for the multiple RISs that makes up for the inevitable loss of MTZF beamforming is also described. Effective closed-form solutions for the loss minimizing RIS operations are obtained with basic linear operations, making the proposed MTZF beamforming-based RIS design highly practical. Numerical results show that the BD-based approach has ability to achieve high sum-rate, but it is useful only when the base station deploys large antenna arrays. Even with the small number of antennas, the MTZF beamforming-based approach outperforms the other schemes in terms of the sum-rate while the technique requires low computational complexity. The results also prove that the proposed techniques can work with the minimum rate requirement for each group.}

	abstract = {In the future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) cellular systems, networked sensing is a promising technique that can leverage the cooperation among the base stations (BSs) to perform high-resolution localization. However, a dense deployment of BSs to fully reap the networked sensing gain is not a cost-efficient solution in practice. Motivated by the advance in the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology for 6G communication, this paper examines the feasibility of deploying the low-cost IRSs to enhance the anchor density for networked sensing. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous networked sensing architecture, which consists of both the active anchors, i.e., the BSs, and the passive anchors, i.e., the IRSs. Under this framework, the BSs emit the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals in the downlink for localizing the targets based on their echoes reflected via/not via the IRSs. However, there are two challenges for using passive anchors in localization. First, it is impossible to utilize the round-trip signal between a passive IRS and a passive target for estimating their distance. Second, before localizing a target, we do not know which IRS is closest to it and serves as its anchor. In this paper, we show that the distance between a target and its associated IRS can be indirectly estimated based on the length of the BS-target-BS path and the BS-target-IRS-BS path. Moreover, we propose an efficient data association method to match each target to its associated IRS. Numerical results are given to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed heterogeneous networked sensing architecture with both active and passive anchors.}

	abstract = {To meet the surging wireless traffic demand, underlaying cellular networks with device-to-device (D2D) communication to reuse the cellular spectrum has been envisioned as a promising solution. In this paper, we aim to secure the D2D communication of the D2D-underlaid cellular network by leveraging covert communication to hide its presence from the vigilant adversary. In particular, there are adversaries aiming to detect D2D communications according to their received signal powers. To avoid being detected, the legitimate entity, i.e., D2D-underlaid cellular network, performs power control aiming to hide the D2D communication. We model the conflict between the adversaries and the legitimate entity as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Therein, the adversaries are the followers intending to detect D2D communication at the lower stage while the legitimate entity is the leader and aims to maximize its utility constrained by the D2D communication covertness and the cellular quality of service (QoS) at the upper stage. Different from the conventional works, the study of the combat is conducted from the system-level perspective, where the scenario that a large-scale D2D-underlaid cellular network threatened by massive spatially distributed adversaries is considered and modeled by stochastic geometry. We obtain the adversary’s optimal strategy as the best response from the lower stage and also both analytically and numerically verify its optimality. Taking into consideration the best response from the lower stage and based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, we devise a bi-level algorithm to find the optimal strategy of the legitimate entity, which together with the best response from the lower stage constitute the Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the network performance and reveal practical insights that instead of improving the legitimate utility by strengthening the D2D link reliability, increasing D2D transmission power will degrade it due to the security concern.}

	abstract = {Fluid antenna system (FAS) is a new flexible antenna technology that offers a new approach to multiple access, referred to as fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA). The performance of FAMA has been investigated but previous results were based on simplified spatial correlation models. In this paper, we will revisit FAMA for the two-user case and study the outage probability by characterizing the joint spatial correlation among the ports. We first derive a closed-form lower bound on the outage probability and reveal that in the absence of spatial correlation, the outage probability of the system decreases exponentially as the number of ports increases. We then show that the channel model can be greatly simplified by focusing upon a limited number of channel variables, allowing us to derive the outage probability using the approximate model. To gain insight, we further approximate the channel model and provide another approximation of the outage probability that is easier to compute. Simulation results validate the approximations and demonstrate that the outage probability decreases with the number of ports but has an error floor unless the antenna size is increased. Also, when the number of ports is fixed, the outage probability initially decreases exponentially with the size but eventually approaches the lower bound.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) as a newly proposed two-dimensional modulation scheme outperforms the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in high-speed scenarios. Most recent studies focus on off-grid channel estimation with the ideal pulse which needs to satisfy the bi-orthogonality robustness condition but does not exist. In this paper, we consider an OTFS system with rectangular pulses and propose a grid evolution based off-grid sparse Bayesian inference (GESBI) by updating the virtual delay-Doppler grid to improve the accuracy of the channel estimation. In particular, different from the recently proposed off-grid channel estimation algorithms in OTFS where the virtual grid is fixed and uniform, the proposed channel estimation method consists of an external and internal iteration, where the grid evolution method performs in the external iteration to update the virtual grid to be non-uniform by utilizing the estimated on-grid and the off-grid information in the internal iteration. In addition, the grid evolution-based efficient sparse Bayesian inference with the Student’s T distribution prior (T-GEESBI) is proposed to reduce the channel estimation complexity while improving the channel estimation accuracy. Specifically, the matrix inversion is avoided by approximating the posterior distribution. Then the equal non-convex problem is handled by utilizing the block coordinate descent method in a majorization-minimization framework. Furthermore, the two types of genie bounds on the mean squared error of the estimated channel coefficients are derived. Finally, both theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate low complexity, convergence, and the efficiency of the proposed channel estimation approach.}

	abstract = {A vital challenge in the deployment of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks is the high energy consumption incurred for the local computation and model update upload on energy-constrained devices such as IoT sensors. Equipping with energy harvesting (EH) modules is a promising solution that allows the devices to work in a self-sustainable manner. Moreover, quantizing the model updates can further improve the energy efficiency during the upload. In this paper, we propose an EH-enabled FL system with model quantization in which EH devices act as clients and client scheduling, model quantization, and transmit energy are jointly optimized to minimize the training loss while satisfying energy causality constraints and guaranteeing fairness in client selection. We formulate a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for the optimization. Then, by recasting the product of a continuous variable and a 0–1 variable in an equivalent linear form, we transform this non-convex MINLP problem into a convex problem and solve it. We present numerical evaluations on various datasets to show that our proposed system is stable and achieves high performance regardless of whether the loss function is convex or non-convex and whether the data distributions are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or non-i.i.d.}

To overcome such a rate degradation, we propose new robust precoding designs which can compensate for the quantization errors. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable rate of traditional precoding designs for limited feedback systems. Then, we obtain an approximation of the second-order statistics of quantized channel state information. With the aid of the derived approximation, we propose robust precoding designs in terms of the mean square error (MSE) with conditional expectation in non-iterative and iterative fashions. For the non-iterative precoding design, we study a robust minimum MSE (MMSE) precoding algorithm by extending a new channel decomposition. Also, in the case of iterative precoding, we investigate a robust weighted MMSE (WMMSE) precoding to further improve the achievable rate. Simulation results show that the proposed precoding schemes yield significant improvements over traditional precoding designs.}

	abstract = {In this article, joint communication and sensing (JCAS) is combined with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which validates a novel RIS-based JCAS (RIS-JCAS) system. The proposed system performs monostatic sensing to detect a potential user, after which communication with the user is established. The corresponding RIS-cascaded channel is formulated, based on which an algorithm is created, to handle radar target detection and communication channel estimation while multiple RISs operate simultaneously. A joint beam training process by utilizing the identical beamforming pattern on multiple RISs is created, which increases the time efficiency significantly. The detection accuracy is subsequently further improved through a novel fine-tuning method. To practically validate the aforementioned algorithm, a RIS-JCAS system is demonstrated using a mmWave testbed with a bandwidth of 1 GHz centralized at 26.2 GHz. Besides combining the widely adopted orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme with high-directional RIS beams, the system also allows the use of variant RIS flat-top beam shaping combined with orthogonal chirp-division multiplexing radar (OCDM) waveforms. This idea keeps the sensitivity of the RIS-JCAS system while broader beams with wider coverage but lower gain are utilized. Overall, accurate 4-dimensional sensing results are derived, which strongly assists the communication channel estimation and realizes the core benefits of the proposed RIS-JCAS system.}

In this work, we study the multiple-RIS-assisted uplink multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication systems, where each user’s signal is sent to the base station via both the direct and the reflected links. To obtain informative insight into the considered system with the statistical channel information, we first derive the closed-form expression for the ergodic sum rate of the MU-MIMO systems by applying the operator-valued free probability theory. Then, the covariance matrices of the transmit signals and the phase shifts of the RIS elements are jointly optimized to maximize the derived asymptotic ergodic sum rate via alternating optimization (AO). Specifically, the AO procedure is composed of a water-filling algorithm and a gradient descent algorithm over the Riemannian manifold and the two algorithms iterate until convergence. The numerical results show the accuracy of the asymptotic expression compared to the Monte Carlo simulation and the superiority of the proposed AO algorithm compared to the benchmark. Furthermore, the rank deficiency of the MIMO channel can be significantly improved by the deployment of multiple RISs and the proposed AO algorithm.}

	abstract = {A signal scrambling based joint blind channel estimation, activity detection, and data decoding (SS-JCAD) scheme is proposed for coded massive random access. This signal scrambling technique imposes symbol-wise phase rotation to each user’s modulated data, and the scrambling pattern serves as a user-specific signature which is free from any bandwidth expansion or pilot signaling overhead. Building on this scrambling signature, we further propose a simple yet efficient receiver design, which integrates the blind channel state information (CSI) estimation module with the forward error correction (FEC) decoder. Specifically, according to the scrambling signature, a user-specific posterior probability density function of the CSI is derived, based on which both the CSI and activity of each user can be blindly detected using a low-complexity single-user maximum a posteriori estimation. Given the estimated CSI as a priori information, a joint CSI (including user activity) estimation and data decoding algorithm is proposed, where the soft information is iteratively updated between the FEC decoder and the CSI estimation module to refine the detection reliability. Simulation shows that for massive random access systems with moderate code length and system load factor less than 1.5, the SS-JCAD scheme achieves almost the same bit error rate as the ideal case aided with perfect CSI, implying the SS-JCAD scheme as a near-optimal solution to the massive random access scenario.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems and filtered multi-carrier waveforms have recently emerged as hot research topics in next-generation wireless networks. This paper extends the use of Overlap-Save Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) receivers to mMIMO communication systems and investigates the corresponding FBMC transceiver advantages over OFDM. To this aim, we derived the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) expressions analytically under several channel impairments such as timing offsets and carrier frequency offsets. Furthermore, we conducted an asymptotic study on the performance of FBMC augmented with our proposed receivers in the context of massive MIMO systems. While still outperforming OFDM, results for FBMC show that increasing the number of base station (BS) antennas does not increase the SINR unboundedly. We have validated the proposed analytical study by comparing its results with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and confirmed the superiority of the proposed receivers over those in mMIMO literature. Moreover, analytical and simulation results confirm that the Overlap-Save FBMC receiver can support asynchronous communications in the context of mMIMO, a cornerstone for grant-free communications and massive access.}

In this paper, we study a multi-passive/active-IRS (PIRS/AIRS) aided wireless network with a multi-antenna base station (BS) in a given region. First, we divide the region into multiple non-overlapping cells, each of which may contain one candidate location that can be deployed with a single PIRS or AIRS. Then, we show several trade-offs between minimizing the total IRS deployment cost and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance over all cells via direct/cascaded LoS transmission with the BS. To reconcile these trade-offs, we formulate a joint multi-PIRS/AIRS deployment problem to select an optimal subset of all candidate locations for deploying IRS and also optimize the number of passive/active reflecting elements deployed at each selected location to satisfy a given SNR target over all cells, such that the total deployment cost is minimized. However, due to the combinatorial optimization involved, the formulated problem is difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this difficulty, we first optimize the reflecting element numbers with given PIRS/AIRS deployed locations via sequential refinement, followed by a partial enumeration to determine the PIRS/AIRS locations. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves better cost-performance trade-offs than other baseline deployment strategies.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a cell-free MIMO (cf-MIMO) system that consists of a central unit (CU), N distributed base stations (BSs) and K users. The BSs are connected to CU via N independent backhaul (BH) links of finite capacities. The BSs are uncoordinated, i.e. each one is ignorant of the others. We study a lattice network coding (LNC) scheme for cf-MIMO. In the uplink, the K users encode their messages with a practical 2^{m} -ary channel code mapped to 2^{m} -PAM, belonging to the ensemble of lattice codes, and transmit simultaneously. Each BS computes independent streams of integer-combinations of the users’ messages, referred to as network coding (NC) streams. The NC streams are forwarded to the CU via BH. The CU aggregates all NC streams from the N BSs, and recovers K users’ messages. We derive the achievable symmetric rate of the LNC scheme. Further, we solve a “bounded independent vectors problem” (BIVP) which identifies a near-optimal set of NC coefficient vectors. The solution maximizes the number of correctly computed NC streams at each BS. For practical implementation, we develop new soft detection algorithms for LNC decoding. The per-user complexity is proved to be no greater than O(K) , suitable for cf-MIMO with a large number of users. Our developed LNC based cf-MIMO exhibits superior frame error rate (FER) and spectral efficiency over existing non-LNC based schemes. Such advances are achieved with low-cost parallel processing and efficient usage of the BH.}

	abstract = {With the application and development of the fifth-generation (5G) communications, it is essential to gain insight understanding of the multi-antenna wireless channel characterizations. In particular, their relevant Channel Impulse Response (CIR) so to ensure the effective design of algorithms and systems. However, both the traditional channel measurement and modelling are essentially based on assessment at discretely sampled spatial points without the capability to obtain the relevant channel information over a given surrounding area. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to re-assemble the discretely sampled CIRs into equalized video streams. With this basis, a deep learning based video super-resolution method, namely, the Time Decomposition Video Super-Resolution (TDVSR), has been proposed to restore the area channel information for the first time. Moreover, a time decomposition module based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) has been designed to decompose the re-assembled CIRs into video form in the time dimension. A retrained video super-resolution model will then process the composited data and output high-resolution frames, which will be reversed to the CIRs at the dense density target area. A data set with various typical fading scenarios has been constructed by Ray Tracing (RT) method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TDVSR model successfully learned the nonlinear propagation laws through the data-driven method, which shows satisfied restoration accuracy with significantly increased computation efficiency.}

In FA-IM, the information bits are mapped not only to the modulation symbols, but also the index of FA position patterns. Additionally, the FA position pattern codebook is carefully designed to further enhance the system performance by maximizing the effective channel gains. Then, a low-complexity detector, referred to efficient sparse Bayesian detector, is proposed by exploiting the inherent sparsity of the transmitted FA-IM signal vectors. Finally, a closed-form expression for the upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) is derived under the finite-path and infinite-path channel condition. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the SE performance compared to the existing FAs-assisted MIMO and the fixed position antennas (FPAs)-assisted MIMO systems while obviating any additional hardware costs. It has also been shown that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional FA-assisted MIMO scheme in terms of error performance under the same transmission rate.}

The IRS is deployed to not only assist the communication from the BS to the CUs, but also enable the BS’s NLoS target sensing based on the echo signals from the BS-IRS-target-IRS-BS link. We consider two types of targets, namely the extended and point targets, for which the BS aims to estimate the complete target response matrix and the target’s direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the IRS, respectively. To provide full degrees of freedom for sensing, we consider that the BS sends dedicated sensing signals in addition to the communication signals. Accordingly, we model two types of CU receivers, namely Type-I and Type-II CU receivers, which do not have and have the capability of canceling the interference from the sensing signals, respectively. Under each setup, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the IRS to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for target estimation, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the CUs and the maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. We present efficient algorithms to solve the highly non-convex SINR-constrained CRB minimization problems, by using the techniques of alternating optimization, semi-definite relaxation, and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that the proposed design achieves lower estimation CRB than other benchmark schemes, and the sensing signal interference cancellation at Type-II CU receivers is beneficial when the number of CUs is greater than one.}

	abstract = {Massive random access of devices brings great challenge to the management of radio access networks. Most of the time, the access requests in the network are sporadic. Exploiting the bursting nature, sparse active user detection (SAUD) is an efficient enabler towards efficient active user detection. However, the sparsity might be deteriorated in case of high concurrent request periods. To dynamically coordinate the access requests, a reinforcement-learning (RL)-assisted scheme of closed-loop access control utilizing the access class barring (ACB) technique is proposed, where the control policy is determined through continuous interaction between the RL agent and the environment. The proposed RL agent can be deployed at the next generation node base (gNB), supporting rapid switching between heterogeneous vertical applications, such as mMTC and uRLLC services. Moreover, a data-driven scheme of deep-RL-assisted SAUD is proposed to resolve highly complex environments with continuous and high-dimensional state and action spaces, where a replay buffer is applied for automatic large-scale data collection. An Actor-Critic framework is formulated to incorporate the strategy-learning modules into the intelligent control agent. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can achieve superior performance in both access efficiency and user detection accuracy over the benchmark scheme for different heterogeneous services with massive access requests.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a challenging secure wireless sensing scenario where a legitimate radar station (LRS) intends to detect a target at unknown location in the presence of an unauthorized radar station (URS). We aim to enhance the sensing performance of the LRS and in the meanwhile prevent the detection of the same target by the URS. Under this setup, conventional stealth-based approaches such as wrapping the target with electromagnetic wave absorbing materials are not applicable, since they will disable the target detection by not only the URS, but the LRS as well. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new target-mounted IRS approach, where intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is mounted on the outer/echo surface of the target and by tuning the IRS reflection, the strength of its reflected radar signal in any angle of departure (AoD) can be adjusted based on the signal’s angle of arrival (AoA), thereby enhancing/suppressing the signal power towards the LRS/URS, respectively. To this end, we propose a practical protocol for the target-mounted IRS to estimate the LRS/URS channel and waveform parameters based on its sensed signals and control the IRS reflection for/against the LRS/URS accordingly. Specifically, we formulate new optimization problems to design the reflecting phase shifts at IRS for maximizing the received signal power at the LRS while keeping that at the URS below a certain level, for both the cases of short-term and long-term IRS operations with different dynamic reflection capabilities. To solve these non-convex problems, we apply the penalty dual decomposition method to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions for them efficiently. Finally, simulation results are presented that verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and algorithms for the target-mounted IRS to achieve secure wireless sensing, as compared with various benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Wideband millimeter-wave communication systems can be extended to provide radar-like sensing capabilities on top of data communication, in a cost-effective manner. However, the development of joint communication and sensing technology is hindered by practical challenges, such as occlusions to the line-of-sight path and clock asynchrony between devices. The latter introduces time-varying timing and frequency offsets that prevent the estimation of sensing parameters and, in turn, the use of standard signal processing solutions. Existing approaches cannot be applied to commonly used phased-array receivers, as they build on stringent assumptions about the multipath environment, and are computationally complex. We present JUMP, the first system enabling practical bistatic and asynchronous joint communication and sensing, while achieving accurate target tracking and micro-Doppler extraction in realistic conditions. Our system compensates for the timing offset by exploiting the channel correlation across subsequent packets. Further, it tracks multipath reflections and eliminates frequency offsets by observing the phase of a dynamically-selected static reference path. JUMP has been implemented on a 60 GHz experimental platform, performing extensive evaluations of human motion sensing, including non-line-of-sight scenarios. In our results, JUMP attains comparable tracking performance to a full-duplex monostatic system and similar micro-Doppler quality with respect to a phase-locked bistatic receiver.}

	abstract = {With the increasing number of wireless devices connecting to networks and sharing spectrum resources, interference has become a major obstacle to improving network performance. Existing interference management (IM) methods treat interference as a negative factor and focus on suppressing or eliminating its impact on the transmission of intended signals. However, this often comes at the cost of consuming communication resources and degrading desired transmission performance. Therefore, the design of a cost-effective IM method that “exploits” interference is important. To achieve this goal, we propose Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Interference Exploitation (IRS-IE) to realize efficient desired data transmission. IRS-IE leverages the low-cost and adaptive deployment capabilities of IRS to gather and reflect interference towards the interfered receiver (Rx). By appropriately designing the reflection coefficient of IRS, a phase shift is introduced to the incident interference, allowing the reflected interference to interact with its direct counterpart at the interfered Rx. As a result, the interfered Rx can retrieve its desired data from the mixed interference. This way, IRS-IE can make use of the interference to facilitate the desired data transmission. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that IRS-IE significantly improves the spectral efficiency (SE) of the interfered communication pair over the other IM methods.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an efficient and privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm that enables massive edge devices to train machine learning models collaboratively. Although various communication schemes have been proposed to expedite the FL process in resource-limited wireless networks, the unreliable nature of wireless channels was less explored. In this work, we propose a novel FL framework, namely FL with gradient recycling (FL-GR), which recycles the historical gradients of unscheduled and transmission-failure devices to improve the learning performance of FL. To reduce the hardware requirements for implementing FL-GR in the practical network, we develop a memory-friendly FL-GR that is equivalent to FL-GR but requires low memory of the edge server. We then theoretically analyze how the wireless network parameters affect the convergence bound of FL-GR, revealing that minimizing the average square of local gradients’ staleness (AS-GS) helps improve the learning performance. Based on this, we formulate a joint device scheduling, resource allocation and power control optimization problem to minimize the AS-GS for global loss minimization. To solve the problem, we first derive the optimal power control policy for devices and transform the AS-GS minimization problem into a bipartite graph matching problem. Through detailed analysis, we further transform the bipartite matching problem into an equivalent linear program which is convenient to solve. Extensive simulation results on three real-world datasets (i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) verified the efficacy of the proposed methods. Compared to the FL algorithms without gradient recycling, FL-GR is able to achieve higher accuracy and fast convergence speed. In addition, the proposed device scheduling and resource allocation algorithm also outperforms the benchmarks in accuracy and convergence speed.}

	abstract = {This paper considers opportunistic scheduler (OS) design using statistical channel state information (CSI). We apply max-weight schedulers (MWSs) to maximize a utility function of users’ average data rates. MWSs schedule the user with the highest weighted instantaneous data rate every time slot. Existing methods require hundreds of time slots to adjust the MWS’s weights according to the instantaneous CSI before finding the optimal weights that maximize the utility function. In contrast, our MWS design requires few slots for estimating the statistical CSI. Specifically, we formulate a weight optimization problem using the mean and variance of users’ signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to construct constraints bounding users’ feasible average rates. Here, the utility function is the formulated objective, and the MWS’s weights are optimization variables. We develop an iterative solver for the problem and prove that it finds the optimal weights. We also design an online architecture where the solver adaptively generates optimal weights for networks with varying mean and variance of the SNRs. Simulations show that our methods effectively require 4~10 times fewer slots to find the optimal weights and achieve 5\\sim 15\\%\nbetter average rates than the existing methods.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an over-the-air (OTA)-based approach for distributed matrix-vector multiplications in the context of distributed machine learning (DML). Thanks to OTA computation, the column-wise partitioning of a large matrix enables efficient workload distribution among workers (i.e., local computing nodes) based on their computing capabilities. In addition, without requiring additional bandwidth, it allows the system to remain scalable even as the number of workers increases to mitigate the impact of slow workers, known as stragglers. However, despite the improvements, there are still instances where some workers experience deep fading and become stragglers, preventing them from transmitting their results. By analyzing the mean squared error (MSE), we demonstrate that incorporating more workers in the OTA-based approach leads to MSE reduction without the need for additional radio resources. Furthermore, we introduce an analog coding scheme to further enhance the performance and compare it with conventional coded multiplication (CM) schemes. Through simulations, it is shown that the OTA-based approach achieves comparable performance to CM schemes while potentially requiring fewer radio resources.}

	abstract = {The integration of a near-space information network (NSIN) with the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned to significantly enhance the communication performance of future wireless communication systems by proactively altering wireless channels. This paper investigates the problem of deploying a RIS-integrated NSIN to provide energy-efficient, ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) services. We mathematically formulate this problem as a resource optimization problem, aiming to maximize the effective throughput and minimize the system power consumption, subject to URLLC and physical resource constraints. The formulated problem is challenging in terms of accurate channel estimation, RIS phase alignment, and effective solution design. We propose a joint resource allocation algorithm to handle these challenges. In this algorithm, we develop an accurate channel estimation approach by exploring message passing and optimize phase shifts of RIS reflecting elements to further increase the channel gain. Besides, we derive an analysis-friendly expression of decoding error probability and decompose the problem into two-layered optimization problems by analyzing the monotonicity, which makes the formulated problem analytically tractable. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve outstanding channel estimation performance and is more energy-efficient than diverse benchmark algorithms.}

In this paper, we investigate a UAV-RIS-assisted maritime communication system under a malicious jammer, where a UAV-RIS is deployed to jointly adjust its placement and RIS surface elements to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) and guarantee quality of service requirements against jamming attacks. In addition, an adaptive energy harvesting scheme is developed for information transmission (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) simultaneously to enhance the endurance of the UAV by deploying different IT times for each RIS element. Considering the non-convex optimization problem and highly complex maritime environments, an intelligent resource management approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to jointly optimize the base station’s transmit power, placement of UAV-RIS, and RISs reflecting beamforming. Furthermore, hindsight experience replay is adopted to improve the learning efficiency and performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the better EE and EH performances under different real-world settings compared with existing popular approaches.}

	abstract = {Wireless sensing is a promising technology for future wireless communication networks to realize various application services. Wireless local area network (WLAN)-based localization approaches using channel state information (CSI) have been investigated intensively. Further improvements of detection performance will depend on selecting appropriate feature information and determining the placements of distributed antenna elements. This paper presents a proposal of an enhanced device-free WLAN-based localization scheme with beam-tracing-based antenna placement optimization and spatially localized regression, where beam-forming weights (BFWs) are used as feature information for training machine-learning (ML)-based models localized to partitioned areas. By this scheme, the antenna placement at the access point (AP) is determined by solving a combinational optimization problem with beam-tracing between AP and station (STA) without knowledge of the CSI. Additionally, we propose the use of localized regression to improve localization accuracy with low complexity, where classification and regression-based ML models are used for coarse and precise estimations of the target position. We evaluate the proposed scheme effects on localization performance in an indoor environment. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed antenna placement and localized regression scheme improve the localization accuracy while reducing the necessary complexity for both off-line training and on-line localization relative to other reference schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the multiuser downlink transmission in the presence of practical hardware impairments (HWI), including the HWI at the transceivers and the phase noise at the active RIS. The active RIS is deployed to amplify the incident signals to alleviate the multiplicative channel effect in conventional nearly passive RIS-aided wireless systems. We aim to maximize the sum rate through jointly designing the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS), the amplification factors and the phase shifts at the active RIS. To tackle this challenging optimization problem effectively, we decouple it into two tractable subproblems. Subsequently, each subproblem is transformed into a second order cone programming problem. The block coordinate descent framework is applied to tackle them, where the transmit beamforming and the reflection coefficients are alternately designed. In addition, another efficient algorithm is presented to reduce the computational complexity. Specifically, by exploiting the majorization-minimization method, each subproblem is reformulated into a tractable surrogate problem, whose closed-form solutions are obtained by Lagrange’s dual decomposition approach and the element-wise alternating sequential optimization method. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the developed algorithms, and reveal that the HWI significantly limit the system performance of active RIS-empowered wireless communications. Furthermore, an active RIS noticeably boosts the sum rate under the same total power budget as a nearly passive RIS.}

	abstract = {Inter-carrier interference (ICI) and noise mitigation is crucial for precise signal detection in underwater acoustic (UWA) differential orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DOFDM) communication systems. In this paper, we adopt the Transformer to design a detector, referred to as the TransDetector, which can dramatically mitigate ICI implicitly and noise explicitly, even without requiring any pilot. Compared with the standard Transformer, we come up with three creative designs. Firstly, we break the inner-encoder computation paradigm of the multi-head attention (MHA) in the standard Transformer, and design a brand new inter-encoder attention mechanism, referred to as the interactive MHA, which can significantly improve the performance, as well as accelerate the convergence rate. Secondly, to reduce the noise component attached to the received signal, we design an auto-perception denoising structure, which allows the network to learn the noise distribution in received signals. Thirdly, to better match the characteristics of DOFDM signals and selectively focus on the data at specified locations, we propose a trapezoidal positional encoding (PE), instead of adopting the original sine-cosine PE in the Transformer. The performance verification results across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and Doppler shifts exhibit that, the TransDetector outperforms the classical \\chi -FFT algorithms and the DNNDetector in both the the simulation channels and the realistic underwater channels. For example, based on the simulation channel, the bit error rate (BER) achieved by the TransDetector is reduced by 31.22% and 5.01% when \\text {SNR}=0 dB and by 48.21% and 42.01% when \\text {SNR}=20 dB against the PS-FFT and the DNNDetector, respectively, while the reduction increases from 8.01% and 9.88% to 44.22% and 18.23%, when the Doppler factor goes from 1 \\times 10^{-4} to 3 \\times 10^{-4} .}

This paper introduces the ASTARS to assist non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communications, where the paring users are uniformly distributed within the service area. We design the independent reflection/transmission phase-shift controllers of ASTARS to align the phases of cascaded channels at pairing users. We derive new approximate and asymptotic expressions of the outage probability and ergodic data rate for ASTARS-NOMA networks in the presence of perfect/imperfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC/ipSIC). The diversity orders and multiplexing gains for ASTARS-NOMA are derived to provide more insights. Furthermore, the system throughputs of ASTARS-NOMA are investigated in both delay-tolerant and delay-limited transmission modes. The numerical results are presented and show that: 1) ASTARS-NOMA with pSIC outperforms ASTARS assisted-orthogonal multiple access (ASTARS-OMA) in terms of outage probability and ergodic data rate; 2) The outage probability of ASTARS-NOMA with pSIC/ipSIC can be further reduced within a certain range by increasing the power amplification factors; and 3) The system throughputs of ASTARS-NOMA are superior to that of ASTARS-OMA in both delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes.}

	abstract = {The vision of pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) services can be realized by training an AI model on time using real-time data collected by internet of things (IoT) devices. To this end, IoT devices require offloading their data to an edge server in proximity. However, transmitting high-dimensional and voluminous data from energy-constrained IoT devices poses a significant challenge. To address this limitation, we propose a novel offloading architecture, called joint data deepening-and-prefetching (JD2P), which is feature-by-feature offloading comprising two key techniques. The first one is data deepening, where each data sample’s features are sequentially offloaded in the order of importance determined by the data embedding technique such as principle component analysis (PCA). Offloading is terminated once the already transmitted features are sufficient for accurate data classification, resulting in a reduction in the amount of transmitted data. The criteria to offload data are derived for binary and multi-class classifiers, which are designed based on support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN), respectively. The second one is data prefetching, where some features potentially required in the future are offloaded in advance, thus achieving high efficiency via precise prediction and parameter optimization. We evaluate the effectiveness of JD2P through experiments using the MNIST dataset, and the results demonstrate its significant reduction in expected energy consumption compared to several benchmarks without degrading learning accuracy.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the constructive interference (CI) precoding problem under per-antenna power constraint (PAPC) in the downlink of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. In this setup, we extend the phase rotation metric and symbol scaling metric of CI precoding under sum power constraint (SPC) to the scenario of PAPC. Against SPC, the scenario of PAPC represents a practical constraint acknowledging that each antenna would have its dedicated power amplifier. Nevertheless, the optimization problem of CI-PAPC precoding becomes more challenging than that under SPC. By analyzing the KKT conditions and leveraging the generalized matrix inverse theory, we obtain a closed-form structure of the CI-PAPC precoder as a function of introduced variables, which facilitates a low-complexity solver. Since the power constraint of each antenna is not always active under PAPC, existing iterative schemes under CI-SPC are no longer applicable. Therefore, the primal-dual interior point method (IPM) is employed to solve the simplified problem with reduced complexity and fast convergence. Simulation results verify our mathematical derivations and demonstrate that our proposed method can reduce the complexity of solving CI-PAPC problem while preserving the error-rate performance, which promotes the practical implementation of CI precoding in real PAPC scenarios.}

In this paper, a novel adaptive coded probabilistic shaping (PS)-based nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is proposed to improve spectral efficiency (SE) of VLC systems in multiuser uplink communication scenarios. The proposed scheme adapts its rate to the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) by utilizing non-uniformly distributed discrete constellation symbols and low complexity channel encoder. Furthermore, an alternate optimization algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal channel coding rate, constellation spacing, and probability mass function (PMF) of each user. The extensive numerical results show that the proposed PS-based NOMA scheme closely approaches the capacity of NOMA with fine granularity. Presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in improving the SE of VLC systems in multiuser scenarios. For instance, our scheme exhibits substantial SE gains over existing schemes, namely, the pairwise coded modulation (PCM), geometric shaping (GS), and uniform-distribution schemes.

	abstract = {Recently, beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has been proposed to generalize conventional RIS. BD-RIS has a scattering matrix that is not restricted to being diagonal and thus brings a performance improvement over conventional RIS. While different BD-RIS architectures have been proposed, it still remains an open problem to develop a systematic approach to design BD-RIS architectures achieving the optimal trade-off between performance and circuit complexity. In this work, we propose novel modeling, architecture design, and optimization for BD-RIS based on graph theory. This graph theoretical modeling allows us to develop two new efficient BD-RIS architectures, denoted as tree-connected and forest-connected RIS. Tree-connected RIS, whose corresponding graph is a tree, is proven to be the least complex BD-RIS architecture able to achieve the performance upper bound in multiple-input singleoutput (MISO) systems. Besides, forest-connected RIS allows us to strike a balance between performance and complexity, further decreasing the complexity over tree-connected RIS. To optimize tree-connected RIS, we derive a closed-form global optimal solution, while forest-connected RIS is optimized through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Numerical results confirm that tree-connected (resp. forest-connected) RIS achieves the same performance as fully-connected (resp. group-connected) RIS, while reducing the complexity by up to 16.4 times.}

	abstract = {In multi-user multi-antenna communications, it is well-known in theory that Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) can achieve a higher spectral efficiency than both Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). However, an experimental evaluation of RSMA’s performance, relative to SDMA and NOMA, is missing in the literature, which is essential to address the ongoing debate between RSMA, SDMA and NOMA over which is better suited to handle most efficiently the available resources and interference in 6G. In this paper, we address this critical knowledge gap by realizing the first-ever RSMA prototype using software-defined radios. Through measurements using our prototype, we empirically solve the modulation and coding scheme-limited sum throughput maximization problem for RSMA, SDMA and NOMA for the two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenario over 1) different pairs of line-of-sight channels that vary in terms of their relative pathloss and spatial correlation, and with 2) different channel state information quality. We observe that RSMA achieves the highest sum throughput across all these cases, whereas SDMA and NOMA are effective only in some cases. Furthermore, RSMA also achieves better fairness at a higher sum throughput than both SDMA and NOMA. These empirical results are consistent with theoretical predictions.}

	abstract = {In a wireless system involving a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), the wireless channel is a linear input-output relation that depends non-linearly on the RIS configuration: in particular, physics-compliant models involve the inversion of an “interaction” matrix. In this paper, we identify two independent origins of this structural non-linearity: 1) proximity-induced mutual coupling between close-by RIS elements; and 2) reverberation-induced long-range coupling between all RIS elements arising from multi-path propagation in complex radio environments. Mathematically, we cast the “interaction” matrix inversion as the sum of an infinite Born series [for 1)] or Born-like series [for 2)] whose Kth term physically represents paths involving K bounces between the RIS elements [for 1)] or wireless entities [for 2)]. We identify the key physical parameters that determine whether these series can be truncated after the first and second term, respectively, as tacitly done in common cascaded models of RIS-parametrized wireless channels. We also quantify the non-linearity of a channel’s RIS parametrization in diverse numerical and experimental radio environments ranging from an anechoic (echo-free) chamber to rich-scattering reverberation chambers to corroborate our analysis. Our findings raise doubts about the reliability of existing performance analyses and channel-estimation protocols for cases in which cascaded models poorly describe the physical reality.}

	abstract = {Most wireless communication systems operate in the far-field region of antennas and antenna arrays, where waves are planar and beams have infinite depth. When antenna arrays become electrically large, it is possible that the receiver is in the radiative near-field of the transmitter, and vice versa. Recent works have shown that near-field beamforming exhibits a finite depth, which enables a new depth-based spatial multiplexing paradigm. In this paper, we explore how the shape and size of an array determine the near-field beam behaviors. In particular, we investigate the 3 dB beam depth (BD), defined as the range of distances where the gain is greater than half of the peak gain. We derive analytical gain and BD expressions and prove how they depend on the aperture area and length. For non-broadside transmissions, we find that the BD increases as the transmitter approaches the end-fire direction of the array. Furthermore, it is sufficient to characterize the BD for a broadside transmitter, as the beam pattern with a non-broadside transmitter can be approximated by that of a smaller/projected array with a broadside transmitter. Our analysis demonstrates that the BD can be ordered from smallest to largest as ULA, circular, and square arrays.}

	abstract = {Location information is often used as a proxy to guarantee the performance of a wireless communication link. However, localization errors can result in a significant mismatch with the guarantees, particularly detrimental to users operating the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) regime. This paper unveils the fundamental statistical relations between location estimation uncertainty and wireless link reliability, specifically in the context of rate selection for ultra-reliable communication. We start with a simple one-dimensional narrowband Rayleigh fading scenario and build towards a two-dimensional scenario in a rich scattering environment. The wireless link reliability is characterized by the meta-probability, the probability with respect to localization error of exceeding the outage capacity, and by removing other sources of errors in the system, we show that reliability is sensitive to localization errors. The \\epsilon -outage coherence radius is defined and shown to provide valuable insight into the problem of location-based rate selection. However, it is generally challenging to guarantee reliability without accurate knowledge of the propagation environment. Finally, several rate-selection schemes are proposed, showcasing the problem’s dynamics and revealing that properly accounting for the localization error is critical to ensure good performance in terms of reliability and achievable throughput.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a widely embraced paradigm for distilling artificial intelligence from distributed mobile data. However, the deployment of FL in mobile networks can be compromised by exposure to interference from neighboring cells or jammers. Existing interference mitigation techniques require multi-cell cooperation or at least interference channel state information, which is expensive in practice. On the other hand, power control that treats interference as noise may not be effective due to limited power budgets, and also that this mechanism can trigger countermeasures by interference sources. As a practical approach for protecting FL against interference, we propose Spectrum Breathing, which cascades stochastic-gradient pruning and spread spectrum to suppress interference without bandwidth expansion. The cost is higher learning latency by exploiting the graceful degradation of learning speed due to pruning. We synchronize the two operations such that their levels are controlled by the same parameter, Breathing Depth. To optimally control the parameter, we develop a martingale-based approach to convergence analysis of Over-the-Air FL with spectrum breathing, termed AirBreathing FL. We show a performance tradeoff between gradient-pruning and interference-induced error as regulated by the breathing depth. Given receive SIR and model size, the optimization of the tradeoff yields two schemes for controlling the breathing depth that can be either fixed or adaptive to channels and the learning process. As shown by experiments, in scenarios where traditional Over-the-Air FL fails to converge in the presence of strong interference, AirBreahing FL with either fixed or adaptive breathing depth can ensure convergence where the adaptive scheme achieves close-to-ideal performance.}

	abstract = {The recently-developed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is capable of transforming the time-varying fading of the time-frequency (TF) domain into the time-invariant fading representations of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The OTFS system using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) as inner core naturally requires the subcarrier spacing (SCS) \\Delta f to be larger than the maximum Doppler frequency \\vartheta _{\\text {max}} , i.e. \\Delta f > \\vartheta _{\\text {max}} , when perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge is assumed. However, for the first time in literature, we explicitly demonstrate that the practical OFDM-based OTFS systems have to double their SCS in order to facilitate CSI estimation, requiring \\Delta f'=2\\Delta f > 2\\vartheta _{\\text {max}} . In order to mitigate this loss, we propose a novel noncoherent OTFS system, which is capable of operating at \\Delta f > \\vartheta _{\\text {max}} . The major challenge in this context is the mitigation of the DD-domain interference without CSI. Against this background, we draw an analogy between the input-output model of OTFS and that of V-BLAST, where V-BLAST’s blind inter-antenna interference mitigation technique is invoked. Moreover, we propose to partition the DD-domain modulated symbols into groups, where space-time block coding is invoked in order to eliminate the DD-domain interference within each group. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed noncoherent OTFS is capable of substantially outperforming its coherent counterparts relying on CSI estimation.}

However, how to efficiently schedule multi-satellite beam resources to satisfy the heterogeneous and uneven terrestrial traffic demands remains a huge challenge for satellite operators. This paper proposes a satellite-terrestrial coordinated multi-satellite BH scheduling framework, where the complex multi-satellite BH problem is formulated into a long-term and a short-term subproblems. The long-term subproblem is cell-satellite association problem, which is solved by a low-complexity iterative algorithm executed in network operation control center (NOCC) to minimize the traffic load gap among satellites while considering the interference avoidance. The short-term subproblem is multi-satellite traffic-driven BH problem and we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) architecture where each satellite can cooperatively make real-time BH decisions using the well-trained model by QMIX algorithm to adapt to time-varying and heterogeneous traffic. Simulation results demonstrate that the traffic load gap and network delay have been reduced by 70% and 50% respectively compared with non-load-balancing scheme. Besides, the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of the network throughput under various traffic load cases and the average network delay is kept within 4 ms. Furthermore, the proposed QMIX-BH can be applied to real-time scheduling since the execution time is less than 1 ms.}

In this paper, we discuss the potential of constructive interference (CI)-based symbol-level precoding (CI-SLP) in PR-MIMO communication systems. The joint design problem that optimizes the SLP strategy and the radiation pattern of PR-MIMO for phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation is formulated to maximize the worst serviced user’s communication quality. Since the optimization variables are softly-coupled, we employ the alternating optimization framework to decompose the joint design problem into the SLP design sub-problem and the pattern design sub-problem. We simplify the pattern design sub-problem and propose an interior-point algorithm, where a sequential optimization-based scheme is further proposed as a sub-optimal solution with low complexity. Furthermore, the discussion is extended to quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulated systems, where a special stopping criterion is proposed to guarantee the performance gain of the proposed scheme. The practical realization of the designed reconfigurable antenna array is also discussed, where we propose a design scheme using programmable metasurface antennas based on time-division switching to enable quick and adaptive pattern reconfiguration. Numerical results demonstrate that the radiation pattern configurability can further enhance the benefit of SLP over conventional precoding approaches.}

We investigate the potential gain of the cascaded LoS MIMO system achieved by the optimization of the array orientations, especially when the Tx and the Rx are in the near-field of the IRS. Under a recently established near-field channel model, we formulate the problem of maximizing the input-output mutual information (MI) of the cascaded LoS MIMO system over active and passive beamforming as well as Tx and Rx array orientations. We give analytical solutions to the problem under asymptotic conditions, such as in the high/low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime or with sufficiently large Tx-IRS and IRS-Rx distances.

To address this issue, we consider to use a data-carrying reference signal (DC-RS) that can simultaneously estimate channel coefficients and transmit data symbols. Here, symbols on the Grassmann manifold are exploited to carry additional data and to assist in channel estimation. Unlike conventional studies, we analyze the channel estimation errors induced by DC-RS and propose an optimization method that improves the channel estimation accuracy without performance penalty. Then, we derive the achievable rate of noncoherent Grassmann constellation assuming discrete inputs in multi-antenna scenarios, as well as that of coherent signaling assuming channel estimation errors modeled by the Gauss-Markov uncertainty. These derivations enable performance evaluation when introducing DC-RS, and suggest excellent potential for boosting spectral efficiency, where interesting crossings with the non-data carrying RS occurred at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication has been identified as a core technology for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks. Recently, task-oriented semantic communications have been proposed for low-latency inference with limited bandwidth. Although transmitting only task-related information does protect a certain level of user privacy, adversaries could apply model inversion techniques to reconstruct the raw data or extract useful information, thereby infringing on users’ privacy. To mitigate privacy infringement, this paper proposes an information bottleneck and adversarial learning (IBAL) approach to protect users’ privacy against model inversion attacks. Specifically, we extract task-relevant features from the input based on the information bottleneck (IB) theory. To overcome the difficulty in calculating the mutual information in high-dimensional space, we derive a variational upper bound to estimate the true mutual information. To prevent data reconstruction from task-related features by adversaries, we leverage adversarial learning to train encoder to fool adversaries by maximizing reconstruction distortion. Furthermore, considering the impact of channel variations on privacy-utility trade-off and the difficulty in manually tuning the weights of each loss, we propose an adaptive weight adjustment method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively protect privacy without significantly affecting task performance and achieve better privacy-utility trade-offs than baseline methods.}

	abstract = {The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing spectral efficiency and massive connectivity in future wireless networks. This paper proposes a GF-NOMA communication network enabled by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RIS). In the proposed GF-NOMA, all user equipments (UEs) have instantaneous access to resource blocks (RBs) without the need for grant acquisition and power control as in the traditional grant-based NOMA schemes. Specifically, we have considered two regimes of interest: 1) the max-min fair (MMF) regime and 2) the max-sum throughput (MST) regime. To achieve the required power disparity, a two-level power control mechanism is proposed; initially, the UEs are clustered according to their channel gains. Additionally, we introduce a multi-level GF-NOMA (MGF-NOMA) scheme that adjusts the transmit power levels for each UE in the cluster. The second level of power disparity is achieved through the assignment of STAR-RISs to the clusters and optimal partitioning of STAR-RIS to support each of the cluster members. Furthermore, we have also derived the closed-form equations for the optimal partitioning of STAR-RIS within the clusters for both regimes of interest. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed STAR-RIS-aided MGF-NOMA yields a gain of 60% and 20% in the MST regime with active and passive RIS realization, respectively. Furthermore, the active and passive RIS-based MGF-NOMA achieve nearly the equivalent fairness that can be obtained through optimal power control in the MMF regime. The finding emphasizes the potential of integrating STAR-RIS with GF-NOMA as a robust and promising solution for future wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) is a communication technology that can control the phase shift and reflection of the incoming signal towards the destination, achieving high spectral efficiency at a low hardware cost. However, the IRS-assisted wireless networks pose fundamental challenges on statistical channel modeling. Communication assisted by the IRS takes the form of a mixture channel, composed of a direct link and cascaded link aided by the IRS, which is often intractable to analyze, requires advanced functions, such as Meijer’s G or Fox’s H functions, to describe, and only applies to a certain operating frequency or network environment. These limitations motivate the development of a tractable and highly accurate channel model for IRS-assisted wireless networks, but versatile enough to be applied to any frequency band and communication scenario given proper parameterization. To this end, we utilize the mixture Gamma distributions to model IRS-assisted communication and derive distributions of the mixture channel for both multiplicability and quadratic form. The system performance of the IRS-assisted wireless network is analyzed using stochastic geometry, and the approximation accuracy of the proposed channel model is validated through extensive numerical simulation. These results indicate that the mixture Gamma distribution-based approximation can greatly facilitate the modeling and analysis in IRS-assisted networks with high accuracy.}

	abstract = {The low-resolution reality of the hardware elements associated with massive mmWave antenna or reflector arrays is associated with the performance degradation of the wireless link when it is not properly controlled. In particular, the unintended angular radiations of the transmission or reflection arrays (e.g., transmission in non-intended directions) would invalidate the usual assumptions of information secrecy, even with perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge at the transmitter, in the presence of low-resolution hardware. In this paper, we study a hybrid beamforming design for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink (DL) communication, from the prospect of information secrecy maximization, wherein the array element phase rotations belong to the known discrete space. To address the NP-hard and non-convex nature of the problem at hand, we propose an iterative procedure by re-structuring the obtained discrete-domain problem into a tractable form which solves the problem numerically and guarantees the convergence to a stationary point. Further, we confirm the accuracy of the proposed optimization algorithm by an exhaustive search method based on graphical simulations. The minimal performance disparity that exists between the proposed algorithm and the considered digital beamforming (DBF) scheme as the upper bound validates the hybrid beamforming design. Moreover, the proposed work highlights the superiority of discrete-aware design over various existing baseline schemes, demonstrating the significant gains attainable by adopting discrete space design from the outset. Additionally, the proposed solution discusses the improvement in secrecy system performance by deploying RIS with an increased number of reflecting elements and thereby restricting the effect of eavesdroppers on secure communication.}

	abstract = {Although deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a 6G enabler by minimizing irrelevant information transmission – minimizing power usage, bandwidth consumption, and transmission delay, its benefits can be limited by radio frequency interference (RFI) that causes substantial semantic noise. Such semantic noise’s impact can be alleviated using an interference-resistant and robust (IR2) SemCom design, though no such design exists yet. To stimulate fundamental research on IR2 SemCom, the performance limits of a popular text SemCom system named DeepSC are studied in the presence of (multi-interferer) RFI. By introducing a principled probabilistic framework for SemCom, we show that DeepSC produces semantically irrelevant sentences as the power of (multi-interferer) RFI gets very large. We also derive DeepSC’s practical limits and a lower bound on its outage probability under multi-interferer RFI, and propose a (generic) lifelong DL-based IR2 SemCom system. We corroborate the derived limits with simulations and computer experiments, which also affirm the vulnerability of DeepSC to a wireless attack using RFI.}

We propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on OTFS modulation. We begin by deriving new sensing and communication signal models for the proposed MIMO-OTFS ISAC system that explicitly capture inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) effects. We then develop a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based multi-target detection and delay-Doppler-angle estimation algorithm for MIMO-OTFS radar sensing that can simultaneously mitigate and exploit ISI/ICI effects, to prevent target masking and surpass standard unambiguous detection limits in range/velocity. Moreover, considering two operational modes (discovery/track), we propose an adaptive MIMO-OTFS ISAC transmission strategy. For the discovery mode, we introduce the concept of delay-Doppler (DD) multiplexing, enabling omnidirectional probing of the environment and large virtual array at the OTFS radar receiver. For the track mode, we pursue a directional transmission approach and design an OTFS ISAC optimization algorithm in spatial and DD domains, seeking the optimal trade-off between radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed sensing algorithm and reveal valuable insights into OTFS ISAC trade-offs under varying communication channel characteristics.}

The proposed solution offers a reduced computational complexity, mainly by a factor of the number of subcarriers, while guaranteeing accurate channel estimation as compared to state-of-the-art techniques. By exploiting the orthogonality property of the OFDM modulation, covariance matrix and noise subspace are estimated for each subcarrier in a parallel scheme, then a global cost function is minimized to obtain channel coefficients estimates. Besides, conditions for channel identifiability as well as the minimum number of subcarriers to be used for the uniqueness of the solution are investigated with various numerical simulations to corroborate our analysis.}

	abstract = {For reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communications, the phase hopping scheme forces the wireless channel to experience multiple channel conditions and thus improves the system reliability. In this paper, we propose a phase hopping based RIS-aided downlink non-orthogonal multiple access system. For the proposed system, we study the outage balancing problem, where the closed-form expression of ergodic capacity, an increasing function with respect to the variance of overall channels, is theoretically derived. One challenge to solve the outage balancing problem is to obtain the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the variance of overall channels. For Rayleigh fading channels, the CDF is obtained using the characteristic function of the product of channel gains and the inverse theorem. For Rician fading channels, we approximate the variance of overall channels as a Gamma distributed random variable. The outage balancing problem is solved by a bisection search. To show the advantages to the phase hopping scheme, we also solve the outage balancing problem for a static random phases based system. Simulation results show that at moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio, the proposed phase hopping based system is superior to the static random phases based one.}

	abstract = {Spectrum sensing and communication security are of crucial importance in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this paper, we utilize intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to simultaneously enhance spectrum sensing accuracy and the secrecy performance of secondary users (SUs) through physical layer security (PLS) techniques. Additionally, we employ IRS as a novel approach to achieve the target probability of detection. We formulate a joint sensing and transmission security optimization problem to maximize the sum secrecy rate of SUs under both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). To transform the probability of detection into a tractable expression, we adopt a safe approximation for the Q -function. We use a computationally-efficient block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm to optimize the beamforming design and IRS phase shifts alternately. Specifically, we employ the {\\mathcal{S}} -procedure to handle the semi-infinite constraints under the imperfect CSI case. Simulation results demonstrate that by leveraging IRS for spectrum sensing, we can significantly reduce the sensing time while achieving the required probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. Furthermore, our proposed scheme improves both sensing accuracy and secrecy rate in both cases compared to the benchmark schemes.}

To achieve accurate and efficient AMR, this paper proposes a data augmentation method for AMR, which can increase the amount of data by seven times and solve the problem of a small sample size more effectively than the existing methods. In addition, this paper proposes a concept of microscale, rationalizes the underwater acoustic signal into time series, and proposes a temporal feature extractor named One2Three block, which can extract temporal features of signals from three microscales. Finally, a spatial feature extractor named the Dual-Stream squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block is designed to abstract and synthesize more advanced spatial features for AMR. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method is verified with eight commonly used modulation modes in underwater acoustic communications on the datasets collected in the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a recognition accuracy of 99% with a lower time and space complexity, and has high robustness to noisy data.}

Specifically, the algorithm super-resolves the SCs in the delay-angle-of-arrival domain and estimates the parameters of a parametric model of the delay-angle power spectrum characterizing the DC. Channel noise is also estimated. In essence, the algorithm solves the problem of estimating spectral lines (the SCs) in colored noise (generated by the DC and channel noise). Its design is inspired by the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. As a result the iteration process contains a threshold condition that determines whether a candidate SC shall be retained or pruned. By relying on results from extreme-value analysis the threshold of this condition is suitably adapted to ensure a prescribed probability of detecting spurious SCs. Studies using synthetic and real channel measurement data demonstrate the virtues of the algorithm: it is able to still detect and accurately estimate SCs, even when their separation in delay and angle is down to half the Rayleigh resolution limit (RRL) of the equipment; it is robust in the sense that it tends to return no more SCs than the actual ones. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated to outperform a state-of-the-art super-resolution channel estimator in terms of robustness in the estimation of the amplitudes of specular components closely spaced in the dispersion domain.}

Motivated by the importance of controlling the number of HOs and by the correlation between efficient HO decisions and the temporal evolution of the channel conditions, we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the state space representing the discrete versions of the large-scale fading and the action space representing the association decisions of the user with the access points (APs). We develop a novel algorithm that employs this model to derive a HO policy for a mobile user based on current and future rewards. To alleviate the high complexity of our POMDP, we follow a divide-and-conquer approach by breaking down the POMDP formulation into sub-problems, each solved separately. Then, the policy and the candidate pool of APs for the sub-problem that produced the best total expected reward are used to perform HOs within a specific time horizon. We then introduce modifications to our algorithm to decrease the number of HOs. The results show that half of the number of HOs in the UC-mMIMO networks can be eliminated. Namely, our novel solution can control the number of HOs while maintaining a rate guarantee, where a 47%- 70% reduction of the cumulative number of HOs is observed in networks with a density of 125 APs per {\\mathrm{ km}}^{2}\n. Most importantly, our results show that a POMDP-based HO scheme is promising to control HOs.}

	abstract = {User-centric cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO), where only partial access points (APs) are selected to serve a specific user equipment (UE), is a scalable extension of CFmMIMO. Existing works have studied the spectral efficiency of large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) aided user-centric CFmMIMO that includes local combining at each AP and statistical channel state information (S-CSI) based fusion in the central processing unit (CPU). However, few efforts have so far been paid to analyze the error probability bound, and existing detectors fail to balance the error probability and fusion complexity. In this paper, we analyze the symbol error rate (SER) and design low-complexity near-optimal detectors for uplink user-centric CFmMIMO systems. Considering non-identical large-scale fading coefficients and local channel estimation errors, we first leverage the pairwise error probability to derive an SER upper bound for optimal linear fusion (OLF) in the CPU, which is suitable to different local combining methods at the APs. Then, by combining local normalization methods and S-CSI based UE grouping or error correction, we design improved detectors for local maximum-ratio and local minimum mean squared error combining successively. Simulation results verify the correctness of the derived SER bound, and show that the proposed detectors are capable of approaching the SER performance of conventional OLF based counterparts with reduced fusion complexity even in scenarios with pilot contamination.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided systems is crucial for optimal configuration of the RIS and various downstream tasks such as user localization. In RIS-aided systems, channel estimation involves estimating two channels for the user-RIS (UE-RIS) and RIS-base station (RIS-BS) links. In the literature, two approaches are proposed: (i) cascaded channel estimation where the two channels are collapsed into a single one and estimated using training signals at the BS, and (ii) separate channel estimation that estimates each channel separately either in a passive or semi-passive RIS setting. In this work, we study the separate channel estimation problem in a fully passive RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) single-user single-input multiple-output (SIMO) communication system. First, we adopt a variational-inference (VI) approach to jointly estimate the UE-RIS and RIS-BS instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI). In particular, auxiliary posterior distributions of the I-CSI are learned through the maximization of the evidence lower bound. However, estimating the I-CSI for both links in every coherence block results in a high signaling overhead to control the RIS in scenarios with highly mobile users. Thus, we extend our first approach to estimate the slow-varying statistical CSI of the UE-RIS link overcoming the highly variant I-CSI. Precisely, our second method estimates the I-CSI of RIS-BS channel and the UE-RIS channel covariance matrix (CCM) directly from the uplink training signals in a fully passive RIS-aided system. The simulation results demonstrate that using maximum a posteriori channel estimation using the auxiliary posteriors can provide a capacity that approaches the capacity with perfect CSI. Leveraging the UE-RIS CCM enhances spectral efficiency by minimizing the training overhead required to control the RIS, and exploiting its low-rank structure reduces training overhead compared to the maximum likelihood estimator.}

	abstract = {Considering the dimensionality of a typical reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), channel state information acquisition in RIS-assisted systems requires lengthy pilot transmissions. Moreover, the large aperture of the RIS may cause transmitters/receivers to fall in its near-field region, where both distance and angles affect the channel structure. This paper proposes a parametric maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework for jointly estimating the direct channel between the user and the base station (BS) and the line-of-sight channel between the user and the RIS, in both far-field and near-field scenarios. The MLE framework is first developed for the case of single-antenna BS and later extended to the scenario where the BS is equipped with multiple antennas. A novel adaptive RIS configuration strategy is proposed to select the RIS configuration for the next pilot to actively refine the estimate. We design a minimal-sized codebook of orthogonal RIS configurations to choose from during pilot transmission with a dimension much smaller than the number of RIS elements. To further reduce the required number of pilots, we propose an initialization strategy with two wide beams. We demonstrate numerically that the proposed MLE method needs only a few pilots for achieving accurate channel estimates and further show that the presented framework performs well under Rician fading. We also showcase efficient user channel tracking in near-field and far-field scenarios.}

The proposed IS-SNOMA is able to mitigate the inter-user interference in the non-orthogonal transmission for multiple semantic-oriented users (SU) or the coexistence of SUs and bit-oriented users (BU). 1) for the homogeneous transmission of semantic streams, we propose a pair of novel semantic difference (SeD) aware IS-SNOMA transceivers to accommodate multiple SUs over the same resource block. A novel SeD-aware superposition coding (SeDSC) technique and SeD-aware successive interference cancellation (SeDSIC) technique are specially designed to mitigate the semantic-level interference; and 2) for the heterogeneous transmission of semantic-bit streams, we develop a pair of syntactic difference (SyD) aware IS-SNOMA transceivers to multiplex channels for SUs and BUs. The heterogeneous semantic symbols and bit sequences are superposed and separated with the proposed SyD-aware SC technique (SyDSC) and SyD-aware SIC technique (SyDSIC), respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed frameworks in improving the communication efficiency of both SUs and BUs, compared with OMA and NOMA-aided transmission benchmarks.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided multi-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with stochastic geometry methods. Under Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels, we provide two types of approximate channel models to depict RIS channels, i.e., the N-fold convolution model and the curve fitting model. The analysis reveals that the N-fold convolution model is accurate and tractable when ignoring inter-cell interference, while the curve fitting model can evaluate the impact of inter-cell interference with a small error. The N-fold convolution model provides accurate diversity orders compared to other existing approaches such as the central limit model. Based on these channel models, we derive the closed-form analytical and asymptotic expressions of coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for two paired NOMA users. The analytical results demonstrate that: 1) When we ignore inter-cell interference, the diversity order of the typical user is equal to the number of Rayleigh fading channels; and 2) For Nakagami-m fading channels with coefficient m , the diversity order is equal to m times of the channel number. Numerical results show that: 1) RISs are capable of enhancing the coverage performance and ergodic rates of the proposed network; and 2) RISs provide extra flexibility for NOMA decoding orders.}

This paper studies the computation rate maximization problem under task deadline constraints in dynamic SCMA-MEC networks. Specifically, we propose a predictive deep Q-network for SCMA resource allocation and computation offloading (PQ-RACO) algorithm for single-cell scenarios, where IoT devices use long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict the states and actions of other agents. However, the PQ-RACO algorithm is not scalable for increasing numbers of IoT devices. To address this issue, an improved multi-agent deep Q-network for SCMA resource allocation and computation offloading algorithm (MQ-RACO) is proposed for multi-cell scenarios. The algorithm is a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm with explicit rewards, which is tailored to the special structure of joint rewards. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and other benchmark schemes in terms of convergence speed and computation rate.}

	abstract = {Data collection and processing timely is crucial for mobile crowd integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) systems with various applications such as smart home and connected cars, which requires numerous integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) devices to sense the targets and offload the data to the base station (BS) for further processing. However, as the number of ISAC devices grows, there exists intensive interactions among ISAC devices in the processes of data collection and processing since they share the common network resources. In this paper, we consider the environment sensing problem in the large-scale mobile crowd ISCC systems and propose an efficient waveform precoding design algorithm based on the mean field game (MFG). Specifically, to handle the complex interactions among large-scale ISAC devices, we first utilize the MFG method to transform the influence from other ISAC devices into the mean field term and derive the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, which models the evolution of the system state. Then, we derive the cost function based on the mean field term and reformulate the waveform precoding design problem. Next, we utilize the G-prox primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm to solve the reformulated problem and analyze the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can solve the interactions among large-scale ISAC devices effectively in the ISCC process. In addition, compared with other baselines, the proposed waveform precoding design algorithm has advantages in improving communication performance and reducing cost function.}

	abstract = {For the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, in-situ model downloading has emerged as an important use case to enable real-time adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) on edge devices. However, the simultaneous downloading of diverse and high-dimensional models to multiple devices over wireless links presents a significant communication bottleneck. To overcome the bottleneck, we propose the framework of model broadcasting and assembling (MBA), which represents the first attempt on leveraging reusable knowledge, referring to shared parameters among tasks/models, to enable parameter broadcasting to reduce communication overhead or latency. The MBA framework comprises two key components. The first, the MBA protocol, defines the system operations including parameter selection from an AI library, power control for broadcasting, and model assembling at devices. The protocol features the use of Shapley value as a metric for measuring parameters’ reusability. The second component is the joint design of parameter-selection-and-power-control (PS-PC), which provides guarantees on devices’ model performance and aims to minimize the downloading latency. The corresponding optimization problem is simplified by decomposition into the sequential PS and PC sub-problems without compromising its optimality. The PS sub-problem is solved efficiently by designing two efficient algorithms. On one hand, the low-complexity algorithm of greedy parameter selection features the construction of task-oriented candidate model sets and a greedy selection metric for choosing the sets of model blocks for broadcasting, both of which are designed under the criterion of maximum reusable knowledge among tasks. On the other hand, the optimal tree-search algorithm gains its efficiency via the proposed construction of a compact binary tree pruned using model architecture constraints and an intelligent branch-and-bound search on the tree that fathoms nodes via solving a linear program that integer-relaxes the PS sub-problem. Last, given optimal PS, the optimal PC policy is derived in closed form by transforming the PC sub-problem into the conventional problem of energy-efficient transmission. Through extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets, our results demonstrate the substantial reduction in downloading latency achieved by the proposed MBA design compared to traditional unicasting-based model downloading.}

	abstract = {Witnessing its large swaths of success in various fields, digital twins (DTs) are considered a promising scheme for 6th Generation (6G) cellular systems, showing a leading edge in networking and communication modelling. However, another 6G core property of high-precision positioning can hardly be supported by existing 6G DT solutions due to the lack of environmental modelling and signal interactions with physical scenes. This shortcoming yields a series of challenges in 6G DT-enabled positioning, including positioning data acquisition, accuracy enhancement, and continuous optimization. In this regard, we propose a novel paradigm of localization-oriented DT (LocDT) with a compound architecture of 7 sub-DT layers to characterize the 6G integrated-localization-and-communication (ILAC) feature. LocDT starts from a physical environment sublayer to mirror 6G signal interactions within a real-world scenario, along with an ILAC baseband sublayer and a channel frequency Polar-coordinate (CFP) image construction method to provide finer-grained fingerprints. Furthermore, insight from LocDT reveals an interesting phenomenon: the channel features of Line-of-Sight (LoS) / None-Los (NLoS) gNodeBs make differentiated-contributions to positioning accuracy, especially in wide-existing partial-LoS-coverage scenarios. Benefiting from this, a DT-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) positioning model, SSI-Net, is designed with a device-attention mechanism, achieving complementary improvements in accuracy. Evaluation results show LocDT and SSI-Net’s advantages from a position-of-strength in accuracy and time overhead, outperforming state-of-the-art models.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with mixed numerology is a promising technology that blends flexibility and high spectral efficiency. However, since NOMA enables multiplexing of the same time-frequency resources for different users and mixed-numerology allows superimposing sub-signals with different numerologies, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) as well as power fluctuation problem in NOMA detection becomes cumbersome especially when applying PAPR reduction techniques. This study considers minimizing PAPR in mixed numerology NOMA systems using selected-mapping (SLM) method. The Riemann sequence is one of the simplest phase sequence that can be used to generate a set of signal copies for PAPR reduction. Our analysis reveals that as the amplitude variation caused by the Riemann sequence grows, the upper bound of PAPR for signal copies decreases correspondingly. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new maximum-range Riemann (MRR)-based phase sequences, in which the amplitude factor can be adjusted to control the power fluctuations. Compared to previous works, our study delves deeper into the influence of phase sequence design of SLM on PAPR reduction performance. Simulations show that the proposed method offers significant performance advantages of PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) improvement even with consideration of power-amplifier.}

	abstract = {In Mesh Wireless Networks (MWNs), the network coverage is extended by connecting Access Points (APs) in a mesh topology, where transmitting frames by multi-hop routing has to sustain the performances, such as end-to-end (E2E) delay and channel efficiency. Several recent studies have focused on minimizing E2E delay, but these methods are unable to adapt to the dynamic nature of MWNs. Meanwhile, reinforcement-learning-based methods offer better adaptability to dynamics but suffer from the problem of high-dimensional action spaces, leading to slower convergence. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic reinforcement learning (MACRL) algorithm to optimize multiple objectives, specifically the minimization of E2E delay and the enhancement of channel efficiency. First, to reduce the action space and speed up the convergence in the dynamical optimization process, a centralized-critic-distributed-actor scheme is proposed. Then, a multi-objective reward balancing method is designed to dynamically balance the MWNs’ performances between the E2E delay and the channel efficiency. Finally, the trained MACRL algorithm is deployed in the QaulNet simulator to verify its effectiveness.}

To overcome this limitation, we therefore consider the hybrid unicast and multicast messages. In particular, we characterize the optimal DoF region for the two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) with imperfect CSIT and hybrid messages. For the converse, we establish a three-step procedure to exploit the utmost possible relaxation. For the achievability, since the DoF region is with specific three-dimensional structure regarding antenna configurations and CSIT qualities, we verify the existence or non-existence of corner point candidates via the feature of antenna configurations and CSIT qualities categorization, and provide a hybrid message-aware rate-splitting scheme. Besides, we show that to achieve the strictly positive corner points, it is unnecessary to split the unicast messages into private and common parts. This implies adding a multicast message may mitigate the rate-splitting complexity.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework that combines an optimization-based approach with a deep learning (DL)-based approach to devise a cooperative strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in wireless-based secure communications by leveraging the strengths of both approaches and addressing their respective limitations. We first formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable secrecy rate while guaranteeing the minimum harvested energy requirement for each ground node by optimizing scheduling, transmit power, and trajectory. To address the difficulty of solving the formulated non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, optimization techniques, such as continuous convex approximation and the block coordinate descent algorithm, are used to efficiently find feasible solutions. To tackle the challenges posed by the high computational complexity and initialization sensitivity of the optimization-based approach, we also propose an unsupervised learning-based deep neural network (DNN) structure with a specialized loss function tailored to our goals that allows the DNN to effectively approximate the optimal strategies for UAVs. Finally, we design a pioneering method that integrates the strengths of the two aforementioned approaches, in which the output of the trained DNN serves as the initial values of the optimization variables, and subsequently, optimization techniques are applied to fine-tune these optimization variables, leading to further performance improvements. Through intensive simulations, we confirm that the integrated scheme provides superior performance without constraint violation compared to the DL-based scheme, while guaranteeing faster convergence than the optimization-based scheme.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently regarded as a disruptive candidate technology for enabling next generation wireless communication. It can establish favorable propagation environment to facilitate low-power and spectrally efficient data transmission, possessing attractive potential to support massive access. However, the required activity detection and channel estimation for RIS-assisted massive access is quite challenging due to the passive nature of the conventional reflecting elements. To this end, this paper considers massive access for RIS-assisted communication systems with semi-passive elements, which can operate in sensing mode for receiving signals. Then, by exploiting the sparsity of the RIS-BS channel in the virtual angular domain as well as the sporadic transmission of massive connectivity, we formulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation as a special bilinear recovery problem, which is a combination of sparse matrix factorization, compressed sensing (CS)-based generalized multiple measurement vector (GMMV) problem and matrix completion. Furthermore, we propose a novel hierarchical message passing-based algorithm to address the problem, in which approximate message passing (AMP)-based approximations are adopted to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its superior performance compared with state-of-the-art baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) has enabled the inception of a novel communication technique due to its high bandwidth and resistance to interference from various electromagnetic sources. However, in an indoor VLC system, other users (static as well as dynamic) can act as blockages to the communication link for the desired user. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an indoor VLC system with dynamic human blockages. Specifically, we use the random waypoint (RWP) model to characterize the movement of the blockages. The system performance is analyzed for a 4-LED configuration, where the blockages can pause during the movement for a specific pause time. Further, we developed a model to calculate the blockage probability in a typical indoor space, which is consequently used to calculate the power at the VLC receiver. Additionally, the analysis is extended for multiple blockage scenarios with different pause times. The second-order statistics such as level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) have been examined to demonstrate the impact of both pause time and the number of blockages on this dynamic time-varying indoor VLC channel. It is observed that a blockage with a longer pause time will have a longer average outage duration (AOD). Finally, the effect of the velocity of blockages on LCR and AFD is also analyzed. We believe that the insights obtained in this paper will be useful to the operator while deploying an indoor VLC communication system in the presence of dynamic blockages.}

	abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS)-based techniques have been widely applied in the grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a single-antenna base station (BS). In this paper, we consider the multi-antenna reception at the BS for uplink grant-free access for the massive machine type communication (mMTC) with limited channel resources. To enhance the overloading performance of the BS, we develop a general framework for the synergistic amalgamation of the spatial division multiple access (SDMA) technique with the CS-based grant-free NOMA. We derive a closed-form statistical beamforming and a dynamic beamforming scheme for the inter-cluster interference suppression when applying SDMA. Based on this, we further develop a joint adaptive beamforming and subspace pursuit (J-ABF-SP) algorithm for the multiuser detection and data recovery, with a novel sparsity level decision method without the accurate knowledge of the noise level. To further improve the data recovery performance, we propose an interference cancellation-based J-ABF-SP scheme (J-ABF-SP-IC) by using the initial signal estimates generated from the J-ABF-SP algorithm. Illustrative simulations verify the superior user detection and signal recovery performance of our proposed algorithms in comparison with existing CS-based grant-free NOMA techniques.}

	abstract = {Inter-satellite links are significant to achieve complex space missions like high precision ranging and rendezvous navigation. However, the impact of spacecraft multipath on system performance cannot be ignored, especially for large spacecraft. To evaluate and optimize the satellite communication system, a geometry-based non-stationary inter-large-satellite wireless channel model is proposed. It includes three components, i.e., a line-of-sight component, solar-panel-bounce parts for multipath on solar panels, and body-bounce (BB) components resulting from spacecraft body scattering. The BB clusters’ time-variant azimuth angle of arrival and departure are derived because conventional angle distribution functions, like von Mises, are unsuitable for scatterers directionally located in a limited region in satellite scenarios. Channel evolution in the space-time-frequency (STF) domain is modeled with birth-death processes regarding self-rotation and solar panel rotation in addition to three-dimensional (3D) movement. Then, channel characteristics, e.g., STF correlation functions, Doppler power spectrum density, and stationary intervals, are derived and studied. Finally, the proposed channel model is validated to be accurate by ray-tracing simulation, satellite measurement and on-orbit observation.}

	abstract = {In this work, we employ a constrained risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning (CRS-DRL) approach for joint scheduling in a dynamic multiplexing scenario involving enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Our scheduling policy minimizes the adverse impact of URLLC puncturing on eMBB users while satisfying URLLC requirements. Conventional DRL-based algorithms for eMBB/URLLC scheduling prioritize maximizing the expected return. However, for URLLC mission-critical applications, it is crucial to explicitly avoid catastrophic scheduling failures associated with the long tail of the reward distribution. Therefore, robust management of such uncertainties and risks is imperative. Our proposed CRS-DRL algorithm incorporates the conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk criterion for optimization. A URLLC queuing mechanism is considered to decrease the URLLC drops and increase eMBB throughput compared to the instant scheduling policy. Our architecture is based on the actor-critic model but considers a transfer function to obtain feasible solutions of the unconstrained actor network, and the critic predicts the entire distribution over future returns instead of simply the expectation. Numerical results indicate that our CRS-DRL algorithm, under varying CVaR levels, achieves similar expected returns but reduces long-tail behavior for long-term rewards compared to the risk-neutral approach.}

	abstract = {Each transmit antenna in spatial modulation (SM) based communication is uniformly activated, which can lead to poor channels for transmission, causing performance degradation. Though antenna selection can be used to tackle this problem caused by uniform antenna activation (U-AA), it requires additional antenna elements, high computational complexity, and signalling overhead. This paper proposes an irregular antenna activation (I-AA) technique, which activates an antenna with a probability that is proportional to a channel with the highest gain. In the proposed method, consecutive equal bits in a bit sequence are exploited to choose an antenna index for transmission. Since different numbers of consecutive equal bits occur with different probabilities, this makes each of the available antennas to be randomly activated with different probabilities. Taking advantage of available channel state information at the transmitter, we develop a rate-optimized I-AA method to utilize better channels for transmission. In prominent variants of SM, the use of I-AA is shown to yield higher throughput and smaller error rates compared to operations with the conventional U-AA. Moreover, a joint rate and Euclidean-distance optimized antenna selection (REAS) and a rate-optimized low-complexity AS (RLAS) for SM with I-AA are proposed. The use of I-AA without AS in prominent variants of the SM technique is shown to achieve better error rate performance compared to U-AA with AS. Also, the use of I-AA in REAS and RLAS yields improvements in the data rates and error rates compared to U-AA with AS, at a negligible extra complexity and signalling overhead.}

To effectively mitigate the mutual interference between sensing and communication caused by the sharing of spectrum and hardware resources, we provide a joint sensing transmit waveform and communication receive beamforming design with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum of normalized sensing rate and normalized communication rate. It is formulated as a computationally complicated non-convex optimization problem, which is quite difficult to be solved by conventional optimization methods. To this end, we first make a series of equivalent transformation on the optimization problem to reduce the design complexity, and then develop a deep learning (DL)-based scheme to enhance the overall performance of ISAC. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DL-based scheme for ISAC in 6G wireless networks.}

	abstract = {A novel hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transmitter enabled downlink multi-user communication system is investigated. Specifically, RISs are exploited to serve as transmitter antennas, where each element can flexibly switch between active and passive modes to deliver information to multiple users. The system energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the RIS element scheduling and beamforming coefficients, as well as the power allocation coefficients, subject to the user’s individual rate requirement and the maximum RIS amplification power constraint. Using the Dinkelbach relaxation, the original mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is transformed into a nonfractional optimization problem with a two-layer structure, which is solved by the alternating optimization approach. In particular, an exhaustive search method is proposed to determine the optimal operating mode for each RIS element. Then, the RIS beamforming and power allocation coefficients are properly designed in an alternating manner. To overcome the potentially high complexity caused by exhaustive searching, we further develop a joint RIS element mode and beamforming optimization scheme by exploiting the Big-M formulation technique. Numerical results validate that: 1) The proposed hybrid RIS scheme yields higher EE than the baseline multi-antenna schemes employing fully active/passive RIS or conventional radio frequency chains; 2) Both proposed algorithms are effective in improving the system performance, especially the latter can achieve precise design of RIS elements with low complexity; and 3) For a fixed-size hybrid RIS, maximum EE can be reaped by setting only a minority of elements to operate in the active mode.}

	abstract = {Accurate channel estimation is an essential prerequisite for achieving significant performance gains in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided communication systems. Recent studies have shown that deep neural network-based channel estimation holds promise as a competitive alternative to conventional methods. However, existing neural network-based approaches typically involve manual design of network architectures through a trial-and-error process, demanding extensive domain knowledge and human resources. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to construct a high-performance neural network architecture for channel estimation. Our method, called the channel estimation neural network architecture search (CENAS), utilizes a truncated back-propagation optimization search strategy to explore a neural network tailored for channel estimation. By carefully designing a search space tailored to channel estimation tasks, the automatically constructed network surpasses both conventional and deep learning-based channel estimation algorithms. The convergence of our framework’s network construction process is comprehensively analyzed, providing formal evidence of its convergence properties. Additionally, the proposed framework exhibits good generalization and applicability by allowing flexible adjustment of hyperparameters to generate networks with varying scales. Empirical results show the stability and the improved performance of CENAS framework, validating its effectiveness and desirability.}

This paper investigates an energy-efficient (EE) distributed SNN, where multiple edge nodes, each containing a subset of spiking neurons, collaborate to gather and process information through wireless channels. To leverage the benefits of the joint design of neuromorphic computing and wireless communications, we develop quantitative system models and formulate the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of edge devices under constraints of limited bandwidth and spike loss probability. Particularly, a simplified homogeneous SNN is first explored, where the system is proved to have stationary states with a constant firing rate and an alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed for jointly allocating the computation and communication resources. The algorithms are further extended to heterogeneous SNNs by exploiting the statistics of spikes. Extensive simulation results on neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that the developed algorithms can significantly reduce the power consumption of edge systems while ensuring inference accuracy. Moreover, SNNs achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but are much more bandwidth-efficient and energy-saving.}

Deep learning (DL) has been used to improve the performance of the receiver in complicated channel environments and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance has been achieved. However, its robustness has not been investigated. In order to evaluate the robustness of DL-based information recovery models under adversarial circumstances, we investigate adversarial attacks on the SOTA DL-based information recovery model, i.e., DeepReceiver. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem with power and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraints. We design different adversarial attack methods according to the adversary’s knowledge of DeepReceiver’s model and/or testing samples. Extensive experiments show that the DeepReceiver is vulnerable to the designed attack methods in all of the considered scenarios. Even in the scenario of both model and test sample restricted, the adversary can attack the DeepReceiver and increase its bit error rate (BER) above 10%. It can also be found that the DeepReceiver is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations even with very low power and limited PAPR. These results suggest that defense measures should be taken to enhance the robustness of DeepReceiver.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has attracted plenty of attentions as an up-and-coming approach to address the spectrum congestion via sharing the same hardware platform. However, including communication information in the sensing waveform will raise the risk of eavesdropping by the sensing targets as the eavesdroppers. In this paper, we investigate a secure transmission problem in a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted ISAC system, which is segmented into a sensing region and a communication region. The STAR-RIS is deployed to build line-of-sight (LoS) links for sensing the target as well as transmitting the confidential signal to users via non-orthogonal multiple access. Specifically, the sum secrecy rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, artificial jamming and STAR-RIS’s passive transmission and reflection beamformings, while ensuring the minimum beampattern gain required by the target. To deal with the non-convex problem, we divide it into two subproblems and leverage successive convex approximation to transform them into convex ones. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in an iterative manner. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme and the potential of STAR-RIS to enhance the security of ISAC.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the realization of covert communication in a general radar-communication cooperation system, which includes integrated sensing and communications as a special example. We explore the possibility of utilizing the sensing ability of radar to track and jam the aerial adversary target attempting to detect the transmission. Based on the echoes from the target, the extended Kalman filtering technique is employed to predict its trajectory as well as the corresponding channels. Depending on the maneuvering altitude of adversary target, two channel state information (CSI) models are considered, with the aim of maximizing the covert transmission rate by jointly designing the radar waveform and communication transmit beamforming vector based on the constructed channels. For perfect CSI under the free-space propagation model, by decoupling the joint design, we propose an efficient algorithm to guarantee that the target cannot detect the transmission. For imperfect CSI due to the multi-path components, a robust joint transmission scheme is proposed based on the property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The convergence behaviour, tracking MSE, false alarm and missed detection probabilities, and covert transmission rate are evaluated. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve accurate tracking. For both channel models, the proposed sensing-assisted covert transmission design is able to guarantee the covertness, and significantly outperforms the conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {We estimate the uplink channel of an extra largescale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, with the base station (BS) consisting of multiple antenna sub-arrays. The BS has a decentralized processing architecture, wherein each sub-array is connected to a local processing unit (LPU), which performs its signal processing tasks. The non-stationarity in XL-MIMO channel causes it to become sparse. We design a decentralized channel estimation algorithm to exploit this sparsity. In this algorithm, each LPU decentrally estimates the channel of a sub-array by exchanging information with other LPUs. This exchange is required to exploit the XL-MIMO sparsity. This decentralized algorithm is designed in two steps. The first step designs a centralized sub-array-based variational Bayesian learning (cS-VBL) algorithm. The second step extends this centralized design to a decentralized S-VBL (dS-VBL) implementation, which converts the centralized hyperparameter updates in cS-VBL algorithm to equivalent decentralized optimization problems. Each LPU decentrally solves this problem using asynchronous alternating direction method of multipliers. We show that the proposed i) cS-VBL and dS-VBL algorithms exploit the XL-MIMO channel sparsity, and outperform their existing centralized and decentralized counterparts; and ii) dS-VBL algorithm is robust to LPU failures, and has a lower complexity than cS-VBL algorithm.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the potential of near-field localization using widely-spaced multi-subarrays (WSMSs) and analyzing the corresponding angle and range Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs). By employing the Riemann sum, closed-form CRB expressions are derived for the spherical wavefront-based WSMS (SW-WSMS). We find that the CRBs can be characterized by the angular span formed by the line connecting the array’s two ends to the target, and the different WSMSs with same angular spans but different number of subarrays have identical normalized CRBs. We provide a theoretical proof that, in certain scenarios, the CRB of WSMSs is smaller than that of uniform arrays. We further yield the closed-form CRBs for the hybrid spherical and planar wavefront-based WSMS (HSPW-WSMS), and its components can be seen as decompositions of the parameters from the CRBs for the SW-WSMS. Simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form CRBs and provide further insights into various system characteristics. Basically, this paper underscores the high resolution of utilizing WSMS for localization, reinforces the validity of adopting the HSPW assumption, and, considering its applications in communications, indicates a promising outlook for integrated sensing and communications based on HSPW-WSMSs.}

Particularly, a location-based assignment algorithm is firstly provided to perform NOMA pairing, then the equal gain transmission at the base station and the cophase matching criterion at STAR-RIS are adopted to improve the performance of the reflected user and the effective channel gain of the paired users, respectively. According to the proposed design, considering the difference in the Rician factors of the channel from the base station to STAR-RIS caused by the change of line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components, two different cases for channel statistics of the paired users are rigorously characterized. Subsequently, we utilize the above results to analyze the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and ergodic rate of all users under downlink and uplink transmissions. Further, the diversity orders and the high slopes corresponding to all expressions are also determined to pursue more insights. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate our analysis and reveal that: 1) the various system factors have significant impact on the performances of the proposed design; and 2) the low-complexity design can reduce the overheads of channel estimation and signal processing at the expense of extremely-low or even no performance loss in contrast to the traditional maximum ratio transmission based design.}

	abstract = {As the demand for wireless connectivity continues to soar, the fifth generation and beyond wireless networks are exploring new ways to efficiently utilize the wireless spectrum and reduce hardware costs. One such approach is the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly access the spectrum. Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies, hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture, which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC beamformers by estimating both radar and communications parameters through our proposed beam-split-aware algorithms. We then develop a family of hybrid beamforming techniques–hybrid, SI, subcarrier-dependent analog-only, and beam-split-aware beamformers–for SPIM-ISAC. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits significantly improved spectral efficiency performance in the presence of beam-split when compared with even fully digital non-SPIM beamformers.}

	abstract = {Noteworthy strides continue to be made in the development of full-duplex millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, but most of this progress has been built on theoretical models and validated through simulation. In this work, we conduct a long overdue real-world evaluation of full-duplex mmWave systems using off-the-shelf 60 GHz phased arrays. We collect over 200,000 measurements of self-interference by electronically sweeping the transmit and receive beams of an experimental base station across a dense spatial profile, shedding light on the effects of the environment, array positioning, and beam steering direction. Then, we call attention to five key challenges faced by practical full-duplex mmWave systems and, with these in mind, propose a general framework for beamforming-based full-duplex solutions. Guided by this framework, we introduce a novel solution called STEER+, a more robust version of recent work called STEER, and experimentally evaluate both in a real-world setting with actual downlink and uplink users. Rather than purely minimize self-interference as with STEER, STEER+ makes use of additional measurements to maximize spectral efficiency, which proves to make it much less sensitive to one’s choice of design parameters. Experimentally, we demonstrate that STEER+ can reliably reduce self-interference to near or below the noise floor while maintaining high SNR on the downlink and uplink, thus enabling full-duplex operation purely via beamforming.}

	abstract = {Due to its ubiquitous and contact-free nature, the use of WiFi infrastructure for performing sensing tasks has tremendous potential. However, the channel state information (CSI) measured by a WiFi receiver suffers from errors in both its gain and phase, which can significantly hinder sensing tasks. By analyzing these errors from different WiFi receivers, a mathematical model for these gain and phase errors is developed in this work. Based on these models, several theoretically justified preprocessing algorithms for correcting such errors at a receiver and, thus, obtaining clean CSI are presented. Simulation results show that at typical system parameters, the developed algorithms for cleaning CSI can reduce noise by 40% and 200%, respectively, compared to baseline methods for gain correction and phase correction, without significantly impacting computational cost. The superiority of the proposed methods is also validated in a real-world test bed for respiration rate monitoring (an example sensing task), where they improve the estimation signal-to-noise ratio by 20% compared to baseline methods.}

Moreover, differentiation among device types causes channels to deviate from the assumed characteristics, leading to performance degradation of conventional compressive sensing (CS) algorithms. To this end, two innovative networks driven by the hybrid of model and data are proposed exploiting the iterative frameworks and deep neural networks. We first present a hybrid driven iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm, dubbed HISTA-Net, where a dual attention network (DAN) is embedded within the iterations to adaptively suppress iterative noise and enhance sparsity properties. Subsequently, we encapsulate data driven network and the intrinsic channel matrix knowledge, and derive a hybrid driven approximate message passing network (HAMP-Net) to further improve the sparse recovery performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed networks outperform existing CS methodologies and deep learning strategies in accuracy, convergence, and generalization ability. Remarkably, the proposed HAMP-Net reduces pilot overhead by 30%, and achieves an NMSE gain of 3 dB for signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 15 dB.}

However, ML implementation at the UE can be infeasible for various reasons, such as UE power consumption. Motivated by this issue, we propose a CSI learning mechanism at BS, called CSILaBS, to avoid ML at UE. To this end, by exploiting channel predictor (CP) at BS, a light-weight predictor function (PF) is considered for feedback evaluation at the UE. CSILaBS reduces over-the-air feedback overhead, improves CSI quality, and lowers the computation cost of UE. Besides, in a multiuser environment, we propose various mechanisms to select the feedback by exploiting PF while aiming to improve CSI accuracy. We also address various ML-based CPs, such as NeuralProphet (NP), an ML-inspired statistical algorithm. Furthermore, inspired to use a statistical model and ML together, we propose a novel hybrid framework composed of a recurrent neural network and NP, which yields better prediction accuracy than individual models. The performance of CSILaBS is evaluated through an empirical dataset recorded at Nokia Bell-Labs. The outcomes show that ML elimination at UE can retain performance gains, for example, precoding quality.}

By utilizing the a posteriori channel model based on the widely adopted jointly correlated channel model, the imperfect CSI is modeled as the statistical CSI incorporating the channel mean and channel variance information with spatial correlation. With the signal model in the presence of channel aging, we formulate the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) balancing and minimum mean square error (MMSE) problems for robust SLP design. The former targets to maximize the minimum SINR across users, while the latter minimizes the mean square error between the received signal and the target constellation point. When it comes to massive MIMO scenarios, the increment in the number of antennas poses a computational complexity challenge, limiting the deployment of SLP schemes. To address such a challenge, we simplify the objective function of the SINR balancing problem and further derive a closed-form SLP scheme. Besides, by approximating the matrix involved in the computation, we modify the proposed algorithm and develop an MMSE-based SLP scheme with lower computation complexity. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed schemes over the state-of-the-art SLP schemes.}

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to enhance the performance of an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink in which a two-dimensional (2D) fluid antenna system (FAS) with multiple activated ports is employed at the base station (BS) to maximize the sum-rate of the downlink users subject to a sensing constraint. The unique feature of this setup is that the locations of the antenna ports at the FAS can be optimized jointly with the precoding design to achieve a higher sum-rate. The required optimization problem is however NP-hard. To overcome this, we start by considering the perfect channel state information (CSI) scenario where all the port CSI is available. Deep reinforcement learning is utilized to build an end-to-end learning framework for the joint optimization problem. In particular, by fixing the activated ports, we adopt a primal-dual based learning algorithm to design a constraint-aware neural network for optimizing the ISAC precoder. Then, by using the neural precoding network to calculate the reward, we adopt the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to design the port selection and precoder jointly. An advantage actor and critic (A2C) algorithm is proposed to train the policy, in which the actor network uses the pointer network to learn the stochastic policy and the critic network adopts the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) encoder architecture to learn the expected reward from the observations. Afterwards, the partial CSI case is addressed, where we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) induced channel extrapolation for predicting all the CSI to facilitate the joint design. Simulation results demonstrate the promising performance of using FAS for multiuser MIMO and also validate the proposed learning-based scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the joint beam alignment and Doppler estimation (BADE) for fast time-varying wideband millimeter-wave channels, which is essential for subsequent data transmission. In such scenarios, the non-negligible Doppler frequencies significantly impact the beam alignment performance and reference signal overhead, calling for accurate time variation modeling and efficient transceiver design. Toward this end, we leverage the angle, Doppler frequency, and delay sparsity, thus formulating the joint BADE problem as a sparse signal recovery problem in the angle-Doppler-delay domain. The feasibility of the formulated problem strongly depends on the transmitter codebook and the receiver algorithm, which motivates our design. For the transmitter codebook, we characterize the design criterion aiming at maximal identifiable paths, which facilitates precise path parameter estimations and is not satisfied by existing deterministic codebooks. Following this, we provide a new deterministic codebook generation algorithm to meet the necessary conditions of the proposed criterion. For the receiver algorithm, we propose the greedy-based multi-path parameter extraction algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the hierarchical refinement dictionaries with extended refinement range are employed, balancing the BADE performance and computational complexity. The numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed transceiver over benchmarks on the joint BADE problem.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), as an emerging technology for 6G, raises a critical security issue that the sensing waveform may expose the private information to suspicious detection targets. In this paper, we design to utilize intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in ISAC to enhance the secure transmission for non-orthogonal multiple access nodes, and establish an additional line-of-sight link for the detection. An IRS-aided secure transmission scheme is proposed to jointly optimize the jamming, the active transmit precoding at the base station and the passive phase reflecting at the IRS to maximize the sum secrecy rate, subject to the echo signal requirement towards the target. To address the non-convexity of the proposed problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems, enabling the optimization of the transmit jamming and precoding vectors and the phase reflecting matrix, respectively. Then, with the help of successive convex approximation, these subproblems are derived to be convex, and an alternating optimization algorithm is introduced to address the original problem, which is guaranteed to converge. Simulations verify that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the benchmarks, and can guarantee the sensing functioning while greatly enhancing the communication security.}

	abstract = {Semantic communications are considered a promising beyond-Shannon paradigm to reduce network traffic and increase reliability, thus making wireless networks more energy efficient, robust, and sustainable. However, the performance is limited by the efficiency of the semantic transceivers, i.e., the achievable “similarity” between the transmitted and received signals. Under strict similarity conditions, semantic transmission may not be applicable and Shannon communication is mandatory. In this paper, for the first time in the literature, we propose a multi-carrier Hybrid Semantic-Shannon communication system where, without loss of generality, the case of text transmission is investigated. To this end, a joint semantic-Shannon transmission selection and power allocation optimization problem is formulated, aiming to minimize two transmission delay metrics widely used in the literature, subject to strict similarity thresholds. Despite their non-convexity, both problems are decomposed into a convex and a mixed linear integer programming problem by using alternating optimization, both of which can be solved optimally. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the proposed hybrid schemes, a novel association of text sentences to subcarriers is proposed based on the data size of the sentences and the channel gains of the subcarriers. We show that the proposed association is optimal in terms of transmission delay. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid semantic-Shannon communication scheme and the derived sentence-to-subcarrier association, and provide useful insights into the design parameters of such systems.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a practical integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework to sense dynamic targets from clutter environment while ensuring users communications quality. To implement communications function and sensing function simultaneously, we design multiple communications beams that can communicate with the users as well as one sensing beam that can rotate and scan the entire space. To minimize the interference of sensing beam on existing communications systems, we divide the service area into sensing beam for sensing (S4S) sector and communications beam for sensing (C4S) sector, and provide beamforming design and power allocation optimization strategies for each type sector. Unlike most existing ISAC studies that ignore the interference of static environmental clutter on target sensing, we construct a mixed sensing channel model that includes both static environment and dynamic targets. When base station receives the echo signals, it first filters out the interference from static environmental clutter and extracts the effective dynamic target echoes. Then a complete and practical dynamic target sensing scheme is designed to detect the presence of dynamic targets and to estimate their angles, distances, and velocities. In particular, dynamic target detection and angle estimation are realized through angle-Doppler spectrum estimation (ADSE) and joint detection over multiple subcarriers (MSJD), while distance and velocity estimation are realized through the extended subspace algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and its superiority over the existing methods that ignore environmental clutter.}

However, these networks are challenged by significant path loss and susceptibility to blockages. In this study, we delve into the use of situational awareness for beam prediction within the 5G NR beam management framework. We introduce an analytical framework based on the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, enabling the quantification of 6D position-related information of geometric reflectors. This includes both 3D locations and 3D orientation biases, facilitating accurate determinations of the beamforming gain achievable by each reflector or candidate beam. This framework empowers us to predict beam alignment performance at any given location in the environment, ensuring uninterrupted wireless access. Our analysis offers critical insights for choosing the most effective beam and antenna module strategies, particularly in scenarios where communication stability is threatened by blockages. Simulation results show that our approach closely approximates the performance of an ideal, Oracle-based solution within the existing 5G NR beam management system.}

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has drawn considerable attention for its ability to enhance the performance of not only the wireless communication but also the indoor localization with low-cost. This paper investigates the performance limits of the RIS-based near-field localization in the asynchronous scenario, and analyzes the impact of each part of the cascaded channel on the localization performance. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB) are derived. Besides, we also derive the equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for the position-related intermediate parameters. Enabled by the derived EFI, we verify that both the ranging and bearing information of the user can be obtained when the near-field model is considered for the RIS-User equipment (UE) part of the channel, while only the direction of the UE can be inferred in the far-field scenario. This result is well known in the scenario that the curvature of arrival (COA) is directly sensed by the traditional active large-scale array, and we prove that it still holds when the COA is sensed passively by the large RIS. For the base station (BS)-RIS part of the channel, we reveal that this part of the channel determines the type of the gain provided by the BS antenna array. Besides, in the single-carrier, single snapshot case, it requires both the BS-RIS and the RIS-UE part of the channel works in the near-field scenario to localize the UE. We also show that the well-known focusing control scheme for RIS, which maximizes the received SNR, is not always a good choice and may degrade the localization performance in the asynchronous scenario. The simulation results validate the analytic work. The impact of the focusing control scheme on the PEB performances under synchronous and asynchronous conditions is also investigated.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an analytical framework for the joint characterization of the 3D direction of arrival (DoA), i.e., azimuth and elevation components, and time of arrival (ToA) in multipath environments. The analytical framework is based on the use of nearly frequency-invariant beamformers (FIB) formed by toric arrays. The frequency response of the toric array is expanded as a series of phase modes, which leads to azimuth–time and elevation–time diagrams from which the 3D DoA and the ToA of the incoming waves can be extracted over a wide bandwidth. Firstly, we discuss some practical considerations, advantages and limitations of using the analytical method. Subsequently, we perform a parametric study to analyze the influence of the method parameters on the quality of the estimation. The method is tested in single-path and multipath mm-wave environments over a large bandwidth. The results show that the proposed method improves the quality of the estimation, i.e., decreases the level of the artifacts, compared to other state-of-art FIB approaches based on the use of single/concentric circular and elliptical arrays.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the antenna selection problem in massive multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) systems under incomplete channel state information (CSI), with a particular interest on risk-aware planning subjected to practical constraints such as transmit power budgets and quality of services (QoS). Due to a very large number of antennas, obtaining complete channel measurements becomes a cost-prohibitive, energy-inefficient and spectral-inefficient task. To reduce pilot overhead, incomplete CSI and antenna selection (AS) are expected in practical massive MIMO systems. However, most existing AS algorithms heavily rely on the complete CSI, which imposes a high probability of violating the practical constraints in the scenarios of our interests. Motivated by this, we propose a joint channel prediction and antenna selection framework (JCPAS) which efficiently performs AS and is robust against the incomplete CSI and practical constraints. The proposed framework comprises i) a channel tracker which estimates the channel dynamics based on historical incomplete observations, and ii) a risk-aware Monte Carlo tree search (RA-MCTS) algorithm which utilizes the estimated channel dynamics to select antennas in a risk-aware manner. Simulation results show that the proposed RA-MCTS not only achieves much lower energy consumption compared to the existing typical algorithms, but also significantly reduces the probability of violating the practical constraints.}

To satisfy the fronthaul capacity constraint, this paper proposes a transform-compress-forward scheme, which consists of well-designed transformation matrices and uniform quantizers. The transformation matrices perform dimension reduction in the uplink and dimension expansion in the downlink. To reduce the communication overhead for designing the transformation matrices, this paper further proposes a deep learning framework to first learn a suboptimal transformation matrix at each RRH based on the local channel state information (CSI), and then to refine it iteratively. To facilitate the refinement process, we propose an efficient signaling scheme that only requires the transmission of low-dimensional effective CSI and its gradient between the CP and RRH, and further, a meta-learning based gated recurrent unit network to reduce the number of signaling transmission rounds. For the sum-rate maximization problem, simulation results show that the proposed two-stage neural network can perform close to the fully cooperative global CSI based benchmark with significantly reduced communication overhead for both the uplink and the downlink. Moreover, using the first stage alone can already outperform the existing local CSI based benchmark.}

Moreover, we show that transmission over multiple time blocks provides benefits through smart resource allocation. We first propose a communication framework named improved distinct extraction-based CRS (iDeCRS) that utilizes the benefits of rate-splitting. With our transmission framework, we derive a performance benchmark assuming genie channel state information (CSI), i.e., the channels of the present and future time blocks are known, denoted as GENIE. Using the results from GENIE, we derive a novel efficiency constrained optimization (ECO) algorithm assuming instantaneous CSI. In addition, a simple but effective even data transmission (EDT) algorithm that promotes steady transmission along the time blocks is proposed. Simulation results show that ECO and EDT have satisfactory performances compared to GENIE. The results also show that ECO outperforms EDT when many users are cooperating, and vise versa.}

In this paper, considering with the global non-uniform user distribution and constrained satellite storage resources, we propose a dynamic satellite-ground integrated mobility management strategy (DSG-MMS) to cope with the relative mobility among users, GSs, and satellites, which can dynamically decide the optimal GS/MEO management node with the minimal handover and migration delays. Specifically, the DSG-MMS optimization problem is modeled as distributed Markov decision processes, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based management node selection method is presented to solve them, where each LEO satellite agent dynamically decides its own management node. To further implement the RL algorithm on the resource-limited LEO satellite agents, a novel tensor-based RL algorithm for DSG-MMS is proposed by means of the streamed low-rank tensor decomposition, where only the small-sized core tensor and factor matrices are kept and updated in the strategic optimization so as to realize low storage and computing overheads as well as fast convergence. We perform simulations for the proposed DSG-MMS with parameter configurations of actual Telesat, Kuiper, and Starlink satellite systems to evaluate the mobility management delay and overhead performances as well as the required satellite storage size for mobility management. Moreover, a case study and an architectural comparison are given to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSG-MMS than existing methods.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates efficient distributed training of a Federated Learning (FL) model over a wireless network of wireless devices. The communication iterations of the distributed training algorithm may be substantially deteriorated or even blocked by the effects of the devices’ background traffic, packet losses, congestion, or latency. We abstract the communication-computation impacts as an ‘iteration cost’ and propose a cost-aware causal FL algorithm (FedCau) to tackle this problem. We propose an iteration-termination method that trade-offs the training performance and networking costs. We apply our approach when workers use the slotted-ALOHA, carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) protocols. We show that, given a total cost budget, the training performance degrades as either the background communication traffic or the dimension of the training problem increases. Our results demonstrate the importance of proactively designing optimal cost-efficient stopping criteria to avoid unnecessary communication-computation costs to achieve a marginal FL training improvement. We validate our method by training and testing FL over the MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset. Finally, we apply our approach to existing communication efficient FL methods from the literature, achieving further efficiency. We conclude that cost-efficient stopping criteria are essential for the success of practical FL over wireless networks.}

	abstract = {With recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensing has recently been accepted as an attractive solution to enable accurate detection of human activities by analyzing the radio signal variations of sensor devices (SDs) using a well-trained AI model. However, due to the limited communication and computation resources at SDs, it is impractical to support energy- and delay-sensitive sensing services by solely processing the massive computation workload at local or offloading it to the edge server (ES) for edge inference. To address this problem, we consider in this paper device-edge co-inference in a wireless sensing system where multiple users collaboratively perform a common inference task. In particular, the AI model deployed at each SD can be split into two sequential parts. Each SD executes the former part of AI model at local, and leaves the remaining part computed at the ES. We aim to minimize the energy consumption of SDs subject to a prescribed inference latency requirement. To this end, we formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) to jointly optimize the model splitting point and system resource allocation, where the major difficulty lies in the tight couplings among splitting decisions of collaborative SDs. To solve the problem, we propose an integrated learning and optimization algorithm named LOP, which tackles the combinatorial model splitting by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method, and deals with the remaining resource allocation problem via convex optimization. To gain some engineering insights, we study the optimal model splitting design in a practical wireless indoor crowd counting system, where the optimal splitting point exhibits a threshold-based structure related to the user channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LOP algorithm can achieve a near-optimal energy performance with on average 0.8% optimality gap while enjoying a hundredfold reduction in computation delay.}

	abstract = {A hybrid Radio Frequency/Free Space Optical (RF/FSO) communication system exploits the benefits of channel physical layer diversity to improve data rate and link availability. The realisable benefits depend on the respective channel attenuations and their level of independence in the presence of degrading effects. The impact of weather on link attenuations is reported in this paper based on empirical data obtained from a hybrid RF/FSO system where the physical paths were near-coincident and the RF was in the E band. The system was operated in six cities (across five countries) around the world and approximately 15,000 hours of logged data, including weather, was available. This paper is possibly the first to use empirical data to investigate the correlation between the RF and FSO channels across a wide range of weather conditions including dust storms, fog, drizzle, rain, snow, showers and clear skies. It reports 1) the distributions of RF attenuation under different FSO channel states; 2) the joint distribution of the RF and FSO attenuations; and 3) the Pearson correlation coefficient and mutual information. Our empirical data illustrate a negative non-linear correlation during dust storm and a positive linear correlation during fog and snow.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal transmission of data and pilots using product superposition is known to be highly efficient under unequal coherence conditions in a downlink channel, improving achievable rates and degrees of freedom (DoF). However, these techniques have not been used when transmit beamforming is present, as product superposition measures and utilizes composite (virtual) link gains, while beamforming requires knowledge of true (physical) link gains at the transmitter. This paper presents new techniques that enable the gains of pilot-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) product superposition to be combined with transmit beamforming gain. The technical novelty of this paper lies in reconciling the requirements of transmit beamforming and product superposition under perfect or imperfect channel state feedback, and demonstrating its effectiveness under multi-user scenarios. The paper begins with a multi-user generalization of product superposition rate analysis in the absence of feedback. Then, a novel non-orthogonal scheme is proposed that harmoniously combines with either perfect or imperfect feedback under disparity in coherence time or coherence bandwidth among users. The proposed scheme includes efficient pilot placement strategies under multi-user scenarios with arbitrary coherence time and coherence bandwidth for different users. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.}

	abstract = {We propose a novel joint channel tracking and data detection (JCTDD) scheme to combat the channel aging phenomenon typical of millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems in high-mobility scenarios. The contribution aims to significantly reduce the communication overhead required to estimate time-varying mmWave channels by leveraging a Bayesian message passing framework based on Gaussian approximation, to jointly perform channel tracking (CT) and data detection (DD). The proposed method can be interpreted as an extension of the Kalman filter-based two-stage tracking mechanism to a Bayesian bilinear inference (BBI)-based joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) framework, featuring the ability to predict future channel state information (CSI) from both reference and payload signals by using an auto-regressive (AR) model describing the time variability of mmWave channel as a state transition model in a bilinear inference algorithm. The resulting JCTDD scheme allows us to track the symbol-by-symbol time variation of channels without embedding additional pilots, leaving any added redundancy to be exploited for channel coding, dramatically improving system performance. The efficacy of the proposed method is confirmed by computer simulations, which show that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SotA) but also approaches the performance of an idealized Genie-aided scheme.}

Channel prediction plays an important role in channel state information (CSI) feedback enhancement in AI-native air interface. To better predict the CSI, this paper investigates the Transformer network based channel prediction. Firstly, real channel data are obtained in Beijing-Tianjin railway line, and the channel prediction datasets are constructed through preprocessing. After formulating the channel prediction problem, a channel prediction model based on the Transformer network is newly proposed. The unique multi-head attention mechanism and position encoding of the Transformer network enable the proposed model to have more powerful parallel computation capability and better global information capture capability. Then, the hyper-parameters of the model are determined by autocorrelation analysis and cross-validation. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and space and time computational complexity using several evaluation metrics, and is compared with classical DL models. It is shown that the proposed model possesses higher prediction performance in the appropriate range of computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Diffusion models (DM) can gradually learn to remove noise, which have been widely used in artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in recent years. The property of DM for eliminating noise leads us to wonder whether DM can be applied to wireless communications to help the receiver mitigate the channel noise. To address this, we propose channel denoising diffusion models (CDDM) for semantic communications over wireless channels in this paper. CDDM can be applied as a new physical layer module after the channel equalization to learn the distribution of the channel input signal, and then utilizes this learned knowledge to remove the channel noise. We derive corresponding training and sampling algorithms of CDDM according to the forward diffusion process specially designed to adapt the channel models. We also theoretically prove that the well-trained CDDM can effectively reduce the conditional entropy of the received signal under small sampling steps. Moreover, we apply CDDM to a semantic communications system based on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) for image transmission and design a three-stage training algorithm for combining them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDDM can further reduce the mean square error (MSE) after minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer, and the joint CDDM and JSCC system achieves better performance than the JSCC system, the traditional JPEG2000 with low-density parity-check (LDPC) code approach and other benchmarks in diverse scenarios.}

	abstract = {The massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) systems are vulnerable to both pilot contamination and pilot spoofing attack (PSA), which jeopardize the uplink channel estimation and cause information leakage in the downlink transmissions. Motivated by the canonical large-scale fading precoding (LSFP), a secure LSFP is proposed to eliminate the impact of the coexistence of pilot contamination and PSA. The proposed framework enables multi-cell coordinated transmissions leveraging the large-scale fading coefficients, thus is suitable to be implemented in mMIMO systems with limited fronthaul. Specifically, the presence of the eavesdropper is first identified by designing a distributed mixture-of-experts neural network (D-MoENN)-based PSA detector, which combines the detected results of distributed nodes to improve the detection accuracy. Subsequently, an optimal jamming base station (BS) is selected by designing a D-MoENN-based localizer, which estimates the locating cell of the eavesdropper and selects the nearest jamming BS to the eavesdropper. Numerical results show that the proposed D-MoENN-based PSA detector outperforms the existing detectors in the low SNR regime. Moreover, the average secrecy rate achieved by the secure LSFP with the jamming BS selected by the D-MoENN-based localizer is close to the upper bound achieved by the genie-aided selector that perfectly knows the location of the eavesdropper.}

Therein, a base station (BS) in a primary network uses RSMA to serve primary users (PUs), and secondary user (SU) pairs constitute an ad hoc network sharing the spectrum with the primary network. Both power splitting (PS)- and time splitting (TS)-based SWIPT protocols are used in the ad hoc network that allow the SU receivers to decode the information and harvest energy simultaneously. An IRS is deployed to further enhance the system performance. We formulate optimization problems that optimize the common data rate allocation and beamformers associated with the common and private messages of RSMA, the beamformers and the PS/TS factors in the ad hoc network, and reflection coefficients of the IRS to maximize the minimum rate of the PUs while satisfying the requirements of harvested energy and data rate of the SU pairs.

For the considered symbiotic radio systems, the strong interference from the primary systems and moving object pose significant challenges for location sensing. Moreover, the symbol detection for symbiotic radio systems typically relies on channel state information (CSI), which would reduce the spectrum efficiency substantially. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a low-complexity and high-accuracy two-dimension DoA estimator based on the ratio of dual points on the main lobe using a single snapshot. The theoretical performance in terms of effective sensing probability and mean square error for the proposed estimator are provided in closed-form. To eliminate the dependence of symbol detection on CSI, we propose to fully capture the characteristic of the ISAC systems and introduce two types of DoA-assisted detectors to detect both the primary and secondary symbols. Specifically, the reciprocal linear detectors that use heuristic linear combiners and iterative detection to achieve mutual benefit for both transmissions, as well as a Manchester detector that can separate the primary and secondary signals, are proposed. Finally, the numerical results are provided to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DoA estimator and DoA-assisted detectors.}

The interconnections of the nodes are formed on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) channels, such as Television White Spaces (TVWS), so the CRAHN can suffer from heterogeneous Secondary User (SU) interference. We suggest that the idle time in IEEE 802.11s devices resulting from the employment of the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) and Mesh Coordination Function (MCF) be used for off-channel SS without causing any disruption to data transmission in the network. We perform Markov chain analysis to find the expected length of time of a sensing window. This work also specifies how an efficient minimum-variance unbiased estimator of the interference-plus-noise can be found. Estimation is more granular, accurate, and appropriate to the problem of SU-SU coexistence than the binary hypothesis testing methods that are common in the DSA and SS literature. We construct confidence intervals for the interference-plus-noise estimates based on the observations and find relationships between the number of sampling windows and sampling time, the interference power, and the achievable confidence interval width. The SU interference estimates can then be used to find improved channel assignments for the CRAHN.}

	abstract = {Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel behavior, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the far-field and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.}

	abstract = {In this work, we investigate the property of the multi-beam of 5G new radio (NR) signals for indoor localization. Specifically, the 5G NR signals are firstly sampled by a self-developed software-defined receiver, and the multi-beam is extracted via detecting the multiple synchronization signal blocks (SSBs). Secondly, with the assistance of the pilots in the multiple SSBs, the reference signal received power (RSRP) and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) of the multi-beam are calculated. Thirdly, by stacking the RSRP and RSRQ of the multi-beam as the observables, a fingerprint database is constructed. With the aim to efficiently process the fingerprint features and improve the accuracy of indoor localization, a CatBoost-based algorithm is proposed, and the parameters are further optimized by tree-structured parzen estimator (TPE). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, indoor field tests are carried out in an office scenario, where real 5G signals are transmitted from a commercial 5G NR base station indoors. The field tests demonstrate that, by taking the advantages of the multi-beam of 5G NR, the localization accuracy can be able to achieve the accuracy of 1.06 m in the metric of root mean squared error (RMSE), even when only one base station is heard indoors. By comparison with the single-beam, the accuracy of multi-beam has improved 48%.}

	abstract = {Metaverse applications such as virtual reality (VR) content streaming, require optimal resource allocation strategies for mobile edge computing (MEC) to ensure a high-quality user experience. In contrast to online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which can incur substantial communication overheads and longer delays, the majority of existing works employ offline-trained RL algorithms for resource allocation decisions in MEC systems. However, they neglect the impact of desynchronization between the physical and digital worlds on the effectiveness of the allocation strategy. In this paper, we tackle this desynchronization using a continual RL (CRL) framework that facilitates the resource allocation dynamically for MEC-enabled VR content streaming. We first design a digital twin-empowered edge computing (DTEC) system and formulate a quality of experience (QoE) maximization problem based on attention-based resolution perception. This problem optimizes the allocation of computing and bandwidth resources while adapting the attention-based resolution of the VR content. The CRL framework in DTEC enables adaptive online execution in a time-varying environment. We propose three variants of CRL, namely Continual Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDDPG), Prioritized Experience Replay - CDDPG (PER-CDDPG), and Freshness Prioritized Experience Replay - CDDPG (FPER-CDDPG). We evaluate these algorithms, including two other benchmarks, using extensive experiments. FPER-CDDPG shows superior performance in terms of average latency, QoE, and successful delivery rate as well as meeting the hfQoE requirements over long-term execution while ensuring system scalability with the increasing number of users.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technique to support latency-sensitivity and computation-intensive serves. However, the low offloading rate caused by the random channel fading characteristic becomes a major bottleneck in restricting the performance of the MEC. Fortunately, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can alleviate this problem since it can boost both the spectrum- and energy- efficiency. Different from the existing works adopting either fully active or fully passive RIS, we propose a novel hybrid RIS in which reflecting units can flexibly switch between active and passive modes. To achieve a tradeoff between the latency and energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated by minimizing the total cost via jointly optimizing the transmission time, the transmit power, the receive beamforming vector, the phase-shift matrix, the mode-switching factor, the amplification factor, the offloading ratio factor, and the computation ability of the user, where the constraints of the maximum energy of users, the maximum power of the RIS, the minimum computation tasks, the transmission time, the offloading ratio factor, the mode-switching factor, the unit moduli of passive units, and the computation ability are taken into account. Considering the complexity of the aforementioned problem, we develop an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm by combining the successive convex approximation method, the variable substitution, and the singular value decomposition to obtain sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, in order to gain more insight into the problem, we consider two special cases involving a latency minimization problem and an energy consumption minimization problem, and respectively analyze the tradeoff between the number of active and passive units. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve flexible mode switching and significantly outperforms existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {The emerging immersive and autonomous services have posed stringent requirements on both communications and localization. By considering the great potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), this paper focuses on the joint channel estimation and localization for RIS-aided wireless systems. As opposed to existing works that treat channel estimation and localization independently, this paper exploits the intrinsic coupling and nonlinear relationships between the channel parameters and user location for enhancement of both localization and channel reconstruction. By noticing the non-convex, nonlinear objective function and the sparse angle pattern, a variational Bayesian learning-based framework is developed to jointly estimate the channel parameters and user location through leveraging an effective approximation of the posterior distribution. The proposed framework is capable of unifying near-field and far-field scenarios owing to exploitation of sparsity of the angular domain. Since the joint channel and location estimation problem has a closed-form solution in each iteration, our proposed iterative algorithm performs better than the conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) and maximum likelihood (ML) based ones in terms of computational complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm almost reaches the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) and achieves a superior estimation accuracy by comparing to the PSO and the ML algorithms.}

Confronted with the influx of CSI data from simulations and real-world environments, leveraging neural networks to mine valuable insights poses significant training costs and technical challenges for base station (BS) manufacturers. To address this, we propose a third-party platform serving as a CSI knowledge repository and feedback model hub, reducing training expenses and addressing technical issues for various BS manufacturers. However, tailoring training for each manufacturer’s model may lead to proprietary information leaks and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present “CSI Meta-knowledge Support”, a cutting-edge CSI feedback network deployment strategy using Learngene, enabling seamless transfer of CSI meta-knowledge across heterogeneous networks. This method captures a Learngene unit enriched with vital CSI meta-knowledge during comprehensive training sessions, serving as a plug-and-play prior to facilitate swift convergence and efficient local fine-tuning for manufacturers. The approach introduces adaptable and scalable CSI feedback network configurations, emphasizing reusability, cost-effectiveness, and resource management while safeguarding intellectual property. Our tests demonstrate enhanced performance, reduced training sample demands, and faster convergence relative to conventional techniques.}

In this work, we investigate how AoI impacts task-oriented multicasting in multi-cell Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) networks, while considering the effects of inter-cell interference and multicast group size. Our findings reveal that larger group sizes lead to increased instability in AoI, but lower inter-cell interference; while smaller group sizes result in higher inter-cell interference but a smaller increase in AoI when transmission fails. To balance inter-cell interference and group size, we propose a novel AoI-aware inter-cell interference mitigation (AIM) solution, which dynamically adjusts multicast group size, schedules multicast groups for transmission, and allocates transmit power to multicast groups. We derive the optimality for achieving the lowest AoI of the AIM scheduling strategy and the upper bound of the number of scheduling groups. Our simulation results show that AIM ensures more successful transmissions and low weighted sum AoI through grouping and AoI-aware inter-cell interference mitigation. We also show that our AoI-aware grouping scheme outperforms random grouping and fixed grouping, as well as evolutionary-based genetic algorithm grouping, by modeling the grouping problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and solving it using the \\epsilon -greedy method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the AoI problem of task-oriented IoT applications in multi-cell multicast NOMA networks.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication is increasingly viewed as a promising solution to improve the transmission efficiency. However, semantic communications are susceptible not only to physical channel impairments, but also to semantic impairments, which degrade semantic understanding at the receiver and disrupt the associated downstream tasks. Hence, we focus our attention on the robustness of semantic communications against semantic impairments. Specifically, we first categorize textual semantic impairments into three categories based on their sources. Then, we propose a robust deep learning enabled semantic communication system (R-DeepSC) by introducing a semantic corrector for robust semantic encoding so as to facilitate semantic transmission. Moreover, we develop a non-autoregressive version of R-DeepSC, namely NA-RDeepSC, which offers improved inference speed by relying on a non-autoregressive architecture and an adaptive generator embedded into the semantic decoder. NA-RDeepSC performs semantic decoding in parallel, hence reducing the decoding complexity from O(n) to O({1}) with a comparable performance to that of R-DeepSC. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness of the proposed R-DeepSC and NA-RDeepSC architectures in eliminating semantic impairments, hence highlighting the significance of this work in advancing the development of robust semantic communications.}

Since those applications require a large amount of computation for processing the sensed data, it is essential to offload the computation load to the edge computing (EC) server. In this paper, we propose the sensing and computing decision (SCD) algorithms for data freshness in the EC-enabled wireless sensor networks. We define the \\eta\n-coverage probability to show the probability of maintaining fresh data for more than \\eta\nratio of the network, where the spatial-temporal correlation of information is considered. We then propose the probability-based SCD for the single pre-charged sensor case with providing the optimal point after deriving the \\eta\n-coverage probability. We also propose the reinforcement learning (RL)-based SCD by training the SCD policy of sensors for both the single pre-charged and multiple energy harvesting (EH) sensor cases, to make a real-time decision based on its observation. Our simulation results verify the performance of the proposed algorithms under various environment settings, and show that the RL-based SCD algorithm achieves higher performance compared to baseline algorithms for both the single pre-charged sensor and multiple EH sensor cases.}

We first derive an upper bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS. Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of the clients in order to minimize the controllable terms of the convergence bound under strict delay and energy constraints. However, since the original problem is not convex, we perform successive convex approximation (SCA) and jointly optimize the parameters for the relaxed convex problem. Through extensive simulation, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed PHFL algorithm in terms of test accuracy, wall clock time, energy consumption and bandwidth requirement.}

In this paper, we propose an integrated over-the-air computation (AirComp) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication scheme in a wireless uplink system, which consists of a data fusion center, a base station, and associated multiple users. Each user participates in AirComp and information transmission simultaneously. The data fusion center is responsible for wireless data aggregation and the base station is responsible for data collection of all users. Our aim is to minimize the computation mean square error (CMSE) at the data fusion center while satisfying the total transmission rate requirement at the base station. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex. To solve the problem, we propose a one-dimensional search based globally optimal solution, an alternating optimization based locally optimal solution, and a generalized Rayleigh quotient based globally optimal solution. Numerical results illustrate that although the locally optimal solution has the shortest average program execution time (PET), it achieves the suboptimal system performance. The generalized Rayleigh quotient based globally optimal solution, which addresses the CMSE minimization problem in a different manner, has much lower average PET than the one-dimensional search based globally optimal solution.}

	abstract = {In this paper a novel joint sensing, communication, and artificial intelligence (AI) framework is proposed so as to optimize extended reality (XR) experiences over terahertz (THz) wireless systems. Within this framework, active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are incorporated as pivotal elements, serving as enhanced base stations in the THz band to enhance Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication. The proposed framework consists of three main components. First, a tensor decomposition framework is proposed to extract unique sensing parameters for XR users and their environment by exploiting the THz channel sparsity. Essentially, the THz band’s quasi-opticality is exploited and the sensing parameters are extracted from the uplink communication signal, thereby allowing for the use of the same waveform, spectrum, and hardware for both communication and sensing functionalities. Then, the Cramér-Rao lower bound is derived to assess the accuracy of the estimated sensing parameters. Second, a non-autoregressive multi-resolution generative AI framework integrated with an adversarial transformer is proposed to predict missing and future sensing information. The proposed framework offers robust and comprehensive historical sensing information and anticipatory forecasts of future environmental changes, which are generalizable to fluctuations in both known and unforeseen user behaviors and environmental conditions. Third, a multi-agent deep recurrent hysteretic Q-neural network is developed to control the handover policy of RIS subarrays, leveraging the informative nature of sensing information to minimize handover cost, maximize the individual quality of personal experiences (QoPEs), and improve the robustness and resilience of THz links. Simulation results show a high generalizability of the proposed unsupervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) framework to fluctuations in user behavior and velocity, leading to a 61% improvement in instantaneous reliability compared to schemes with known channel state information.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the integration of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a secure multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI), imperfect channel state information (CSI), and spatially correlated channels. We first introduce a linear minimum-mean-square error estimation algorithm for the aggregate channel by considering the impact of transceiver HWI and RIS phase-shift errors. Then, we derive a lower bound for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper when artificial noise (AN) is employed at the base station (BS). In addition, the obtained expressions of the ergodic secrecy rate are further simplified in some noteworthy special cases to obtain valuable insights. To counteract the effects of HWI, we present a power allocation optimization strategy between the confidential signals and AN, which admits a fixed-point equation solution. Our analysis reveals that a non-zero ergodic secrecy rate is preserved if the total transmit power decreases no faster than 1/N , where N is the number of RIS elements. Moreover, the ergodic secrecy rate grows logarithmically with the number of BS antennas M and approaches a certain limit in the asymptotic regime N\\rightarrow \\infty . Simulation results are provided to verify the derived analytical results. They reveal the impact of key design parameters on the secrecy rate. It is shown that, with the proposed power allocation strategy, the secrecy rate loss due to HWI can be counteracted by increasing the number of low-cost RIS elements.}

	abstract = {As indoor applications grow in diversity, wireless sensing, vital in areas like localization and activity recognition, is attracting renewed interest. Indoor wireless sensing relies on signal processing, particularly channel state information (CSI) based signal parameter estimation. Nonetheless, regarding reflected signals induced by dynamic human targets, no satisfactory algorithm yet exists for estimating the acceleration of dynamic path length change (DPLC), which is crucial for various sensing tasks in this context. Hence, this paper proposes DP-AcE, a CSI based DPLC acceleration estimation algorithm. We first model the relationship between the phase difference of adjacent CSI measurements and the DPLC’s acceleration. Unlike existing works assuming constant speed, DP-AcE considers both speed and acceleration, yielding a more accurate and objective representation. Using this relationship, an algorithm combining scaling with the Fourier transform is proposed to realize acceleration estimation. We evaluate DP-AcE via the acceleration estimation and acceleration-based fall detection with the collected CSI. Experimental results reveal that, using distance as the metric, DP-AcE achieves a median acceleration estimation percentage error of 4.38%. Furthermore, in multi-target scenarios, the fall detection achieves an average true positive rate of 89.56% and a false positive rate of 11.78%, demonstrating its importance in enhancing indoor wireless sensing capabilities.}

	abstract = {A network relying on a large antenna-array-aided base station is designed for delivering multiple information streams to multi-antenna users over high-frequency bands such as the millimeter-wave and sub-Terahertz bands. The state-of-the-art analog precoder (AP) dissipates excessive circuit power due to its reliance on a large number of phase shifters. To mitigate the power consumption, we propose a novel AP relying on a controlled number of phase shifters. Within this new AP framework, we design a hybrid precoder (HP) for maximizing the users’ minimum throughput, which poses a computationally challenging problem of large-scale, nonsmooth mixed discrete-continuous log-determinant optimization. To tackle this challenge, we develop an algorithm which iterates through solving convex problems to generate a sequence of HPs that converges to the max-min solution. We also introduce a new framework of smooth optimization termed soft max-min throughput optimization. Additionally, we develop another algorithm, which iterates by evaluating closed-form expressions to generate a sequence of HPs that converges to the soft max-min solution. Simulation results reveal that the HP soft max-min solution approaches the Pareto-optimal solution constructed for simultaneously optimizing both the minimum throughput and sum-throughput. Explicitly, it achieves a minimum throughput similar to directly maximizing the users’ minimum throughput and it also attains a sum-throughput similar to directly maximizing the sum-throughput.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have been considered as a promising technology for next generation communications. The existing works mainly focused on the single-connected RIS, which is always mathematically characterized as diagonal phase shift matrices, because that each element of traditional RIS separately controls its status and would not like to apply influence to any other elements. Although there exist some research on sub-array RIS, the grouping conception is based on the controlling strategy level but not on the hardware realization level. Fortunately, a new type of beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) is proposed with its mathematical expression is symmetric and not limited to traditional diagonal phase shift matrices. BD-RIS model can fully cover the previous various types of RIS like: reflective RIS, refractive RIS, IOS (Intelligent Omni-Surfaces) or STAR-RIS (Simultaneously Transmitting And Reflecting RIS). In this work, a new model of BD-RIS is proposed to explain its working principle. Then, the quantization strategy for the new model BD-RIS is analyzed. Finally, the optimization algorithms for BD-RIS in single-user multi-input-multi-output (SU-MISO) systems and in multi-user multi-input-multi-output (MU-MISO) systems are proposed. Simulation results verifies the effectiveness of the the algorithms’ performance.}

	abstract = {In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, the wireless channel condition is a critical factor affecting both the communication power consumption and computation rate of the offloading tasks. This paper exploits the idea of cooperative transmission and employing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in MEC to improve the channel condition and maximize computation efficiency (CE). The resulting problem couples various wireless resources in both uplink and downlink, which calls for the joint design of the user association, receive/downlink beamforming vectors, transmit power of users, task partition strategies for local computing and offloading, and uplink/downlink phase shifts at the RIS. To tackle the challenges brought by the combinatorial optimization problem, the group sparsity structure of the beamforming vectors determined by user association is exploited. Furthermore, while the CE does not explicitly depend on the downlink phase shifts, instead of simply finding a feasible solution, we exploit the hidden relationship between them and convert this relationship into an explicit form for optimization. Then the resulting problem is solved via the alternating maximization framework, and the nonconvexity of each subproblem is handled individually. Simulation results show that cooperative transmission and RIS deployment can significantly improve the CE and demonstrate the importance of optimizing the downlink phase shifts with an explicit form.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a cooperative time synchronization (CTS) scheme for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where synchronization packets are jointly broadcast by a set of coordinated access points (APs). Thanks to multiple timestamps available at each target node, the proposed CTS scheme enables a much higher accuracy in clock parameters estimation than the conventional non-cooperative synchronization approaches. In addition to the clock parameters between the target nodes and their associated APs, the clock deviations among APs are also jointly estimated, where the clock deviations can be fed back to their associated APs via acknowledgment for further clock adjustment. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact on synchronization performance under the packet loss scenario, a matrix completion-based CTS (MC-CTS) algorithm is proposed that complements the lost timestamp information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CTS scheme presents a robust performance against the clock deviations among coordinated APs with packet overhead of approximately 50% less than that of the non-broadcast synchronization approaches, and the proposed MC-CTS algorithm effectively enhances the estimation performance of clock parameters, compared to just utilizing the CTS algorithm. Hence, the proposed algorithms are particularly suitable for time-sensitive cell-free massive MIMO systems.}

ISAC transmit access points serve the user equipments in the downlink and optionally steer a beam toward the target in a multi-static sensing framework. A maximum a posteriori ratio test detector is developed for target detection in the presence of clutter, so-called target-free signals. Additionally, sensing spectral efficiency (SE) is introduced as a key metric, capturing the impact of resource utilization in ISAC. A power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring minimum communication requirements. Two ISAC configurations are studied: utilizing existing communication beams for sensing and using additional sensing beams. The proposed algorithm’s efficiency is investigated in realistic and idealistic scenarios, corresponding to the presence and absence of the target-free channels, respectively. Despite performance degradation in the presence of target-free channels, the proposed algorithm outperforms the interference-unaware benchmark, leveraging clutter statistics. Comparisons with a fully communication-centric algorithm reveal superior performance in both cluttered and clutter-free environments. The incorporation of an extra sensing beam enhances detection performance for lower radar cross-section variances. Moreover, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated operation of sensing and communication compared to an orthogonal resource-sharing approach.}

	abstract = {The emerging 6G network envisions integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a promising solution to meet growing demand for native perception ability. To optimize and evaluate ISAC systems and techniques, it is crucial to have an accurate and realistic wireless channel model. However, some important features of ISAC channels have not been well characterized, for example, most existing ISAC channel models consider communication channels and sensing channels independently, whereas ignoring correlation under the consistent environment. Moreover, sensing channels have not been well modeled in the existing standard-level channel models. Therefore, in order to better model ISAC channel, a cluster-based statistical channel model is proposed in this paper, which is based on measurements conducted at 28 GHz. In the proposed model, a new framework based on 3GPP standard is proposed, which includes communication clusters and sensing clusters. Clustering and tracking algorithms are used to extract and analyze ISAC channel characteristics. Furthermore, some special sensing cluster structures such as shared sensing cluster, newborn sensing cluster, etc., are defined to model correlation and difference between communication and sensing channels. Finally, accuracy of the proposed model is validated based on measurements and simulations.}

However, current research focuses on single-domain resource allocation in ISAC and computing force networks, leaving the joint optimization of sensing, communication, and computation resource allocation unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem by deep incorporating computation resources, combined with a federated learning framework, while considering sensing precision and power consumption. Firstly, a multi-objective optimization is designed, involving Cramer-Rao Bound, sum rate of ISAC networks, and power consumption of computing force networks. Subsequently, the multi-objective optimization is transformed into a multi-task learning model. We aim to obtain joint optimization of sensing, communication, and computation resource allocation via deep learning techniques. Towards the multi-task learning model, the multiple-gradient descent algorithm is utilized to obtain the multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, a practical low-complexity the multiple-gradient descent algorithm is developed to reduce the computational cost.

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) wireless communications have the potential to realize ultra-high-speed and secure data transfer with miniaturized devices for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. The atmospheric turbulence due to random airflow leads to spatial inhomogeneity of the communication medium, which is yet missing in most existing studies, leading to additional propagation loss and even loss of spatial coherence (LoSC) in MIMO systems. In this paper, the attenuation and loss of spatial coherence for atmospheric turbulence are modeled in THz UAV MIMO channels. Specifically, the frequency- and altitude-dependency of the refractive index structure constant (RISC), as a critical statistical parameter characterizing the intensity of turbulence, is first investigated. Then, the LoSC, fading, and attenuation caused by atmospheric turbulence are modeled, where the turbulence-induced fading is modeled by a Gamma-Gamma distribution, and the turbulence attenuation as a function of altitude and frequency is derived. Numerical results show that the turbulence leads to at most 10 dB attenuation with frequency less than 1 THz and distance less than 10 km. Furthermore, when the distance is 10 km and the RISC is 10^{-9}\\,\\textrm {m}^{-2/3} , the loss of spatial coherence effect leads to 10 dB additional loss for a 1024\\times 1024 ultra-massive MIMO system.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology to increase system throughput and accommodate massive connectivity via non-orthogonal resource allocation. This paper studies the benefits of the improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) technique on the two-user downlink NOMA system with imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) over Rayleigh fading channels by analyzing the outage probabilities of both the strong user (SU) and the weak user (WU). The SU is assumed to use proper Gaussian signaling (PGS), while the WU employs IGS. Only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the base station, which is more practical than perfect knowledge of the instantaneous CSI. Both users’ outage probabilities are formulated in terms of the impropriety degree of the WU’s IGS, taking into account the residual interference introduced by the imperfect SIC. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize the outage probability of one user by adjusting the transmitted power and the impropriety degree of the WU while maintaining a certain quality-of-service (QoS) of the other user. Numerical results on the NOMA system verify that IGS provides an opportunity to further improve the outage performance over the conventional PGS.}

	abstract = {The hybrid intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) architecture is a novel technology that leverages the advantages of both passive and active IRS; the passive IRS offers a large aperture, while the active IRS provides additional power amplification. Prior studies have shown that the optimal performance of IRS-assisted wireless networks is achieved when the passive IRS is deployed near the transceivers and the active IRS is closer to the receiver with decreasing amplification power, assuming that the IRS is located between transceivers and that the height difference between IRS and transceivers is much smaller than the link distance between transceivers. However, most of the prior works on IRS blindly adopted this assumption in the IRS association policy, which essentially becomes a partial selection strategy that offers analytical simplicity at the cost of sub-optimal performance. This limitation motivated us to find the globally optimal deployment strategy for all types of IRS. To this end, we first employ the geometric models for integrated path loss distance (known as Cassini oval and Ellipse for product- and sum-distance path loss laws, respectively) and use them to determine the optimal locations of the hybrid IRS. Then, we design a novel opportunistic association policy for hybrid IRS based on the integrated path loss model. Furthermore, we validate our proposed methods through simulations and show that they significantly outperform the conventional nearest association policy, especially for hybrid and active IRS.}

	abstract = {In space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), receivers experience diverse interference from both the satellite and terrestrial transmitters. The heterogeneous structure of SAGIN poses challenges for traditional interference management (IM) schemes to effectively mitigate interference. To address this, a novel UAV-RIS-aided IM scheme is proposed for SAGIN, where different types of channel state information (CSI) including no CSI, instantaneous CSI, and delayed CSI, are considered. According to the types of CSI, interference alignment, beamforming, and space-time precoding are designed at the satellite and terrestrial transmitter side, and meanwhile, the UAV-RIS is introduced for the cooperating interference elimination process. Additionally, the degrees of freedom (DoF) obtained by the proposed IM scheme are discussed in depth when the number of antennas on the satellite side is insufficient. Simulation results show that the proposed IM scheme improves the system capacity in different CSI scenarios, and the performance is better than the existing IM benchmarks without UAV-RIS, but the performance improvement is at the cost of the requirement on the elements of UAV-RIS.}

	abstract = {Multiple access technologies are critical technologies in every communication era. As a promising paradigm for next-generation mobile communication, semantic communication has explored new semantic information space resources. Based on the characteristic that different semantic models cannot understand semantic information generated by other models, we propose the concept of semantic orthogonal signals. Combining the advantages of Deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC), an Orthogonal-Model Division Multiple Access (O-MDMA) technology that can be applied to any semantic model is proposed. The essence of O-MDMA is to migrate the anti-interference capability of DeepJSCC to the multi-user capacity. Compared with Non-Orthgonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and Model Division Multiple Access (MDMA) technologies, O-MDMA has better performance. The O-MDMA can be integrated with NOMA, and experimental results show that the combined technique can save more bandwidth.}

Fully digital arrays with true time delay per antenna element are a potential solution, but they require downconversion at each element. This paper shows that hybrid arrays can perform essentially as well as digital arrays once the number of radio-frequency chains exceeds a certain threshold that is far below the number of elements. This threshold is determined by only a few physical parameters—bandwidth, array size, and beamforming direction—and can be expressed in a remarkably simple closed form. The result is robust, holding also for suboptimum yet highly appealing beamspace architectures.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which simultaneously performs sensing and communication functions within a shared frequency band and hardware platform, has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems. Nevertheless, the weak echo signal received by the low-sensitivity ISAC receiver significantly constrains sensing performance in scenarios involving obstructed targets. Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a prospective solution by situationally manipulating the wireless propagations and amplifying the signals. In this paper, we investigate active RIS-empowered ISAC systems to enhance radar echo signal quality as well as communication performance. In particular, we focus on the joint design of the base station (BS) transmit precoding and the active RIS reflection beamforming to optimize the parameter estimation performance in terms of Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) subject to the communication users’ signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and majorization-minimization (MM) is proposed to solve the formulated challenging non-convex problem. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm and the potential of employing active RIS in ISAC systems to enhance direct-of-arrival (DoA) estimation performance.}

	abstract = {Limited capacity of fronthaul links in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can cause quantization errors at a central processing unit (CPU) during data transmission, complicating the centralized rate optimization problem. Addressing this challenge, we propose a harmony search (HS)-based algorithm that renders the combinatorial non-convex problem tractable. One of the distinctive features of our algorithm is its hierarchical structure: it first allocates resources at the access point (AP) level and subsequently optimizes for user equipment (UE), ensuring a more efficient and structured approach to resource allocation. Our proposed algorithm deals with rigorous conditions, such as asymmetric fronthaul bit allocation and distinct quantization error levels at each AP, which were not considered in previous works. We derive a closed-form expression of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), in which additive quantization noise model (AQNM) based distortion error is taken into account, to define the mathematical expression of spectral efficiency (SE) for each UE. Also, we provide analyses on computational complexity and convergence to investigate the practicality of proposed algorithm. By leveraging various performance metrics such as total SE and max-min fairness, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can adaptively optimize the fronthaul bit allocation depending on system requirements. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory performance while maintaining low computational complexity, as compared to the exhaustive search method.}

	abstract = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network (LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process (BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the performance of LEO-SSCN. Notably, with common parameter settings, after incorporating the space link, the transmission success probability increases by 886% with a 13 dB predefined signal-to-noise ratio (or signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio) threshold. This superior performance is attributed to the fact that the space link uses a wider bandwidth and greater power for signal transmission compared to the maritime link. It’s undeniable that the integration of the space link inevitably incurs additional expenses.}

	abstract = {As an emerging technology for wireless communication, the intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS) is made up of numerous low-cost passive elements with reconfigurable parameters, which can reflect signals with a certain phase shift and build a programmable communication environment. To reduce the high hardware cost and energy consumption in spatial modulation (SM), an IRS-aided hybrid secure SM (SSM) system with a hybrid precoder is proposed in this paper, where an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the secrecy rate (SR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming at IRS and the hybrid precoding at transmitter. For the IRS beamforming, an alternating direction method of multipliers (IRS-ADMM) scheme is first proposed. To achieve a higher SR, an IRS beamforming scheme via semidefinite relaxation (IRS-SDR) is put forward. To reduce the high complexity of IRS-SDR, we design a block coordinate ascend-based IRS beamforming scheme (IRS-BCA) with a closed-form solution. As for the hybrid precoding, two methods, called a successive convex approximation method based on the approximate secrecy rate (ASR-SCA) and a gradient ascend method based on cut-off rate (COR-GA), are presented. Simulation results show that the proposed IRS-ADMM and IRS-SDR harvest substantial SR performance gains over IRS-BCA. In comparison to the IRS-ADMM and IRS-SDR, the proposed IRS-BCA is of the lowest complexity at the cost of performance loss. Regarding hybrid precoding, the proposed ASR-SCA outperforms COR-GA in the high transmit power region. According to the complexity and SR performance of six combination methods including each IRS beamforming method and each hybrid precoding method, we selected three combinations: IRS-BCA plus ASR-SCA, IRS-ADMM plus ASR-SCA and IRS-SDR plus COR-GA. Moreover, it is showed that the SR performance achieved by the three combination methods is significantly higher than those of IRS with random beamforming and without IRS.}

Its exploitation for wireless communications is still in its infancy. In this work, a millimetre wave (mmWave) cellular network aided by FS-RIS is proposed to satisfy the new challenging communication services. The FS-RIS is able to down-convert the carrier frequency of the mmWave signal and spread the control information to the cell by using a more reliable and stable link, relying on better propagation within the lower bands, and a novel multi-frequency beam-management procedure is given. The proposed method can rapidly discover all users in the entire cell by using different sizes of beams. It avoids range penalization due to the better propagation in sub-6 GHz bands, unlike the hierarchical BMP. Additionally, the proposed technique only requires one base station (BS), and hence the delay overhead caused by the information exchange among several BSs is fully avoided, unlike the case of coordinated multi-point (CoMP). Overall, this paper provides a new way to exploit FS-RIS in wireless systems, which can potentially change the way we look at spectrum and interference management for the efficient exploitation of communication applications.}

	abstract = {Movable antenna (MA) is a new technology with great potential to improve communication performance by enabling local movement of antennas for pursuing better channel conditions. In particular, the acquisition of complete channel state information (CSI) between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) regions is an essential problem for MA systems to reap performance gains. In this paper, we propose a general channel estimation framework for MA systems by exploiting the multi-path field response channel structure. Specifically, the angles of departure (AoDs), angles of arrival (AoAs), and complex coefficients of the multi-path components (MPCs) are jointly estimated by employing the compressed sensing method, based on multiple channel measurements at designated positions of the Tx-MA and Rx-MA. Under this framework, the Tx-MA and Rx-MA measurement positions fundamentally determine the measurement matrix for compressed sensing, of which the mutual coherence is analyzed from the perspective of Fourier transform. Moreover, two criteria for MA measurement positions are provided to guarantee the successful recovery of MPCs. Then, we propose several MA measurement position setups and compare their performance. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed framework is able to estimate the complete CSI between the Tx and Rx regions with a high accuracy.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a chaotic waveform-based multi-antenna receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Particularly, we present a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based SWIPT multiantenna receiver architecture, where each antenna switches between information transfer (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) modes depending on the receiver’s requirements. We take into account a generalized frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading model as well as the nonlinearities of the EH process to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the associated bit error rate (BER) and the harvested direct current (DC), respectively. We show that, both depend on the parameters of the transmitted waveform and the number of receiver antennas being utilized in the IT and EH mode. We investigate a trade-off in terms of the BER and energy transfer by introducing a novel achievable ‘success rate - harvested energy’ region. Moreover, we demonstrate that energy and information transfer are two conflicting tasks and hence, a single waveform cannot be simultaneously optimal for both IT and EH. Accordingly, we propose appropriate transmit waveform designs based on the application specific requirements of acceptable BER or harvested DC or both. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of chaotic waveform-based signal design and its impact on the proposed receiver architecture.}

	abstract = {Decentralized federated learning (DFL), inherited from distributed optimization, is an emerging paradigm to leverage the explosively growing data from wireless devices in a fully distributed manner. With the cooperation of edge devices, DFL enables joint training of machine learning model in a device to device (D2D) communication fashion without the coordination of a parameter server. However, the deployment of wireless DFL is facing some pivotal challenges. Communication is a critical bottleneck due to the required extensive message exchanges between neighbor devices to share the learned model. Besides, model consensus becomes increasingly difficult as the number of devices grows because there is no available central server for coordination. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes the use of over-the-air computation (Aircomp) to improve communication efficiency by exploiting the superposition property of analog waveforms in multi-access channels, and introduce the mixing matrix mechanism to promote consensus using the spectral property of symmetric doubly stochastic matrix. Specifically, we develop a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) over-the-air DFL (OA-DFL) framework to study over-the-air DFL problem over MIMO multiple access channels. We conduct a general convergence analysis to quantitatively capture the impact of aggregation weights and communication error on the MIMO OA-DFL performance in ad hoc D2D networks. The result shows that the communication error together with the spectral gap of the mixing matrix has a significant impact on the learning performance. Based on this, a joint communication-learning optimization problem is formulated to optimize the transceiver beamformers and the mixing matrix. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to reveal the characteristics of different topologies and demonstrate the substantial learning performance enhancement of our proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) systems have attracted a significant interest in the relevant research communities. As a potential precoding scheme, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) can be adopted in MIMO-NOMA systems and has been proved to have a good trade-off for complexity and performance. In this paper, the performance of the GSVD-based MIMO-NOMA communications with Rician fading is studied. In particular, the distribution characteristics of generalized singular values (GSVs) of channel matrices are analyzed. Two novel mathematical tools, the linearization trick and the deterministic equivalent method, which are based on operator-valued free probability theory, are exploited to derive the Cauchy transform of GSVs. An iterative process is proposed to obtain the numerical values of the Cauchy transform of GSVs, which can be exploited to derive the average data rates of the communication system. In addition, the special case when the channel is modeled as Rayleigh fading, i.e., the line-of-sight propagation is trivial, is analyzed. In this case, the closed-form expressions of average rates are derived from the proposed iterative process. Simulation results are provided to validate the derived analytical results.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) is a promising technique to support cellular Internet-of-Things (IoT) by forming a mutualistic relationship between IoT and cellular transmissions. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-user multi-IoT-device SR system to enable massive access in cellular IoT. In the considered system, the base station (BS) transmits information to multiple cellular users, and a number of IoT devices simultaneously backscatter their information to these users via the cellular signal. The cellular users jointly decode the information from the BS and IoT devices. Noting that the reflective links from the IoT devices can be regarded as the channel uncertainty of the direct links, we apply the robust design method to design the beamforming vectors at the BS. Specifically, the transmit power is minimized under the cellular transmission outage probability constraints and IoT transmission sum rate constraints. The algorithm based on semi-definite programming and difference-of-convex programming is proposed to solve the power minimization problem. Moreover, we consider a special case where each cellular user is associated with several adjacent IoT devices and propose a direction of arrival (DoA)-based beamforming design approach. The DoA-based approach requires only the DoA and angular spread (AS) of the direct links instead of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the reflective link channels, leading to a significant reduction in the channel feedback overhead. Simulation results have substantiated the multi-user multi-IoT-device SR system and the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming design approaches. It is shown that the DoA-based beamforming approach achieves comparable performance as the CSI-based approach in the special case when the ASs are small.}

To address these issues, we propose in this paper new and efficient beam training schemes with off-grid range estimation by using conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook. Specifically, we first analyze the received beam pattern at the user when far-field beamforming vectors are used for beam scanning, and show an interesting result that this beam pattern contains useful user angle and range information. Then, we propose two efficient schemes to jointly estimate the user angle and range with the DFT codebook. The first scheme estimates the user angle based on a defined angular support and resolves the user range by leveraging an approximated angular support width, while the second scheme estimates the user range by minimizing a power ratio mean square error (MSE) to improve the range estimation accuracy. Finally, numerical simulations show that our proposed schemes greatly reduce the near-field beam training overhead and improve the range estimation accuracy as compared to various benchmark schemes.}

We consider a block feedback channel model, where the transmitter receives noiseless/noisy channel output feedback after each block. The proposed scheme employs a single encoder to facilitate transmission over multiple blocks, refining the receiver’s estimation at each block. Specifically, the unified encoder of JSCCformer-f can leverage the semantic information from the source image, and acquire channel state information and the decoder’s current belief about the source image from the feedback signal to generate coded symbols at each block. Numerical experiments show that our JSCCformer-f scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance with robustness to noise in the feedback link. Additionally, JSCCformer-f can adapt to the channel condition directly through feedback without the need for separate channel estimation. We further extend the scope of the JSCCformer-f approach to include the broadcast channel, which enables the transmitter to generate broadcast codes in accordance with signal semantics and channel feedback from individual receivers.}

In this paper, we consider OTFS in an overspread channel exhibiting a delay spread that exceeds the block duration in a frame, where traditional channel estimation (CE) fails. We propose a two-stage CE method based on a delay-Doppler (DD) training frame, consisting of a dual chirp converted from time domain and a higher power pilot. The first stage employs a DD domain embedded pilot CE to estimate the aliased delays (due to modulo operation) and Doppler shifts, followed by identifying all the underspread paths not coinciding with any overspread path. The second stage utilizes time domain dual chirp correlation to estimate the actual delays and Doppler shifts of the remaining paths. This stage also resolves ambiguity in estimating delays and Doppler shifts for paths sharing same aliased delay. Furthermore, we present a modified low-complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection algorithm for OTFS in overspread channels. Finally, we evaluate performance of OTFS using the proposed CE and the modified MRC detection in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).}

	abstract = {Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a crucial technique for the design of intelligent transceivers and has received considerable research attention. Conventional feature-based (FB) methods have the advantage of low computational complexity. However, these methods are highly sensitive to the distribution shifts of the received signal caused by the variation of channel effects and have rarely been studied in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under unseen synthetic channels with multipath fading effects, carrier frequency offset (CFO), phase offset (PO) and additive noise. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel FB method using the error vector magnitude (EVM) features for AMC tasks (termed as EVM-AMC), which can achieve reliable classification performance for the communication scenarios considering unseen synthetic channels in OFDM systems. Specifically, we first propose the axisymmetric mapping-based self-circulant differential division (AM-SCDD) algorithm to convert the received signal into the non-negative spectral quotient (NNSQ) sequence, deeply suppressing the synthetic channel effects. Subsequently, we derive the EVM features by analyzing the matched error vectors between the generated NNSQ sequence and the predefined NNSQ constellation symbol (NNSQCS) masks. During this process, a percentile-based filter is utilized to remove the outliers in each matched error vector. Finally, the feature samples collected from various channel conditions are sent to the multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for training and testing. Two candidate modulation type sets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed EVM-AMC method under both the constant and changing channel conditions. Our numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed method exhibits impressive robustness and generalization when dealing with unseen synthetic channels, 2) the proposed method yields the best classification performance when compared to the conventional FB AMC methods in the presence of channel effects.}

	abstract = {We consider a user-centric cell-free massive MIMO wireless network with L remote radio units, each with M antennas, serving K single-antenna user devices (UEs). Most of the current literature considers the regime $LM \\gg K $ , where the K UEs are active on each time-frequency slot, and evaluates the system performance in terms of ergodic rates. In this paper, we take a quite different viewpoint. We observe that the regime of $LM \\gg K $ corresponds to a lightly loaded system with low sum spectral efficiency (SE). In contrast, in most relevant scenarios, the number of UEs is much larger than the total number of antennas (think of a sport event with $K \\sim 10,000$ users and $ML \\sim 200$ antennas). To achieve high sum SE and handle $K\\gg ML$ , users must be scheduled over the time-frequency resource. The number of active users $K_{\\mathrm{ act}}\\leq K$ must be carefully chosen such that: 1) the network operates close to its maximum SE; 2) the active user set must be chosen dynamically over time in order to enforce fairness in terms of per-user time-averaged throughput rates. The fairness scheduling problem is canonically formulated as the maximization of a suitable concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function of the per-user rates. The intermitted user transmission due to scheduling imposes slot-by-slot coding/decoding, which in turn prevents the achievability of ergodic rates. Hence, we model the per-slot service rates using information outage probability. In order to obtain a tractable problem, we make a “decoupling” assumption on the CDF of the instantaneous mutual information seen at each UE k receiver. We approximately enforce this condition by introducing a conflict graph that prevents the simultaneous scheduling of users with large pilot contamination conflict and propose an adaptive scheme for instantaneous service rate scheduling based on locally estimating the mutual information CDF at each UE. Overall, the proposed dynamic scheduling is the first to address such system dimensions with tens of thousand users in a scalable way, is robust to system model uncertainties, and can be easily implemented in practice.}

	abstract = {By transmitting task-related information only, semantic communications yield significant performance gains over conventional communications. However, the lack of mature semantic theory about semantic information quantification and performance evaluation makes it challenging to perform resource allocation for semantic communications, especially when multiple tasks coexist in the network. To cope with this challenge, we propose a quality-of-experience (QoE) based semantic-aware resource allocation method for multi-task networks in this paper. First, semantic entropy is defined to quantify the semantic information for different tasks, and the relationship between semantic entropy and Shannon entropy is analyzed. Then, we develop a novel QoE model to formulate the semantic-aware resource allocation in terms of semantic compression, channel assignment, and transmit power. The compatibility of the formulated problem with conventional communications is further demonstrated. To solve this problem, we decouple it into two subproblems, and solve them by a developed deep Q-network (DQN) based method and a proposed low-complexity matching algorithm, respectively. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, as well as its compatibility with conventional communications.}

Specifically, the holographic beamformer of each base station (BS) is designed for maximizing the channel gain based on the local channel state information (CSI). By contrast, the digital beamformer at the central processing unit is designed based on the minimum mean squared error criterion. Furthermore, the near-field spectral efficiency of the RHS in cell-free networks is derived theoretically by harnessing the popular stochastic geometry approach. We consider both the phase shift error (PSE) at the RHS elements and the hardware impairment (HWI) at the radio frequency (RF) chains of the transceivers. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the asymptotic capacity bound, when considering an infinite physical size for the RHS in the near-field channel model. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the PSE at the RHS elements and the HWI at the RF chains of transceivers limit the spectral efficiency in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. Moreover, we show that the PSE at the RHS elements and the HWI at the RF chains of BSs can be compensated by increasing the number of BSs. Finally, we also demonstrate that the ergodic spectral efficiency based on the near-field channel model is higher than that based on the far-field channel model assumption.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a self-sensing intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Unlike the conventional purely passive IRS, the self-sensing IRS can effectively reduce the path loss of sensing-related links, thus rendering it advantageous in ISAC systems. Aiming to jointly sense the target/scatterer/user positions as well as estimate the sensing and communication (SAC) channels in the considered system, we propose a two-phase transmission scheme, where the coarse and refined sensing/channel estimation (CE) results are respectively obtained in the first phase (using scanning-based IRS reflection coefficients) and second phase (using optimized IRS reflection coefficients). For each phase, an angle-based sensing turbo variational Bayesian inference (AS-TVBI) algorithm, which combines the VBI, messaging passing and expectation-maximization (EM) methods, is developed to solve the considered joint location sensing and CE problem. The proposed algorithm effectively exploits the partial overlapping structured (POS) sparsity and 2-dimensional (2D) block sparsity inherent in the SAC channels to enhance the overall performance. Based on the estimation results from the first phase, we formulate a Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) minimization problem for optimizing IRS reflection coefficients, and through proper reformulations, a low-complexity manifold-based optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results are provided to verify the superiority of the proposed transmission scheme and associated algorithms.}

	abstract = {We consider reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided sixth-generation (6G) terahertz (THz) communications for indoor environment in which a base station (BS) wishes to send independent messages to its serving users with the help of multiple RISs. For indoor environment, various obstacles such as pillars, walls, and other objects can result in no line-of-sight signal path between the BS and a user, which can significantly degrade performance. To overcome such limitation of indoor THz communication, we firstly optimize the placement of RISs to maximize the coverage area. Under the optimized RIS placement, we propose 3D hybrid beamforming at the BS and phase adjustment at RISs, which are jointly performed at the BS and RISs via codebook-based 3D beam scanning with low complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the average sum rate compared to the cases of no RIS and randomly deployed RISs and also outperforms several benchmark schemes. It is further shown that the proposed codebook-based 3D beam scanning efficiently aligns analog beams between BS–user links or BS–RIS–user links and, as a consequence, achieves the average sum rate close to that of coherent beam alignment requiring global channel state information.}

	abstract = {A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based spatial modulation system operating over multiple subchannels is investigated. For scheduled users of each subchannel, a mixed multicast and unicast transmission is delivered. The multicast content is transmitted via the transmit antenna domain, while unicast contents are transmitted through the amplitude-phase modulated symbols using NOMA via the active antenna. Firstly, the unicast rate for each user and an upper bound for the multicast rate are derived. Secondly, a joint subchannel and power allocation problem for weighted sum rate maximization is formulated. To solve this challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem, we decompose it into three subproblems, namely the decoding order design, the subchannel assignment, and the power allocation. A heuristic scheme is developed to solve the first one by investigating the characteristics of the decoding order constraint. To avoid the high complexity caused by exhaustive search, the subchannel assignment is reformulated as a many-to-one matching with peer effect, and the Gale-Shapley method and swap operation are designed to solve it. The power allocation is solved by employing the successive convex approximation. Moreover, a joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm is proposed to further boost the performance, and a robust power allocation algorithm is proposed under channel uncertainties.}

	abstract = {We propose new pilot transmission protocols for acquiring channel state information (CSI) of individual reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted channels. Our approach addresses the challenge of individual CSI acquisition when the RIS lacks sensing and signal processing capabilities. We use monostatic and bistatic full-duplex base stations (BSs) and exploit the reciprocity of the uplink and downlink channels to design channel estimation algorithms based on both unstructured and geometric channel models. Specifically, for unstructured channel models, we develop two different channel estimation algorithms that provide high accuracy and low pilot overhead, respectively, depending on the type of full-duplex BS used. Moreover, a unified estimation framework is proposed to determine the CSI based on geometric channel models for both types of full-duplex BSs. For the angle estimation required as part of the proposed framework, we further develop a high-precision algorithm based on atomic norm minimization (ANM) and a low-complexity algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms are superior to existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy, complexity, and pilot overhead.}

	abstract = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) constitutes the design trend for base stations of future wireless communication systems, being capable of offering pencil-like beamforming that confronts path loss in an energy-efficient manner. However, wideband wireless applications with XL-MIMO antenna arrays are usually subject to near-field signal propagation conditions, frequency selectivity, and the spatial-wideband effect, whose ignorance in the beamforming optimization process will severely degrade the achievable performance. In this paper, we present an algorithmic framework for designing near-field reception beamforming of wideband multi-user XL-MIMO systems realized with holographic metasurface-based antenna arrays (HMAs). We first present a spherical-wave-propagation channel model, including the near-field effect, frequency selectivity, as well as the spatial-wideband effect. Based on this model, we formulate an HMA-based reception beamforming optimization problem for the uplink of multi-user XL-MIMO communications, whose optimal solution is challenging to obtain due to the nonlinear coupling between the high-dimensional analog combining weights and the digital combiner. To efficiently address the proposed framework via a convergent iterative approach, the considered sum-rate design objective is transformed into a sum-mean-square-error-minimization one. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase that the proposed HMA-based combining scheme can effectively deal with the practical effects under investigation, achieving a higher sum rate than conventional phase-shifter-based hybrid analog and digital combiners having the same antenna aperture.}

	abstract = {The emergence of fluid antenna systems (FAS) offers a novel technique for obtaining spatial diversity and leveraging interference fades for spectrum sharing in multiuser scenarios—a paradigm referred to as fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA). Nevertheless, as the number of users increases, the interference mitigation capability diminishes. To overcome this, opportunistic scheduling that prioritizes robust users proves to be an effective method for enhancing FAMA. This paper introduces a resilient decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) approach for opportunistic FAMA (O-FAMA), to autonomously select robust users and the port of each chosen user’s FAS jointly to maximize the network sum-rate. In order to enhance learning efficiency in this multi-agent environment, we propose a novel team-theoretic RL framework that includes a derivative network guiding the multi-agent learning of each solution’s policy networks. Our simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

	abstract = {In this article, we study the collocated and distributed deployment of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) for a fixed total number of IRS elements to support enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services inside a factory. We build a channel model that incorporates the line-of-sight (LoS) probability and power loss of each transmission path, and propose three metrics, namely, the expected received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), expected finite-blocklength (FB) capacity, and expected outage probability, where the expectation is taken over the probability distributions of interior blockages and channel fading. The expected received SNR and expected FB capacity for extremely high blockage densities are derived in closed-form as functions of the amount and height of IRSs and the density, size, and penetration loss of blockages, which are verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that deploying IRSs vertically higher leads to higher expected received SNR and expected FB capacity. By analysing the average/minimum/maximum of the three metrics versus the number of IRSs, we find that for high blockage densities, both eMBB and URLLC services benefit from distributed deployment; and for low blockage densities, URLLC services benefit from distributed deployment while eMBB services see limited difference between collocated and distributed deployment.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, it is susceptible to the severe spectrum scarcity and interference issues since it operates in the unlicensed frequency band. To tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing UAV network adopting an anti-jamming technique is considered. Two intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization schemes are designed, capitalizing on the proposed external interaction and internal inference based frameworks. For the first scheme, a novel external interaction based hybrid online-offline multi-agent actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient (MA2C-DDPG) framework is proposed taking into account the hybrid characteristics of discrete spectrum allocation and continuous UAV trajectory. As for the second scheme, another novel framework, the deep active inference (DAI) based on internal inference is proposed, which minimizes the internal variational free energy. Moreover, a belief learning based method is exploited to enhance the agents’ perception and improve the action selection in the dynamic spectrum sharing environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed schemes. It is shown that our proposed schemes significantly improve the secondary network sum transmission rate compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed MA2C-DDPG and DAI frameworks demonstrate the advantages in improving the training stability and convergence speed.}

First, we address the non-stationary multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem by considering the codeword index and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the action and reward, respectively, for beam training in time-varying channels. We develop a beam selection algorithm called the collaborative upper confidence bound (UCB) policy by clustering users according to their preferences for each codeword, using neural collaborative filtering. Second, we formulate a nonlinear least-squares problem using feedback SNR values to predict the beam gains for the unirradiated codewords. We then assign the radio frequency (RF) precoder using codewords with high expected beam gains for each user. Once the RF precoder is assigned, we estimate the equivalent baseband channel by receiving feedback on its direction information. Finally, we design the baseband precoder based on the acquired equivalent baseband channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid beamforming scheme with fast beam training improves energy efficiency by reducing beam training overhead and increasing beam searching accuracy.}

	abstract = {State-of-the-art performance for many edge applications is achieved by deep neural networks (DNNs). Often, these DNNs are location- and time-sensitive, and must be delivered over a wireless channel rapidly and efficiently. In this paper, we introduce AirNet, a family of novel methods that allow DNNs to be efficiently delivered over wireless channels under stringent transmit power and latency constraints. It is a part of a new class of joint source-channel coding methods that maximize the accuracy of the DNNs transmitted to the receiver, rather than recover the DNNs with high fidelity. In AirNet, we propose to directly map the DNN parameters to the transmitted channel symbols, while training the network under the channel constraints with robustness to channel noise. AirNet achieves higher accuracy compared to the separation-based alternatives. We further improve its performance by pruning the network below the available bandwidth, and using bandwidth expansion for significant network parameters. We also exploit unequal error protection (UEP) by selectively expanding the important layers. Finally, we propose an ensemble training approach where networks for different channel conditions can be obtained simultaneously, resolving the impractical memory requirements of training distinct networks for different channel conditions.}

	abstract = {Although 5G and beyond communication technology empower a large number of edge heterogeneous devices and applications, the stringent security remains a major concern when dealing with the millions of edge computing tasks in the highly dynamic heterogeneous networks (HDHNs). Blockchains contribute significantly to addressing security challenges by guaranteeing the reliability of data and information. Since the node’s mobility, there are risks of exiting the network and leaving the remaining tasks noncomputed. Therefore, we model the cost function of offloaded computing tasks as a dynamic stochastic game. To reduce the computational complexity, the Time-Variant Mean-Field term (TVMF) is adopted to solve the cost-optimized problem. What’s more, we design an Adaptivity-Aware Practical byzantine fault tolerance consensus Protocol (AAPP) to dynamically formulate domains, execute leader node selection with regard to task completion and quickly verify computational results. In addition, a Dynamic Multi-domain Fractional Repetition uncoded repair storage (DMFR) scheme with variant redundancy is proposed to reduce the storage pressure and repair overhead. The simulation is implemented to demonstrate our scheme outperforms the benchmarks in terms of cost and time overhead.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional (2D) modulation technology for processing high mobility communication signals. The integer delay and Doppler shifts can lead to significant modeling error in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. To obtain accurate estimation of fractional DD domain channel, we propose a novel two-step off-grid channel estimation using Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) for OTFS systems. First, we analyze the vectorized form of fractional DD domain input-output relationship and derive a simplified expression form to adapt compressive sensing model. Then, to tackle the problem of fractional parameters estimation, we build an off-grid compressive model in light of high-order Taylor expansion. The channel parameters can be obtained by our proposed off-grid BCS (OG-BCS) algorithm, where we edge out the noise parameters and adopt a hierarchical Laplacian scale mixture (LSM) prior for OTFS signal. At the same time, based on likelihood maximization we derive the off-grid update expressions and incorporate it into our optimized BCS framework. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose a fast BCS (FBCS) algorithm via LSM prior. In our proposed FBCS algorithm, the hyper-parameters modeling the sparse signal are separated for calculation, and only a single hyper-parameter is considered for updating in each iteration. Specially, we analyze the condition of maximization for obtaining the solution of hyper-parameters and derive its update expressions. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm has better computational efficiency and precise channel estimation performance.}

To address the issues, we advocate to perform joint channel estimation, detection, and decoding (JCDD) for MIMO URLLC systems encoded by short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Specifically, we develop two novel JCDD problem formulations based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion for Gaussian MIMO channels and sparse mmWave MIMO channels, respectively, which integrate the pilots, the bit-to-symbol mapping, the LDPC code constraints, as well as the channel statistical information. Both the challenging large-scale non-convex problems are then solved based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms, where closed-form solutions are achieved in each ADMM iteration. Furthermore, two JCDD neural networks, called JCDDNet-G and JCDDNet-S, are built by unfolding the derived ADMM algorithms and introducing trainable parameters. It is interesting to find via simulations that the proposed trainable JCDD receivers can outperform the turbo receivers with affordable computational complexities.}

	abstract = {A novel stochastic geometry framework is proposed in this paper to study the downlink coverage performance in a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network by jointly considering the polar coordinates of the Base Stations (BSs) with respect to the typical user located at the origin. Specifically, both the Euclidean and the angular distances of the BSs in a maximum power-based association policy for the user equipment (UE) are considered to account for realistic beam management considerations, which have been largely ignored in the literature, especially in the cell association phase. For completeness, two other association schemes are considered and exact-form expressions for the coverage probability are derived. Subsequently, the key role of angular distances is highlighted by defining the dominant interferer using angular distance-based criteria instead of Euclidean distance-based, and conducting a dominant interferer-based coverage probability analysis. Among others, the numerical results reveal that considering angular distance-based criteria for determining both the serving and the dominant interfering BS, can approximate the coverage performance more accurately as compared to utilizing Euclidean distance-based criteria. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously explores the role of angular distances in the association policy and analysis of cellular networks.}

	abstract = {In the realm of industrial Internet of Things, the imperative for ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is underscored by the demand for up to 99.999% reliability and sub-microsecond latency. In this paper, we delve into a downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system designed to facilitate URLLC, operating over spatially correlated Rician fading channels with inherent phase shifts. Utilizing short-packet transmission and accounting for imperfect channel state information, we derive stringent closed-form expressions for the lower-bound achievable rates, considering both phase-aware and phase-unaware minimum mean squared error estimations. Employing these expressions, we execute an in-depth performance analysis across diverse system configurations, including the availability of phase shifts and the counts of access points (APs), connected devices, antennas per AP, and pilot sequences. Additionally, we propose a path-following power control algorithm that employs geometric programming to enhance the downlink sum-rate. This algorithm is meticulously designed to meet the stringent latency and reliability requirements of URLLC for all connected devices. The theoretical underpinnings and the efficacy of the proposed power control algorithm are substantiated through extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with active elements is an augmented version of an RIS. By equipping all or part of RIS elements with signal processing capabilities, the channel estimation and the design of RIS phases can be further extended, yielding an improvement in the spectral efficiency (SE). In this paper, we first present a novel sensing RIS structure which is efficient for hardware implementation. Unlike partial active elements in previous structures, all elements are available to the RF chains via switches, which enables the traditional channel estimation methods and channel extrapolation to be implemented. Moreover, we make a comprehensive analysis and comparison with other RIS structures from the perspective of channel state information (CSI) acquisition. Considering the large-scale of RIS and base station (BS) array, we model the channel between the user and the RIS, the RIS and the BS using a near-field channel model. Based on the structured channel model, we propose a low-overhead channel reconstruction protocol through a parameter-extracting method, while the training overhead and complexity are also analyzed. In addition, we investigate the RIS elements’ activation strategy to further reduce the training overhead. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves accurate channel estimation with low overhead, which can also enhance the achievable SE.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the coverage performance of downlink satellite networks employing dynamic coordinated beamforming. Our approach involves modeling the spatial arrangement of satellites and users using Poisson point processes situated on concentric spheres. We derive an analytical expression for the coverage probability which is formulated in terms of various parameters, including the number of antennas per satellite, satellite density, fading characteristics, and path-loss exponent. This coverage probability validates the advantages of coordinated beamforming from a spatial average perspective. Our primary finding is that dynamic coordinated beamforming significantly improves coverage compared to the absence of satellite coordination, in proportion to the number of antennas on each satellite. Moreover, we observe that the optimal cluster size, which maximizes the ergodic spectral efficiency, increases with higher satellite density, provided that the number of antennas on the satellites is sufficiently large. To offer a more intuitive understanding, we also develop an approximation for the coverage probability. Furthermore, by considering the in-cluster geometry of the coordinated satellite set, we derive an approximate coverage probability conditioned on in-cluster geometry. Our findings are corroborated by simulation results, confirming the accuracy of the derived expressions.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which can make full use of the wireless platform and the spectrum for concurrent sensing and communication purposes, is emerging as a promising technology for future mobile networks. This paper studies the secure transmission for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-ISAC networks. Particularly, the UAV, as a dual-functional ISAC base station, serves K communication users and senses J targets with the help of an IRS. Furthermore, a potential eavesdropper, whose channel state information is not available, aims at eavesdropping the private information from the UAV to K users. A secure transmission scheme is proposed to maximize the average achievable rate via jointly designing the transmit power allocation, the scheduling of users and targets, the phase shifts at IRS, as well as the trajectory and velocity of the UAV. Owing to the non-convexity, an iterative algorithm based on the alternating optimization (AO), the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the manifold optimization (MO) is proposed to obtain a near-optimal solution. Moreover, we also investigate the energy efficiency maximization problem. We develop another iterative algorithm based on the AO, the SCA, the MO and the Dinkelbach’s algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution to this non-convex fractional programming problem. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified via simulation results.}

	abstract = {Broadcast plays a vital role in wireless ad hoc networks for information dissemination, while one of the key system parameters for maximizing broadcast performance is the transmission rate. However, due to the entangled impact of various factors on the broadcast performance such as node distribution, interference, transmission rate, and multi-hop links, theoretically modeling of the impact of different parameters on the broadcast performance is intractable, and hence the optimal transmission rate is still unknown. Inspired by the similarity between the process of packet broadcasting and the spreading of contagious diseases, we resort to epidemic theory to propose a tractable approach for modeling the dynamics of message broadcast process in wireless ad hoc networks. To characterize the impact of transmission rate on the broadcast performance, a novel utility function is proposed by jointly considering the packet delivery delay and packet size. Then, we derive the dynamics of packet broadcasting analytically and obtain the approximated expression for the proposed utility function in closed-form. Furthermore, the optimization of the transmission rate is carried out based on our proposed analytical model. Simulation results show that our analytical model can accurately characterize the process of broadcasting under a wide range of system parameters and that optimizing the transmission rate can improve broadcast performance significantly.}

Edge computing, especially the edge intelligence system, enables local users to offload the computation tasks to the edge servers to reduce the computational energy consumption of user equipment and accelerate fast task execution. However, the limited bandwidth of upstream channels may increase the task transmission latency and affect the computation offloading performance. To overcome the challenge arising from scarce wireless communication resources, we propose a semantic-aware multi-modal task offloading system that facilitates the extraction and offloading of semantic task information to edge servers. To cope with the different tasks with multi-modal data, a unified quality of experience (QoE) criterion is designed. Furthermore, a proximal policy optimization-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (MAPPO) is proposed to coordinate the resource management for wireless communications and computation in a distributed and low computational complexity manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed MAPPO algorithm outperforms other reinforcement learning algorithms and fixed schemes in terms of task execution speed and the overall system QoE.}

	abstract = {Channel State Information (CSI) feedback, powered by Deep Learning (DL) methodologies, exhibits significant promise in enhancing spectrum efficiency within massive MIMO systems. However, DL-based approaches typically necessitate substantial CSI datasets for each specific scenario, and managing multiple learned models demands considerable storage and updating bandwidth. To overcome this costly barrier, we develop a solution for efficient training and deployment enhancement of DL-based CSI feedback, which involves a lightweight translation model to cope with new CSI environments and introduces a novel dataset augmentation based on domain knowledge. Specifically, we first develop a deep unfolding CSI feedback network, SPTM2-ISTANet+, which incorporates spherical normalization to mitigate the challenge of path loss variation. Additionally, SPTM2-ISTANet+ integrates a trainable measurement matrix and residual CSI recovery blocks to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Employing SPTM2-ISTANet+ as a foundational feedback model, we introduce an adaptive CSI feedback architecture termed CSI-TransNet. CSI-TransNet features a scenario-adaptive plug-in module for CSI translation, composed of a sparsity aligning function and a compact DL module, facilitating the reuse of pretrained models in unencountered environments. To accommodate the small datasets, we propose a lightweight and general augmentation strategy based on domain knowledge. Test results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed solution for accurate CSI feedback given limited measurements for unseen CSI environments.}

Different from the existing works, this paper investigates the power allocation problem for onboard ISAC systems of vehicles, during the vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and sensing progress, in case of the time-varying communication channel gains, the time-varying impulse responses of sensed targets, and the stochastic traffic. Note that both the inter-beam interference of a single vehicle and the inter-vehicle interference are important considerations. Specifically, we formulate a stochastic programming problem, which optimizes the sensing performance, subject to constraints on the network stability, power limits and quality-of-service requirements. Leveraging the Lyapunov optimization technique, this stochastic programming problem is transformed into a single-time slot non-convex problem. Taking advantages of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO), a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the non-convex problem. Typically, we improve the traditional PSO to balance the global search ability and local search ability of particles. Finally, a dynamic power allocation strategy is proposed. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that this strategy achieves a communication performance-sensing performance tradeoff of [ {\\mathrm {O(}}1/V{\\mathrm {)}} , {\\mathrm {O(}}V{\\mathrm {)}} ] with V being a control parameter.}

To this end, a dynamic channel allocation schemes based on traffic prediction is proposed. First, the machine learning is adopted to extract temporal and spatial features of the service traffic or load in a certain region, and then the prediction results and graph theory are both used to realize the division of a given frequency band and bandwidth allocation, in order to achieve the purpose of coordinating the interference between SBSs and improve the system throughput; Secondly, oriented to the fluctuation of service traffic in the region, a dynamic channel allocation method based on user satisfaction is proposed to fulfill the dynamic adjustment of the total system bandwidth and channel allocation, so as to utilize the frequency band resources more effectively. Simulations show that our proposed method improves the number of bandwidths allocated per SBS by a factor of 4.932 and 1.225 on average compared to OCA and CA-CM, and it realizes the data rate requirement of most users with less bandwidth.}

	abstract = {Data-driven machine learning techniques have been advocated for signal detection in complex wireless environments. However, when applied to wideband spectrum sensing scenarios, they face practical challenges including very large data dimensionality, insufficient training data, and implicit inter-band dependencies. Current literature focuses on deep convolutional models, whose inherent model structure is not well suited for representing the diverse spectrum occupancy patterns of practical wideband networks, causing inefficient performance-complexity tradeoff and excessive sensing time. To address these issues, this paper develops a novel Spectrum Transformer with multi-task learning for wideband spectrum sensing at high sample efficiency. Empowered by the multi-head self-attention mechanism, the transformer architecture is designed to effectively learn both the inner-band spectral features and the inter-band spectrum occupancy correlations in the wideband regime. Simulations show that the proposed Spectrum Transformer outperforms the existing methods based on convolutional neural networks especially in the small-data case, by achieving higher sensing accuracy with an 89% reduction in model complexity.}

To tackle this challenge, we present an innovative sub-connected architecture for active RIS within the digital twin (DT) integrated mobile edge computing (MEC) framework of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, capitalizing on edge intelligence to enhance ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services. The primary aim of our research is to improve uplink data transmission from IoT URLLC user nodes (UNs) to a base station (BS) with the aid of an active RIS, even under an imperfect channel state information (CSI). We have formulated the total end-to-end (e2e) latency minimization problem, which is solved by using an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. The algorithm breaks down the proposed non-convex problem into five subproblems, namely, beamforming design, caching and offloading policy optimization, joint communication and computation optimization, and joint active RIS phase shift and amplification factor vector optimization. We conducted a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed AO algorithm, benchmarking its performance against the established Heuristic algorithm. Our simulation results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DT-assisted optimal phase sub-connected active RIS scheme over various benchmark schemes, taking into account various factors such as the number of RIS elements, power budget constraints, imperfect CSI, edge computing server (ECS) cache capacity, number of IoT UNs, and the number of power amplifiers.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of tracking the angles of arrival (AoAs) of multiple sources in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Considering the time-varying nature of the channel, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based active learning scheme for adaptive analog beamforming and multi-source AoA tracking. The proposed scheme consists of a DNN-based beamformer and a subspace tracking-based multiple signal classification (MUSIC) estimator. Specifically, the DNN generates the beamformer using soft AoA estimates from the previous time block, and the MUSIC estimator exploits the measured signal by the beamformer to estimate the AoAs in the current time block. The proposed scheme is first applied to the uniform linear array (ULA) scenario, and then extended to the uniform rectangular array (URA) scenario. Particularly, in the URA scenario, to reduce the computational complexity, we modify the reduced-dimension MUSIC (RD-MUSIC) algorithm to a beam-space form. Furthermore, we adopt a partially connected analog beamforming scheme for the large-scale URA scenario to further reduce the hardware costs. We conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the tracking performance of the proposed scheme in the ULA and URA scenarios, and show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing codebook-based beamformer methods.}

	abstract = {Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a network architecture beyond fifth generation (B5G), which has the potential to deliver significantly higher spectral efficiency (SE) and energy conservation, when compared to the traditional cellular MIMO layout. Radio stripes form a particular realization of CF mMIMO topologies, which at a relatively modest deployment cost, promise to distribute part of the computational load of the centralized processing unit (CPU), while maintaining the same performance. However, the limited-capacity fronthaul (FH) network effect has not yet been adequately studied in this context. In this paper, we develop an uplink sequential processing algorithm that is optimal in the sense of locally minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) at every antenna processing unit (APU). The performance is further enhanced by applying an effective Compare-and-Forward (CnF) strategy or by minimizing the compression error covariance trace, given the fronthaul capacity constraint. Additionally, we study the case where the radio stripe arrangement uses a distributed setup of access points (APs), aiming at minimizing path attenuation even more effectively. Based on analytical equations and simulation results, we conclude that throughput is maximized when the classic radio stripe setup is combined with the proposed algorithm and the CnF technique.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the system model and the transmit beamforming design for the Cell-Free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. The impact of the uncertainty of the target locations on the propagation of wireless signals is considered during both uplink and downlink phases, and especially, the main statistics of the MIMO channel estimation error are theoretically derived in the closed-form fashion. A fundamental performance metric, termed communication-sensing (C-S) region, is defined for the considered system via three cases, i.e., the sensing-only case, the communication-only case and the ISAC case. The transmit beamforming design problems for the three cases are respectively carried out through different reformulations, e.g., the Lagrangian dual transform and the quadratic fractional transform, and some combinations of the block coordinate descent method and the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results present a 3-dimensional C-S region with a dynamic number of access points to illustrate the trade-off between communication and radar sensing. The advantage for radar sensing of the Cell-Free massive MIMO system is also studied via a comparison with the traditional cellular system. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed beamforming schemes is validated in comparison with zero-forcing and maximum ratio transmission schemes.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) is a promising paradigm to provide uniform coverage in future wireless networks. However, a fully connected CFmMIMO system where all the access points (APs) serve every user equipment (UE) makes it challenging to deploy and scale in real-time due to high computational complexity and increased signaling overhead. In this work, we study the problem of downlink power allocation in partially connected CFmMIMO (p-CFmMIMO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT). We utilize the underlying geometry of the problem to propose a graph representation of the CFmMIMO system and develop a graph neural network (GNN) based power allocation strategy to maximize the minimum SINR in the system. We demonstrate that the proposed GNN model has excellent generalizability to deployment size, radio propagation morphologies, and per-AP serving density. Our GNN can address the power allocation problem in the fully connected case, the partially connected case, and even the cellular case with magnitudes lower computational complexity compared to the conventional numerical solvers. Notably, we show that over a wide range of service scenarios, the model achieves a median spectral efficiency that is within 10% of the optimal second-order cone programming (SOCP) solution while requiring 100 times fewer FLOPS.}

We explore and reveal the separability of the SLP model. By reformulating the power minimization (PM) SLP problem and exploiting the separability of the corresponding reformulation, the original problem is decomposed into several parallel subproblems via the ADMM framework with closed-form solutions, leading to a substantial reduction in computational complexity. The sufficient condition for guaranteeing the convergence of the proposed approach is derived, based on which an adaptive parameter tuning strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence rate. To avoid the large-dimension matrix inverse operation, an efficient algorithm is proposed by employing the standard proximal term and by leveraging the singular value decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, a prox-linear proximal term is adopted to fully eliminate the matrix inversion, and a parallel inverse-free SLP (PIF-SLP) algorithm is finally obtained. Numerical results validate our derivations above, and demonstrate that the proposed PIF-SLP algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-arts.}

In this paper, we propose an efficient communication scheme in MARL for mobile applications that enables each learning agent to optimize the cooperative agents and the learning parameters to integrate the shared information. The cooperative agents are chosen according to the learning environment observations, the channel states, and the task similarity with neighboring agents. The learning parameters are chosen based on the attention mechanism that exploits the correlation with the local observation to enhance the agent receptive field for efficient policy exploration. Neural networks with weights updated based on the learning factors determined by the task similarity are designed to further improve the learning efficiency. The performance bounds including the information gain from the learning agent cooperation, the communication cost and the utility are provided based on the Nash equilibrium of the cooperative MARL communication game. The proposed scheme is implemented in the anti-jamming video transmission of the unmanned aerial vehicle swarms to optimize the transmit channel and power and experimental results verify the performance gain over the benchmark.}

This system incorporates four distinct forms of index modulation: carrier, time slot, Walsh code, and sort. Particularly noteworthy is the introduction of the sort index, a unique feature within DCSK-related systems. The sort index is applied by arranging the selected indices from the code index in sequential order and placing them within the unselected time slots of inactive subcarriers. Furthermore, we present a joint demodulation algorithm at the receiver capable of simultaneously recovering time slot, Walsh code, and sort indices after carrier recovery. Furthermore, we have implemented noise reduction techniques at the receiver to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance. Our analysis covers the system’s data rate, spectral efficiency, and complexity, comparing these factors against those of similar systems. Additionally, we formulate theoretical BER equations for the JCTCS-IM-DCSK system in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. The simulation results not only confirm the precision of the theoretical BER expressions but also showcase our system’s superior BER performance when compared with similar systems under equivalent conditions.}

	abstract = {Beam management is one of the most challenging issues in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, where the antenna direction is dynamic, and the storage, computing, and communication resources are limited. In this work, we develop a zero-shot learning approach to maximize the average data rate of a user by optimizing beam tracking policy in both spatial and temporal domains. In the spatial domain, we develop a graph recurrent neural network (GRNN) with only 60 training parameters to predict the next beam direction. Compared with an existing recurrent neural network with more than 30, 000 parameters, the GRNN can reduce the storage requirement remarkably. In the temporal domain, we design a Twin deep Q-network (DQN) to determine the time to trigger beam tracking. To improve the generalization ability of GRNN and Twin DQN, we apply meta-learning to train them with different antenna directions and test them in unseen scenarios. Simulation results show that our zero-shot learning approach does not need new data samples in unseen scenarios. Thus, it does not introduce extra computing and communication overheads. Additionally, the achievable average data rate is around 10% to 20% higher than different benchmarks.}

Specifically, we design the precoded transmit signals that minimize the symbol-level transmit power subject to per-antenna time-domain PAPR constraint and CI condition, using the knowledge of both data information and channel state information (CSI), based on which a non-convex problem is established. This non-convex problem is transformed into a convex one by the vectorization and relaxation method. For the relaxed problem, we employ Lagrangian method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to obtain a closed-form expression on the precoded signals as a function of the Lagrangian multipliers. Subsequently, we study the dual problem and obtain the optimal Lagrangian multipliers via the proposed alternating iterative algorithm. We further consider the practical communication scenario with imperfect CSI, where the original CI constraint is transformed into a probabilistic constraint in order to achieve robustness against statistically CSI errors. Numerical results validate that the proposed low-complexity algorithm achieves an enhanced performance over existing methods in terms of transmit power, PAPR and computation complexity, both in ideal perfect CSI and practical imperfect CSI cases.}

In this paper, we develop a novel signal detection approach for MIMO-ODDM systems by leveraging the spatial-based generative adversarial network, namely SG-ODDM, for accurate, interference-resilient and environment-robust performance. We creatively design a spatial-based generative adversarial network (spatial-based GAN) for comprehensive feature extraction and interference mitigation. We propose a transfer learning-based adaptive updating (TAU) to enhance environmental robustness by reducing the frequency and effort in updating the detection model. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed SG-ODDM is considerably superior to state-of-the-art related works, in terms of detection accuracy, interference resilience and updating effort reduction.}

In particular, we focus on maximizing the worst-case performance of uplink eMBB and URLLC users when multiplexed in a given resource block using an effective rate-splitting approach among multiple sub-messages. Subsequently, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to jointly maximize the worst-case rate and minimize the worst-case packet-error probability (PEP) for eMBB and URLLC users, respectively, using effective power splitting and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding of the sub-messages. To solve the non-convexity of the formulated MOOP, we adopt a priori articulation scheme combined with the weighted product approach to transforming the MOOP into a single objective optimization problem (SOOP) and later, solve it using a low complex differential evolution (DE)-based meta-heuristic algorithm. We derive an optimal decoding strategy for sub-messages to ensure better user fairness among eMBB-URLLC traffic. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the considered RSMA-based superposition for hybrid eMBB-URLLC traffic over conventional slicing and superposition techniques. Moreover, the adopted weighted product method-based DE algorithm outperforms the state-of-art solutions.}

According to the angular or distance information contained in the received signals, 1) a distance-based codebook is designed for near-field MIMO channels, based on which a hierarchical beam training scheme is proposed to reduce the training overhead; 2) a combined angular-distance codebook is designed for hybrid-far-near-field MIMO channels, based on which a two-stage beam training scheme is proposed to achieve alignment in the angular and distance domains separately. For maximizing the achievable rate while reducing the complexity, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to carry out the joint optimization iteratively. Specifically, the RIS coefficient matrix is optimized through the beam training process, the optimal combining matrix is obtained from the closed-form solution for the mean square error (MSE) minimization problem, and the active beamforming matrix is optimized by exploiting the relationship between the achievable rate and MSE. Numerical results reveal that: 1) the proposed beam training schemes achieve near-optimal performance with a significantly decreased training overhead; 2) compared to the angular-only far-field channel model, taking the additional distance information into consideration will effectively improve the achievable rate when carrying out beam design for near-field communications.}

	abstract = {Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a key enabling technology of cognitive radio networks with multiple secondary users (SUs). In conventional CSS systems, when the primary signals are weak, the SUs require long sensing time to achieve a high detection probability for protecting the transmission of the primary user (PU), leading to little remaining time for secondary transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted CSS system, where multiple RISs are employed to improve the CSS performance within limited sensing time. Considering that the dependency of the CSS performance on the received primary signal strengths at the SUs differs across various CSS schemes, the RIS configurations could also be optimized differently regarding these CSS schemes. Motivated by this, we investigate the phase shift matrix (PSM) optimization problems to maximize the cooperative detection probability given a maximum tolerable false alarm probability, and we consider two typical kinds of CSS schemes, namely, data fusion and decision fusion. As it is intractable to directly solve these problems due to the complex expressions of the cooperative detection probability with respect to the PSMs, we show that the solutions can be obtained by transforming these problems into channel gain-related optimization problems. Furthermore, we show that the proposed PSM optimization methods can be extended to the more practical scenarios where instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unavailable. In such cases, we leverage statistical CSI to improve the CSS performance in the sense of expectation. Subsequently, we conduct a numerical analysis on the number of reflecting elements required to achieve a target detection probability in the statistical CSI case. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PSM optimization methods can significantly improve the CSS performance within limited sensing time.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a nonorthogonal downlink multiple access scheme, where the base station assigns the bit streams to different users from an adjustable hierarchical quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) constellation and all users deploy a simple non-iterative receiver with the same complexity as in an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. We analyze the achievable information rates of the proposed scheme, termed as QAMA, and show that it possesses a similar rate region as the hybrid OMA and MUST approach in the 5G standard, while the latter relies on successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers and dynamic switching of two distinct modules. We propose a design procedure to determine a few transmission modes that closely approximate the rate region via a simple polygon. Thanks to the receiver simplicity, easy scalability to more than two users, and the near-optimal rate region, QAMA is an appealing candidate for 6G cellular and other advanced wireless systems.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) alters the wireless channel by dynamically adjusting the propagation of wireless signals, thereby having the ability to enhance communication performance. Due to its low power consumption, IRS is expected to play an important role in improving energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, both optical IRS (OIRS) and radio frequency (RF) IRS are employed to assist aggregated visible light communication (VLC)-RF systems, and then a resource allocation algorithm is proposed to improve EE. To this end, a model for the IRS-assisted aggregated VLC-RF system is first established, followed by the formulated EE maximization problem. Furthermore, the EE maximization problem is decomposed into four subproblems, focusing on RF IRS configuration, optical subchannel assignment, OIRS arrangement, and joint power allocation. By employing block coordinate descent (BCD), the four subproblems are solved iteratively. Moreover, simulation results show the significant EE improvement brought by the IRS for aggregated VLC-RF systems. In addition, the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed BCD-based resource allocation algorithm, as well as the influence of key system parameters on EE are also demonstrated.}

	abstract = {Dual-function-radar-communication (DFRC) is a promising candidate technology for next-generation networks. By integrating hybrid analog-digital (HAD) beamforming into a multi-user millimeter-wave (mmWave) DFRC system, we design a new reconfigurable subarray (RS) architecture and jointly optimize the HAD beamforming to maximize the communication sum-rate and ensure a prescribed signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio for radar sensing. Considering the non-convexity of this problem arising from multiplicative coupling of the analog and digital beamforming, we convert the sum-rate maximization into an equivalent weighted mean-square error minimization and apply penalty dual decomposition to decouple the analog and digital beamforming. Specifically, a second-order cone program is first constructed to optimize the fully digital counterpart of the HAD beamforming. Then, the sparsity of the RS architecture is exploited to obtain a low-complexity solution for the HAD beamforming. The convergence and complexity analyses of our algorithm are carried out under the RS architecture. Simulations corroborate that, with the RS architecture, DFRC offers effective communication and sensing and improves energy efficiency by 83.4% and 114.2% with a moderate number of radio frequency chains and phase shifters, compared to the persistently- and fully-connected architectures, respectively.}

We start by modeling and developing resource allocation algorithms for two standard network operation modes. The centralized mode provides high data rates but suffers multiple issues, including scalability. On the other hand, the distributed mode has the opposite problem: relatively low rates, but is scalable. To address these challenges, we combine the strength of the two standard modes, creating a new semi-distributed operation mode. To avoid the need for information exchange between access points, we introduce a new quality of service metric to decentralize the resource allocation algorithms. Our results show that we can eliminate the need for information exchange with a relatively small penalty on data rates.}

	abstract = {Aiming to circumvent the severe large-scale fading and the energy scarcity dilemma in high-altitude platform (HAP) networks, this paper investigates the benefits of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) on HAP communications. Specifically, we propose a concept of multi-layer refracting RIS-assisted receiver to achieve concurrent transmission of the information and energy, which is conducive to overcoming the severe fading effect induced by extreme long-distance HAP links and fully exploits RIS’s degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for the SWIPT design. Based on the RIS-enhanced receiver, we then formulate a worst-case sum-rate maximization problem by considering the channel state information (CSI) error, the information rate requirements, and the energy harvesting constraint. To handle the intractable non-convex problem, a scalable robust optimization framework is proposed to obtain semi-closed-form solutions. Specifically, a discretization method is adopted to convert the imperfect CSI into a robust one. Then, by utilizing the LogSumExp inequality to smooth the objective and constraints, we develop a dual method to obtain the optimal solution for the HAP transmit precoder. In addition, a modified cyclic coordinate descent (M-CCD) is adopted to update the block-wise RIS coefficients. Moreover, closed-form solutions for power splitting (PS) ratios and the receive decoder are derived. Finally, the asymptotic performance of our proposed RIS-enhanced receiver is provided to reveal the substantial capacity gain for HAP communications. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed architecture and optimization framework are capable of achieving superior performance with low complexity compared to state-of-the-art schemes in HAP networks.}

	abstract = {One of the core problems in millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication systems, which significantly affects the data rate, is the misalignment of the beam direction of the transmitter towards the receiver. In this paper, we investigate strategies that identify the best beam within a fixed duration of time. To this end, we develop an algorithm, named Unimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3), that exploits the unimodal structure of the mean received signal strength as a function of the available beams and identifies the best beam within a fixed time duration using pure exploration strategies. We derive an upper bound on the probability of misidentifying the best beam, and we prove that the upper bound is of the order \\mathcal {O}\\left ({{\\log _{2} K\\exp \\left \\{{{-\\alpha n A}}\\right \\}}}\\right)\n, where K is the number of beams, A is a problem-dependent constant, and \\alpha n\nis the number of pilots used in the channel estimation phase. In contrast, when the unimodal structure is not exploited, the error probability is of order \\mathcal {O}\\left ({{\\log _{2} K\\exp \\left \\{{{-\\alpha n A/(K\\log K)}}\\right \\}}}\\right)\n. Thus, by exploiting the unimodal structure, we achieve a much better error probability, which depends only logarithmically on K. We demonstrate that UB3 outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms through extensive simulations.}

	abstract = {Coded caching (CC) can substantially enhance network performance by leveraging memory as an additional communication resource. However, the use of CC is challenging in various practical applications due to dynamic user behavior. The existing solutions, based on shared caching, cannot directly handle all scenarios where users freely enter and depart the network at any time as they are constrained by specific conditions on network parameters. This paper proposes a universally applicable shared-caching scheme for dynamic setups without any restriction on network parameters. The closed-form expressions for the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) are computed for the resulting generalized scheme, and are shown to achieve the existing optimal bounds of the shared-cache model. Furthermore, a successive-interference-cancellation-free extension based on a fast iterative optimized beamformer design is devised to optimize the use of excess spatial dimensions freed by cache-aided interference cancellation. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed scheme. In particular, the results demonstrate that while a dynamic setup may achieve a DoF substantially lower than the optimal DoF of shared caching, our proposed scheme significantly improves the performance at the finite signal-to-noise ratio compared to unicasting, which only benefits from the local caching gain.}

The wireless connectivity conditions vary as the users move within the application area motivating the use of a non-uniform cache memory allocation process to avoid excessive delivery time for users located in wireless bottleneck areas. To this end, a location-aware placement and delivery array (LAPDA) is designed for cache-aided multiantenna data delivery with a fast converging, iterative linear beamforming process. The underlying weighted max-min transmit precoder design enables the proposed scheme to serve users in poor connectivity areas with smaller amounts of data while simultaneously delivering larger amounts to other users. Our new scheme is suitable for large networks due to its linear transceiver structure and it is not constrained by the number of users, cache size, or the number of antennas at the transmitter, unlike the existing schemes. Despite non-uniform cache placement, the proposed scheme still achieves a significant degree of coded caching gain that is additive to the multiplexing gain and greatly outperforms the conventional symmetric CC schemes in terms of both average and 95-percentile delivery time.}

	abstract = {The recent development of reinforcement learning (RL) has boosted the adoption of online RL for wireless radio resource management (RRM). However, online RL algorithms require direct interactions with the environment, which may be undesirable given the potential performance loss due to the unavoidable exploration in RL. In this work, we first explore the use of offline RL algorithms in solving the RRM problem. We evaluate several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms for a practical RRM problem that aims at maximizing a linear combination of total rates and 5-percentile rates via user scheduling. Our findings indicate that the performance of offline RL for the RRM problem is heavily contingent upon the behavior policy deployed for data collection. We propose an innovative offline RL approach utilizing heterogeneous datasets from various behavior policies. This method demonstrates that a strategic mixture of datasets enables near-optimal RL policy generation, even with suboptimal behavior policies. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements: an ensemble-based policy to augment dataset mixture training efficiency, and a novel offline-to-online strategy for seamless adaptation to new environments. Our data mixture approach achieves over 95% efficiency of an online RL agent in the absence of expert data. The ensemble algorithm notably reduces training duration by half compared to the data mixture method. Furthermore, our model, when applied with offline-to-online fine-tuning, surpasses existing benchmarks by approximately 5% in our user scheduling problem.}

	abstract = {The growth of vehicular applications will inevitably require Base Stations (BSs) to simultaneously serve more Connected Vehicles (CVs) within limited bandwidth resources, which imposes a great challenge in interference management. Effective management of this interference is crucial for reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, and necessitates accurate Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). In practice, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of CV movements prevents BS from obtaining perfect CSIT, leading to outdated information and threatening communication performance. In this study, we propose a Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled V2X communication system to efficiently manage interference channels. We leverage a 1-layer RSMA scheme to relax the stringent requirement for perfect CSIT and enhance robustness to outdated information. Furthermore, we introduce Gruformer, a transformer-based model for improved CSIT prediction utilizing historical data. While longer forecasting horizons decrease accuracy, we present a game theory-based approach that significantly reduces processing time for power allocation, enabling timely decisions before CSIT becomes outdated. Simulation results reveal that Gruformer allows for more accurate predictions during rapid changes in channel conditions. Leveraging this high-quality CSIT, the proposed V2X system achieves a 20% increase in Weighted Ergodic Sum-Rate (WESR). Furthermore, the game theory-based approach delivers a 60% reduction in processing time while maintaining near-optimal performance.}

	abstract = {With the growing popularity of wearable devices, body-centric networks have become the focus of Internet of Things (IoT) research. However, malicious eavesdroppers and attackers pose threats to user privacy and network secrecy. Fortunately, physical layer security (PLS) communication and covert communication (CC) have been introduced and can be used in body-centric networks. However, network performance of both secrecy techniques has not been analyzed with an accurate wireless fading model. To fill this research gap, we study a body-centric IoT communication system with information secrecy features based on PLS and CC techniques. By adopting the Alternate Rician Shadowed fading model, we derive closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability and secrecy rate in PLS, and the detection error probability and covert rate in CC. To provide more explicit guidance, an algorithm for the selection of PLS and CC techniques is proposed, which aims to reach a high transmission performance state while ensuring communication security and covertness. The secrecy rate and covert rate are analytically and empirically compared. We insightfully find that, with the help of a friendly jammer, CC performs better than PLS, especially with high transmit power.

	abstract = {Elliptic positioning system offers a precise alternative to global navigation satellite system (GNSS). However, ranging measurements upon a single UAV only delineate the location estimates to a spherical region. Data infusion from inertial measurement units (IMUs) may refine these estimates, while its fidelity is undermined by IMUs’ lack of self-alignment to a specified reference frame. In this paper, we explore the minimal number of assisted UAVs or anchors for absolute positioning, i.e., location and alignment in a fixed frame, during complete GNSS outages. We first prove that the observability establishes under a UAV in a 3-D trajectory or a pair of static anchors. The two numbers are new theoretical limit, significantly lower than the three anchors in 2-D or four in 3-D scenarios required by traditional theorems. We propose a sequential scheme for the multi-parameter estimation problem ensuring rapid convergence. An iterative solution is derived, flexible to UAV and anchor-based configurations, that provides instant location updates free of computational overhead. Thereafter, we also circumvent NLOS effects by employing inverse estimation of range. Accordingly, we devise a tiered positioning framework that commences with a location-unknown UAV to first cooperate with LOS anchors, and then extend the service to UE via a single NLOS link outside anchors’ coverage. In the experiments, the proposed scheme reaches (10−2)° orientation alignment and centimeter-level accuracy in NLOS scenarios, which attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) accuracy. Moreover, the accuracy notably exceeds the noise level of ranging measurements at high sampling rate, and also shows robustness against local clock drifting.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study a multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC) network in the industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario, which aims at providing a joint computation service for a group of sub-tasks offloaded from multiple user equipments (UEs). The whole MEC service, including a communication phase and a computation phase, is required to satisfy both a low latency and a high reliability requirement. We derive the end-to-end reliability (error probability) of the whole MEC service and provide corresponding reliability-optimal design frameworks, where both the perfect channel state information (CSI) and outdated CSI scenarios are considered. In particular, we characterize the low-latency communication behavior with the consideration of the finite blocklength (FBL) impact, and exploit the extreme value theory to study the delay violation probability in the computation phase. Following the characterizations, in the perfect CSI scenario, a design framework minimizing the instantaneous end-to-end error probability is provided, i.e., via optimally choosing the time length for each user’s offloading and the time length for the computation phase. We rigorously prove the convexity of the problem, investigate the relationships among the variables in the optimal solution, based on which a low-complexity method is proposed achieving the optimal solution. In addition, for the scenario with only the outdated CSI, after deriving the expected end-to-end error probability conditioned on the outdated CSI value, a corresponding optimal time allocation design is provided as well, where the convexity of the formulated problem is characterized and the optimal solution is obtained. Via simulations, we validate our analytical model and evaluate the network performance under the design.}

	abstract = {The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network landscape is evolving toward enhanced programmability, virtualization, and intelligence to support heterogeneous use cases. The O-RAN Alliance is pivotal in this transition, introducing a disaggregated architecture and open interfaces within the 6G network. Our paper explores an intelligent traffic steering (TS) scheme within the Open radio access network (RAN) architecture, aimed at improving overall system performance. Our novel TS algorithm efficiently manages diverse services, improving shared infrastructure performance amid unpredictable demand fluctuations. To address challenges like varying channel conditions, dynamic traffic demands, we propose a multi-layer optimization framework tailored to different timescales. Techniques such as long-short-term memory (LSTM), heuristics, and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) are employed within the non-real-time (non-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC). These techniques collaborate to make decisions on a larger timescale, defining custom control applications such as the intelligent TS-xAPP deployed at the near-real-time (near-RT) RIC. Meanwhile, optimization on a smaller timescale occurs at the RAN layer after receiving inferences/policies from RICs to address dynamic environments. The simulation results confirm the system’s effectiveness in intelligently steering traffic through a slice-aware scheme, improving eMBB throughput by an average of 99.42% over slice isolation.}

	abstract = {The growth of intelligent vehicular services, like augmented reality (AR) road simulation, underscores the need for rapid, multi-modal content generation. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models, known for their swift production of diverse artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), stand out as a prime solution. However, integrating cloud-centric GAI models into vehicular networks is fraught with challenges. Notably, to offer specialized generative edge intelligence (EI) and boost vehicular AIGC, GAI models need to tap into user data and utilize significant computation resources. Moreover, their deployment across vehicular networks is essential for proximity-based distributed inferences. Yet, edge devices are resource-limited, and data sharing can raise safety and privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces GAI-IoV, an EI-enabled GAI framework facilitated through the cooperation between road-side units (RSUs) and vehicles. Subsequently, we propose the workflow for collaborative fine-tuning and distributed inference. On this basis, two pivotal vehicle-centric problems are then formulated: computation and communication resource allocation for federated fine-tuning (FFT) to optimize time and energy cost, and splitting strategy of shared and local inferences to optimize inference latency and content-generation capability. To solve these optimizations, we introduce a self-adaptive global best harmony search (SGHS) algorithm for resource allocation and a backward induction method for determining inference splitting strategy. Our experiments based on the Stable Diffusion v1-4 model vouch for a superior fine-tuning and inference capabilities of GAI-IoV. Furthermore, simulations underscore its resource utilization and distributed inference efficiency in dynamic vehicular scenarios.}

	abstract = {Backscatter communications (BCs), allowing passive devices to transmit information by reflecting incident RF signals, have emerged as an attractive solution for the green Internet of Things (IoT). In the practical implementation of BC systems, we observe two common and interesting phenomena: wavy backscatter signals and striped-shape constellation clusters. These phenomena differ significantly from the traditional point-to-point communication and the theoretical BC systems, substantially degrading the system performance. Unfortunately, their causes and potential solutions remain unexplored. Motivated by this, this paper investigates the origins and designs of the corresponding solving methods. Specifically, we first reveal the causes of these phenomena: the time-varying interference stemming from the phase-locked loop (PLL) non-ideality. Then, we introduce our solutions: the dynamic self-interference cancellation (DSIC) and the data-aided decision boundary (DDB) algorithms. Finally, we implement and evaluate our solutions on a practical BC platform. Experimental results show that our solutions can reduce the bit error rate (BER) by up to two orders of magnitude, extend the communication range by over three times, and maintain linear runtime complexity, demonstrating their effectiveness and applicability in practical BC systems.}

	abstract = {This study proposes the utilization of quantum machine learning (QML) to maximize the energy efficiency of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted communication with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). The next-generation wireless communications are expected to yield significantly higher energy efficiency compared to that of the previous generations. In a multiuser system, energy efficiency can be defined as a benefit-to-cost ratio between the achievable sum-rate and the energy consumption, where enhancements in the former come at the expense of increases in the latter. Recently, the integration between RSMA and RISs has been advocated as a powerful mean to control this tradeoff. Indeed, RSMA can enhance the rate region while RISs can lead to reduced energy consumption thanks to the use of low-energy phase shifters. However, optimizing a RIS-aided RSMA communication system is faced with a computational burden given that the RIS enlarges the volume of the required channel information, which expands the information that needs to be processed by the optimization module, even when the optimization is based on conventional learning techniques. The proposed QML optimization framework, which orchestrates non-linear quantum unitary operations to compose the learning models, enjoys information processing gains thanks to state vector operations in multi-dimensional Hilbert space. It is composed of two trainable quantum-based learning models employed in an alternating manner: the first establishes the transmission precoding, and the second designs the RIS phase shifting. Numerical results show that the proposed QML delivers comparable performance to that of conventional optimization but with reduced complexity.}

The main associated problems are the CSI acquisition time, which impacts the latency requirements of time-critical applications, and the estimation accuracy, which degrades the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, thus, reducing communication reliability. In this work, we formulate and solve a minimum-power precoding design problem simultaneously serving multiple URLLC users in the downlink with imperfect CSI. Specifically, we develop an algorithm that exploits state-of-the-art precoding schemes such as maximal ratio transmission and zero-forcing, and adjust the power of the precoders to compensate for the channel estimation error uncertainty based on the extreme value theory framework. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method and show its superiority with respect to a worst-case robust precoding benchmark.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is studied in the airborne domain, where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) act as communication base stations and radars simultaneously. The UAV transmits signals to users while leveraging these signals to localize targets. This research focuses on jointly improving communication and sensing (C&S) performances by designing the UAV trajectory and allocating user’s bandwidth. Since UAV’s sustainability is determined by its onboard battery, energy supply is considered as a constraint in the trajectory design. Communication performance is evaluated by total transmitted data, while sensing performance is assessed through Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). A tradeoff objective is formulated with normalization. To achieve a flexible tradeoff between C&S, the trajectory design is formulated as a weighted sum optimization problem. To improve the formulation accuracy of trajectory design, a multi-stage trajectory design (MSTD) is proposed. While the resultant design problem is difficult to solve directly, an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain a local optimal solution of UAV trajectory. Finally, numerical results are presented to show UAV trajectories determined by the tradeoff between C&S and the energy supply. Benefits of ISAC-based UAV scenario are highlighted by comparing the single-functional UAV scenarios.}

To facilitate the design and the detection of large unitary constellations at reduced complexity, the proposed constellations are constructed as the Cartesian product of independent amplitude and phase-shift-keying (PSK) vectors, and hence, can be iteratively detected. The amplitude vector is detected by exhaustive search, whose complexity is sufficiently low in short packet transmission scenarios. To detect the PSK vector, we use the posterior probability as a reliability criterion in the sorted decision-feedback differential detection (sort-DFDD), which results in near-optimal error performance for PSK symbols with equal modulation orders. This detector is called posteriori-based-reliability-sort-DFDD (PR-sort-DFDD) and has polynomial complexity. We also propose an improved detector called improved-PR-sort-DFDD to detect a more generalized PSK structure, i.e., PSK symbols with unequal modulation orders. This detector also approaches the optimal error performance with polynomial complexity. Simulation results show the merits of our proposed multi-symbol unitary constellation when compared to competing low-complexity unitary constellations.}

	abstract = {A great amount of endeavour has recently been devoted to activity detection for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where multiple access points (APs) jointly identify the active devices from a large number of potential devices. In practice, the APs and the central processing unit (CPU) are connected by capacity-limited fronthauls and the signals at the APs need to be compressed/quantized before they are forwarded to the CPU. However, existing approaches treat the compression/quantization and activity detection as separate tasks, which makes it difficult to achieve global system optimality. To tackle the above problem, this paper proposes an augmented model-driven end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimizes the compression modules, quantization modules at the APs, and the decompression module and detection module at the CPU. Specifically, deep unfolding is leveraged for designing the detection module in order to inherit the domain knowledge derived from the optimization algorithm, and other modules are constructed by judiciously designed neural network architectures for improving the learning capability. Furthermore, we design an enhanced scheme so that the proposed framework is adaptable to different compression rates. We demonstrate numerically that the proposed framework significantly reduces the computational complexity and achieves better detection performance than the conventional approaches. Moreover, it costs a much smaller number of bits on the fronthauls while still maintaining the detection performance.}

However, as the number of antennas increases, the task of eigenvalue decomposition or matrix inversion for the channel covariance matrix becomes progressively challenging. In this paper, we propose an equilibrium-equation-based recursive channel principal component tracking algorithm specifically designed for linear precoding in Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing (JSDM) systems. Unlike many existing algorithms that depend on gradient formulations and the choice of step size, our proposed recursive tracking algorithm operates without the need for a step size, significantly enhancing convergence speed and learning performance. We also derive the adaptive forgetting factor, which improves the convergence capability. Additionally, we provide a mathematical analysis of the algorithm’s convergence performance, mean deviation, and learning curve. Finally, we implement various precoding strategies to a downlink channel in a massive MIMO JSDM system, leveraging the channel’s principal components. Our simulations conclusively demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional tracking algorithms, while principal component-based precoding effectively enhances spectral efficiency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of vehicle service mode selection (sensing, communication, or both) and vehicle connections within terahertz (THz) enabled joint sensing and communications over vehicular networks is studied. The considered network consists of several service provider vehicles (SPVs) that can provide: 1) only sensing service, 2) only communication service, and 3) both services, sensing service request vehicles, and communication service request vehicles. Based on the vehicle network topology and their service accessibility, SPVs strategically select service request vehicles to provide sensing, communication, or both services. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the number of successfully served vehicles by jointly determining the service mode of each SPV and its associated vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic graph neural network (GNN) model that selects appropriate graph information aggregation functions according to the vehicle network topology, thus extracting more vehicle network information compared to traditional static GNNs that use fixed aggregation functions for different vehicle network topologies. Using the extracted vehicle network information, the service mode of each SPV and its served service request vehicles will be determined. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic GNN based method can improve the number of successfully served vehicles by up to 17% and 28% compared to a GNN based algorithm with a fixed neural network model and a conventional optimization algorithm without using GNNs.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is promising for future sixth-generation mobile communication systems. For OFDM-based ISAC systems, it is important to accurately sense the target’s parameters. This paper studies the three-dimensional joint estimation (3DJE) of range, velocity, and azimuth for OFDM-based ISAC systems with multiple receive antennas. First, we establish the signal model and derive the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the 3DJE. CRBs are widely used benchmarks that provide the theoretical lower bounds of the variances for unbiased estimation. Furthermore, an auto-paired super-resolution 3DJE algorithm is proposed by exploiting the reconstructed observation sub-signal’s translational invariance property in the delay, Doppler, and angle domains. Finally, with the 5G New Radio parameter setup, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better estimation performance and its root mean square error is closer to the square root of CRBs than existing methods.}

	abstract = {A multi-user heterogeneous semantic communication (SemCom) and bit communication (BitCom) system is investigated. Each user can be served via either SemCom or BitCom for demanding semantic or bit data. Orthogonal/non-orthogonal multiple access (OMA/NOMA) techniques are employed to provide access for multiple users. Channel-based and user demand-based transmission protocols are proposed, where a joint optimization problem of the communication mode selection, frequency bandwidth and power allocation, and NOMA user pairing is formulated to maximize the long-term (equivalent) semantic throughput and user satisfaction, respectively. To solve the formulated problems: 1) channel-based transmission, a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient with reference neuron enhanced Softmax (TD3-RNS) algorithm is proposed, where a fixed-value neuron is invoked to improve the training efficiency; 2) user demand-based transmission, a transfer TD3-RNS (T2D3-RNS) algorithm is proposed, where the learned policy is transferred to address the sparse rewards and perverse incentive problem caused by the optimization objective and reward shaping, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) proposed heterogeneous scheme outperforms the baselines which merely use SemCom or BitCom; 2) compared to OMA, NOMA is more compatible with the proposed heterogeneous scheme; and 3) proposed algorithms outperform the benchmarks in channel-based and user demand-based transmission, respectively.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to bring transformative improvements to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, due to its high flexibility, high autonomy, large coverage and strong adaptability to various terrains. Sensory data is gathered by sensing UAVs (SUs) from the coverage area and then relayed to the corresponding fusion center UAVs (FCUs). Afterwards, terrestrial base stations receive the sensory data from FCUs in such air-ground networks. However, due to complex task execution environment and transmission environment, it is challenging to capture the network-layer performance of the sensory data transmission and evaluate the trade-off relationship between sensing and communication. In this work, we model and analyze the network-layer delay violation for an ISAC UAV network to address this challenge. Specifically, the UAV formation is distributed according to a Poisson cluster process (PCP). Then, the successful sensing probability is derived, with which the sensory data traffic can be captured. Under the sensory data flow, the delay violation probability is calculated for the two-stage sensory data transmission queue by exploiting stochastic network calculus (SNC). Furthermore, a delay minimization problem is proposed to reveal the trade-off relationship between sensing and communication under the power allocation strategy. Based on the long-term network-layer queue backlog evaluated, we are devoted to analyze the delay violation probability under an emergency that results in the antenna misalignment for one typical SU during a certain period. The steady-state and transient analysis for the ISAC UAV network not only illustrate the trade-off relationship between sensing and communication for the network, but also provide insights for on-demand power allocation, network deployment, control module provisioning and sensory data flow control under certain performance requirements.}

	abstract = {As a promising approach to increase spectrum efficiency and user fairness, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, with strong potential for applications in integrated satellite-terrestrial relay networks (ISTRNs), has been considered as a vital part of the future wireless network architecture. However, studies on the symbol error performance of NOMA-based ISTRNs with multiple relays and multiple users are still in their infancy. In this study, we propose a dual-user NOMA-based ISTRN architecture with hardware impairments to all nodes. This study uses the opportunistic scheduling scheme to select the optimal relay for the relaying system with a decode-and-forward protocol and maximum ratio combination technique to improve the signal quality. We also use a shadowed Rician distribution to model fading in the satellite channels, while the terrestrial channels are assumed to follow a Nakagami-m fading distribution. In addition, the impacts of the path loss and beam pattern on the system are considered. Closed-form expressions are derived for the average symbol error rate (SER) for near and far users. We verify that the numerical results agree with the theoretical calculations and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture with decode-and-forward protocol compared with the case where line-of-sight links are used to transmit signals alone and with the case using amplify-and-forward protocol. Finally, we analyze the effect of some critical parameters on the average SER of the considered system and present some helpful insights in relation to engineering design.}

	abstract = {This work examines the task assignment, transmission scheduling, and trajectory design of image-surveillance UAVs dispatched to serve on-demand image capture and delivery services to ground users, e.g., from drivers seeking images of traffic jams or security units requesting images of private homes. In each task, the UAVs are required to capture the image of a specified surveillance region and deliver the image to the requesting user before the deadline. The task assignment, transmission scheduling, and trajectory design are jointly determined to maximize the total surveillance area of the completed tasks. We first examine the single-UAV problem and propose an alternating optimization approach that adopts the exact penalty method to promote near-binary solutions and employ successive convex approximation to deal with the nonconvex trajectory optimization. Then, we extend to the multiple-UAV scenario where cross-UAV tasks may require images to be captured and delivered by different UAVs. To enable distributed implementation, we introduce auxiliary deadlines to limit the time available for local tasks and, thus, decouple the joint optimization problem into multiple single-UAV problems that can be solved in parallel following the procedure derived in the previous case. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.}

This paper studies the construction of one particular type of CKM, namely channel gain map (CGM), by using a finite number of measurements or simulation-generated data, with model-based spatial channel prediction. We try to answer the following question: How much data is sufficient for CKM construction? To this end, we first derive the average mean square error (AMSE) of the channel gain prediction as a function of the sample density of data collection in offline CGM construction, as well as the number of data points used in online spatial channel gain prediction. To model the spatial variation of the wireless environment within each cell, we divide the CGM into subregions and estimate the channel parameters from the local data within each subregion. The parameter estimation error and the channel prediction error based on estimated channel parameters are derived as functions of the number of data points within the subregion. The analytical results may guide the CGM construction and utilization by determining the required spatial sample density for offline data collection and the number of data points to be used for online channel prediction, so that the desired level of channel prediction accuracy is guaranteed.}

	abstract = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR), the RIS acts as a secondary transmitter by modulating its information bits over the incident primary signal and simultaneously assists the primary transmission, then a cooperative receiver is used to jointly decode the primary and secondary signals. Most existing works of SR focus on using RIS to enhance the reflecting link while ignoring the ambiguity problem for the joint detection caused by the multiplication relationship of the primary and secondary signals. Particularly, in case of a blocked direct link, joint detection will suffer from severe performance loss due to the ambiguity, when using the conventional on-off keying and binary phase shift keying modulation schemes for RIS. To address this issue, we propose a novel modulation scheme for RIS-assisted SR that divides the phase-shift matrix into two components: the symbol-invariant and symbol-varying components, which are used to assist the primary transmission and carry the secondary signal, respectively. To design these two components, we focus on the detection of the composite signal formed by the primary and secondary signals, through which a problem of minimizing the bit error rate (BER) of the composite signal is formulated to improve both the BER performance of the primary and secondary ones. By solving the problem, we derive the closed-form solution of the optimal symbol-invariant and symbol-varying components, which is related to the channel strength ratio of the direct link to the reflecting link. Moreover, theoretical BER performance is analyzed. Finally, simulation results show the superiority of the proposed modulation scheme over its conventional counterpart.}

	abstract = {Recently, symbol level jamming (SLJ) has been proposed and studied as an effective jamming technique. However, the detection performance estimation and efficient detection schemes for SLJ have not been investigated in the literature. This paper proposes a novel active detection scheme for SLJ to enhance the detection capability of the legitimate user, where the detection performance estimation and target detection performance can be actively obtained. Specifically, based on a preset tolerant threshold of the bit error rate (BER) and necessary inputs, the threatening jamming power level (TJPL) for SLJ is obtained for the legitimate user, and then the TJPL is used for active performance estimation and adaption. We first derive the theoretical detection performance for QPSK modulated SLJ and noise modulated SLJ. Moreover, the TJPL required for detection is derived based on BER expressions and analytical results. Thereafter, two modes of active detection scheme are discussed, aiming to actively estimate the detection performance and obtain expected detection performance, respectively. Simulation results show that the active detection scheme can accurately estimate the jamming detection performance. Additionally, it can achieve expected detection performance, which adapts well to different preset thresholds, SNR regions and the modulation types.}

However, limitations in communication resources require UAVs to collect data from large-scale WSNs with high spectral efficiency. In this work, we investigate a UAV-assisted data collection strategy for a WSN enabled by hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Specifically, the WSN is organized into clusters and each cluster is further subdivided into multiple groups. The sensor nodes in each group transmit data to the UAV using NOMA scheme. To ensure fairness between sensor nodes, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput by jointly optimizing the sensor node pairing, decoding order, transmit power and the UAV waypoints, subject to transmit power and UAV trajectory length constraints. To address the formulated mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we first propose an optimization-based algorithm by applying block coordinate descent method where a closed-form solution of the transmit power is derived, and then design a low-complexity heuristic algorithm. In addition, we present an initialization scheme for the proposed algorithms and an implementation strategy for our system.

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can reconfigure the channel conditions, while the passive beamforming gain is limited by the severe double path-loss effect. Fortunately, active IRS (AIRS) is emerging to tackle obstacles by simultaneously adjusting the phase and amplitude of each reflection element. In this paper, we propose an AIRS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-relaying scheme, where the AIRS is equipped on the UAV to reflect the signal from the ground base station (GBS) to users via non-orthogonal multiple access. We jointly adjust beamforming vectors at the GBS, reflection matrix of the AIRS and UAV trajectory to maximize the average sum rate. However, the problem is non-convex. Thus, it is decomposed into three subproblems via block coordinate descent. The beamforming optimization at the GBS is transformed into a standard semidefinite program through semidefinite relaxation. Then, the reflection matrix of AIRS and UAV trajectory subproblems are solved through successive convex approximation. Ultimately, we design an iterative algorithm to effectively tackle the original problem. Simulation results are shown to verify the performance of designed scheme.}

	abstract = {This work proposes a covert communication scheme in a cognitive radio network where a secondary transmitter (ST) transmits confidential information to a secondary receiver under the cover of jammers with homogeneous Poisson point process. Specifically, we first analyze the detection performance of the primary transmitter (PT) and Willie under collaboration and non-collaboration modes. We then derive the covert transmission outage probability under ST’s correct and incorrect decisions for whether PT transmits or not and obtain the expression for the effective covert rate (ECR). In order to maximize the ECR, we derive the optimal value of the time allocation ratio, based on which, we also derive the optimal value of ST’s transmit power subject to the covertness constraint and some power constraints. Our examination shows the non-collaboration mode outperforms the collaboration mode in terms of achieving a higher ECR, because the uncertainty of the PT’s transmission in the former one will cause confusion at Willie and lead to an increased detection error rate. In addition, the proposed scheme effectively increases the ECR when compared with the scheme without the jammer.}

	abstract = {The natural integration of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and terahertz (THz) communications can potentially establish Tbps data links for 6G networks. However, due to the extremely large array aperture and wide bandwidth, a new phenomenon termed as “near-field beam split” emerges. This phenomenon causes beams at different frequencies to focus on distinct physical locations, leading to a significant loss of the beamforming gain. To address this challenging problem, we first harness a piecewise-far-field channel model to approximate the complicated near-field wideband channel. In this model, the entire large array is partitioned into several small sub-arrays. While the wireless channel’s phase discrepancy across the entire array is modeled as near-field spherical, the phase discrepancy within each sub-array is approximated as far-field planar. Built on this approximation, a phase-delay focusing (PDF) method employing delay phase precoding (DPP) architecture is proposed. Our PDF method could compensate for the intra-array far-field phase discrepancy and the inter-array near-field phase discrepancy via the joint control of phase shifters and time delayers, respectively. Theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PDF method in mitigating the near-field beam split effect. Finally, we define and derive a novel metric termed as the “effective Rayleigh distance” by the evaluation of beamforming gain loss. Compared to classical Rayleigh distance, the effective Rayleigh distance is more accurate in determining the near-field range for practical communications.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been regarded as an efficient technology to enhance the network performance. Since the IRS can assist transmitters to communicate in a directional reflection way, its deployment usually has a strong correlation with the locations of transmitters. In order to well capture the directional transmission and the spatial correlation while guaranteeing the analytical tractability, we propose an IRS-assisted network model based on a Gauss-Poisson process and a simple yet effective IRS reflected model. Under this setup, we derive the success probabilities for two association policies, namely the dedicated transmitter-receiver pairs with fixed-distance and the nearest associations. To highlight the impact of the IRS, we also derive the success probabilities of three special cases, i.e., without deploying IRSs, ignoring the IRS interference, and blocked direct link between transceivers. The results show that deploying IRS improves the success probability, especially in the cases of IRSs deployed near the transmitters and blocked direct link, and the IRS interference cannot be ignored which becomes the bottleneck factor in the case of transmitters equipped with massive antenna arrays. Owing to the proposed model, the impact of the correlation between IRSs and transmitters is well studied, which provides useful guidance for integrating IRSs into wireless networks.}

	abstract = {We present a factor graph formulation and particle-based sum-product algorithm for robust localization and tracking in multipath-prone environments. The proposed sequential algorithm jointly estimates the mobile agent’s position together with a time-varying number of multipath components (MPCs). The MPCs are represented by “delay biases” corresponding to the offset between line-of-sight (LOS) component delay and the respective delays of all detectable MPCs. The delay biases of the MPCs capture the geometric features of the propagation environment with respect to the mobile agent. Therefore, they can provide position-related information contained in the MPCs without explicitly building a map of the environment. We demonstrate that the position-related information enables the algorithm to provide high-accuracy position estimates even in fully obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) situations. Using simulated and real measurements in different scenarios we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multipath-aided tracking algorithms and show that the performance of our algorithm constantly attains the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (P-CRLB). Furthermore, we demonstrate the implicit capability of the proposed method to identify unreliable measurements and, thus, to mitigate lost tracks.}

	abstract = {Due to the uncertainty of non-cooperative communication channels, the received signals often contain various impairment factors, leading to a significant decline in the performance of existing deep learning (DL)-based automatic modulation classification (AMC) models. Several preliminary works utilize domain adaptation (DA) to alleviate this issue, however, they are constrained by singular domain difference factor, whereas in practice, these factors often manifest cumulatively. Therefore, this paper introduce a more realistic task named superimposed DA, where multiple domain difference factors are overlaid, reflecting the cumulative nature of them. We propose the SigDA as a solution framework, which adopts adversarial training to align the data distribution in different domains. Two technical modules, Multi-task based Masked Signal Feature Extractor (M2SFE) and Signal Feature Pyramid Aggregation (SFPA), are innovatively designed in SigDA. M2SFE utilizes mask and reconstruction task to enhance feature extraction and achieves discriminative feature selection through the design of feature mapping layers, while SFPA can solve the problem of inconsistent signal length in superimposed DA and can aggregate the features of signals into the same dimension. We consider and superimpose various typical signal domain difference factors, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve significant performance improvement in various communication channels.}

In this work, we exploit SIM to enable transmit precoding and receiver combining in holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) communications, and we study the achievable rate by formulating a joint optimization problem of the SIM phase shifts at both sides of the transceiver and the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal. Notably, we propose its solution by means of an iterative optimization algorithm that relies on the projected gradient method, and accounts for all optimization parameters simultaneously. We also obtain the step size guaranteeing the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results provide fundamental insights such the performance improvements compared to the single-RIS counterpart and conventional MIMO system.

Despite its great potential, RIS faces new challenges in integrating efficiently into wireless networks, including reflection optimization, channel estimation (CE), and optimization of deployment locations. This paper presents and analyzes a CE solution in RIS-assisted systems using compressive sensing techniques. The steering vector and the complex channel gains of the base station (BS)-RIS/user equipment (UE)-RIS links are estimated separately by using the matching pursuit with phase rotation (MP-PR) by deploying a few active elements at the RIS panel. The performance and complexity of the proposed method are comprehensively analyzed in different scenarios and compared against those of several other related methods in the literature. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves better (or at least very similar) performance compared to other relevant techniques but with a significant decrease in computational complexity.}

	abstract = {The array design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in a line-of-sight (LoS) environment is investigated. Properly designed uniform array configurations at the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) can extract maximum spatial multiplexing gain only for a fixed transmit distance between the Tx and Rx arrays and for a fixed orientation of the arrays. However, such designs suffer from significant capacity variations when the position and/or orientation of the arrays is modified. To alleviate this, we examine robust, joint design of non-uniform Tx and Rx arrays, where the minimum capacity over a range of varying array positions and orientations is maximized. First, we show that, by leveraging convex relaxation, the joint Tx and Rx array design problem can be solved with convex optimization techniques in an iterative manner. Moreover, an alternative design method based on dynamic programming (DP) is proposed, which is shown to outperform the convex optimization approach. As the DP algorithm is quite demanding in terms of computational complexity, a modified DP-based algorithm is also proposed, where the Tx and Rx arrays are designed to have the same configuration. It is shown that the resulting non-uniform array configurations with the proposed designs outperform both uniform and non-uniform array designs of the literature in terms of the system robustness.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the joint downlink delay-aware scheduling in a large time span, where the rotation of User Equipments (UEs) may lead to significant channel variation, is investigated via a novel approximate Markov Decision Process (MDP) method. Specifically, we consider the joint downlink power allocation and receiving UE selection of a number of successive frames in a millimeter Wave (mmWave) system with quasi-static scattering clusters in the channel and rotating UEs. The propagation statistics of scattering clusters can be tracked via a learning method. Since the rotation of UEs can be detected, future channel statistics can be forecast via embedded motion sensors. Hence, the overall scheduling is formulated as a finite-horizon MDP with non-stationary predictable state transition probabilities, where the average queuing delay and probability of transmission buffer overflow are considered in the objective of scheduling optimization. A novel low-complexity solution framework with an analytical performance bound is proposed to save the efforts of value iteration. Benefiting from the forecast of system statistics, superior performance to the benchmarks is shown by numerical simulations, particularly in the suppression of buffer overflow rate. Preliminary experiments via an mmWave testbed are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor-assisted mmWave beam alignment.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been demonstrated to be a prominent component for wireless communications. In this work, we consider an emergency communication scenario wherein a UAV-based relay system collects data from ground users, and then uses different UAV-enabled virtual antenna arrays (UVAAs) to transmit the collected data to several remote base stations (BSs) via collaborative beamforming (CB). However, several adjacent aerial users (AUs) are carrying out other missions at the same time, which may be interfered by the signal transmitted by the UVAAs. Thus, we formulate a reliable and energy-efficient communication multi-objective optimization problem (RECMOP) to jointly maximize the minimum receiving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the BSs, minimize the maximum average receiving SNR of the AUs, and minimize the propulsion power consumption of the UAVs, so that diminishing the energy cost while enhancing the system performance. The formulated RECMOP is intricate since it is proven to be NP-hard and non-convex. Therefore, an improved multi-objective gravitational search algorithm (IMOGSA) with several specific designs is proposed to handle the formulated problem. Simulation results manifest that the proposed IMOGSA can effectively solve the formulated RECMOP, and it outperforms other benchmarks in both smaller and larger scale UAV networks. Moreover, extended simulation demonstrates the robustness of the proposed CB-based approach under several unexpected circumstances.}

	abstract = {Physical-layer security (PLS) is a promising technique to complement more traditional means of communication security in beyond-5G wireless networks. However, studies of PLS are often based on ideal assumptions such as infinite coding blocklengths or perfect knowledge of the wiretap link’s channel state information (CSI). In this work, we study the performance of finite blocklength (FBL) transmissions using a new secrecy metric — the average information leakage (AIL). We evaluate the exact and approximate AIL with Gaussian signaling and arbitrary fading channels, assuming that the eavesdropper’s instantaneous CSI is unknown. We then conduct case studies that use artificial noise (AN) beamforming to analyze the AIL in both Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. The accuracy of the analytical expressions is verified through extensive simulations, and various insights regarding the impact of key system parameters on the AIL are obtained. Particularly, our results reveal that allowing a small level of AIL can potentially lead to significant reliability enhancements. To improve the system performance, we formulate and solve an average secrecy throughput (AST) optimization problem via both non-adaptive and adaptive design strategies. Our findings highlight the significance of blocklength design and AN power allocation, as well as the impact of their trade-off on the AST.}

The model is constructed based on datasets for sub-6 GHz macro cellular networks but it is general enough to be applicable to millimeter-wave networks as well. On the one hand, performance metrics are calculated for \\beta\n-Ginibre point processes which are shown to faithfully model a large number of motion-invariant networks. On the other hand, performance metrics are derived for inhomogeneous Poisson point processes with a radial intensity measure, which are shown to be a good approximation for motion-variant networks. For both cases, joint and marginal distributions of the EMFE and the coverage, and the first moments of the EMFE are provided and validated by Monte Carlo simulations using realistic sets of parameters from two sub-6 GHz macro urban cellular networks, i.e., 5G NR 2100 (Paris, France) and LTE 1800 (Brussels, Belgium) datasets.

	abstract = {Ideally, the bi-directional channel in time division duplex (TDD) millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems exhibits reciprocity. However, the involvement of low-cost and non-ideal radio frequency (RF) chains disrupts this reciprocity. Consequently, prior to fully leveraging the advantage of channel reciprocity, it is essential to implement channel calibration. Despite numerous over-the-air calibration methods, such as Argos, the typical least square (LS) are proposed in the literature, none of their criteria directly focus on the calibration performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel deep learning based approach that aims to optimize the calibration performance and introduce device-level intelligence toward 6G networks. To be specific, two cascaded modules are designed in a model-assisted end-to-end manner. Firstly, we propose the double-CNN-based channel denoising module for joint bi-directional channel estimation by exploiting the characteristics of mmWave channel. Secondly, the deep calibration learning module is meticulously designed to obtain the calibration coefficients with the aid of assisted model. This traceable assisted model is established by leveraging the expert knowledge of calibration process, based on which the MetrNet and the CaliNet are designed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing calibration methods. Particularly, additional simulations and analysis are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the two properly designed modules.}

	abstract = {Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a crucial task in the field of wireless communication, allowing for the identification of the modulation scheme of a received radio signal without prior knowledge of the communication system. Recently, AMC approaches based on Deep Learning (DL) have achieved outstanding results. However, the majority of current DL-based AMC methods face challenges in achieving high recognition accuracy while remaining computationally efficient. Some researchers have designed autoencoder-based models to generate low-dimensional temporal feature embeddings of the radio signal, thereby reducing the number of model parameters while maintaining high performance in recognizing modulation formats. However, when further improving AMC performance via learning low-dimensional spatial-temporal feature representations, traditional autoencoder models require both a convolutional decoder and an LSTM decoder to reconstruct temporal and spatial features separately, which unavoidably raises the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal feature sharing reconstructing network (STARNet) to simultaneously extract low-dimensional spatial and temporal feature representations of radio signals using a single autoencoder structure, thereby reducing the number of model parameters and improving AMC performance. Additionally, we construct a Hybrid Attentive Ghost (HA-Ghost) to automatically extract discriminative radio signal spatial information according to signal reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed STARNet achieves an average modulation classification accuracy of 63.64%, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. Despite extracting more types of features, STARNet has only 14,860 parameters, which is smaller than existing spatiotemporal autoencoder-based methods.}

In this paper, we maximize the information-theoretic achievable rate of a multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system with wideband matching constraints. Using a multiport circuit theory approach with frequency-selective scattering parameters, we propose a general framework for optimizing the MISO achievable rate that incorporates Bode-Fano wideband matching theory. We express the solution to the achievable rate optimization problem in terms of the optimized transmission coefficient and the Lagrangian parameters corresponding to the Bode-Fano inequality constraints. We apply this framework to a single electric Chu’s antenna and an array of dipole antennas. We compare the optimized achievable rate obtained numerically with other benchmarks like the ideal achievable rate computed by disregarding matching constraints and the achievable rate obtained by using sub-optimal matching strategies like conjugate matching and frequency-flat transmission. We also propose a practical methodology to approximate the achievable rate bound by using the optimal transmission coefficient to derive a physically realizable matching network through the ADS software.}

	abstract = {Owing to the abundance of onboard energy and wide coverage, fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (FW-UAVs) have better capabilities to serve as aerial base stations, thereby extending communication coverage and improving the performance of ground wireless communication networks. Therefore, the FW-UAV is regarded as one of the essential components of the sixth-generation (6G) communication networks. However, due to its inability to hover, a single FW-UAV may only serve a few mobile users (MUs) at a given time which introduces challenges in ensuring uninterrupted service. Additionally, the limited communication resource further impacts the quality of service (QoS). In order to improve the QoS and guarantee the uninterrupted services of the MUs that are located in a wide range, we consider a multi-FW-UAV communication network to maximize the cumulative throughput by optimizing the trajectory, power control, user association, and subcarrier allocation policy jointly. Since the above problem is non-convex, we first decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems i.e., the trajectory optimization subproblem and the power control, user association, and subcarrier allocation policy optimization subproblem. Then, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL)-based joint optimization scheme is proposed to optimize the two subproblems jointly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can maximize the cumulative throughput and gain superior performance compared to the benchmark schemes.}

This study proposes a multi-domain correlation-aided implicit CSI feedback framework that uses deep learning. This framework retains the existing implicit feedback mechanism while introducing the aid of the multi-domain correlation property of CSI matrices to the feedback process for performance improvement. First, a time correlation-aided implicit feedback framework is proposed, where the correlation among adjacent CSI matrices is exploited to improve the CSI reconstruction accuracy. Second, to utilize the correlation between the uplink and downlink channel, the uplink channel magnitude is introduced into the CSI reconstruction process at the base station. Additionally, the framework combines the aid of time and bidirectional channel correlation properties to further enhance performance. Simulation results show that, with the aid of the multi-domain correlation property, the feedback overhead can be reduced by 75% and 85% compared to approaches without correlation utilization and Type II codebook, respectively.}

Moreover, the study also takes into account the dynamic interference experienced by UEs due to different uploading completion times during the computation offloading process. To efficiently address the considered non-convex problem, we split it into four subproblems, i.e., UAV deployment, MEC server selection, computation resource and task ratio allocation, and power allocation subproblems, and solve them iteratively. Specifically, the first one is solved by three-dimensional-strategy iterative weekly acyclic game, the second one is addressed by Markov Approximation approach in which the third one is solved by the interior point method at each iteration, and the last one is solved by whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Finally, extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and results have shown the approach can effectively mitigate the effect of blockage on mmWave transmissions and reduce the total latency of all UEs, particularly in scenarios where the communication bandwidth is limited or data volumes of tasks are large.}

Here, the target, referred to as Eve, is a potential eavesdropper with the intention of intercepting both the downlink and the uplink information. The security problem of the full-duplex ISAC system has not been studied well, where the sensing and communication signals suffer from the serious interference. In this paper, we jointly design the information beamformer, the radar waveform, the uplink communication receive filter, and the radar receive filter to achieve the downlink and uplink communication security and the target tracking. Specifically, both the Eve’s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio minimization and the secrecy rate maximization problems, subject to the sensing and the communication constraints, are formulated for the ISAC system from the perspectives of the quality of service and the secrecy rate. An iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated problems. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, the proposed iterative algorithm converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimal point of the original problem without the rank 1 constraint. We further extend the joint design to the case of the imperfect wiretap channel and the angle uncertainty. Numerical results show that our scheme remarkably outperforms the benchmark approaches. The performance is close to that of designing the secure communication and the sensing separately.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has become a cost-effective solution for constructing a smart and adaptive radio environment. Most previous works on IRS have jointly designed the active and passive precoding based on perfectly or partially known channel state information (CSI). However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, it is imperative to explore more effective methods for leveraging IRS to enhance communication reliability without the need for any CSI. In this paper, we investigate an innovative IRS-aided multiuser communication system, which integrates an IRS with its aided multi-antenna base station (BS) to simultaneously serve multiple high-mobility users through transmit diversity and multiple low-mobility users through active/passive precoding. In specific, we first reveal that when dynamically tuning the IRS’s common phase-shift shared with all reflecting elements, its passive precoding gain to any low-mobility user remains unchanged. Inspired by this property, we utilize the design of common phase-shift at the IRS for achieving transmit diversity to serve high-mobility users, yet without requiring any CSI at the BS. Meanwhile, the active/passive precoding design is incorporated into the IRS-integrated BS to serve low-mobility users (assuming the CSI is known). Then, taking into account the interference among different users, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem of the IRS’s reflect precoding and the BS’s transmit precoding, with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power at the BS. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed co-design of transmit diversity and active/passive precoding in IRS-aided multiuser systems can achieve superior and desirable performance compared to other benchmarks.}

Existing studies mainly focus on the deployment and resource allocation of a single IRS instead of multiple IRSs, whereas it is extremely challenging for joint multi-IRS multi-user association in UAV communications with constrained reflecting resources and dynamic scenarios. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a new optimization algorithm for joint IRS-user association, trajectory optimization of UAVs, successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order scheduling and power allocation to maximize system energy efficiency. We first propose an inverse soft-Q learning-based algorithm to optimize multi-IRS multi-user association. Then, successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach-based algorithm are leveraged to optimize UAV trajectory followed by the optimization of SIC decoding order scheduling and power allocation. Finally, theoretical analysis and performance results show significant advantages of the designed algorithm in convergence rate and energy efficiency.}

	abstract = {Preemptive scheduling efficiently addresses the coexistence of enhanced Mobile Broad Band (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). While URLLC puncturing influences eMBB performance, further investigation is necessary to study the trade-offs between stability, delay, and efficiency. However, existing studies overlook the imbalance in eMBB/URLLC load distribution and personalized fluctuations in eMBB performance, leading to sub-optimal results. To tackle this, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay-assisted eMBB/URLLC multiplexing framework. Specifically, considering the utilization of UAVs for connecting separated next-generation Node Bs (gNBs) and the individual subject experience of services, we first formulate the multiplexing problem as an optimization problem. The objective is to maximize eMBB throughput and minimize personalized fluctuations in eMBB performance and UAV consumption, subject to URLLC constraints. Then, the challenging problem is decomposed into the eMBB problem and the URLLC problem. For the former, we further decompose it into three sub-problems and solve them using optimization methods. For the latter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to obtain an optimal strategy for relaying and puncturing URLLC into eMBB intelligently. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposals outperform benchmark schemes regarding eMBB throughput, UAV consumption, eMBB performance fluctuation, URLLC satisfaction, and learning efficiency.}

To model the transmission propagation in multi-UAV integrated channels more accurately, the single-bouncing transmissions and multi-bouncing transmissions in multi-UAV integrated channels are simultaneously modeled and quantified by a cooperative cluster density index for the first time. Meanwhile, the transmissions through line-of-sight (LoS), ground reflection, single-bouncing, and multi-bouncing are captured. To jointly mimic cooperative S-A-T consistency and S-A-T-F non-stationarity in the integrated scattering environment (SE), a new cooperative consistent and non-stationary modeling algorithm is developed based on the frequency-dependent path gain, visibility region (VR), and birth-death (BD) survival probability. The channel parameters related to multi-UAVs are also taken into account in the developed algorithm. The corresponding multi-UAV cooperative channel statistical properties are derived by taking mixed-bouncing transmission into account. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the mixed-bouncing based multi-UAV integrated channel model with cooperative S-A-T consistency and S-A-T-F non-stationarity is validated as simulation results match well with ray-tracing results.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has opened up numerous game-changing opportunities for future wireless systems. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot signals in ISAC systems to sense the electromagnetic (EM) property of the target and thus also identify the material of the target. Specifically, we first establish an end-to-end EM propagation model by means of Maxwell equations, where the EM property of the target is captured by a closed-form expression of the ISAC channel, incorporating the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the method of moments (MOM) for discretization. We then model the relative permittivity and conductivity distribution (RPCD) within a specified detection region. Based on the sensing model, we introduce a multi-frequency-based EM property sensing method by which the RPCD can be reconstructed from compressive sensing techniques that exploits the joint sparsity structure of the EM property vector. To improve the sensing accuracy, we design a beamforming strategy from the communications transmitter based on the Born approximation that can minimize the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix. The optimization problem is cast in terms of the Gram matrix and is solved iteratively to obtain the optimal beamforming matrix. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving high-quality RPCD reconstruction and accurate material classification. Furthermore, improvements in RPCD reconstruction quality and material classification accuracy are observed with increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or reduced target-transmitter distance.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) experience considerable control overhead, particularly problematic in mobile multi-user programmable wireless environments (PWEs). This paper presents a strategy that dynamically excludes shadowed RIS tiles from supporting non-line-of-sight mmWave communications, reducing overheads and enhancing RIS usage efficiency. Spatio-temporal variations caused by crowd mobility necessitate the dynamic adaption of this strategy. The primary challenge lies in identifying optimal occasions for updating RIS tile exclusion decisions, which must strike a balance between improving achievable channel gain (performance) and power consumption as well as controlling overhead (cost) associated with decision updates. Given the absence of a general mmWave channel model, this paper applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for managing the RIS exclusion strategy. DRL caters to the susceptibility of mmWave channels to concept drift, where spatio-temporal variations in crowd mobility alter the probability distribution of RIS channel gains and outages. To counter concept drift and generate a universal RIS exclusion strategy for any indoor mmWave environment, we propose an adaptive exclusion update mechanism powered by DRL. This mechanism utilizes hierarchical decision decomposition, reward signal embedding, and a fusion of concept drift and temporal features due to crowd mobility, enabling efficient adaptation to environmental changes. Extensive cross-validation confirms the agent’s impressive generalization ability, directly applicable to varied environments. This adaptive mechanism, despite containing only 2, 300 learnable parameters, achieves more than a two-fold increase in efficiency relative to static exclusion timing methods. Furthermore, decision execution, based on a low-cost RIS controller, only takes a few tens of nanoseconds, showcasing practicality and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered as a promising technology for enabling massive connectivity and achieving high spectral efficiency in future wireless communication. In the literature, most of the existing NOMA schemes are designed with the assumption of infinite blocklength, which may lead to suboptimal performance in practical communication systems. Thus, this paper investigates the downlink NOMA system with finite blocklength (FBL) transmission, namely the downlink FBL-NOMA system. We focus on developing a joint resource allocation scheme from single-channel to multi-channel systems, aiming at minimizing the average block error rate (BLER) for the downlink FBL-NOMA. Specifically, for single-channel systems, the optimal rate and power allocation scheme are derived in semi-closed form. For multi-channel systems, we conduct the convexity analysis of the minimum BLER problem and provide the optimal solution in waterfilling form for convex cases, as well as an efficient majorization-minimization (MM)-based algorithm for general cases. We also propose an efficient method to jointly optimize channel assignment, rate allocation, and power allocation for multi-channel FBL-NOMA systems. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed designs over the existing NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes in terms of reliability and efficiency.}

	abstract = {The existing works on ultraviolet (UV) channel modeling primarily focus on non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication scenarios, where the UV transceiver does not need to be aligned and can communicate around obstacles. However, NLoS scenarios also face problems such as long channel delay spread and severe path loss, and consequently, these phenomena will be exacerbated as the amount and dimension of obstacles increase. To tackle these problems, we investigate the channel models for UV diffused line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios comprehensively. First, a UV diffused-LoS channel model with an obstacle is put forward, where the radiation intensity distributions of UV light sources, the height difference between UV transceivers, as well as the obstacle dimension and orientation are incorporated to approach practical application scenarios. Besides, the channel modeling framework for diffused-LoS scenarios incorporating obstacles is investigated, where we take two obstacles as an example to illustrate the entire modeling process. Further, we validate the proposed models by comparing them with associated LoS and Monte-Carlo photon-tracing (MCPT) models via numerical calculations. The path loss results manifest that the proposed integration models agree well with the existing channel models, while their calculation time is much shorter than that of the MCPT model. Apart from that, the channel path loss and bit-error rate performance of diffused-LoS scenarios are superior to those of NLoS scenarios when obstacle reflection is apparent, and channel delay spreads of diffused-LoS scenarios are shorter than those of NLoS scenarios regardless of circumstances with one or two obstacles.}

	abstract = {With the increasing security concerns of the satellite network due to the broadcasting nature and the inherent openness of satellite-terrestrial communications, the satellite spectrum and terrestrial node resource trading based cooperation in cognitive satellite terrestrial networks (CSTNs) has gained a lot attention. However, the existing literature has not well considered the fairness issue in resource trading, which may cause cooperation failure between the satellite and terrestrial networks when their own benefits are impaired. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a two-layer hierarchical game framework for a multi-terrestrial base stations (BSs) CSTN scenario to guarantee the fairness of resource trading between the satellite and terrestrial networks and thus achieve a win-win situation for both networks. Specifically, a coalition formation game is adopted to study the cooperative behaviors among the terrestrial BSs. Herein, we propose a distributed merge-and-split based coalition formation algorithm to determine the coalition structure, of which the stability, convergence, and complexity are theoretically investigated. Moreover, a Stackelberg game is introduced to model the competition between the satellite and terrestrial BSs, where the satellite acts as the leader and the terrestrial BSs act as the followers. The Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the Stackelberg game is derived based on the backward induction method. We then design a distributed algorithm to obtain the coalition structure and SE for the proposed two-layer hierarchical game framework. Finally, simulations are presented to validate our theoretical results.}

	abstract = {The 4G/5G era in the past decades has witnessed the vigorous development of Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming (HBF) technologies in the field of communications under cellular Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. As an evolution, the B5G/6G has strong visions of high-accurate positioning capabilities other than the communication quality, thus a beam alignment method towards positioning enhancement is also urgently desired in cellular systems. To this end, this paper proposed a HBF method for positioning enhancement in cellular MIMO systems. We first derive the Fisher Information for multiple-path assisted positioning as the performance criterion of positioning under a wideband channel with both precoder and combiner considered. Then a HBF strategy is proposed to optimize such criterion over multiple resources involving the transmitting power, beam and frequency dimensions, which is referred to as Sensing Beamforming. Furthermore, a Newton based heuristic method is proposed for the estimation of sensing elements (e.g. angle of arrival) from multiple paths, and the positioning results are obtained by a proposed multiple-path assisted positioning method considering the multiple path clutters in the environment. The results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the positioning performance with the accurate estimation of sensing elements.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates physical layer secure communication in a wideband wireless system, where a base station (BS) equipped with an extremely large scale antenna array (ELAA) transmits confidential information to a legitimate receiver under the threat of a potential eavesdropper. Due to the high carrier frequency and large antenna aperture, both the receiver and eavesdropper lie in the near-field region of the BS. In order to mitigate the beam split effect and reduce the hardware cost, a true-time delayer-based hybrid beamfocusing architecture is designed. Then, a nonconvex sum secrecy capacity maximization problem (SSCM) is formulated for securing wideband communications. Based on alternating optimization, the SSCM is decomposed into three subproblems solved iteratively for designing the digital beamfocusing vectors, time delay matrices, and phase shift matrices on each subcarrier, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme yields significantly high secrecy capacity compared to benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness of our scheme in enhancing secure wideband communications and mitigating the beam split effects.}

	abstract = {With the rapidly increasing number of satellites, the handover scheme design is critically important for the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, especially for the mega-constellations that include massive number of LEO satellites. However, the existing handover schemes for LEO satellite networks are designed based on the static propagation conditions, which cannot satisfy the dynamic feature of communication environment caused by the mobility of LEO satellites and users. To address this issue, a centralized adaptive intelligent handover scheme for mega-constellations is proposed, where the dynamics of the propagation conditions and limited LEO satellite capacity are taken into considerations. Specifically, we first use a three-state Markov model to characterize the dynamically varying propagation conditions between satellites and users. Then, the Loo model is employed to describe the dynamic land mobile satellite channels. By considering the user transmission rate requirement and the load-balancing demand of satellites, we design the user utility function and formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the overall long-term utility of the network. To reduce the handover decision-making complexity, a multi-agent successive hysteretic deep Q-learning algorithm is developed and it can efficiently solve the formulated problem by reducing the state and action space. To reduce the signaling overhead and the computation complexity of the proposed centralized handover scheme brought to the control center, a distributed intelligent handover scheme is further developed, where each user is enabled to independently make the handover decision only based on the local information. Simulation results show that both the proposed centralized and distributed approaches can efficiently improve the network performance over the existing schemes.}

	abstract = {We consider a multi-way massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) relaying system wherein a relay aids multi-way data exchange between multiple users by employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The relay achieves this by superposing different user signals in the power domain. Each user then sequentially decodes the data of all other users by performing successive interference cancellation (SIC). To perform SIC, a user utilizes the downlink channel information, which it estimates using the precoded pilots transmitted by the relay. We derive a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression for this downlink-pilot-aided NOMA multi-way relaying system by considering spatially-correlated channels, and imperfect SIC at the user. We next design two algorithms to maximize this SE by optimally allocating the user transmit powers and the NOMA variables. Both these algorithms provide a similar SE, but the latter one, due to its closed-form power updates, has a much lesser complexity. The efficacy of downlink pilots in multi-way NOMA relaying, with practical correlated Rayleigh-faded channels, is shown by demonstrating that they vastly outperform the case when users perform SIC using channel statistics.}

	abstract = {Traditional wisdom for network resource management allocates separate frequency-time resources for measurement and data transmission tasks. As a result, the two types of tasks have to compete for resources, and a heavy measurement task inevitably reduces available resources for data transmission. This prevents interference graph estimation (IGE), a heavy yet important measurement task, from being widely used in practice. To resolve this issue, we propose to use power as a new dimension for interference measurement in full-duplex millimeter-wave backhaul networks, such that data transmission and measurement can be done simultaneously using the same frequency-time resources. Our core insight is to consider the mmWave network as a linear system, where the received power of a node is a linear combination of the channel gains. By controlling the powers of transmitters, we can find unique solutions for the channel gains of interference links and use them to estimate the interference. To accomplish resource allocation and IGE simultaneously, we jointly optimize resource allocation and IGE with power control. Extensive simulations show that significant links in the interference graph can be accurately estimated with minimal extra power consumption, independent of the time and carrier frequency offsets between nodes.}

It is validated in previous works that the performance of fully centralized uplink in a cell-free network overwhelms uplink methods without or with limited coordination. On the other hand, a fully centralized uplink requires extremely high costs on backhaul links and computation capacity on the central processing unit (CPU), which is impractical in a widely deployed large cell-free network. To handle the mentioned problems, the relation between centralized uplink and group sliced distributed uplink is revealed, firstly. With the uniform framework compatible with previous fully centralized and fully distributed minimal mean square error (MMSE) equalization, two theorems are derived as group-joint MMSE complementary and the column space equivalence, which indicate the relation between the local optimal and the global optimal and can include conclusions achieved in previous works. Both computation and backhaul signaling overheads are distributed among the whole network. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of proposed methods based on the derived complementary kernel.}

The transmission power of the base station and the phase shifts of the RIS are jointly devised to maximize the weighted sum rate while considering the spatially correlation and channel estimation errors. Firstly, the relationship between the channel estimation error and spatially correlated RIS’s elements is revealed by using the linear minimum mean square error. Secondly, based on the maximum-ratio transmission precoding, a tight lower bound of the rate under short packet transmission is derived. Finally, the NP-hard problem is decomposed into two optimization problems, where the transmission power is obtained by geometric programming and phase shifts are designed by using gradient ascent method. Besides, we have rigorously proved that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to a sub-optimal solution with low complexity. Simulation results confirm the tightness between the analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the two-timescale scheme provides a practical solution for the short packet transmission.}

	abstract = {This article introduces a novel lightweight framework using ambient backscattering communications to counter eavesdroppers. In particular, our framework divides an original message into two parts. The first part, i.e., the active-transmit message, is transmitted by the transmitter using conventional RF signals. Simultaneously, the second part, i.e., the backscatter message, is transmitted by an ambient backscatter tag that backscatters upon the active signals emitted by the transmitter. Notably, the backscatter tag does not generate its own signal, making it difficult for an eavesdropper to detect the backscattered signals unless they have prior knowledge of the system. Here, we assume that without decoding/knowing the backscatter message, the eavesdropper is unable to decode the original message. Even in scenarios where the eavesdropper can capture both messages, reconstructing the original message is a complex task without understanding the intricacies of the message-splitting mechanism. A challenge in our proposed framework is to effectively decode the backscattered signals at the receiver, often accomplished using the maximum likelihood (MLK) approach. However, such a method may require a complex mathematical model together with perfect channel state information (CSI). To address this issue, we develop a novel deep meta-learning-based signal detector that can not only effectively decode the weak backscattered signals without requiring perfect CSI but also quickly adapt to a new wireless environment with very little knowledge. Simulation results show that our proposed learning approach, without requiring perfect CSI and complex mathematical model, can achieve a bit error ratio close to that of the MLK-based approach. They also clearly show the efficiency of the proposed approach in dealing with eavesdropping attacks and the lack of training data for deep learning models in practical scenarios.}

	abstract = {Hybrid beamforming is a promising technology for enhancing the energy- and spectral-efficiency of wireless networks with large-scale antenna arrays, yet the current designs fall short of concurrently achieving low computational complexity and high communication scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable and effective hybrid beamforming framework for multi-user systems, where the bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) is leveraged to exploit the graph topological structure for sum-rate maximization. To capture permutation properties of the sum-rate maximization problem, we model the wireless network as a bipartite graph, where two disjoint sets of vertices respectively model users and radio frequency (RF) chains, and the edges connecting adjacent vertices characterize interactions between users and RF chains. Based on the bipartite graph, we partition the hybrid beamforming optimization into the updates of feature vectors at user and RF chain vertices, which are realized by alternately activating four kinds of vertex operators that constitute the proposed BGNN. The inputs and outputs of each vertex operator are specifically designed to be independent of the user number and RF chain number in terms of dimension. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed BGNN framework from the perspectives of achievable sum rate, computation complexity, and scalability.}

This paper studies quality of experience (QoE)-oriented resource allocation in MEC while considering user diversity, limited resources, and the complex relationship between allocated resources and user experience. We introduce a closed-loop online resource allocation (CORA) framework to tackle this problem. It learns the objective function of resource allocation from the historical dataset and updates the learned model using the online testing results. Due to the learned objective model is typically non-convex and challenging to solve in real-time, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term average constraint and apply the prime-dual method to solve this decoupled resource allocation problem. Thereafter, we put forth a data-driven optimal online queue resource allocation (OOQRA) algorithm and a data-driven robust OQRA (ROQRA) algorithm for homogenous and heterogeneous user cases, respectively. Moreover, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the OOQRA algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms using the synthesis and YouTube datasets. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the user complaint rate is reduced by up to 100% and 18% in the synthesis and YouTube datasets, respectively.}

	abstract = {Radio maps provide radio frequency metrics, such as the received signal strength, at every location of a geographic area. These maps, which are estimated using a set of measurements collected at multiple positions, find a wide range of applications in wireless communications, including the prediction of coverage holes, network planning, resource allocation, and path planning for mobile robots. Although a vast number of estimators have been proposed, the theoretical understanding of the radio map estimation (RME) problem has not been addressed. The present work aims at filling this gap along two directions. First, the complexity of the set of radio map functions is quantified by means of lower and upper bounds on their spatial variability, which offers valuable insight into the required spatial distribution of measurements and the estimators that can be used. Second, the reconstruction error for power maps in free space is upper bounded for three conventional spatial interpolators. The proximity coefficient, which is a decreasing function of the distance from the transmitters to the mapped region, is proposed to quantify the complexity of the RME problem. Numerical experiments assess the tightness of the obtained bounds and the validity of the main takeaways in complex environments.}

	abstract = {Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is an emerging and powerful multiple access scheme that relies on splitting and encoding user messages encoded into common and private streams, so as to partially decode multi-user interference and partially treat it as noise. In this paper, the secrecy rate constraint of each user is taken into consideration and a RSMA-based secure beamforming approach is proposed to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR). A generalized receiver model is considered where each user is also a potential eavesdropper wiretapping confidential messages for other users after decoding its own message. To solve the intractable non-convexity caused by security constraints in the formulated problem, a novel joint weighted minimum mean square error and successive convex approximation based alternate optimization algorithm is proposed and extended to maximize the instantaneous WSR with perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and the weighted ergodic sum-rate with imperfect CSIT. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design, which significantly improve the sum-rate performance and robustness to channel errors while guaranteeing message confidentiality and also unveil a better trade-off between message confidentiality and sum-rate performance thanks to its powerful interference management capability.}

This paper introduces a new cross-layer low-complexity scheme for the online optimization of RIS-assisted communication systems. It jointly combines BS and RIS configuration and fair UEs’ scheduling which is critical for high-performance deployments. A RIS beam synthesis method is especially proposed for RIS configuration. The proposed solution embeds two nested control loops: i) a fast control loop working at the OFDMA slot scale and consisting in a standard UEs proportional fair scheduler, and ii) a slow control loop operating at the OFDMA frame scale which adapts the RIS’ configuration to the UEs’ spatial distribution and maximizes the UEs’ aggregated performance. The slow control loop is based on an online stochastic approximation algorithm whose convergence to the optimal restpoint is proved. In a reference scenario, the proposed scheduler achieves a gain of 47% in mean spectral efficiency for NLOS UEs over a baseline scheme.}

By exploiting the unique modular array architecture and considering the potential near-field propagation, we develop sub-array based uniform spherical wave (USW) models for distinct versus common angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs) with respect to different sub-arrays/modules, respectively. Under such USW models, we analyze the beam focusing patterns at the near-field observation location by using near-field beamforming. The analysis reveals that compared to the conventional XL-MIMO with collocated antenna elements, modular XL-MIMO can provide better spatial resolution by benefiting from its larger array aperture. However, it also incurs undesired grating lobes due to the large inter-module separation. Moreover, it is found that for multi-user modular XL-MIMO communications, the achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for users may be degraded by the grating lobes of the beam focusing pattern. To address this issue, an efficient user grouping method is proposed for multi-user transmission scheduling, so that users located within the grating lobes of each other are not allocated to the same time-frequency resource block (RB) for their communications. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed user grouping method, as well as the superior performance of modular XL-MIMO over its collocated counterpart with densely distributed users.}

	abstract = {Edge artificial intelligence (AI) in the sixth-generation networks will provide inference services at the network edge to enrich the capabilities of mobile devices and lengthen their battery lives. As a well-known technique in computing, batching can boost the computation throughput at an edge server by assembling multiple tasks into a batch that is fed into a pre-trained prediction model. This reduces the memory-access frequency and hence accelerates the execution of each task. In this paper, we study joint batching and (task) scheduling to maximise the throughput (i.e., the number of completed tasks) under the practical assumptions of heterogeneous task arrivals and deadlines. The design aims to optimise the number of batches, their starting time instants, and the task-batch association that determines batch sizes. The joint optimisation problem is complex due to multiple coupled variables as mentioned and numerous constraints including heterogeneous tasks arrivals and deadlines, the causality requirements on multi-task execution, and limited radio resources. Our approach of solving the formulated mixed-integer problem is to transform it into a convex problem via integer relaxation method and \\ell _{0} -norm approximation. This results in an efficient alternating optimization algorithm for finding a close-to-optimal solution. Specifically, it iterates between solving two sub-problems, optimal task-batch association and optimal batch starting time. The former is a linear program whose solution can be found using a derived scheme of greedy task selection while that of the latter is derived in closed form. In addition, we also design the optimal algorithm from leveraging spectrum holes, which are caused by fixed bandwidth allocation to devices and their asynchronized multi-batch task execution, to admit unscheduled tasks so as to further enhance throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework of joint batching and resource allocation can substantially enhance the throughput of multiuser edge-AI as opposed to a number of benchmarking schemes.}

	abstract = {We investigate a new deployment form of reflective intelligent surface (RIS), which aims at enhancing the quality of service of a main communication system in a target region, while without the need of changing its transmission protocol and scheme (i.e., the RIS is “transparent” to the main system). To this end, we mathematically formulate a coverage enhancement problem, where a RIS is used transparently in the sense that the BS can be unaware of its existence, while the minimum channel link strength, measured from every BS antenna to any point in the target region, can be maximized. The formulated problem is non-convex with mixed discrete-continuous variables. To tackle this challenge, we recast it into a convex feasibility problem via spatial sampling and semi-definite relaxation. Based on a derived analytical upper bound on the link strength difference between any two location points, we further characterize the coverage-similarity region of a given location, and accordingly propose an improved spatial sampling scheme for efficient implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed transparent RIS design achieves better coverage performance than benchmark schemes. More importantly, it can effectively improve the communication performance without affecting the transmission scheme originally adopted by the main communication system.}

The ground users are equipped with multiple antennas and the ground-to-air propagation channels are subject to correlated Rician fading. To overcome huge signaling overhead in the fully-centralized detection in cell-free systems, we propose a two-layer distributed uplink detection scheme, where the uplink signals are first detected in AP-UAVs by using the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detector based on local channel state information (CSI), and then collected and weighted combined at the CPU-UAV to obtain the refined detection. By using the operator-valued free probability theory, the asymptotic expressions of the combining weights are obtained, which only depend on the statistical CSI and show excellent accuracy compared to the exact but intractable expressions. Based on the proposed scheme, we further investigate the impacts of different deployment scenarios on the spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that in urban and dense urban environments, it is more beneficial to deploy more AP-UAVs to increase SE. Nonetheless, in suburban environment, an optimal combination of the number of AP-UAVs and the number of antennas per AP-UAV exists to maximize SE.}

The objective of this paper is to provide further insight into the use of closely spaced antennas in the uplink and downlink of a multi-user Holographic MIMO system. To this end, we utilize multiport communication theory, which ensures physically consistent uplink and downlink models. We first consider a simple uplink scenario with two side-by-side half-wavelength dipoles, two users, and single-path line-of-sight propagation, and show both analytically and numerically that the receive array gain and average spectral efficiency strongly depend on the directions from which the signals are received and on the array matching network used. Numerical results are then used to extend the analysis to more practical scenarios involving a larger number of dipoles (arranged in a uniform linear array) and a larger number of users. The case where the antennas are densely packed in a space-constrained factor form is also considered. It is found that the spectral efficiency benefits from decreasing the antenna spacing if arrays of moderate size are considered, e.g., in the order of a few wavelengths. In comparison, Larger arrays with closely spaced antennas show only marginal improvements in spectral efficiency compared to half-wavelength arrays.}

In particular, a multi-antenna transmitter Alice transmits information to Bob, through UAV-RIS in the presence of an adversarial warden, whose channel state information (CSI) is not perfectly known at Alice. To simultaneously guarantee the covertness and the robustness, the minimum worst-case average covert transmission rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the beamforming vector, the phase shift vector and UAV trajectory. Moreover, the robust design of beamforming, phase shift and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory is formulated as a non-convex problem. To deal with the intractable optimization problem, an alternative optimization algorithm consisting of three subproblems is designed to deal with the joint optimization problem. The general sign-definiteness is utilized to transform the CSI uncertainty and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are proposed to transform non-convex constraints. Besides, considering the high complexity of the proposed SCA based algorithm, we further develop a low-complexity algorithm for a special case of perfect CSI scenario, where analytical expressions of the beamforming and phase shift are derived. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the noise uncertainty for hiding legitimate communication is not necessarily as high as possible for a large equivalent receiving power threshold \\beta and the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes.}

As only a subset of devices is capable of collecting data and performing local model update at any specific moment, the communication pattern between the edge server and devices is random and sporadic, which is referred to as sporadic local updates. This motivates us to adopt a two-phase grant-free random access scheme that consists of the activity detection and model transmission phases to facilitate efficient communication between the edge server and devices. We first provide the regret analysis for online federated learning, and derive the optimality gap in terms of successful transmission probabilities. Then, we characterize the achievable transmission rate of each active device using random matrix theory and establish the relationship between the pilot length and the outage probability. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pilot length design by minimizing the optimality gap. To validate our scheme, we provide comprehensive experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over traditional schemes in various online tasks.}

	abstract = {Radio imaging is rapidly gaining prominence in the design of future communication systems, with the potential to utilize reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as imaging apertures. Although the sparsity of targets in three-dimensional (3D) space has led most research to adopt compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging algorithms, these often require substantial computational and memory burdens. Drawing inspiration from conventional Fourier transform (FT)-based imaging methods, our research seeks to accelerate radio imaging in RIS-aided communication systems. To begin, we introduce a two-stage wavenumber domain 3D imaging technique: first, we modify RIS phase shifts to recover the equivalent channel response from the user equipment to the RIS array, subsequently employing traditional FT-based wavenumber domain methods to produce target images. We also determine the diffraction resolution limits of the system through k-space analysis, taking into account factors including system bandwidth, transmission direction, operating frequency, and the angle subtended by the RIS. Addressing the challenge of limited pilots in communication systems, we unveil an innovative algorithm that merges the strengths of both FT- and CS-based techniques by substituting the expansive sensing matrix with FT-based operators. Our simulation outcomes confirm that our proposed FT-based methods achieve high-quality images while demanding few time, memory, and communication resources.}

	abstract = {Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained growing research interests in sensing fields. While extensive efforts have been devoted to designing RIS space beamforming for improving sensing accuracy, the potential of RIS in improving sensing resolution has so far not been fully dug. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental performance of RIS-enabled multi-target sensing, and exploit the potential of RIS in simultaneously boosting resolution and accuracy. Specifically, based on the identification that sensing is to obtain target state information from the received echo signals, we adopt the sensing mutual information as the performance metric, thus enabling comprehensive evaluation of both sensing resolution and accuracy. Then, we derive the analytical expression of the sensing mutual information in our considered systems, revealing that in addition to providing beamforming gains to enhance sensing accuracy in the space domain, RIS can also flexibly vary its beamforming in the time domain to improve sensing resolution. Based on this result, we propose a novel space-time beamforming, in which space-domain and time-domain beamforming gains are utilized for enhancing sensing accuracy and resolution, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed space-time beamforming scheme over the traditional space-only beamforming scheme in terms of sensing resolution.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) can provide uniformly great service to user equipment (UE) by utilizing a large number of distributed access points (APs) connected to a single central processing unit (CPU). For addressing scalability and feasibility issues inherent in single-CPU CF-mMIMO systems, multiple-CPU CF-mMIMO (MC-CF-mMIMO) has been considered. However, the MC-CF-mMIMO system inevitably encounters performance degradation at the boundary area of the CPUs, referred to as the CPU edge. Cooperation among CPUs can improve the performance in the CPU edge region; however, scalability problems resurface owing to inter-CPU information sharing during the cooperation process. In this study, we propose a scalable CPU cooperation scheme that focuses on power control to address the performance degradation issue in the CPU edge region. Initially, we propose a policy estimation scheme for other CPUs to reduce the overhead of information sharing. Based on these estimated policies, each CPU can independently derive power control policies for the max-min optimization problem without simultaneous information sharing. Simulation results show that the proposed power control scheme achieves a performance improvement of up to 4.3234 dB in terms of CPU edge region performance and minimum spectral efficiency compared to baseline schemes based on the degree of CPU cooperation.}

While the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) released many standardizations to enhance SI protection for preventing users from false base station (FBS) attacks, most of them are centralized solutions which are vulnerable to potential attacks and single-point failures. To address the aforementioned issues, a blockchain-enabled SI protection (BeSI), as a compatible and effective secure access scheme, is developed in this work, which aims at guaranteeing the authenticity and reliability of SI by considering the features of blockchain in immutability, traceability, and decentralization. Then, we derive a mathematical framework to justify the superiority of using blockchain in SI protection. Moreover, by resorting to a Poisson point process as the geographical model for both base stations and FBSs, we thus theoretically analyze the security gain of blockchain and understand the impact of network parameters including redundancy rate, number of confirmation blocks, and the density of base stations. Finally, numerical results are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of BeSI.}

However, the issue of discarding the amplitude information by one-bit quantizers has to be compensated. Thus, carefully tailored methods need to be developed for one-bit channel estimation and data detection as the conventional ones cannot be used. To address these issues, the problems of one-bit channel estimation and data detection for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system that operates over uncorrelated frequency selective channels are investigated here. We first develop channel estimators that exploit Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and approximate versions of it as the so-called weak classifiers in an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) approach. Particularly, the combination of the approximate GDA classifiers with AdaBoost offers the benefit of scalability with the linear order of computations, which is critical in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. We then take advantage of the same idea for proposing the data detectors. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed channel estimators and data detectors compared to other methods. They show comparable/better performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods, but require dramatically lower computational complexities and run times.}

Yet, due to high-speed movement of the LEO satellite, it is challenging to acquire timely channel state information (CSI) and design effective multibeam precoding for various IoT applications. To this end, this paper provides a deep learning (DL)-based joint channel prediction and multibeam precoding scheme under adverse environments, e.g., high Doppler shift, long propagation delay, and low satellite payload. Specifically, this paper first designs a DL-based channel prediction scheme by using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM), which predicts the CSI of current time slot according to that of previous time slots. With the predicted CSI, this paper designs a DL-based robust multibeam precoding scheme by using a channel augmentation method based on variational auto-encoder (VAE). Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme in LEO satellite IoT.}

We demonstrate important scenarios where a model with a finite and deterministic number of streets, termed the binomial line process (BLP), is more accurate. We characterize the statistical properties of the BLP and the corresponding binomial line Cox process (BLCP) and apply them to analyze the performance of a network whose access points are deployed along the streets of a city. Such a deployment scenario will be typical for 5G and future wireless networks. In order to obtain a fine-grained insight into the network performance, we derive the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference and noise ratio. Accordingly, we investigate the mean local delay in transmissions and the density of successful transmission. These metrics, respectively, characterize the latency and coverage performance of the network and are key performance indicators of next-generation wireless systems.}

In this paper, user grouping is utilized to address these issues, by allocating users to groups based on frequency band division, preventing interference among users within different groups, and eliminating pilot contamination between different groups. We consider an uplink CF mMIMO-aided URLLC system with user grouping and derive the lower bound for the ergodic rate. Due to the limited blocklength of each group necessitating pilot reuse, a weight sum rate (WSR) maximum problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user grouping, pilot assignment, and power control. We propose a user grouping scheme based on graph theory, where iteratively searching for specific negative loops in the weighted directed graph can approach the optimal user grouping matrix. As the user grouping matrix updates at each iteration, we update the pilot assignment matrix based on graph theory and employ logarithmic function approximation and fractional programming for power control updates. Numerous numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of user grouping, and the proposed algorithm improves WSR by 25% compared to the non-grouping algorithm, while outperforming other benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {Accurate channel estimation plays a pivotal role in realizing the passive beamforming gain of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Multi-user RIS-assisted channels exhibit a common sparse structure in the angular domain, which offers the potential to enhance channel estimation performance. Nonetheless, most existing methods simply partition the multi-user channel estimation problem into multiple sub-problems, which regrettably neglect the exploitation of the shared property across different users. In this paper, we formulate a unified multi-user channel estimation problem and propose a computationally efficient message passing approach to jointly extract the common sparsity. We first introduce a new sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for joint multi-user RIS-assisted channel estimation, where some auxiliary variables and Dirac delta distributions are introduced to handle the intricate interplay of numerous unknown variables within the joint sparse channel representation. Subsequently, we devise a reassembled message passing algorithm for the associated joint Bayesian inference, incorporating a three-stage expected propagation approximation (EPA) procedure along with a novel reassembling technology to facilitate variable decoupling and ensure reliable sparse signal recovery. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art counterparts.}

In this paper, we quantitatively compare these two techniques, highlighting their essential differences as well as respectively suitable scenarios. We first examine both digital and analog transmission schemes, together with a unified and fair comparison framework under imbalanced device sampling, strict latency targets, and transmit power constraints. A universal convergence analysis under various imperfections is established for evaluating the performance of FL over wireless networks. These analytical results reveal that the fundamental difference between the digital and analog communications lies in whether communication and computation are jointly designed or not. The digital scheme decouples the communication design from FL computing tasks, making it difficult to support uplink transmission from massive devices with limited bandwidth and hence the performance is mainly communication-limited. In contrast, the analog communication allows over-the-air computation (AirComp) and achieves better spectrum utilization. However, the computation-oriented analog transmission reduces power efficiency, and its performance is sensitive to computation errors from imperfect channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, device sampling for both schemes are optimized and differences in sampling optimization are analyzed. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and affirm the superior performance of the sampling optimization.}

The whole unit is usually connected via the input/output port of each microstrip to the radio frequency (RF) chains of the baseband unit. Point-to-point (P2P) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is one of the most prominent wireless communication systems, with its use cases recently increasing with the booming of machine-to-machine communication. However, it is yet to be explored with DMAs. This work thus studies the achievable rate maximization of a DMA-based P2P MIMO system whose transmitter or receiver is equipped with DMA instead of traditional antennas. Noteworthy, this is the first work to analyze the deployment where both the BS and the user are equipped with DMA. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate how uplink and downlink communication can be achieved in each DMA deployment strategy. Finally, through the simulation results, the performance of our proposed designs is compared with various benchmark systems, such as conventional P2P and IRS-aided MIMO systems, where in both cases, it is shown that the proposed designs provide the best tradeoff in achieving high performance with significant RF chains reduction.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-based sensing technology has become increasingly important due to its exceptional maneuverability, versatile coverage capabilities, and reliable line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity. However, the sensing accuracy improvement by exploiting resource coordination strategy poses a new challenge on multi-UAV sensing system. In this paper, we consider the problem of cooperative sensing via a system of multi-UAV, where each UAV is equipped with a directional antenna to cooperatively conduct energy detection for several targets of interest. To measure the perception ability of the system, we choose the energy detection probability as the metric, aiming to maximize the sum detection probability of the network by jointly optimizing UAVs’ deployment, as well as the directional antenna orientations. By virtue of the specific problem structure, we recast the formulation into an equivalent yet more tractable form with the aid of auxiliary vectors. Subsequently, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for the solution based on the alternating direction penalty method (ADPM), which decomposes the formulated non-convex problem into multiple subproblems and solves them alternately. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and provide valuable insights for practical system design.}

	abstract = {On the heels of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, the recently discovered affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising waveform for the sixth-generation wireless network. In this paper, we study the widely-used embedded pilot-aided (EPA) channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output AFDM (MIMO-AFDM) system with fractional Doppler shifts. We first formulate the vectorized input-output relationship of MIMO-AFDM, and theoretically prove that MIMO-AFDM can achieve full diversity in doubly selective channels. Then we illustrate the implementation of EPA channel estimation in MIMO-AFDM and unveil that serious inter-Doppler interference (IDoI) occurs if we try to estimate the channel gain, delay shift, and Doppler shift of each propagation path. To address this issue, the diagonal reconstructability of AFDM subchannel matrix is studied and a low-complexity embedded pilot-aided diagonal reconstruction (EPA-DR) channel estimation scheme is proposed. The EPA-DR scheme calculates the AFDM effective channel matrix directly without estimating the three channel parameters, eliminating the severe IDoI inherently. Since the effective channel matrix is necessary for MIMO-AFDM receive processing, we believe this is an important step to bring AFDM towards practical communication systems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed EPA-DR scheme.}

	abstract = {Localization is becoming a fundamental requirement for various applications. For many Global Navigation Satellite Systems degraded environments, such as urban and indoor, localization based on the fingerprints of wireless signals has attracted increasing attentions. In this study, a fingerprint, which is based on the multipath channel features of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals, is designed and named as angle delay power spectrum (ADPS). The ADPS is constructed by using the proposed angle domain Fourier transform and delay domain Fourier transform. It can exhibit the signatures of arrival angle and delay of the received signals in the multipath channel more clearly. Next, an adjustable weight weighted K-nearest neighbor (AWKNN) algorithm along with a cosine similarity criterion is utilized to perform the pattern matching localization with the ADPS fingerprints. By introducing the adjustable ability for the K value of the traditional WKNN methods, the AWKNN can obtain a better positioning accuracy. Simulation and real-test results based on public databases prove the superiority of the proposed method to the traditional ones.}

Millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) can help systems to achieve high-quality communication and generate high-directional beams to assist positioning. In this paper, the proposed Structured Perturbed Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SPOMP) could alleviate the pilot pollution in massive MIMO systems and break the resolution of angular estimation. Based on the above super-resolution estimation, we develop a dynamic two-stage multi-cell user grouping scheme to reduce interference and improve resource utilization. Combined with the grouping results and our derived performance metric, a joint optimization problem for power and bandwidth allocation is proposed to maximize the comprehensive performance of joint communication and positioning while guaranteeing performance bounds. An effective cyclic iteration algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is present to solve the proposed optimization problem. Numerical results show that the proposed joint user grouping and resource allocation scheme achieves a larger rate-accuracy region and a better multi-cell service performance balance compared to conventional schemes.}

	abstract = {Heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets), where networks are deployed with ultra-dense small cells (SCs), is one of the main enabling technologies for future wireless networks. In such networks, signals are vulnerable to severe blockage, interference, and intermittent connectivity. This can be largely overcome using the emerging Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology that can enhance HetNets performance by controlling the propagation environment. However, jointly optimizing the parameters of base stations’ (BSs’) active beamforming and RISs’ passive beamforming is a major challenge in RIS-empowered HetNets. In this paper, we investigate the issue of rate control in RIS-empowered multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) HetNets via joint users’ equipment (UEs) rate fairness and SCs rate load balancing. We assume RIS-assisted SC BSs at mmWave underlying a RIS-assisted macrocell (MC) BS at sub-6GHz serving dual-connectivity UEs that can concurrently connect to the MC BS and a single SC BS. Then, we formulate an optimization problem whose objective is to jointly optimize the active transmit beamforming vectors of the MC and SCs BSs on the one hand and the passive beamforming vectors of the MC and SCs RISs on the other hand. Due to the high non-convexity and complexity of the formulated problem, we propose a novel distributed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based multi-task deep reinforcement learning (MTDRL) scheme to solve the problem and learn network dynamics. Through deliberate definitions of MTDRL agent’s tasks and their corresponding main elements, we demonstrate via simulations that our proposed scheme guarantees a fair distribution of rates within UEs and SCs. In addition, we quantify the robustness of our proposed MTDRL scheme compared with some benchmarks in terms of convergence speed and utility values.}

In particular, we systematically address the new problem of joint fronthaul load balancing and allocation of the computation resource. As a consequence of our new optimization framework, we present representative numerical results highlighting the existence of an optimal number of quantization bits in the analog-to-digital conversion at the RUs.}

	abstract = {Satellite-Ground integrated networks (SGINs) are regarded as promising network architecture, which can provide global coverage, large broadband and mega access services for massive terrestrial users. Furthermore, it is beneficial to reducing network congestion, releasing network resources and achieving computation offloading functions. However, the SGIN graph structure is time-varying and highly complex, lack of fixed node orders or reference nodes, which result in dynamic multi-modal features. Hence, we consider a SGIN directed graph model to minimize the total latency while improving the model prediction accuracy, and then perform the computation offloading and quantization schemes. Specifically, we envision a spatial graph convolutional neural network framework to adapt to the dynamic SGIN graph nodes and size, and then propose a centrally deep reinforcement learning aided multi-node federated learning (CDRFL) framework to optimize the CPU cycle frequency, transmission bandwidth and the number of quantization bits to accelerate the convergence round. Extensive theoretical analyses verify the graph permutation property between SGIN graph structure and optimization problems, and demonstrate the upper bound of quantization error via massive mathematical derivation. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed CDRFL framework outperforms some existing benchmarks with reference to FL convergence analysis, average latency and transmission energy consumption for all independent identically distribution (IID) and non-IID data.}

	abstract = {Though achieving marvelous progress in various scenarios, existing semantic communication frameworks mainly consider single-input single-output Gaussian channels or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the widely-used multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which hinders the application into practical systems. One common solution to combat MIMO fading is to utilize feedback MIMO channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we incorporate MIMO CSI into system designs from a new perspective and propose the learnable CSI fusion semantic communication (LCFSC) framework, where CSI is treated as side information by the semantic extractor to enhance the semantic coding. To avoid feature fusion due to abrupt combination of CSI with features, we present a non-invasive CSI fusion multi-head attention module inside the Swin Transformer. With the learned attention masking map determined by both source and channel states, more robust attention distribution could be generated. Furthermore, the percentage of mask elements could be flexibly adjusted by the learnable mask ratio, which is produced based on the conditional variational interference in an unsupervised manner. In this way, CSI-aware semantic coding is achieved through learnable CSI fusion masking. Experiment results testify the superiority of LCFSC over traditional schemes and state-of-the-art Swin Transformer-based semantic communication frameworks in MIMO fading channels.}

These features make them attractive for many applications, potentially increasing the shortage of spectrum resources. In this paper, wideband spectrum sensing augmented technology is discussed for distributed UAV swarms to improve the utilization of spectrum using Nyquist folding receiver (NYFR). Compared to the other sub-sampling schemes, the NYFR has low hardware complexity, power consumption, and high recovery efficiency for non-strictly sparse conditions. In particular, there is a focus discussion on the sensing model of two multichannel scenarios for the distributed UAV swarms, one with a complete functional receiver for the UAV swarm with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and another with a decentralized UAV swarm equipped with a complete functional receiver for each UAV element. Moreover, the property for multiple pulse reconstruction is analyzed through the Gershgorin circle theorem, especially for very short pulses. And the block sparse recovery property is analyzed for wide bandwidth signals. Experiment results show augmented spectrum sensing efficiency under non-strictly sparse conditions, and improve the processing capability for multiple signals and wide bandwidth signals while reducing interference from folded noise and subsampled harmonics.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology promises unprecedented capacity and ultra-low latency for wireless communications. However, mmWave systems confront challenges, including high costs, power consumption, and accurate carrier synchronization, significantly limiting mmWave-based applications. The emerging over-the-air modulation (OTAM) technique has recently demonstrated cost-effective and low-power mmWave communication by utilizing channel attenuation difference characteristics to achieve an ASK-like modulation effect. Despite these advancements, the wireless beam modulation (WBM) system based on the OTAM technique suffers from nonlinear interference caused by random phase offsets when supporting multi-node spatial division multiplexing (SDM) access. To address the challenges, we propose a moment-based analysis (MBA) framework to reduce carrier synchronization requirements, enabling the WBM system to linearize nonlinear spatial interference under coarse carrier synchronization. Within the MBA framework, we further develop a moment-based interference cancellation (MBML-IC) algorithm based on the maximum likelihood criterion. The MBML-IC algorithm eliminates interference in the energy domain, thereby supporting multi-node SDM access for the WBM system. Simulation experiments validate the performance improvements regarding the system bit error rate (BER). Besides, the proposed MBA framework and MBML-IC algorithm empower the WBM system to employ lower-precision, cost-effective, and low-power mmWave components, enhancing energy efficiency.}

In the uplink, instead of encoding the whole message into one stream, a user can split its message into two parts and encode them into two streams before transmitting a superposition of these two streams. The base station (BS) uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode the streams and reconstruct the original messages. Focusing on the packet transmission reliability, we investigate the features of RSMA in the context of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), a well-established mechanism for enhancing reliability. This work proposes a HARQ scheme for uplink RSMA with different retransmission times for a two-user scenario and introduces a power allocation strategy for the two split streams. The results show that compared with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), RSMA outperforms them in terms of error probability and power consumption. The results show that RSMA with HARQ has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {Millimeter-waves’ propagation characteristics create opportunities for spatio-temporal spectrum sharing in a variety of contexts, including cognitive spectrum sharing (CSS). However, CSS with omnidirectional sensing is not efficient at mmWave frequencies due to their directional transmission, as this limits secondary networks’ ability to access the spectrum. This inspired us to create an analytical approach using stochastic geometry to examine the implications of directional sensing in millimeter-wave (mmWave) CSS. We explore a cognitive network where multiple secondary transmitter-receiver pairs coexist with multiple primary transmitter-receiver pairs. The positions of the secondary transmitters are modelled using a Poisson point process with corresponding secondary receivers located around them. A threshold on directional transmission is imposed on each secondary transmitter to limit its interference at the primary receiver. We derive the medium-access-probability of a secondary user along with the fraction of the secondary transmitters active at a time-instant. To understand cognition’s feasibility, we derive the primary and secondary links’ coverage probabilities. We provide various design insights. For example, we investigate the interference-threshold’s optimal value while ensuring both link’s coverage and its dependence on various parameters. We find that directionality improves both links’ performance. Further, allowing location-aware secondary-directionality can help achieve similar coverage for all secondary links.}

This motivates us to investigate the transmit beamforming design for massive multiple-input multiple-output integrated sensing and communications (mMIMO-ISAC) systems. Inspired by the facts that linear precoding methods can provide very good performance in mMIMO and that a dual-function ISAC transmit beamformer should be suitable for both communication and radar sensing, we propose an implementation-friendly mMIMO-ISAC transmit beamformer as a weighted combination of a linear precoder and a pre-designed array beamformer. The weights are selected and adjusted through the powers allocated to the beamformers, while the design problem is formulated as a total transmit power minimization, while satisfying the requirements for both sensing and communication. Leveraging the use-and-then-forget strategy, simplified performance metrics for communication and sensing under the proposed mMIMO-ISAC transmit model are derived, which yields linear programming (LP) problems for the design. It is shown that analytical solutions can be obtained and, hence, the proposed design is computationally very attractive. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methods.}

	abstract = {A large amount of spectrum, enabling multi-Gigabits-per-second data rates, is offered by millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems. Yet mmWave communication systems incur significant propagation challenges, including large free space path loss (PL), large penetration loss, and large diffraction loss. Hence, it is vital to quantify these and other channel effects to ensure link reliability, particularly in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings. As with many industries, commercial aviation is experiencing growth that could benefit from mmWave communication systems. In this paper, we present 90-GHz band measurement results for two aviation settings: an airport maintenance hangar and an airport baggage claim area. We address line-of-sight (LOS), NLOS, mixed LOS/NLOS, and LOS-to-NLOS transition settings. We provide results on path loss, delay spread, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and spatial stationarity distance. The highly-reflective maintenance hangar setting yields large AoA values (>104°). The minimum stationarity distance for both LOS and NLOS settings in the maintenance hangar is less than or equal to 0.5 m. Our PL exponent is close to the free space PL exponent, as expected in this baggage area open setting. A relatively large root mean square delay spread was observed in both LOS and NLOS baggage claim settings: 20.5 ns for LOS and 24 ns for NLOS.}

	abstract = {With the goal of enabling ultrareliable and low-latency wireless communications for industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), this paper studies the use of energy-based modulations in noncoherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with correlated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise, in which the receiver has statistical channel state information (CSI). We first provide a theoretical analysis on the limitations of unipolar pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood detection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy levels, when no (statistical) CSI is available at the transmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for quadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better exploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design receivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit lower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic approximation for the error probability of a general class of quadratic detectors in the large array regime. Finally, we numerically validate it and discuss the outage probability of the system.}

	abstract = {The scheduling of the laser inter-satellite links (LISLs) can effectively decrease the energy consumption by deactivating idle LISLs and reduce the network latency by decreasing the average hop count through establishing appropriate dynamic LISLs, but is challenging in mega-constellations due to a large amount of satellites involved. In this paper, a federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method for LISL scheduling is proposed, where the global scheduling is decomposed into independent decisions for each satellite. To reduce the substantial communication overhead attributable to MADRL, asynchronous hierarchical federated learning with partial and global aggregations is utilized, transmitting the model parameters rather than status information among low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites. The movement of LEO satellites maintains the consistency of local sample distribution and the indirect association among different GEO satellites. Therefore, the global aggregation with infrequent occurrence is asynchronous with the partial aggregation. Moreover, during the partial aggregation, the utility of each layer in the local model of the LEO satellite is also evaluated to minimize the uncertainty, allowing the adaptive upload to ensure efficiency and fairness within a limited power budget. The simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the average hop by about two hops and decreases the LISLs number by over 25%. Meanwhile, the communication overhead of LEO satellites is 46.6% of that in the centralized approach, with the training performance ensured.}

	abstract = {Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) shows great advantages over conventional two-layer federated learning (FL) in reducing network overhead and interaction latency while still retaining the data privacy of distributed FL clients. However, the communication and energy overhead still pose a bottleneck for HFL performance, especially as the number of clients raises dramatically. To tackle this issue, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled HFL system under semi-synchronous cloud model aggregation in this paper, aiming to minimize the total cost of time and energy at each HFL global round. Specifically, we first propose a novel fuzzy logic based client selection policy considering client heterogeneity in multiple aspects, including channel quality, data quantity and model staleness. Subsequently, given the fuzzy based client-edge association, a joint edge server scheduling and resource allocation problem is formulated. Utilizing problem decomposition, we firstly derive the closed-form solution for the edge server scheduling subproblem via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. Next, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based algorithm is proposed to tackle the resource allocation subproblem considering time-varying environments. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the considered benchmarks regarding HFL performance improvement and total cost reduction.}

	abstract = {Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has exhibited considerable advantages for automatic modulation classification (AMC) with a scarcity of labeled samples. Nevertheless, the majority of the available CL-based AMC methods use the simple signal augmentation strategy and suffer from interference from false negatives. To explore the more generalizable global temporal semantics within signals, a novel masked contrastive learning with hard negatives (MCLHN) method is proposed in this paper. MCLHN first strategically incorporates semantic-preserving data augmentation, ensuring the diversity and semantic invariance of signals. Second, MCLHN adopts an encoder with temporal masking to enable robust temporal modeling. Moreover, a debiased hardness-weighted contrastive (DHWC) loss is designed to balance the adverse impact of the debiased strategy and the advantage of hard negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and generalization capability of MCLHN to other methods. Significantly, the performance of MCLHN with only one labeled sample per modulation under each signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rivals that of other methods with five to twenty times the number of labeled samples.}

	abstract = {Location awareness and time consensus, which are two intertwined aspects of distributed systems, have become more important in vertical industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Existing integrated localization and synchronization (ILAS) in a connected system relies on collaborative measurement of time of arrival, as well as exchange of estimated location and clock related states. However, with the growing scale and dynamics of wireless IoT systems, the unselected and excessive information obtained from the collaborating nodes becomes less effective in ILAS. To enhance the performance of ILAS with controlled complexity, we first propose an optimal measurement geometry directed collaborating nodes selection scheme in this paper. Specifically, the optimal measurement geometry evaluated by the dilution of precision is utilized to prioritize the corresponding subset collaborating nodes for the best estimation accuracy with limited complexity. Moreover, to further reduce the computation complexity in increased-scale systems, a sequential state stacking belief propagation algorithm is proposed for the related states estimation, where the matrix inversions and square root calculations reduce to the dimensions of a subset of the overall collaborating states. Numerical simulations demonstrate a significant enhancement in the robustness of the ILAS estimation and reduction in the computational complexity compared to the baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is considered a transformative enabler for next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) services and wireless data aggregation via the electromagnetic waveform-superposition property of wireless multi-access channels (MAC). However, the conventional distortion metric, minimum square error (MSE), is imperfect and not universally applicable in specific AirComp scenarios in a low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and under power budget constraint. Conversely, the average discriminant gain is studied for task-oriented AirComp AI services like classification but with inaccurate performance indication. To solve these problems, this work establishes a novel framework for AirComp systems from the mutual information (MI) perspective. First, we categorize the AirComp model into two distinct classes based on the source (sensing) data independence, namely diverse-targets (DT) AirComp and homogeneous-target (HT) AirComp. Both categories with different inputs like classical Gaussian and classification-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM), can be unified and assessed via MI criterion. Next, for the DT AirComp system, we introduce a novel MI-aided AirComp beamforming scheme employing majorization-minimization (MM) relaxation. As for the HT AirComp, we present a heuristic successive approximation (SA)-based beamforming method considering complex GMM inputs. We also provide the feedback and update protocol for AirComp tracking. Simulations validate the superior performance on AirComp throughput and task-oriented metrics such as classification accuracy with our proposed MI-aided beamforming schemes.}

	abstract = {Joint sensing and communication (JSAC) is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, which can reuse most devices of the systems in sensing and communication (S&C) and reduces the cost in terms of power and spectrum (P&S) critically. The current research considers the P&S allocation of S&C separately and then discusses the performance from different aspects. However, as an integrated system, the allocation strategy of P&S allocation affects the joint performance significantly. In this article, we use tools from stochastic geometry to study the coverage performance considering the trade-off of P&S allocation for JSAC with the principle requirements of small distance resolution (SDR) in sensing and high data rate (HDR) in communication. In particular, we model the locations of user equipment (UE) and base stations (BSs) as two different Poisson Point Processes and allocate P&S at BSs with two independent ratios. The sensing system will detect the surrounding environment and obtain UE positions. After that, an adaptive beamwidth for beamforming technology is applied in communication, which can save energy effectively. First, we introduce the distance resolution in sensing and special channel models in S&C with a high frequency. Then, considering the proposed system model, we separately model the interference in S&C. Further, the joint coverage probability (CP) of JSAC is derived as a function of densities of UE and BSs, required HDR and SDR, and allocation ratios of P&S. Finally, We draw multiple valuable system-level insights from the proposed analysis. For instance, we show that the SDR and HDR are the two main constraints to the maximum achievable CP with optimized allocations of P&S. Furthermore, we show that different densities of BSs should be considered in various scenarios. The revealed relationship between the densities of UE and BSs can be taken as a reference in practical applications.}

Moreover, ISAC outperforms traditional separate radar and communication systems in terms of both power consumption and spectral efficiency. This paper investigates the dual-functional (DF) constant modulus waveform design for simultaneously transmitting and reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided ISAC. To investigate the performance trade-off, the weighted sum of multi-user interference (MUI) energy and waveform discrepancies is minimized via jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and the reflection and transmission coefficient matrices at STAR-RIS. Furthermore, both cases of independent and coupled phase shifts at STAR-RIS are investigated. For independent phase shifts, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm to decouple the original problem into several tractable subproblems that facilitates the derivation of a closed-form solution to each subproblem. In the scenario with the coupled phase shifts, we first formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process, employing a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based deep reinforcement learning approach to address it. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, demonstrating STAR-RIS’s superiority over conventional RIS. Moreover, the adopted protocol of STAR-RIS can maintain an excellent balance between performance and complexity.}

More specifically, we deal with the robust selection of binary (on/off) states of the IRS elements in order to maximize the worst-case energy efficiency (EE), given a bounded CSI uncertainty, while satisfying a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, we consider not only continuous but also discrete IRS phase shifts. First, we derive closed-form expressions of the worst-case SNRs, and then formulate the robust (discrete) optimization problems for each case. In the case of continuous phase shifts, we design a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to achieve the global maximum with polynomial complexity\nO(LlogL)\n, where L is the number of IRS elements. In the case of discrete phase shifts, we develop a convex-relaxation-based method (CRBM) to obtain a feasible (sub-optimal) solution in polynomial time\nO(\nL\n3.5\n)\n, with a posteriori performance guarantee. Furthermore, numerical simulations provide useful insights and confirm the theoretical results.

Generally, accurate indoor localization is challenging due to the multipath effect. Numerous methods have been proposed to increase the accuracy of localization for multipath environments. One of the recent methods is direct localization. This method includes a two-dimensional search in a planar geometry to directly localize the source without estimating any intermediate variable such as angle-of-arrival or time-of-flight. In this paper, we use a compressed sensing framework in the direct localization technique to estimate the location of a user in an indoor multipath environment. We form a penalized \\ell _{0} -norm structure for this problem and then convert this structure to an Ising energy problem to take advantage of the efficient existing binary programming solvers. In this paper, the Ising energy problem is solved using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The evaluations show that our approach significantly improves the localization accuracy compared to other approaches in the literature.}

	abstract = {Millimeter wave communications are sensitive to complex scattering environments (e.g., to the presence of obstacles), which can be mitigated by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Traditional nearly passive RISs lack the ability to perform signal processing operations, which makes channel estimation in RIS-aided communications more challenging. Hence, in this paper, we focus on a hybrid RIS architecture, which is equipped with a small number of active elements. These active elements can be connected with baseband processing units through radio frequency (RF) chains. We estimate the whole channel, including the channel between the base station (BS) and the RIS, that between the users and the RIS, and that between the BS and the users. The whole channel is acquired at the hybrid RIS through the transmission of several segments of training pilots. In order to decrease the hardware cost, the BS and the hybrid RIS are equipped with RF chains with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Since the numbers of BS antennas and RIS elements are very large, the estimation of the full-space channels is not straightforward. To tackle this problem, we propose a channel extrapolation scheme based on a joint selection model. Specifically, we select a BS antenna subset and an RIS element subset to be connected to the RF chains and to estimate the partial-space channels related to these subsets. Then, a reference-based variational auto-encoder model is used to implement the extrapolation from the partial-space channels to the full-space channels. Besides, the optimal joint selection pattern is acquired through a selection network to improve the channel extrapolation performance. Moreover, to overcome the quantization error caused by the use of low-resolution ADCs, we propose a two-stage repair scheme for channel estimation. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed channel extrapolation scheme.}

	abstract = {This paper studies the affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)-empowered sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system, referred to as AFDM-SCMA, for supporting massive connectivity in high-mobility environments. First, by placing the sparse codewords on the AFDM chirp subcarriers, the input-output (I/O) relation of AFDM-SCMA systems is presented. Next, we delve into the generalized receiver design, chirp rate selection, and error rate performance of the proposed AFDM-SCMA. The proposed AFDM-SCMA is shown to provide a general framework and subsume the existing OFDM-SCMA as a special case. Third, for efficient transceiver design, we further propose a class of sparse codebooks for simplifying the I/O relation, referred to as I/O relation-inspired codebook design in this paper. Building upon these codebooks, we propose a novel iterative detection and decoding scheme with linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator for both downlink and uplink channels based on orthogonal approximate message passing principles. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AFDM-SCMA systems over OFDM-SCMA systems in terms of the error rate performance. We show that the proposed receiver can significantly enhance the error rate performance while reducing the detection complexity.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has emerged as a promising technology for passive Internet of Things (IoT), which enables backscatter devices (BDs) to transmit information over ambient radio frequency (RF) signals. This paper investigates joint localization and signal detection for an AmBC system. The BDs modulate information over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, and the receiver realizes joint localization and signal detection for the BDs. A two-stage receiver algorithm is proposed to realize the joint localization and signal detection. In the first stage, the receiver estimates the delays and angles-of-arrival (AoAs) of the BDs through the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based algorithm. Then attenuation coefficients of the backscatter link are estimated through the least squares (LS) method, based on which the information symbols transmitted by the BDs can be detected in the second stage. Further, to address the discretization error in the estimation of AoAs and delays through the OMP algorithm, we propose an sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) based algorithm to achieve off-grid estimation. Finally, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the system model and the superiority of the SBL-based algorithm, and it is shown that larger bandwidth and antenna arrays are beneficial to improving the estimation accuracy.}

	abstract = {Coupled with identification, 3D positioning can significantly enrich location-based services. Resonant beam (RB) is emerging as a promising solution to indoor positioning due to its self-aligning and energy-focused transmission. We propose a system for simultaneous localization and identification using RB as the individual medium. The base station (BS) employs a single-source RB, and each mobile target (MT) is equipped with a signal reflection module. For 3D localization, the BS estimates direction by analyzing RB’s spatial distribution and determines the distance from its frequency components. For identification, the passive MT captures the RB for power and reflects its identity (ID) to BS as spot flicker signals. To demonstrate the working principles, we have developed models for location estimation and ID recognition, as well as the power flow within the RB channel. In implementation, we incorporate a threshold regulation scheme for accurate image signal retrieval, along with an input power distribution model tailored for multi-access scenarios. Through simulating the entire process, we verify the system’s feasibility, including confirming the viability of ID recognition. We also evaluate localization performance, averaging ~ 1 cm at heights of 1.5 m ~ 2.5 m, showing promise for a wide range of potential applications.}

	abstract = {In unmanned space exploration, the cooperation among space robots requires advanced communication techniques. In this paper, we propose a communication optimization scheme for a specific cooperation system named the “mother-daughter system”. In this setup, the mother spacecraft orbits the planet, while daughter probes are distributed across the planetary surface. During each control cycle, the mother spacecraft senses the environment, computes control commands and distributes them to daughter probes for actions. They synergistically form sensing-communication-computing-control ( \\mathbf {SC^{3}} ) loops. Given the indivisibility of the \\mathbf {SC^{3}} loop, we optimize the mother-daughter downlink for closed-loop control. The optimization objective is the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost, and the optimization parameters are the block length and transmit power. To solve the nonlinear mixed-integer problem, we first identify the optimal block length and then transform the power allocation problem into a tractable convex problem. We further derive the approximate closed-form solutions for the proposed scheme and two communication-oriented schemes: the max-sum rate scheme and the max-min rate scheme. On this basis, we analyze their power allocation principles. In particular, for time-insensitive control tasks, we find that the proposed scheme demonstrates equivalence to the max-min rate scheme. These findings are verified through simulations.}

MLO can transmit information simultaneously on different channels in the same device, which can significantly increase the capacity of Wi-Fi for future communication systems. Previous relevant studies have shown that network throughput is not simply and positively correlated with frame aggregation length. Furthermore, due to the variability of communication environments, the optimal frame aggregation length in the scheduling process is not unique within a given time, and the traditional methods are limited to solving non-convex optimization problems. To fill this gap, we present a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to tackle the optimization of frame aggregation lengths in 802.11be for multiple links. Our research offers a comprehensive depiction of the communication and interaction structure among multiple links and DRL, which helps drive the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in future network designs and demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting DRL in next-generation wireless networks. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared to the existing methods.}

	abstract = {Recently, semantic communication (SC) has been regarded as one of the most potential paradigms of 6G. Current SC frameworks require the physical layer channel state information (CSI) in order to handle the severe signal distortion induced by channel fading. Since practical CSI cannot be obtained accurately and the overhead of channel estimation cannot be neglected, we therefore propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based SC framework (Ti-GSC) that doesn’t require CSI. In Ti-GSC, there are two main modules, i.e., an autoencoder-based encoder-decoder module (AEDM) and a GAN-based non-CSI signal distortion suppression (SDS) module (GSDSM), where SDS only relies on learning the syntactic distribution and the semantics of the transmitted data, so no prior information such as CSI is needed by GSDSM. In order to measure signal distortion, a novel loss function is proposed where two terms, i.e., a syntactic distortion loss term and a semantic distortion loss term, are newly added, and a differentiable semantic measurement method is designed based on the intermediate layers of the AEDM decoder. To achieve better training results of Ti-GSC, two training schemes, i.e., the joint optimization based training (JOT) and the alternating optimization based training (AOT) are designed for the proposed Ti-GSC. Experimental results show that JOT is more efficient for Ti-GSC, and Ti-GSC outperforms conventional communication frameworks in terms of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score in both Rician and Rayleigh fading channels. Moreover, without CSI, the BLEU score achieved by Ti-GSC is about 40% and 62% higher than that achieved by existing SC frameworks in Rician and Rayleigh fading, respectively. Besides, each term of the presented loss function has a great impact on the BLEU performance of Ti-GSC, where in Rician fading syntactic learning has the greatest impact, and in Rayleigh fading, the adversarial learning becomes important.}

This system faces challenges in performance degradation due to the absence of knowledge from other antennas and several realistic constraints brought by the distributed implementation of the communication system such as the presence of phase noise (PN). In this paper, a robust cascaded team minimum mean square error (RCT-MMSE) precoding based on a hierarchical fronthaul structure is exploited to handle distributed and robust precoding including not only PN but signaling noise, sharing cost constraints and channel aging uncertainty. Such RCT-MMSE precoding, characterized by its avoidance of iterations because we derive the analytic expressions, mitigates the need for high fronthaul level instantaneous information exchange. It also demonstrates scalability with distributed computation burden and flexible signaling overhead, which offers an advantageous performance-cost tradeoff. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of RCT-MMSE to combat several practical constraints and provide a flexible distributed precoding framework compared with previous ones.}

	abstract = {Grant-free random access is an effective technology for enabling low-overhead and low-latency massive access, where joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) is a critical issue. Although existing compressed sensing algorithms can be applied for JADCE, they usually fail to simultaneously harvest the following properties: effective sparsity inducing, fast convergence, robust to different pilot sequences, and adaptive to time-varying networks. To this end, we propose an unfolding framework for JADCE based on the proximal gradient method. Specifically, we formulate the JADCE problem as a group-row-sparse matrix recovery problem and leverage a minimax concave penalty rather than the widely-used \\ell _{1} -norm to induce sparsity. We then develop a proximal gradient-based unfolding neural network that parameterizes the algorithmic iterations. To improve convergence rate, we incorporate momentum into the unfolding neural network, and prove the accelerated convergence theoretically. Based on the convergence analysis, we further develop an adaptive-tuning algorithm, which adjusts its parameters to different signal-to-noise ratio settings. Simulations show that the proposed unfolding neural network achieves better recovery performance, convergence rate, and adaptivity than current baselines.}

Our objective is to minimize the average delay in the system due to APs’ limited service capacity and unreliable wireless channels between APs and users. This problem can be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandits problem with fairness constraint (RMAB-F). Since finding the optimal policy for RMAB-F is intractable, existing learning algorithms are computationally expensive and not suitable for practical dynamic dense mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a structured reinforcement learning (RL) solution for mmDPT by exploiting the inherent structure encoded in RMAB-F. To achieve this, we first design a low-complexity and provably asymptotically optimal index policy for RMAB-F. Then, we leverage this structure information to develop a structured RL algorithm called mmDPT-TS, which provably achieves an \\tilde {\\mathcal {O}}(\\sqrt {T}) Bayesian regret. More importantly, mmDPT-TS is computation-efficient and thus amenable to practical implementation, as it fully exploits the structure of index policy for making decisions. Extensive emulation based on data collected in realistic mmWave networks demonstrate significant gains of mmDPT-TS over existing approaches.}

In this paper, we present an efficient 3D REM construction scheme based on the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), which aims to recover the accurate REM with limited and optimized sampling data. In order to reduce the number of sampling sensors, an efficient sparse sampling method for unknown scenarios is proposed. For the given construction accuracy and the priority of each location, the quantity and sampling locations can be jointly optimized. With the sparse sampled data, by mining the sparsity of the spectrum situation and channel propagation characteristics, a SBL-based spectrum data hierarchical recovery algorithm is developed to estimate the missing data of unsampled locations. Finally, the simulated three-dimensional (3D) REM data in the campus scenario are used to verify the proposed methods as well as to compare with the state-of-the-art. We also analyze the recovery performance and the impact of different parameters on the constructed REMs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can ensure the construction accuracy and improve the computational efficiency under the low sampling rate.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging paradigm able to control the propagation environment in wireless systems. Most of the research on RIS has been dedicated to system optimization and, with the advent of beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to RIS architecture design. However, developing general and unified electromagnetic (EM)-consistent models for RIS-aided systems remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a universal framework for the multiport network analysis of RIS-aided systems. With our framework, we model RIS-aided systems and RIS architectures through impedance, admittance, and scattering parameter analysis. Based on these analyses, three equivalent models are derived accounting for the effects of impedance mismatching and mutual coupling. The three models are then simplified by assuming large transmission distances, perfect matching, and no mutual coupling to understand the role of the RIS in the communication model. The derived simplified models are consistent with the model used in related literature, although we show that an additional approximation is commonly considered in the literature. We discuss the benefits of each analysis in characterizing and optimizing the RIS and how to select the most suitable parameters according to the needs. Numerical results provide additional evidence of the equivalence of the three analyses.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the application of neural networks (NNs) in wireless communication has garnered widespread attention and proven successful. However, conventional learning-based NNs often suffer from poor calibration, meaning that they struggle to reliably quantify prediction confidence and lack proper uncertainty estimation. This limitation becomes especially critical for next generation communication systems, particularly in complex industrial scenarios with stringent reliability requirements. Previous efforts to enhance model calibration have primarily centered on modifying NNs’ training processes. However, these methods often demand significant computing resources, making them impractical for resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we investigate a distributed wireless communication system involving multiple users and propose a novel approach to improve model calibration. Our method focuses on enhancing calibration during the inference stage of NNs by introducing a power control mechanism. Notably, existing research indicates that many NNs exhibit overconfidence, i.e., the NN’s confidence exceeds its actual accuracy. Leveraging this insight, we exploit the inherent noise and fading in wireless systems to naturally reduce the NN’s confidence while preserving accuracy. To achieve this, we employ linear relaxation-based perturbation analysis (LiRPA) to approximate the relationship between the perturbed output and the input perturbation of the NN. Subsequently, we devise an optimization problem by leveraging the analyzed relationship and the definition of perfect calibration. It is aimed at finding the input perturbation that maximizes the probability of the model achieving perfect calibration. Finally, considering different channel conditions and a given specific modulation method, we derive the optimal transmission power based on bit error rate (BER) formula. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed power control method exhibits significant advantages in model calibration compared to several traditional approaches.}

	abstract = {We focus on prediction of channel quality between any two devices using Deep Neural Network (DNN) from information already known to mobile networks. The DNN-based prediction reduces a cost of a common pilot-based channel quality measurement in scenarios with many ad-hoc communicating devices. However, collecting a sufficient number of high-quality and well-distributed training samples in real-world is not feasible. Hence, in this paper, we develop and validate a concept of DNN-based channel quality prediction between any two devices based on a low-complexity and easy-to-create digital twin. The digital twin serves for a generation of a large synthetic training dataset for channel quality prediction. As the low-complexity digital twin cannot capture all real-world aspects of the channels, we enhance the digital twin with real-world measured and artificially augmented inputs via transfer learning. The proposed concept is implemented and validated in software defined mobile network. We demonstrate that the proposed concept predicts the channel quality with a very high accuracy (mean average error of only 0.66 dB) in a real-world complex indoor scenario. Such error is sufficient for practical applications of the developed channel quality prediction concept and the error is few times lower than the error achievable by state-of-the-art solutions.}

Furthermore, we consider an MTC network with hierarchical user activity patterns following an event-triggered traffic mode. Therein the users are distributed over clusters with a structured sporadic activity behavior that exhibits both cluster-level and intra-cluster sparsity patterns. To solve the JUICE problem, we first leverage the concept of strong priors and propose a hierarchical-sparsity-inducing spike-and-slab prior to model the structured sparse activity pattern. Subsequently, we derive a Bayesian inference scheme by coupling the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm with the expectation maximization (EM) framework. Second, we reformulate the JUICE as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation problem and propose a computationally-efficient solution based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). More precisely, we relax the strong spike-and-slab prior with a cluster-sparsity-promoting prior based on the long-sum penalty. We then derive an ADMM algorithm that solves the MAP problem through a sequence of closed-form updates. Numerical results highlight the significant performance gains obtained by the proposed algorithms, as well as their robustness against various assumptions on the sparse activity behavior of the users.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for designing robust precoders for a multi-input single-output (MISO) system that performs integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) across multiple cells and users. We use Cramer-Rao-Bound (CRB) to measure the sensing performance and derive its expressions for two multi-cell scenarios, namely coordinated beamforming (CBF) and coordinated multi-point (CoMP). In the CBF scheme, a BS shares channel state information (CSI) and estimates target parameters using monostatic sensing. In contrast, a BS in the CoMP scheme shares the CSI and data, allowing bistatic sensing through inter-cell reflection. We consider both block-level (BL) and symbol-level (SL) precoding schemes for both the multi-cell scenarios that are robust to channel state estimation errors. The formulated optimization problems to minimize the CRB in estimating the parameters of a target and maximize the minimum communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) while satisfying a given total transmit power budget are non-convex. We tackle the non-convexity using a combination of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and alternating optimization (AO) techniques. Simulations suggest that neglecting the inter-cell reflection and communication links degrades the performance of an ISAC system. The CoMP scenario employing SL precoding performs the best, whereas the BL precoding applied in the CBF scenario produces relatively high estimation error for a given minimum SINR value.}

Existing methods require channel state information (CSI) and residual self-interference (SI) knowledge to calculate exact active beamformers or the DRL rewards, which typically fail without CSI or residual SI. Especially for time-varying channels, estimating and signaling CSI to the DRL agent is required at each time step and is costly. We propose a two-stage DRL framework with minimal signaling overhead to address this. The first stage uses the least squares method to initiate learning by partially canceling the residual SI. The second stage uses DRL to achieve performance comparable to existing CSI-based methods without requiring the CSI or the exact residual SI. Further, the proposed DRL framework for quantized RIS phase shifts reduces the signaling from BS to the RISs using 32 times fewer bits than the continuous version. The quantized methods reduce action space, resulting in faster convergence and 7.1% and 22.28% better UL and DL rates, respectively than the continuous method.}

Based on this architecture, an optimization problem is formulated that maximizes the sum of achievable rates while minimizing the hardware power consumption. Both continuous and discrete phase shifters are considered. 1) For continuous phase shifters, a wavenumber-domain weighted minimum mean-square error (WD-WMMSE) algorithm is proposed, which exploits the sparsity of WD near-field channels to achieve the low-dimensional beamformer design. 2) For discrete phase shifters, a penalty-based layered iterative (PLI) algorithm is proposed. The closed-form analog and baseband digital beamformers are derived in each iteration. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed dynamic beamforming architecture outperforms the conventional fixed hybrid beamforming architecture in terms of spatial multiplexing-power consumption tradeoff, and 2) the proposed algorithms achieve better performance than the other baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Beam-hopping (BH) technology, integral to multi-beam satellite systems, adapts beam activation to the variable communication demands of terrestrial users. The optimization of power allocation and beam illumination scheduling constitutes the core design challenge in BH systems, especially under the constraint on a limited number of simultaneously active beams due to restricted radio frequency chain availability. This paper proposes a two-stage BH design solution, which minimizes energy consumption in BH satellite communications while accommodating the heterogeneous demands of users. The first stage addresses the coupling variables of power and beam status by recasting the allocation and scheduling problem through a statistical lens, thus breaking down the intricate relationship between variables. To manage the resulting non-convex challenge, we propose an iterative method that capitalizes on the optimality conditions inherent to this problem. This method is designed to procure a statistically-informed solution that aligns with our reformulated interpretation. Subsequently, the second stage maps this solution into a concrete beam illumination schedule, employing binary quadratic programming techniques. A penalty-based iterative method is applied, ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Through numerical simulations, the proposed framework has been validated for its efficacy in improving energy efficiency and accurately matching demands.}

	abstract = {Channel charting (CC) consists in learning a mapping between the space of raw channel observations, made available from pilot-based channel estimation in multicarrier multiantenna system, and a low-dimensional space where close points correspond to channels of user equipments (UEs) close spatially. Among the different methods of learning this mapping, some rely on a distance measure between channel vectors. Such a distance should reliably reflect the local spatial neighborhoods of the UEs. The recently proposed phase-insensitive (PI) distance exhibits good properties in this regards, but suffers from ambiguities due to both its periodic and oscillatory aspects, making users far away from each other appear closer in some cases. In this paper, a thorough theoretical analysis of the said distance and its limitations due to ambiguities is provided. Consequently, a new channel distance especially designed to remove ambiguities is proposed. Guidelines for designing systems capable of learning quality charts with the proposed distance are also derived. Experimental validation is then conducted on synthetic and realistic data in different scenarios.}

However, how to achieve energy-efficient freshness-aware information transmission with energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices remains a challenge. To solve this challenge, in this paper, we consider a new metric called freshness-aware energy efficiency (FAEE), which is defined as the ratio of AoI improvement to transmission energy consumption. We study a freshness-aware integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network in which multiple IoT devices (IDs) that are accountable for generating and transmitting status updates frequently over time so as to maintain the freshness of information observed at the IAB donor. For this system setup, we first formulate three mixed discrete-continuous optimization problems in order to maximize the long-term average FAEE under different transmission scheduling schemes, including round-robin (RR), sub-channel allocation (SA), and time-resource allocation (TA). By constructing average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with mixed discrete-continuous action space to model these optimization problems, we propose a novel proximal policy optimization (PPO) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is referred to as APO-CD, to learn sub-optimal policies for status update strategy and resource allocation. Extensive simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and to reveal several design insights of freshness-aware IAB networks.}

To address this challenge effectively, we propose leveraging inter-vehicle communication to schedule communication and sensing signals for vehicles, thereby enhancing networked sensing capabilities. We first introduce an analytical framework to characterize the mutual interference among multiple vehicles. Subsequently, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed interference mitigation method in terms of interference probability, duration, and the achievable detectable density. Additionally, recognizing the different performance requirements of communication and sensing functions, we investigate a joint resource allocation problem catering to both aspects.

	abstract = {Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for downlink precoding in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). However, obtaining CSI through feedback from the user equipment (UE) becomes challenging with the increasing scale of antennas and subcarriers and leads to extremely high CSI feedback overhead. Deep learning-based methods have emerged for compressing CSI but these methods generally require substantial collected samples and thus pose practical challenges. Moreover, existing deep learning methods also suffer from dramatically growing feedback overhead owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI feedback. To address these issues, we propose a low-overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for massive MIMO systems. An incorporation-extrapolation scheme for eigenvector-based CSI feedback is proposed to reduce the feedback overhead. Then, to alleviate the necessity of extensive collected samples and enable few-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a knowledge-driven data augmentation (KDDA) method and an artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data augmentation method by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and by exploiting a novel generative model, respectively. Experimental results based on the DeepMIMO dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEFSF significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead by 64 times compared with existing methods while maintaining higher feedback accuracy using only several hundred collected samples.}

	abstract = {Deep learning has brought about a revolution in the design of the channel state information (CSI) feedback module in wireless communications. However, designing the optimal neural network (NN) architecture for CSI feedback can be a laborious and time-consuming process, and manual design can be prohibitively expensive for customized NNs tailored to different scenarios. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes the use of neural architecture search (NAS) to automate the generation of scenario-customized CSI feedback NN architectures. By employing automated machine learning and gradient-descent-based NAS, an efficient and cost-effective architecture design process is achieved, requiring less expert experience and design time, thus lowering the design threshold. The proposed approach leverages implicit scene knowledge and integrates it into the scenario customization process in a data-driven manner, fully exploiting the potential of deep learning in a given scenario. To address the issue of excessive search, early stopping and elastic selection mechanisms are employed, further enhancing the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the generated architecture, known as Auto-CsiNet, outperforms manually-designed models in terms of reconstruction performance (achieving approximately 14% improvement) and complexity (reducing by approximately 50%), highlighting the effectiveness of the NAS-based automatic scheme. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of the scenario on the NN architecture and capacity.}

The plug-in RIS is a novel system design, streamlining RIS-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication without requiring decoupling two parts of the end-to-end channel, traditional control signal transmission, and online RIS configuration. In plug-in RIS-aided transmission, the transmitter efficiently activates specific regions of the divided large RIS by employing hybrid beamforming techniques, each with predetermined phase adjustments tailored to reflect signals to desired user locations. This user-centric approach enhances connectivity and overall user experience by dynamically illuminating the targeted user based on location. By introducing plug-in RIS’s theoretical framework, design principles, and performance evaluation, we demonstrate its potential to revolutionize mmWave communications for the limited channel state information (CSI) scenarios. Simulation results illustrate that plug-in RIS provides power/cost-efficient solutions to overcome blockage in the mmWave communication system and a striking convergence in average bit error rate and achievable rate performance with traditional full CSI-enabled RIS solutions.}

	abstract = {Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMA) provide a solution to form compact, cost-effective, energy-efficient multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) arrays. In this paper, we implement a practical hierarchical codebook with a realistic DMA design through electromagnetic simulations. We leverage existing DMA models to derive a novel method for enhancing the beamforming gain. We find that the proposed method provides better coverage and spectral efficiency results than prior methods. We also present and verify a new technique for creating wide beamwidths through the DMA and hierarchical codebook. Additionally, we use a detailed transmitter architecture model to determine the power consumption savings of the DMA compared to a typical phased array. The DMA largely outperforms a passive phased array in terms of spectral and energy efficiency due to high component loss from a high-resolution passive phase shifter. While the DMA provides lower spectral efficiency results than the active phased array, the DMA achieves a higher energy efficiency because of the significant power consumption for the active phase shifters. Therefore, we find that DMAs in a realistic wireless environment provide sufficient coverage and spectral efficiency compared to typical phased arrays while maintaining a substantially lower power consumption.}

In sharp contrast to traditional linear precoding algorithms, our proposed efficient randomized iterative precoding algorithm (ERIPA) not only avoids costly matrix inversion but also considers the complexity reduction of matrix multiplication involved, thus enabling more efficient linear precoding. Additionally, ERIPA is demonstrated to have both exponentially fast and global convergence, making it adaptable to various practical scenarios of massive MIMO. We also investigate the convergence phenomenon of ERIPA in relation to the selection of the sampling distribution during random iterations. After that, the concept of conditional sampling is introduced to ERIPA such that significant system potential can be beneficially exploited in terms of both precoding performance and computational complexity. Finally, simulation results regarding the downlink massive MIMO are presented to confirm the superiorities of the proposed ERIPA.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider symbol-level precoding (SLP) in channel-coded multiuser multi-input single-output (MISO) systems. It is observed that the received SLP signals do not always follow Gaussian distribution, rendering the conventional soft demodulation with the Gaussian assumption unsuitable for the coded SLP systems. It, therefore, calls for novel soft demodulator designs for non-Gaussian distributed SLP signals with accurate log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation. To this end, we first investigate the non-Gaussian characteristics of both phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) received signals with existing SLP schemes and categorize the signals into two distinct types. The first type exhibits an approximate-Gaussian distribution with the outliers extending along the constructive interference region (CIR). In contrast, the second type follows some distribution that significantly deviates from the Gaussian distribution. To obtain accurate LLR, we propose the modified Gaussian soft demodulator and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-expectation-maximization (EM) soft demodulators to deal with two types of signals respectively. Subsequently, to further reduce the computational complexity and pilot overhead, we put forward a novel neural network named pilot feature extraction network (PFEN) to replace the EM algorithm, leveraging the transformer mechanism in deep learning. Simulation results show that the proposed soft demodulators dramatically improve the throughput of existing SLPs for both PSK and QAM transmission in coded systems.}

	abstract = {The vision of backscatter communication always incorporates compatibility with active radios to enable low-cost and easy deployment. However, recent innovations lack the flexibility to communicate with heterogeneous wireless devices directly. In this paper, we design and implement a flexible backscatter system, i.e., Flexcatter, which can support various modulation schemes in a software-defined way, to be compatible with different kinds of active radios. The key technique is signal emulation, where the tag can vary the reflection coefficient in the time domain to emulate desired baseband signals. We first carefully design a cost-effective impedance network, which employs two radio frequency (RF) switches to provide up to 16 reflection coefficients. Next, we establish and model the emulation mapping between desired baseband signals and available reflection coefficients. Besides, the emulation frameworks for different modulation schemes are presented. After that, to face the emulation distortion for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), we introduce the oversampling method in the baseband modulation process. We further build the prototype hardware, and experiment results show that Flexcatter can flexibly generate various kinds of backscatter signals, including Wi-Fi, BLE, and LoRa. Especially the OFDM transmission generated by Flexcatter can achieve a throughput of 25.1 Mbps.}

Cell-free radio access network (CF-RAN) with network-assisted fullduplex (NAFD) possesses global collaborative capabilities and enable uplink and downlink transmission simultaneously, which can be considered as a potential technology for supporting air-ground communication. In this paper, we investigate the performance of cellular-connected UAV in CF-RAN with NAFD. We propose a modified beamforming training scheme to mitigate cross-link interference (CLI) and a location-aware access point (AP) clustering strategy to reduce fronthaul overhead. We derive closed-form expressions for uplink and downlink achievable rates of GUEs and UAVs, respectively. Based on these expressions, we propose an efficient global spectral efficiency optimization scheme by solving a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) aiming to maximize the uplink sum rates and downlink sum rates simultaneously with deep Q-network (DQN). Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. The effectiveness of the modified beamforming training scheme and location-aware AP clustering strategy are proved. In addition, the impact of system parameters and the advantages of NAFD system are analyzed. We also illustrate the convergence and benefits of DQN-based optimization scheme on different type of users.}

	abstract = {5G New Radio (NR) millimeter wave (mmWave) and future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) 6G systems are designed for rate-greedy multimedia applications. Such applications often utilize rate adaptation allowing to vary the rate according to the network conditions. Unreliable nature of these bands subject to blockage may induce persistent user behavior resulting in repeated attempts (retrials) to continue the service. These effects may lead to the loss of sessions during the service and service provisioning at reduced rate. In this paper, by using the stochastic geometry and queuing theory, we characterize performance of adaptive rate-greedy applications at mmWave/sub-THz base stations. We consider user- and system-centric performance including new and ongoing session drop probabilities, resource utilization, and the amount of wasted resources. Our results show that the user persistence improves the new and ongoing session drop probabilities: making two retrials brings both down by 20-70 % while for fully persistent behavior the gain is 300%. The impact is more pronounced in underloaded system conditions. User persistence also increases the usage of system resources by 20-40 % and decreases the percentage of wasted resources by two/three times. However, these gains come at the expense of decreased successful session completion probability without retrials negatively affecting the overall user experience.}

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based user mobility prediction, user assignment and drone position optimisation scheme for a UAV swarm-enabled wireless communication system in the presence of malicious Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attackers. Specifically, a robust deep learning-based user mobility prediction model, namely denoising autoencoder recurrent transformer (DART), is designed. Additionally, two efficient user assignment and drone position optimisation methods are proposed. The proposed deep learning model forecasts user locations, on which we construct and solve assignment and position optimisation problems. Simulation results show that the proposed deep learning-based prediction-optimisation scheme can provide up to 30% higher overall sum rate compared with the adversarially trained long short-term memory (LSTM) baseline and almost double the overall sum rate compared with the vanilla LSTM baseline.}

	abstract = {As wireless information transmission (WIT) progresses into its sixth generation (6G), a challenge arises in sustaining terminal operations with limited batteries for Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. To address this, wireless power transfer (WPT) emerges as a solution, empowering battery-less infrastructures and enabling nodes to harvest energy for sustainable operations. Thus, the eclectic integration of WPT with WIT mechanisms becomes crucial to mitigate the need for battery replacements while providing secure and reliable communication. A novel protocol that amalgamates WIT and WPT called Information Harvesting (IH) has recently been proposed to effectively handle challenges in wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) by employing index modulation (IM) techniques for data communication atop the existing far-field WPT mechanism. This paper presents a unified framework for IM-based IH mechanisms and evaluates their energy harvesting capability, bit error rate (BER), and ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) performance for diverse IM schemes. The findings indicate the significant potential of the IM-based IH mechanism in facilitating reliable data communication within existing far-field WPT systems while underscoring promising refinements in green and secure communication paradigms for next-generation IoT wireless networks.}

This paper presents a novel dual frequency index modulation (DFIM) scheme for OTFS to improve spectral efficiency (SE). Exploring the internal relationship between indices, the proposed scheme, termed OTFS-DFIM, turns the classic index mapping process into a cascaded procedure involving partial index mapping and index updating. The differential information between grid points in the delay-Doppler domain and the time-frequency information are utilized to jointly determine the active grid points, which enables the OTFS frame to remain sparse and results in promising bit error rate (BER) performance. We also propose three distribution modes of IM subblocks in the two-dimensional grid and analyze their impact on receiver structure and system performance. The tight closed-form expressions of BER are derived. Additionally, we evaluate existing linear/non-linear equalization algorithms in OTFS and adapt them to the OTFS-IM/OTFS-DFIM system, offering a comprehensive insight on the tradeoffs between complexity and BER performance. Numerical simulations validate the superior performance of the OTFS-DFIM scheme in both SE and BER.}

	abstract = {Cognitive radio has been suggested as a solution to address the shortage of accessible spectrum caused by the significant demand for wideband services and the fragmentation of spectrum resources. Nevertheless, the sensing performance is rather inadequate owing to the diminished sensing signal-to-noise ratio, especially in complex environments with severe channel fading. Fortunately, applying reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for spectrum sensing can efficiently address the aforementioned problems. However, the passive RIS may experience the “double fading” effect, seriously limiting the effectiveness of passive RIS-aided spectrum sensing. Thus, a crucial challenge is how to fully exploit the potential advantages of the RIS and further improve the sensing performance. In this paper, we utilize the passive and active RIS to further enhance detection probability and subsequently develop two different problems for both the passive and active RIS to achieve the detection probability maximization. Considering the complexity of the above problems, we design a one-stage optimization algorithm featuring inner approximation and a two-stage optimization algorithm that employs the bisection method to derive corresponding solutions, and further establish the upper bound and lower bound of the detection probability by employing the Rayleigh quotient. Moreover, we separately explore how many reflecting elements are needed for passive RIS and active RIS and investigate the detection performance comparison of the two types (passive and active) of RIS. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms under the same parameter configuration, and achieve a detection probability close to 1 with even fewer reflecting elements or antennas than existing schemes.}

	abstract = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks will become the core infrastructure of space-air–ground integrated networks in 6G wireless technology, providing ubiquitous broadband internet services for global users in a cost-effective manner. However, timing synchronization is a significant problem in large-scale multisatellite (MSAT) communications. Due to the different propagation delays, signals transmitted from multiple satellites to a user terminal are always misaligned. In this paper, we study asynchronous satellite-terrestrial interference in LEO MSAT systems, aiming to mitigate asynchronous interference through cooperative beamforming. Specifically, we derive an MSAT coherent transmission model and analyse the power degeneration of interference due to the offset sample time. We also derive the closed-form expression for the achievable rate by considering asynchrony and propose a cooperative beamforming algorithm based on the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) criterion. To realize accurate timing advance (TA), we design a delay estimation method based on pseudorandom code. Finally, we approximate the achievable rate under an imperfect TA and propose a timing-error–robust algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed asynchronous algorithm achieves a 21.47% performance improvement over the conventional algorithm, indicating that by exploiting time asynchrony, we can naturally eliminate some interference and achieve substantial performance improvements.}

	abstract = {Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) is the enabler of Terahertz (THz) communications in next-generation wireless networks. In THz UM-MIMO systems, a new paradigm of cross-field communications spanning from near-field to far-field is emerging, since the near-field range expands with higher frequencies and larger array apertures. Precise beam alignment in cross-field is critical but challenging. Specifically, unlike far-field beams that rely only on the angle domain, the incorporation of dual-domain (angle and distance) training significantly increases overhead. A natural question arises of whether far-field beam training can be deployed for cross-field beam alignment. In this paper, this question is answered, by demonstrating that the far-field training enables sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both far- and near-field scenarios, while exciting all channel dimensions. Based on that, we propose a subarray-coordinated hierarchical (SCH) training with greatly reduced overhead. To further obtain high-precision beam designs, we propose a two-phase angle and distance beam estimator (TPBE). Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Compared to near-field exhaustive search, the SCH possesses 0.2% training overhead. The TPBE achieves 0.16 degrees and 0.01 meters estimation root-mean-squared errors for angle and distance. Furthermore, with the estimated beam directions, a near-optimal SNR with 0.3 dB deviation is attained after beam alignment.}

	abstract = {Most learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback efforts concentrate on enhancing feedback accuracy through innovative neural network (NN) designs and exploiting correlations. This paper introduces an integrated learning framework for CSI feedback and localization designed to synergistically improve both tasks. We present a novel unified approach for CSI feedback and downlink CSI-based localization, where feedback is facilitated by an autoencoder, and the downlink CSI-based localization uses the feedback codeword directly without requiring reconstruction. The goal is to simultaneously minimize feedback and localization errors. Additionally, for users with access to coarse position data, we propose a refined framework that integrates this information into both the feedback mechanism and localization processes. This coarse positional knowledge is incorporated into the encoding and decoding stages to reduce feedback errors and is inputted into the localization NN to enhance localization accuracy. The improved framework is refined through an end-to-end training strategy, focusing on concurrently reducing feedback and localization errors. Simulation results using ray tracing channel datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only enables feedback and localization tasks to mutually benefit but also shows that incorporating coarse positional data significantly increases the accuracy of both CSI feedback and CSI-based localization.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multicasting is a promising approach for simultaneously delivering common messages to multiple users in next-generation wireless networks. However, existing studies have exclusively focused on multicast beamforming designs based on the Shannon capacity, assuming the infinite blocklength (IBL) for transmission. This assumption may lead to strictly suboptimal designs for practical multicast transmissions with finite blocklength (FBL), especially in ultra-reliable low-latency communications. In this paper, we explore the beamforming design for massive MIMO multi-group multicasting in the FBL regime. Our study considers both the max-min fairness and the weighted sum rate criteria for a comprehensive treatment. Due to the non-concave FBL rate function, the resulting optimization problems are known to be notoriously hard. We characterize the necessary and sufficient condition for the non-negative FBL rate to be a concave function of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Considering a finite number of transmit antennas, we propose low-complexity majorization-minimization (MM) type algorithms, which update variables in either closed or semi-closed form, to achieve locally optimal solutions of the formulated optimization problems. We further show that, as the number of transmit antennas becomes large, the optimal beamformer of each group aligns asymptotically with a linear combination of the channel vectors of that group of users, where the optimal normalized combining coefficients are derived in closed form. Subsequently, we obtain the globally optimal multicast beamformers by optimizing the power allocation using low-complexity iterative algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform several existing methods, especially those employing the Shannon capacity as the performance metric. Moreover, the proposed algorithms exhibit complexities that only slightly grow with the number of transmit antennas and they can notably reduce the computation time by up to two orders of magnitude over the benchmarks, making them highly beneficial for massive MIMO applications.}

This work shows the importance of transmitting downlink pilots for a NOMA CF mMIMO system, and derives a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression with spatially-correlated Rician channels by addressing the complexity due to i) dynamic-resolution analog to digital converters; and ii) channel estimation errors. We also design a low-complexity parallel block minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm to optimize the non-convex global energy efficiency (GEE) metric.

In this paper, we focus on D2D-underlaid cellular network, where the D2D communication is performed on a hybrid manner (i.e., operating over either mmWave or microwave frequency band). To secure the hybrid D2D communication against vigilant adversary, we apply covert communication to hide its presence. In particular, the D2D transmitters perform power control and communication mode switch as well as leveraging the cellular signal to avoid the transmission detection by the adversaries. We model the conflict between the D2D transmitters and adversaries in the framework of a two-stage Stackelberg game. The D2D transmitters are the leaders to maximize their utility subject to the constraints on communication covertness at the upper stage. The adversaries are the followers to minimize their detection errors at the lower stage. We apply stochastic geometry to mathematically characterize the network spatial configuration and consider a large-scale D2D-underlaid network, enabling the study from system-level perspective. We analyze the game equilibrium and obtain it by adopting a bi-level algorithm. Numerical results are provided and insightful conclusions are drawn. Compared with the conventional D2D communication, hybrid D2D communication shows a significant advantage regarding throughput under the same security requirement while weak resistance to the more stringent security requirement.}

	abstract = {The millimeter wave (mmWave) has received considerable interest due to its expansive bandwidth and high frequency. However, a noteworthy challenge arises from its vulnerability to blockages, leading to reduced coverage and achievable rate. To address these limitations, a potential solution is to deploy distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which comprise many low-cost and passively reflected elements, and can facilitate the establishment of extra communication links. In this paper, we leverage stochastic geometry to investigate the ergodic coverage probability and the achievable rate in both distributed RISs-assisted single-cell and multi-cell mmWave wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first establish the system model considering the stochastically distributed blockages, RISs and users by the Poisson point process. Then we give the association criterion and derive the association probabilities, the distance distributions, and the conditional coverage probabilities, for two cases of associations between base stations and users without or with RISs. Finally, we use Campbell’s theorem and the total probability theorem to obtain the closed-form expressions of the ergodic coverage probability and the achievable rate. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our analysis method, and demonstrate that by deploying distributed RISs, the ergodic coverage probability is significantly improved by approximately 50%, and the achievable rate is increased by more than 1.5 times.}

	abstract = {The cellular network of magnetic Induction (MI) communication holds promise in long-distance underground environments. In the traditional MI communication, there is no fast-fading channel since the MI channel is treated as a quasi-static channel. However, for the vehicle (mobile) MI (VMI) communication, the unpredictable antenna vibration brings the remarkable fast-fading. As such fast-fading cannot be modeled by the central limit theorem, it differs radically from other wireless fast-fading channels. Unfortunately, few studies focus on this phenomenon. In this paper, using a novel space modeling based on the electromagnetic field theorem, we propose a 3-dimension model of the VMI antenna vibration. By proposing “conjugate pseudo-piecewise functions” and boundary p(x)\ndistribution, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF) and the expectation of the VMI fast-fading channel. We also theoretically analyze the effects of the VMI fast-fading on the network throughput, including the VMI outage probability which can be ignored in the traditional MI channel study. We draw several intriguing conclusions different from those in wireless fast-fading studies. For instance, the fast-fading brings more uniformly distributed channel coefficients. Finally, we propose the power control algorithm using the non-cooperative game and multiagent Q-learning methods to optimize the throughput of the cellular VMI network. Simulations validate the derivation and the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses two challenges faced by mm-Wave communication systems in outdoor environments. A temporary blockage of the narrow Line of Sight (LoS) beam between the base station and the mobile, e.g., by an interposed hand, face or a pedestrian, can cause an outage. It has been suggested that a dense deployment of base stations is necessary to combat blockage, which is however a capital expensive proposition. This paper presents a low cost solution. It shows that in outdoor environments with hard surfaces, such as pavements, parking lots, etc., there is generally a ground reflected beam that allows sufficient data rate for a control channel to maintain time synchronization during the blockage of the LoS beam. This makes possible a quick reversion to the LoS beam as soon as the temporary blockage ends. The design of a protocol TERRA is described, and is experimentally shown to avoid outage 84.5~\\% of the time during pedestrian blockages in outdoor environments. The protocol TERRA also addresses a second problem: when the blockage is permanent, or due to mobility, the user has moved away from the earlier serving base station. In such cases a handover to a neighbor base station is needed. There are several challenges of ensuring a soft handover due to the narrow mmWave beams. Since blockages are sudden, the mobile will need to be always ready to switch to a neighbor base station’s beam. This requires that it always have in hand a suitable neighbor base station, as well as continually realign its beam to that neighbor base station while it is mobile. TERRA shows how this is to be done without the neighbor base station’s active cooperation, since connection with it is not yet established. At the same time, TERRA also needs to and does continually realign the mobile’s beam with its presently serving base station to counteract its mobility. TERRA thereby enables the mobile to perform a soft handover to a neighbor base station in the event of a permanent blockage, without requiring any side information, unlike the existing works. Evaluations show that TERRA maintains received signal strength close to the optimal solution while keeping track of the neighbor base station.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the performance optimization of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with digital modulation and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is studied. In particular, a MIMO system is considered in which edge devices transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a parameter server (PS) using beamforming to maximize the number of devices scheduled for transmission. The PS, acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts it back to all devices. Due to the limited bandwidth in a wireless network, AirComp is adopted to enable efficient wireless data aggregation. However, fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an AirComp-based FL scheme. To tackle this challenge, we propose a modified federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm that combines digital modulation with AirComp to mitigate wireless fading while ensuring the communication efficiency. This is achieved by a joint transmit and receive beamforming design, which is formulated as an optimization problem to dynamically adjust the beamforming matrices based on current FL model parameters so as to minimize the transmitting error and ensure the FL performance. To achieve this goal, we first analytically characterize how the beamforming matrices affect the performance of the FedAvg in different iterations. Based on this relationship, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the local FL models of all devices and adjust the beamforming matrices at the PS for future model transmission. The algorithmic advantages and improved performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments.}

We then propose multiple convex optimization algorithms to maximize the proposed metrics by updating the RIS matrix, validating that the metrics indeed represent the desired objectives successfully. Through the metrics, only a single RIS matrix update is required, contrast to existing works using alternating optimization. Finally, since the aforementioned optimization algorithms still suffer from high complexity, we propose RIS element allocation algorithms that update the RIS matrix to maximize the metrics with minimal complexities.

	abstract = {The high altitude platform station (HAPS) technology is garnering significant interest as a viable technology for serving as base stations in communication networks. However, HAPS faces the challenge of high spatial correlation among adjacent users’ channel gains which is due to the dominant line-of-sight (LoS) path between HAPS and terrestrial users. Furthermore, there is a spatial correlation among antenna elements of HAPS that depends on the propagation environment and the distance between elements of the antenna array. This paper presents an antenna architecture for HAPS and considers the mentioned issues by characterizing the channel gain and the spatial correlation matrix of the HAPS. We propose a cylindrical antenna for HAPS that utilizes vertical uniform linear array (ULA) sectors. Moreover, to address the issue of high spatial correlation among users, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) clustering method is proposed. An algorithm is also developed to allocate power among users to maximize both spectral efficiency and energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) conditions. Finally, simulation results indicate that the spatial correlation has a significant impact on spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in multiple antenna HAPS systems.}

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) compression and feedback is a common way of acquiring the CSI at the transmitter in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to the lack of channel reciprocity. However, implicit reciprocity potentially exists in the bi-directional channels of an FDD system because they in fact share physically the same propagation paths. We propose to leverage this implicit reciprocity in FDD mMIMO systems to minimize the feedback overhead and enhance the CSI recovery with uplink channel information at the transmitter. To achieve this, we develop a disentangled representation (DR) learning enabled neural network (NN), named DrCsiNet, to realize the selective CSI compression feedback with the assistance of uplink CSI. The proposed DrCsiNet successfully extracts the information of reciprocity implicitly shared between the downlink and uplink channels in FDD mMIMO, while it simultaneously extracts selective information from the downlink CSI excluding the implicit reciprocity component for compression feedback. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed DrCsiNet against existing methods under various setups. Results demonstrate remarkable performance gains of DrCsiNet for CSI recovery and evidence a strong generalization ability across various network structures. These findings validate the efficacy of disentangling implicit CSI reciprocity embedded in uplink CSI for enhancing the downlink CSI recovery in FDD mMIMO.}

	abstract = {Loop closure detection is an important aspect of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to correct long-term drift by finding overlapping trajectories. However, in multipath SLAM using radio signals, due to the limitation of low-resolution sensors and few features, most of the existing works have not fully explored loop closure. In this paper, we propose a loop closure detection algorithm for multipath SLAM, Wi-Loop SLAM, that can reduce cumulative errors. To recognize previously visited places, we use the multipath parameters extracted from received signals as matching features without introducing new information. We use a delayed selection strategy to ensure that the most appropriate pairing is selected, and a confirmation of location drift is required to minimize unnecessary computation. Finally, we derive a Bayesian model to perform loop optimization with the particle-based sum-product algorithm (SPA). Simulation results show that the proposed Wi-Loop SLAM can correct the state estimate drift in the environment where propagation paths are often obscured.}

	abstract = {Dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) is a promising technology in future integrated sensing and communication systems. Since communication and sensing performance need to be taken into consideration for joint radar and communication (JRC) beamforming in the DFRC system, existing approaches mainly transform JRC beamforming problems into convex optimization problems and then solve them with classical convex solvers. These traditional solutions heavily rely on precise channel estimation and entail high computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate a deep learning-based optimization approach for JRC beamforming to enhance the spectral efficiency for communication users and guarantee the probability of detecting targets. To achieve better performance, we leverage the theoretical optimal structures of JRC beamforming and design an effective deep neural network architecture. To further reduce the computational burden in the training phase of neural network, we develope an improved orthogonal beamforming technique. Simulation results verify that our proposed algorithm guarantees the required sensing performance and outperforms numerical algorithms in terms of communication performance. The orthogonal beamforming technique achieves satisfactory performance with low computational complexity.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks leads to the generation of vast volumes of remote sensing data which is traditionally transferred to the ground server for centralized processing, raising privacy and bandwidth concerns. Federated edge learning (FEEL), as a distributed machine learning approach, has the potential to address these challenges by sharing only model parameters instead of raw data. Although promising, the dynamics of LEO networks, characterized by the high mobility of satellites and short ground-to-satellite link (GSL) duration, pose unique challenges for FEEL. Notably, frequent model transmission between the satellites and ground incurs prolonged waiting time and large transmission latency. This paper introduces a novel FEEL algorithm, named FedMega, tailored to LEO mega-constellation networks. By integrating inter-satellite links (ISL) for intra-orbit model aggregation, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the usage of low data-rate and intermittent GSL. Our proposed method includes a ring all-reduce based intra-orbit aggregation mechanism, coupled with a network flow-based transmission scheme for global model aggregation, which enhances transmission efficiency. Theoretical convergence analysis is provided to characterize the algorithm performance. Extensive simulations show that our FedMega algorithm outperforms existing satellite FEEL algorithms, exhibiting an approximate 30% improvement in convergence rate.}

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing user density and quality of service (QoS) demand, 5G networks with limited spectrum resources are facing massive access challenges. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel discrete semantic feature division multiple access (SFDMA) paradigm for multi-user digital interference networks. Specifically, by utilizing deep learning technology, SFDMA extracts multi-user semantic information into discrete representations in distinguishable semantic subspaces, which enables multiple users to transmit simultaneously over the same time-frequency resources. Furthermore, based on a robust information bottleneck, we design a SFDMA based multi-user digital semantic interference network for inference tasks, which can achieve approximate orthogonal transmission. Moreover, we propose a SFDMA based multi-user digital semantic interference network for image reconstruction tasks, where the discrete outputs of the semantic encoders of the users are approximately orthogonal, which significantly reduces multi-user interference. Furthermore, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula for semantic communications, which is the first theoretical relationship between inference accuracy and transmission power. Then, we derive adaptive power control methods with closed-form expressions for inference tasks. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SFDMA.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can dynamically reconstruct wireless environments to enhance spectral efficiency. However, most existing studies have ignored the impact of the phase error and imperfect amplitude gain of the RIS. In this paper, we investigate the practical RIS-aided multiuser communication systems by maximizing the sum of users’ average achievable rate, filling the current research gap. Specifically, a novel RIS phase shift design approach, namely amplitude feedback (AF), is proposed by utilizing the coupling relationship between the amplitude and phase to derive the optimal phase shift under the worst phase error. The feasibility of AF is demonstrated by proving the measurability of amplitude response through the electromagnetic theory. We propose a channel estimation design with low pilot overhead and provide an effective closed-form achievable rate to approximate the average achievable rate. Moreover, an efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal closed-form precoding at the base station and the optimal trade-off design between the amplitude and phase of RIS, and the algorithm is extended to active RIS systems. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed AF method and optimization algorithm can efficiently improve the performance in terms of achievable sum rate compared to existing methods.}

The existence of private and common stream as well as their conditioning for Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), gives rise to an expanded set of opportunities for retransmission of failed packets. Specifically, we devise a scheme in which the retransmissions are scheduled through the common stream, which offers a higher success probability. With this, the common stream needs to carry both new and retransmitted bits, which leads to a layered HARQ (L-HARQ) strategy which is capable of trading off throughput and reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that the devised HARQ scheme outperforms RSMA with conventional HARQ, where each retransmission is handled independently through its own stream. It also helps in closing the throughput gap between HARQ and Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) in the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime while also achieving a decreased Packet Error Rate (PER) and a lower latency.}

	abstract = {As upcoming, beyond-5G (B5G) wireless network generations are expected to deliver much better performance than existing solutions, Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are gaining relevance as one of the new key technologies able to facilitate such improvement. Interestingly, they can redesign how the propagation environment is conceived by giving an opportunity to programmatically alter it: they can be configured to behave as orientable mirrors, scatterers, or lenses. This flexibility allows for the successful exploitation of bands which provide superior performance in wireless links but present poor propagation properties. However, this fascinating technology comes at not negligible costs: RISs require ad-hoc design, deployment and management operations to be fully exploited. In this paper, we tackle one of the open problems in the RISs literature: the optimal placement. We propose a model-based and a model-free approach, respectively RISA and AI-RISA, showcasing their large-scale solutions on synthetic topologies to improve communication performance while solving the “dead-zone” coverage problem. Additionally, our frameworks are empirically validated within a realistic indoor scenario, the Rennes railway station, showing how a complex indoor propagation environment can be fully disciplined by an advanced RISs installation.}

The system incorporates a novel dynamic delay alignment (DDA) modulation technique, allowing signals from different paths to reach the receiver simultaneously, eliminating the need for complex channel equalization and mitigating inter-symbol interference, while considering the dynamic movement of the vehicular units (VUs), and accounting for time-selective fading and uniform Doppler power spectra (DPS) model. Our system is equipped with a dual-function radar and communication multiple-antenna base station (BS), which simultaneously serves both communication and target sensing functions through an ASRIS. The objective is to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing BS transmit beamforming, ASRIS reflection and transmission beamforming matrices, VU mobility correlation parameters, and radar receive filter. Traditional optimization methods prove challenging given the intricate nature of this non-convex optimization problem, owing to dynamic changes in communication links and the interplay of multiple variables. To overcome this, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. MADDPG enables collaborative learning, adapts to the dynamic communication environment, and excels in optimizing interdependent parameters in the proposed THz system. Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and modified-PPO (MPPO) algorithms serve as benchmarks, showcasing the distinctive advantages of the ML-based MADDPG solution for the proposed system’s complexities. Our simulations validate the substantial benefits of ASRIS over conventional RIS benchmark scenarios.}

To tackle the variables coupling in outage probability constraints, the property of perspective function and the quadratic transform are applied. Then, the Bernstein-type inequality is used to derive the computationally tractable forms of the outage probability constraints. The considered problem is further decomposed into four subproblems and solved by the proposed alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm. Numerical results show the proposed algorithm outperforms three existing AO-based baselines in terms of convergence speed and optimality performance.

Leveraging these advantages, a multiple-input multiple-output NOMA-ISAC framework is proposed in this paper, in which the technique of signal alignment is adopted. The performance of the proposed framework for both downlink and uplink is analyzed. 1) The downlink ISAC is investigated under three different precoding designs: a sensing-centric (S-C) design, a communications-centric (C-C) design, and a Pareto optimal design. 2) For the uplink case, two scenarios are investigated: a S-C design and a C-C design, which vary based on the order of interference cancellation between the communication and sensing signals. In each of these scenarios, key performance metrics including sensing rate (SR), communication rate (CR), and outage probability are investigated. For a deeper understanding, the asymptotic performance of the system in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region is also explored, with a focus on the high-SNR slope and diversity order. Finally, the SR-CR rate regions achieved by ISAC and FDSAC are studied. Numerical results reveal that in both downlink and uplink cases, ISAC outperforms FDSAC in terms of sensing and communications performance and is capable of achieving a broader rate region, clearly showcasing its superiority.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) opens up new service possibilities for sixth-generation (6G) systems, where both communication and sensing (C&S) functionalities co-exist by sharing the same hardware platform and radio resource. In this paper, we investigate the waveform design problem in a downlink multi-user and multi-target ISAC system under different C&S performance preferences. The multi-user interference (MUI) may critically degrade the communication performance. To eliminate the MUI, we employ the constructive interference mechanism into the ISAC system, which saves the power budget for communication. However, due to the conflict between C&S metrics, it is intractable for the ISAC system to achieve the optimal performance of C&S objective simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to strike a trade-off between C&S objectives. By virtue of the multi-objective optimization theory, we propose a weighted Tchebycheff-based transformation method to re-frame the C&S trade-off problem as a Pareto-optimal problem, thus effectively tackling the constraints in ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results reveal the trade-off relation between C&S performances, which provides insights for the flexible waveform design under different C&S performance preferences in MIMO-ISAC systems.}

Overcoming the limitations of traditional discrete operations that impede gradient flow, these layers leverage the concrete distribution to facilitate efficient learning processes.

This paper proposes a tractable model of product-distance association in IRS-assisted networks, where the Cassini oval is leveraged to characterize the IRS association mechanism theoretically, and the system coverage probability is analyzed by stochastic geometry. Specifically, modeling the product-distance of IRS by the mathematical model of the Cassini curve and considering the physical limitations of the half-space reflection in IRS, the probability density function of the minimum product-distance of IRS that can successfully reflect the signal is derived by approximating the area of Cassini oval. Furthermore, a semi-closed expression of the coverage probability is obtained under Rician fading through the Gamma approximation of expected signal power and the Laplace transform of interference power. In addition, the analysis results indicate a trade-off between the number of IRS elements deployed in the network and the density of base stations, and the tendency of this trade-off changes with IRS density. The numerical results reveal the optimal coverage performance based on product-distance association is 28.8% higher than that of nearest-distance-based association.}

	abstract = {Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems with sensing functionality are envisioned to facilitate global-coverage service and emerging applications in 6G. Currently, two fundamental challenges, namely, inter-beam interference among users and power limitation at the LEO satellites, limit the full potential of the joint design of sensing and communication. To effectively control the interference, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is employed as the interference management strategy in the system design. On the other hand, to address the limited power supply at the LEO satellites, we consider low-resolution quantization digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the transmitter to reduce power consumption, which grows exponentially with the number of quantization bits. Additionally, optimizing the total energy efficiency (EE) of the system is a common practice to save the power. However, this metric lacks fairness among users. To ensure this fairness and further enhance EE, we investigate the max-min fairness EE of the RSMA-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-LEO satellite system. In this system, the satellite transmits a quantized dual-functional signal serving downlink users while detecting a target. Specifically, we optimize the precoders for maximizing the minimal EE among all users, considering the power consumption of each radio frequency (RF) chain under communication and sensing constraints. To tackle this optimization problem, we proposed an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach’s method. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed design and RSMA architecture outperforms strategies maximizing the total EE of the system, space-division multiple access (SDMA), and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in terms of max-min fairness EE and the communication-sensing trade-off.}

	abstract = {In this paper, the covert communication is considered with a full-duplex (FD) receiver under covertness and reliability constraints in the finite blocklength regime. Conventional covert communication systems are restricted by the square root law. To break through this limitation, an FD receiver is introduced, generating artificial noise (AN) to confuse the warder’s detection and achieving positive covert rates. To investigate the tradeoff among covertness, reliability, blocklength and throughput, the expressions of the warder’s detection error probability and the receiver’s decoding error probability in the finite blocklength regime are derived. Moreover, the asymptotic throughput is analyzed when the maximum transmit power of the FD receiver approaches infinity. Through the asymptotic analysis, we find that the blocklength’s impact on the covertness performance vanishes, which is a reason for achieving positive covert rates. However, the AN will also cause harmful residual self-interference to the receiver for which the FD receiver should be carefully designed by making a tradeoff between the covertness and the effective throughput. Hence, an optimization problem is formulated and solved to maximize the covert throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is effective in the finite blocklength regime where positive covert rates can be obtained.}

We delve into the research of the multi-user uplink transmission with both the base station and the users equipped with holographic planar arrays. To begin, we construct an HMIMO channel model utilizing electromagnetic field equations, accompanied by a colored noise model that accounts for both electromagnetic interference and hardware noise. Since this model is continuous, we approximate it within a finite-dimensional space spanned by Fourier space series, which can be defined as the communication mode functions. We show that this channel model samples Green’s function in the wavenumber domain in different communication modes. Subsequently, we tackle the challenging task of maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system, which involves optimizing the continuous current density function (CDF) for each user. Using the aforementioned approximation model, we transform the optimization variables into expansion coefficients of the CDFs on a finite-dimensional space, for which we propose an iterative water-filling algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in enhancing the system SE and show the influence of the colored noise and the system parameters on the SE.}

To provide space-centric solutions, the limited coverage time and limited resources of LEO satellites pose challenges to maintaining service continuity and ensuring low latency for users. Furthermore, LEO satellites rely on solar panels to obtain energy, so a balance needs to be struck between energy consumption and service provision for satellite mobile edge computing. In this paper, we aim to achieve space-centric computational task offloading in LEO satellite networks. The goal is to minimize end-to-end task offloading latency while considering the constraints posed by the limited onboard computing, storage, and energy resources in constantly moving LEO satellites. To achieve this, we formulate a joint problem of service migration and power control in energy-harvesting LEO satellite networks. The problem is then converted into a Markov decision process (MDP) and solved with SpaceEdge, a novel algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). SpaceEdge offers supports for both centralized learning and multi-agent learning. Simulation results show that SpaceEdge, particularly the multi-agent model, outperforms existing solutions, demonstrating its effectiveness in deploying space-centric task offloading services in LEO satellite networks.}

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal spectrum sensing of multiple primary users (PUs) sharing the same channels with unknown and irregular coverage presents significant challenges. The receive signal strength (RSS) levels at secondary users (SUs) vary greatly due to path propagation loss and shadowing. Moreover, due to security concerns and limited energy at SUs, the reported RSS measurements to a fusion center are noisy and incomplete. These challenges seriously impact the performance of existing cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) techniques. In this work, to address these issues, we propose a robust graph learning based CSS (RoGL-CSS) detector, after revealing the low rank property of the expectation of RSS matrix and formulating a graph learning problem. By solving the graph learning problem with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a probability matrix (graph) representing the correlations among SUs is acquired, which is applied to recover the expectation of RSSs from corrupted measurements and select SUs for CSS. Specifically, a robust RSS recovery algorithm with a learned probability matrix is adopted, and the SUs with recovered RSSs of high correlations are collected for implementing CSS. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detector compared to state-of-the-art detectors. At a false-alarm probability of 10%, with measurement missing rate 20% and outlier rate 30%, RoGL-CSS achieves performance improvement of at least 16% and 9% in detection probability, compared to other detectors for scenarios of two and five PUs, respectively.}

Alice covertly transmits messages to Bob with the assistance of the XL-RIS, while evading detection by Willie. To enhance the covert communication performance, we maximize the achievable covert rate by jointly optimizing the hybrid analog and digital beamformers at Alice, as well as the reflection coefficient matrix at the XL-RIS. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the joint beamforming design problem. For the hybrid beamformer design, a semi-closed-form solution for fully digital beamformer is first obtained by a weighted minimum mean-square error based algorithm, then the baseband digital and analog beamformers at Alice are designed by approximating the fully digital beamformer via manifold optimization. For the XL-RIS’s reflection coefficient matrix design, a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers based algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of large-scale variables and unit-modulus constraints. Numerical results unveil that i) the near-field communications can achieve a higher covert rate than the far-field covert communications in general, and still realize covert transmission even if Willie is located at the same direction as Bob and closer to the XL-RIS; ii) the proposed algorithm can enhance the covert rate significantly compared to the benchmark schemes; iii) the proposed algorithm leads to a beam diffraction pattern that can bypass Willie and achieve high-rate covert transmission to Bob.}

To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative MEC framework that facilitates resource sharing between the edge servers, and with the aim to maximize the long-term QoS and reduce the cache switching costs through joint optimization of service caching, collaborative offloading, and computation and communication resource allocation. The dual timescale feature and temporal recurrence relationship between service caching and other resource allocation make solving the problem even more challenging. To solve it, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dual timescale scheme, called DGL-DDPG, which is composed of a short-term genetic algorithm (GA) and a long short-term memory network-based deep deterministic policy gradient (LSTM-DDPG). In doing so, we reformulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the small-timescale resource allocation decisions generated by an improved GA are taken as the states and inputted into a centralized LSTM-DDPG agent to generate the service caching decision for the large-timescale. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the average QoS and the cache switching costs.}

	abstract = {An active-sensing-based sense-then-train (STT) scheme is proposed for beam training in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Compared to conventional codebook-based schemes, the proposed STT scheme is capable of not only addressing the complex spherical-wave propagation but also effectively exploiting the additional degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs). The STT scheme is tailored for both single-beam and multi-beam cases. 1) For the single-beam case, the STT scheme first utilizes a sensing phase to estimate a low-dimensional representation of the near-field MIMO channel in the truncated wavenumber domain. Then, in the subsequent training phase, the neural network modules at transceivers are updated online to align beams, utilizing sequentially received ping-pong pilots. This approach can efficiently obtain the aligned beam pair without relying on predefined codebooks or training datasets. 2) For the multi-beam case, based on the single-beam STT, a Gram-Schmidt method is further utilized to guarantee the orthogonality between beams in the training phase. Numerical results unveil that 1) the proposed STT scheme can significantly enhance the beam training performance in the near field compared to the conventional far-field codebook-based schemes, and 2) the proposed STT scheme can perform fast and low-complexity beam training, while achieving a near-optimal performance without full channel state information in both cases.}

	abstract = {As one of the pivotal enablers for 6G, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks have emerged as a solution to provide extensive connectivity and comprehensive 3D coverage across the spatial-aerial-terrestrial domains to cater to the specific requirements of 6G massive ultra-reliable and low latency communications (mURLLC) applications, while upholding a diverse set of stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In the context of mURLLC satellite services, the concept of data freshness assumes paramount significance, as the use of outdated data may lead to unforeseeable or even catastrophic consequences. To effectively gauge the degree of data freshness for satellite-terrestrial integrated communications, the notion of age of information (AoI) has recently emerged as a new dimension of QoS metrics to support time-sensitive applications. Nonetheless, the research efforts directed towards incorporating diverse statistical QoS provisioning metrics, including AoI, delay, and reliability, while accommodating the dynamic and intricate nature of satellite-terrestrial integrated environments, are still in their infancy. To overcome these problems, in this paper we develop analytical modeling formulations/frameworks for statistical QoS over 6G satellite-terrestrial integrated networks using hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) in the finite blocklength regime. In particular, first we design the satellite-terrestrial integrated wireless network architecture model and AoI metric model. Second, we characterize the peak-AoI bounded QoS metric using HARQ-IR protocol. Third, we develop a set of new fundamental statistical QoS metrics in the finite blocklength regime. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted to assess and analyze the efficacy of statistical QoS schemes for satellite-terrestrial integrated networks.}

	abstract = {The scope of the 6G wireless communication system is envisioned to expand beyond delivering data to humans and towards connecting machines that constantly upload computation-intensive status updates to obtain real-time situational awareness. Under dynamic environments, the amount of useful information contained in status updates degrades over time, which could be measured based on the concept of age of information. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to investigate the temporal value of status updates, in terms of the peak age of information. Given the temporal dynamics of observed physical process, the procedure of transmission and computing is modeled as tandem queues for both parallel processing and series processing modes at the edge server. The obtained closed-form expressions explicitly characterize the coupling among information generation, transmission, and usage, which can be exploited as performance metrics for task-oriented resource optimization. The accuracy of our analysis is verified with simulation results. Based on the theoretical analysis, we formulate an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the age of status updates and energy consumption for multiple devices. Numerical results reveal that the computation and transmission time could be traded off to obtain timely status updates at low energy cost.}

	abstract = {To provide satisfying services for ever-emerging mission-critical applications, the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) need novel design to improve the spectrum efficiency and enhance the robustness. To achieve this, we design a robust rate-splitting and beamforming scheme for the downlink multiuser URLLC system in finite blocklength regime under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Rate-splitting is utilized to deal with the complex inter-user interference and improve the spectrum efficiency. Considering the norm-bounded CSIT error model, we formulate a minimum user rate maximization problem to guarantee the URLLC performance requirements by jointly designing the rate-splitting factors and the common/private beamforming vectors. The corresponding constraints are infinite due to the uncertainty of CSIT and the constraint set is also non-convex. To tackle it, we convert the infinite constraints into finite ones utilizing S-Procedure, and transform the original problem into difference of convex (DC) programming. Efficient approaches based on constrained concave convex procedure and Gaussian randomization are proposed to solve the DC programming and generate initial feasible points. Through extensive simulations, the convergence, robustness and effectiveness proprieties of the design are investigated and confirmed. Compared with the baselines, our design can achieve obvious performance improvement for different blocklength and block error rate requirements.}

Based on queuing theory, we formulate a delay minimization model that aggregates users’ requests to reduce repeated content delivery. To minimize network latency, the model is decomposed into three subproblems: task offloading, user clustering and communication resource allocation, and cache state updating. In each slot, the task offloading subproblem is solved utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) under a resource-constrained cloud-edge-terminal setting. During a transition between slots, mobile terminals are grouped using K-means-based user clustering, and the allocations of the subchannels and transmit power are optimized utilizing matching theory and successive convex approximation (SCA), respectively. Contents cached at the network nodes are updated, according to long-short-term memory (LSTM)-based predicted popularity. Simulations show that the proposed JTOCC model achieves lower-delay content distribution than its existing counterparts in cloud-edge-terminal cooperation environments, and converges fast in heterogeneous networks.}

In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission of ISAC aided by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Moreover, assuming that an aerial target is a potential eavesdropper, the artificial noise is introduced to disrupt the eavesdropping, while enhancing the sensing signal-to-noise ratio and the users’ quality of service. Aiming to maximize the sum secrecy rate, we jointly optimize the UAV deployment, BS transmit beamforming, artificial noise power and passive beamforming. The formulated non-convex problem is decomposed into three subproblems and solved via an iterative alternating optimization algorithm. Specifically, we introduce auxiliary variables to transform the non-convex subproblems into convex ones. For the UAV deployment solution, it can be obtained by successive convex approximation. With the optimal UAV deployment, the BS transmit beamforming, artificial noise power and passive beamforming can be derived by semi-definite relaxation. Finally, we present simulation results to validate the performance improvement of the proposed scheme on the security of ISAC.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the mobility problem in extremely large antenna array (ELAA) communication systems. In order to account for the performance loss caused by the spherical wavefront of ELAA in the mobility scenario, we propose a wavefront transformation-based matrix pencil (WTMP) channel prediction method. In particular, we design a matrix to transform the spherical wavefront into a new wavefront, which is closer to the plane wave. We also design a time-frequency projection matrix to capture the time-varying path delay. Furthermore, we adopt the matrix pencil (MP) method to estimate channel parameters. Our proposed WTMP method can mitigate the effect of near-field radiation when predicting future channels. Theoretical analysis shows that the designed matrix is asymptotically determined by the angles and distance between the base station (BS) antenna array and the scatterers or the user when the number of BS antennas is large enough. For an ELAA communication system in the mobility scenario, we prove that the prediction error converges to zero with the increasing number of BS antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed transform matrix efficiently mitigates the near-field effect, and that our proposed WTMP method can overcome the ELAA mobility challenge and approach the performance in stationary setting.}

	abstract = {Perceptive mobile network (PMN) is an emerging concept for next-generation wireless networks capable of conducting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). A major challenge for realizing high performance sensing in PMNs is how to deal with spatially separated asynchronous transceivers. Asynchronicity results in timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), which further cause ambiguity in ranging and velocity sensing. Most existing algorithms mitigate TOs and CFOs based on the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation path between sensing transceivers. However, LOS paths may not exist in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a cooperation based joint active and passive sensing scheme for the non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios having asynchronous transceivers. This scheme relies on the cross-correlation cooperative sensing (CCCS) algorithm, which regards active sensing as a reference and mitigates TOs and CFOs by correlating active and passive sensing information. Another major challenge for realizing high performance sensing in PMNs is how to realize high accuracy angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation with low complexity. Correspondingly, we propose a low complexity AoA algorithm based on cooperative sensing, which comprises coarse AoA estimation and fine AoA estimation. Analytical and numerical simulation results verify the performance advantages of the proposed CCCS algorithm and the low complexity AoA estimation algorithm.}

	abstract = {Joint optimization for common rate allocation and beamforming design have been widely studied in rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) empowered multiuser multi-antenna transmission networks. Due to the highly coupled optimization variables and non-convexity of the joint optimization problems, emerging algorithms such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and successive convex approximation (SCA) have been applied to RSMA which typically approximate the original problem with a sequence of disciplined convex subproblems and solve each subproblem by an optimization toolbox. While these approaches are capable of finding a viable solution, they are unable to offer a comprehensive understanding of the solution structure and are burdened by high computational complexity. In this work, for the first time, we identify the optimal beamforming structure and common rate allocation for the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem of RSMA. We then propose a computationally efficient optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and common rate allocation without relying on any toolbox. Specifically, we first approximate the original WSR maximization problem with a sequence of convex subproblems based on fractional programming (FP). By exploiting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of each subproblem, the optimal beamforming structure is derived. An efficient hyperplane fixed point iteration method is then proposed to find the optimal Lagrangian dual variables. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same performance but takes only 0.5% or less simulation time compared with the state-of-the-art WMMSE, SCA, and FP algorithms. The proposed algorithms pave the way for the practical and efficient optimization algorithm design for RSMA and its applications in 6G.}

As the captured audio signals are inevitably corrupted by ambient noises, signal enhancement is vital in WASNs. To this end, this paper proposes a distributed-robust and energy-efficient MVDR beamformer (BF) for WASNs. Specifically, a distributed MVDR BF is first derived by recursively updating the inverse of the noise correlation matrix, which requires fewer data transmission without sacrificing performance. Then, its robust version is further designed to alleviate the adverse effects of parameter mismatches. Finally, an energy-efficient network topology control (EENTC) is carried out to reduce the energy consumption, by optimizing the weight matrix of the distributed averaging process. Since the proposed EENTC strategy involves non-convex programming, we transform it into a convex one and solve it via the Dinkelbach algorithm. Unlike the centralized BFs, the proposed method works without an additional central processor. Moreover, it is robust against parameter mismatch during beamforming and can reduce a large amount of data transmission. Simulation and real-world experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed method.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a framework for realizing distributed machine learning in an environment where training samples are distributed to each device. Recently, FL has employed over-the-air computation enabling all devices to transmit learning model updates simultaneously. This work proposes a communication-efficient sparse one-bit analog aggregation (SOBAA) method, incorporating new power control, layer-wise scaled one-bit quantization, layer-wise sparsification, and an error-feedback mechanism. We derive a tight upper bound of the expected convergence rate of the proposed SOBAA as a closed-form expression. From this expression, we explicitly identify the relationship between the convergence rate and compression and aggregation errors. Based on the theoretical convergence analysis, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the compression ratio and power control to minimize compression and aggregation errors, leading to the fastest convergence. In each communication round, the optimization problem is decomposed, and solved in a computationally efficient and feasible way. From this solution, we characterize the trade-off between learning performance and communication cost. Through extensive experiments on well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we confirm that the proposed method provides an enhanced trade-off performance between test accuracy and communication costs and a faster convergence rate than the other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it is proven that the proposed method is more effective for more complex datasets and learning models.}

This feature proves advantageous in reducing the size and power consumption of underwater vehicles. This paper develops a JDC system based on multi-input multi-output sonar by using orthogonal linear frequency modulation (OLFM) waveforms. Here, the proposed OLFM-based JDC system (OLFM-JDC) considers the detection functionality as the primary task. Therefore, OLFM-JDC exploits the mainlobe of transmit beam to detect targets and the sidelobes to communicate with the remote receivers. To enhance the information embedding capacity, the waveform diversity and the combination of index and phase modulations are utilized. Particularly, we propose a low-complexity two-step decoder to simplify the information decoding. Furthermore, the two-step decoder effectively utilizes multipath information to improve the performance of index decoding, and it can even outperform the maximum likelihood scheme when assessed within a simulated South China Sea acoustic channel. The numerical results demonstrate that OLFM-JDC achieves higher data rates and lower error rates compared to the JDC systems that only utilize phase modulation. Additionally, the simultaneous transmission of multiple waveforms facilitates target detection by utilizing the generalized high-resolution range profile synthesis technique. Performance analysis indicates that OLFM-JDC exhibits similar resolution performance to systems implementing a wideband waveform.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an age of incorrect information (AoII)-aware data dissemination scheme for distributed multi-agent systems (MASs). In the proposed scheme, AoII is utilized to measure the importance of data in terms of timeliness and content. We formulate the joint optimization of time slot allocation and agent selection as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), with the objective of minimizing the AoII. To solve the Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (DV-MAPPO) is proposed. In particular, to tackle challenges posed by the partial observability of global system information, each agent estimates the global system state using variational inference. Moreover, to improve the accuracy of global system state estimation, each agent is given an intrinsic reward that is dominated by the accuracy of estimates. The proposed data dissemination scheme is implemented and evaluated in various missions. Simulation results show that the proposed data dissemination scheme outperforms traditional data dissemination schemes in terms of AoII. Furthermore, in typical multi-agent collaborative tasks, the proposed scheme facilitates more efficient cooperation among multiple agents compared to the data distribution mechanisms that ignore the importance of data.}

	abstract = {The future of vehicular communication networks relies on mmWave massive multi-input-multi-output antenna arrays for intensive data transfer and massive vehicle access. However, reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure links require exact alignment between the narrow beams, which traditionally involves excessive signaling overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel proactive beamforming scheme that integrates multi-modal sensing and communications via Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Network (MMFF-Net), which is composed of multiple neural network components with distinct functions. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on communication processing, our approach obtains comprehensive environmental features to improve beam alignment accuracy. We verify our scheme on the Vision-Wireless (ViWi) dataset, which we enriched with realistic vehicle drifting behavior. Our proposed MMFF-Net achieves more accurate and stable angle prediction, which in turn increases the achievable rates and reduces the communication system outage probability. Even in complex dynamic scenarios with adverse environment conditions, robust prediction results can be guaranteed, demonstrating the feasibility and practicality of the proposed proactive beamforming approach.}

	abstract = {Conventional policy for configuring an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) typically requires channel state information (CSI), thus incurring substantial overhead costs and facing incompatibility with the current network protocols. This paper proposes a blind beamforming strategy in the absence of CSI, aiming to boost the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all the receiver positions, namely the coverage enhancement. Although some existing works already consider the IRS-assisted coverage enhancement without CSI, they assume certain position-channel models through which the channels can be recovered from the geographic locations. In contrast, our approach solely relies on the received signal power data, not assuming any position-channel model. We examine the achievability and converse of the proposed blind beamforming method. If the IRS has N reflective elements and there are U receiver positions, then our method guarantees the minimum SNR of \\Omega (N^{2}/U) —which is fairly close to the upper bound O(N+N^{2}\\sqrt {\\ln (NU)}/\\sqrt [{4}]{U}) . Aside from the simulation results, we justify the practical use of blind beamforming in a field test at 2.6 GHz. According to the real-world experiment, the proposed blind beamforming method boosts the minimum SNR across seven random positions in a conference room by 18.22 dB, while the position-based method yields a boost of 12.08 dB.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has evolved into an influential technique to ameliorate energy and spectrum scarcity via co-designing these two functionalities. However, the target can be a potential eavesdropper aiming at wiretapping the information transmitted to the communication user. This paper studies a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled ISAC system, where the IRS is employed to assist the secure communication and simultaneously perform the target sensing based on the echo signals received by the dedicated sensor at the IRS. Specifically, we model two types of targets, namely point targets and extended targets. The direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the former and the complete target response matrix of the latter should be estimated. Under this configuration, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) as the performance metric of target estimation. To achieve an optimal performance trade-off, we formulate a weighted optimization problem that balances maximizing the secrecy rate and minimizing the CRB, via jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts of IRS. Then, we employ the alternating optimization, successive convex approximation and semi-definite relaxation to tackle the proposed non-convex problems for the two target cases. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes compared with benchmarks.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of novel industrial applications at the wireless edge, such as smart grids and vehicle networks, demands the advancement of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The performance of CPSs is closely linked to the last-mile wireless communication networks, which often become bottlenecks due to their inherent limited resources. Current CPS operations often treat wireless communication networks as unpredictable and uncontrollable variables, ignoring the potential adaptability of wireless networks, which results in inefficient and overly conservative CPS operations. Meanwhile, current wireless communications often focus more on throughput and other transmission-related metrics instead of CPS goals. In this study, we introduce the framework of goal-oriented wireless communication resource allocations, accounting for the semantics and significance of data for CPS operation goals. This guarantees optimal CPS performance from a cybernetic standpoint. We formulate a bandwidth allocation problem aimed at maximizing the information utility gain of transmitted data brought to CPS operation goals. Since the goal-oriented bandwidth allocation problem is a large-scale combinational problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer and greedy solution algorithm. The information utility gain is first approximately decomposed into marginal utility information gains and computed in a parallel manner. Subsequently, the bandwidth allocation problem is reformulated as a knapsack problem, which can be further solved greedily with a guaranteed sub-optimality gap. We further demonstrate how our proposed goal-oriented bandwidth allocation algorithm can be applied in four potential CPS applications, including data-driven decision-making, edge learning, federated learning, and distributed optimization. Through simulations, we confirm the effectiveness of our proposed goal-oriented bandwidth allocation framework in meeting CPS goals.}

	abstract = {Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) is a device-free sensing technology that can image the radio frequency (RF) attenuation of physical objects in the environment. RTI uses received signal strength (RSS) information from a wireless communication network (WCN) to perform image reconstruction. However it requires a dense WCN consisting of a large number of nodes making it difficult to apply in realistic WCN. In this paper we investigate the performance of RTI when reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are integrated into the WCN for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This approach can potentially enable the use of RTI in realistic WCN without a large number of nodes. Theoretical and numerical comparisons based on the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) are provided to verify the improvement on sensing performance brought by RIS. The scaling behavior of the reconstruction error as a function of the number of RIS element groups is also derived. Simulations are conducted to validate the proposed RIS-RTI system with a limited number of nodes. The results indicate that incorporating RIS can reduce the necessary number of nodes by more than a half while maintaining high-quality reconstruction compared to a network without RIS.}

	abstract = {Holographic MIMO communications, enabled by large-scale antenna arrays with quasi-continuous apertures, are potential technology for spectrum efficiency improvement. However, the increased antenna aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region, leading to a hybrid near-far field communication mode. The users and scatterers randomly lie in near-field and far-field zones, and thus, conventional far-field-only and near-field-only channel estimation methods may not work. To tackle this challenge, we demonstrate the existence of the power diffusion (PD) effect, which leads to a mismatch between the hybrid-field channel and existing channel estimation methods. Specifically, in far-field and near-field transform domains, the power of one channel path may diffuse to other positions, thus generating fake paths. This renders the conventional techniques unable to detect those real paths. We propose a PD-aware orthogonal matching pursuit (PD-OMP) algorithm to eliminate the influence of the PD effect by identifying the PD range, within which the path power diffuses to other positions. PD-OMP fits a general case without prior knowledge of respective numbers of near-field and far-field paths and the user’s location. Simulation results show that PD-OMP can accurately estimate the channel when antenna spacing is below half wavelength and outperform current state-of-the-art hybrid-field channel estimation methods.}

Each single-antenna node of this mesh network amplifies, predistorts, and forwards its reception to a receiver. In this configuration, an incoherent network of N nodes enhances the received power of a signal of interest by a factor of N compared to a single-input single-output communications link. By synchronizing these distributed nodes and constructing a spatiotemporal beamformer, we increase this factor to a maximum of N {^{{2}}} and enable significant interference rejection capabilities. To achieve phase-coherence across the network elements, we execute a distributed synchronization algorithm using training data from the source node. We construct spatiotemporal beamformers by solving an MMSE optimization, which we continually reoptimize using new observations of training sequences and updated channel estimates. We present results from two over-the-air experimental demonstrations, one without and one with an external interferer. In the former, we demonstrate a 17.4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement compared to the 18.1 dB theoretical bound for an eight-element network.

	abstract = {Powered by position-flexible antennas, the emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) technology is postulated as a key enabler for massive connectivity in 6G networks. The free movement of antenna elements enables the opportunistic minimization of interference, allowing several users to share the same radio channel without the need of precoding. However, the true potential of FAS is still unknown due to the extremely high spatial correlation of the wireless channel between very close-by antenna positions. To unveil the multiplexing capabilities of FAS, proper (simple yet accurate) modeling of the spatial correlation is prominently needed. Realistic classical models such as Jakes’s are prohibitively complex, rendering intractable analyses, while state-of-the-art approximations often are too simplistic and poorly accurate. Aiming to fill this gap, we here propose a general framework to approximate spatial correlation by block-diagonal matrices, motivated by the well-known block fading assumption and by statistical results on large correlation matrices. The proposed block-correlation model makes the performance analysis possible, and tightly approximates the results obtained with realistic models (Jakes’s and Clarke’s). Our framework is leveraged to analyze fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) systems, evaluating their performance for both one- and two-dimensional fluid antennas.}

Owing to the channel non-stationarity, spherical wavefront, and antenna configurations in RIS-empowered V2V channel, the geometry-based channel models suffer from high computational complexity, thereby leading to high hardware burden. To address this issue, a novel beam domain channel model (BDCM) is generated from the proposed geometry-based channel model through a beamforming operation based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To describe the non-stationarities of the V2V channels empowered by RIS, the channel model presented in this paper introduces real-time velocities and accelerations to capture the motion features of the communication terminals. The propagation characteristics including spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal autocorrelation functions (ACFs), frequency correlation functions (FCFs), and channel capacities of the proposed communication system are derived and discussed. Some comparisons between the propagation characteristics of the proposed GBSM and those based on BDCM with respect to the different physical parameters of RIS and different environmental variables are investigated. Furthermore, numerical results indicate that the proposed channel model works well by changing the velocity parameters in different motion states.}

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications have attracted much attention in recent years due to its application in intelligent transportation systems. To apply the dynamic beamforming technology in V2I communications, an accurate V2I narrow-beam channel model is required. This paper investigates cluster-based dynamic narrow-beam channel modeling for V2I scenarios. Firstly, a phased-array antenna based channel measurement system is designed and used to perform a series of narrow-beam channel measurements at 3.35 GHz in V2I highway scenarios. Data processing methods such as beam synthesis, angle estimation based on single-scattering assumption, and variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model clustering are applied to extract parameters of multipath components and clusters. Then, we propose a cluster-based dynamic narrow-beam channel model, which considers the directional attenuation of narrow-beam and non-stationarity of clusters. In this model, the parameters of spatial-temporal characteristics are divided into global-cluster parameters and scatterer-cluster parameters, and the statistical distribution of these parameters are studied and modeled. Finally, a simulation method for the proposed channel model is provided, and model validation results show a good match between measurements and simulations in terms of channel characteristics such as delay spread and angle spread. This model provides a better characterization of the V2I narrow-beam channel and will be useful for designing and evaluating V2I communication systems.}

Understanding the fundamental limits of sensing performance in such setups, which remain largely unknown, is crucial. This paper investigates the sensing performance bounds in the presence of clock asynchronism. In both single-carrier and multi-carrier models, we derive the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRB) for estimating dynamic channel path parameters including angle of arrival, delay, and complex gain sequence (CGS). Through mathematical analyses and numerical simulations, we conduct a comprehensive study on how these bounds depend on various system parameters and the impact of clock asynchronism. Our findings highlight the degradation of parameter estimation performance due to clock asynchronism and reveal low-accuracy zones for CGS estimation in strong-line-of-sight scenarios. Additionally, we observe asymptotic mitigation in performance degradation with larger bandwidth, providing valuable insights for system design and optimization.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, where the dual-functional base station (DFBS) operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to provide communication services and performs targets sensing simultaneously. Meanwhile, we consider multiple targets and multiple users scenario as well as the self-interference at the FD DFBS. Through jointly optimizing the DFBS and active STAR-RIS beamforming under different work modes, our purpose is to achieve the maximum communication sum-rate, while satisfying the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint, the active STAR-RIS hardware constraints and the total power constraint of DFBS and active STAR-RIS. To tackle the complex non-convex optimization problem formulated, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the fractional programming method is first leveraged to turn the original problem into a more tractable one, and subsequently the transformed problem is decomposed into several sub-problems. Next, we develop a derivation method to obtain the closed-form expression of the radar receiving beamforming, and then the DFBS transmit beamforming is optimized under the radar SINR requirement and total power constraints. After that, the active STAR-RIS reflection and transmission beamforming are optimized by majorization minimization, complex circle manifold and convex optimization techniques. Finally, the proposed schemes are conducted through numerical simulations to show their benefits and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is widely used in many applications. Traditional DOA estimation generally adopts the second-order statistics and the uniform linear array (ULA) structure. However, the second-order statistics and the uniform array structure restrict the number of DOAs that can be accurately estimated. In addition, the performance of the second-order statistics-based methods is sensitive to noise. As the wireless environment is becoming increasingly complex with the advent of the 5G era, the propagation channel can be composed of numerous paths. When the number of paths exceeds the size of the antenna array, DOA estimation becomes an under-determined problem, which the second-order statistics-based traditional methods fail to deal with. In order to address the under-determined DOA estimation problem, this paper proposes a method based on higher-order statistics and non-uniform array structure. Higher-order statistics-based methods can not only expand the array aperture, but also suppress the additive Gaussian noise. However, if combined with a uniform array structure, the degrees of freedom of the expanded array is limited. Therefore, we further adopt a non-uniform array structure and optimize its structure. Consequently, the proposed method is capable of achieving M^{2}\n-level DOA estimation with an M-element array, while simultaneously providing good robustness to noise. For instance, using the proposed method, the DOAs of 20 incoming wave directions can be accurately estimated with a 6-antenna non-uniform array when the signal-to-noise ratio is as low as 0 dB.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) can provide flexible computing service for terminal-devices (TDs). However, malicious active aerial eavesdroppers can perform air-to-ground eavesdropping and air-to-air attacking, which makes TDs’ tasks offloading computation more vulnerable, posing significantly secure threats to UAV-enabled MEC. To overcome this challenge, we aim to design collaborative communication and computation schemes for the secure UAV-enabled MEC system, where an active aerial eavesdropper is capable of wiretapping the tasks information offloaded from TDs and transmitting attack signals to the legitimate network. The total weighted energy consumption of the system is minimized via optimizing time allocation, transmit power, local and offloading computation bits, as well as UAV trajectory. First, considering the given number of computational tasks of TDs, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based scheme is proposed to decompose the original multi-variables-coupling and close-form-lacking problem into several tractable subproblems that can be addressed by iterations. Next, considering that there are dynamic and random tasks arriving to TDs’ original tasks, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme is proposed to maintain the stability of tasks, where the solution of computation, communication and trajectory optimization is intelligently obtained by adopting double-deep Q-learning (DDQN). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform the respective benchmarks for secure UAV-enabled MEC against active aerial eavesdropping.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to realize the programmable wireless environment via steering the incident signal in fully customizable ways. However, a major challenge in RIS-aided communication systems is the simultaneous design of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the phase shifting matrix of the RIS elements. This is mainly attributed to the highly non-convex optimization space of variables at both the BS and the RIS, and the diversity of communication environments. Generally, traditional optimization methods for this problem suffer from the high complexity, while existing deep learning based methods are lacking in robustness in various scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML), which works without pre-training and has strong robustness for RIS-aided communications. Specifically, the proposed method fuses meta learning and manifold learning to improve the overall spectral efficiency, and reduce the overhead of the high-dimensional signal process. Unlike traditional deep learning based methods which directly take channel state information as input, GMML feeds the gradients of the precoding matrix and phase shifting matrix into neural networks. Coherently, we design a differential regulator to constrain the phase shifting matrix of the RIS. Numerical results show that the proposed GMML can improve the spectral efficiency by up to 7.31%, and speed up the convergence by 23 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, they also demonstrate remarkable robustness and adaptability in dynamic settings.}

	abstract = {Ultra wideband (UWB) systems have received great interest again due to the high range resolution, flexible data transmission capability, and low power consumption. In this paper, we develop a practical asynchronous integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using impulse radio UWB signals. This system operates within a joint mono-bistatic sensing network, accommodating multiple static and dynamic targets. To achieve simultaneous communication and target sensing, a reliable soft information based decouple solution is proposed to perform data demodulation in the typical UWB modulation waveforms. The data transmission can benefit from proper channel sensing, to about 2-3 dB gain, by exploiting the multipath components for demodulation. In addition to the demodulated data bits at the bi-static receiver, the environmental target distance and Doppler shift can also be achieved at both mono- and bi-static receivers, respectively. We then evaluate the sensing capability of the ISAC UWB system, by extensive simulations and practical experiments. The target tracking accuracy can be achieved within 20 cm at over 80% confidence, with commercial UWB devices according to practical measurements.}

	abstract = {It is well known that there is inherent radiation pattern distortion for the commercial base station antenna array, which usually needs three antenna sectors to cover the whole space. To eliminate pattern distortion and further enhance beamforming performance, we propose an electromagnetic hybrid beamforming (EHB) scheme based on a three-dimensional (3D) superdirective holographic antenna array. Specifically, EHB consists of antenna excitation current vectors (analog beamforming) and digital precoding matrices, where the implementation of analog beamforming involves the real-time adjustment of the radiation pattern to adapt it to the dynamic wireless environment. Meanwhile, the digital beamforming is optimized based on the channel characteristics of analog beamforming to further improve the achievable rate of communication systems. An electromagnetic channel model incorporating array radiation patterns and the mutual coupling effect is also developed to evaluate the benefits of our proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed EHB scheme with a 3D holographic array achieves a relatively flat superdirective beamforming gain and allows for programmable focusing directions throughout the entire spatial domain. Furthermore, they also verify that the proposed scheme achieves a sum rate gain of over 150% compared to traditional beamforming algorithms.}

	abstract = {This paper studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station transmits beamformed signals for joint downlink multi-user communication and radar sensing of an extended target (ET). By considering echo signals as reflections from valid elements on the ET contour, a set of novel Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) is derived for parameter estimation of the ET, including central range, direction, and orientation. The ISAC transmit beamforming design is then formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to minimize the CRB associated with radar sensing, while satisfying a minimum signal-to-interference-pulse-noise ratio requirement for each communication user, along with a 3-dB beam coverage constraint tailored for the ET. To solve this non-convex problem, we utilize semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and propose a rank-one solution extraction scheme for non-tight relaxation circumstances. To reduce the computation complexity, we further employ an efficient zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming design, where the sensing task is performed in the null space of communication channels. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the obtained CRB, revealing the diverse features of CRB for differently shaped ETs. The proposed SDR beamforming design outperforms benchmark designs with lower estimation error and CRB, while the ZF beamforming design greatly improves computation efficiency with minor sensing performance loss.}

	abstract = {In vehicular edge computing networks, the real-time, on-demand scheduling of scarce network resources for environmental perception, task offloading, computation, and feedback is vital. However, these coupled processes make resource allocation challenging. Moreover, existing real-time channel measurement techniques in complex vehicular topologies present load, accuracy, and customization difficulties. To address these issues, this paper proposes an on-demand environmental perception and resource allocation strategy. Specifically, with the introduction of a channel knowledge base, we first analyze the coupling relationship between environmental perception, communication, and computation. A model is then proposed for task offloading to schedule the granularity of environment perception, communication resources, and computational resources dynamically. Subsequently, the resource allocation problem is formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to minimize system processing delay and maximize resource utilization while ensuring perception accuracy. To address this, a two-phase optimization-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed. The initial phase uses convex optimization to approximate a solution. The second phase proposes a DRL-based algorithm to intelligently schedule dynamic network resources, with the first phase’s solution guiding the initial exploration space to enhance DRL training efficiency. Extensive simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposal.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) simultaneously performs downlink communication and target detection. A novel target detection and information transmission protocol is proposed, where the BS executes the channel estimation and beamforming successively and meanwhile jointly exploits the pilot sequences in the channel estimation stage and user information in the transmission stage to assist target detection. We investigate the joint design of the pilot matrix, training duration, and transmit beamforming to maximize the probability of target detection, subject to the minimum achievable rate required by the user. However, designing the optimal pilot matrix is rather challenging since there is no closed-form expression of the detection probability with respect to the pilot matrix. To tackle this difficulty, we resort to designing the pilot matrix based on the information-theoretic criterion to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the received observations and BS-target channel coefficients for target detection. We first derive the optimal pilot matrix for both channel estimation and target detection, and then propose a unified pilot matrix structure to balance minimizing the channel estimation error (MSE) and maximizing MI. Based on the proposed structure, a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm is proposed. In addition, we rigorously analyze the impact of pilot length and pilot matrix on two fundamental tradeoffs, namely MSE-MI and Rate-MI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pilot matrix structure can well balance the MSE-MI and the Rate-MI tradeoffs, and show the significant region improvement of our proposed design as compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, it is unveiled that as the communication channel is more spatially correlated, the Rate-MI region can be further enlarged.}

Based on a simplified yet effective received signal model including an expanded memory polynomial (EMP) and a noisy receiver filter, this paper proposes a low-complexity digital post-cancellation (DPC) framework for transmitter IQI and overall system nonlinearity mitigation. The nonlinearity parameters with reduced nonlinearity order are firstly estimated with low-complexity using a novel transmission protocol incorporating both frame rotation and preamble power scaling. Through widely linear system equalization and interference cancellation, the signal distortion caused by frequency-dependent IQI and nonlinearity is then mitigated with significant performance improvement. The mean-squared-error measurement of the EMP-modelled signals also provides a practical means for the nonlinear system identification and characterization. Both simulation and experiment results obtained from a millimeter wave system with 2.125 GHz bandwidth and 73.5 GHz carrier frequency are presented to verify the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPC technology.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation (CE) plays a key role in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, while it poses a challenging task due to the passive nature of RIS and the cascaded channel structures. In this paper, a partially decoupled atomic norm minimization (PDANM) framework is proposed for CE of RIS-aided MIMO systems, which exploits the three-dimensional angular sparsity of the channel. In particular, PDANM partially decouples the differential angles at the RIS from other angles at the base station and user equipment, reducing the computational complexity compared with existing methods. A reweighted PDANM (RPDANM) algorithm is proposed to further improve CE accuracy, which iteratively refines CE through a specifically designed reweighting strategy. Building upon RPDANM, we propose an iterative approach named RPDANM with adaptive phase control (RPDANM-APC), which adaptively adjusts the RIS phases based on previously estimated channel parameters to facilitate CE, achieving superior CE accuracy while reducing training overhead. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches in terms of running time, CE accuracy, and training overhead. In particular, the RPDANM-APC approach can achieve higher CE accuracy than existing methods within less than 30 percent training overhead while reducing the running time by tens of times.}

	abstract = {Though visible light communication (VLC) systems are contained to a given room, improving their security is an important criterion in any practical deployment. This paper studies the design of artificial noise (AN) to enhance physical layer security in VLC systems in the context of input signals with no explicit amplitude constraint (e.g., multicarrier systems). In such systems, clipping is needed to constrain the input signals within the limited linear ranges of the LEDs. However, this clipping process gives rise to non-linear clipping distortion, which must be incorporated into the AN design. To solve the design problem, a sub-optimal approach is presented using the Charnes-Cooper transformation and the convex-concave procedure (CCP). Then, a novel AN transmission scheme is proposed to reduce the impact of clipping distortion, thus improving the secrecy performance. The proposed scheme exploits the typical structure of LED luminaries that are composed of multiple light-emitting chips. Specifically, LED chips in each luminaire are divided into two groups driven by separate driver circuits. One group is used to transmit the information-bearing signal, while the other group transmits the AN. Numerical results show that while clipping distortion can significantly reduce the secrecy level, with proper design AN significantly improves the secrecy performance using the proposed design methodology.}

However, inefficient access control and resource allocation in WNCS are two critical factors that limit closed-loop performance and control stability, especially when the spectral and energy resources are limited. In this paper, we first analyze the optimal scheduling condition for maintaining control stability of a WNCS and then formulate a long-term optimization problem that jointly optimizes the access policy of edge devices, and grant policy and resource allocation at the edge server. We employ Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a sequence of independent sub-problems, and propose a heterogeneous attention graph based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly optimizes the access and resource allocation policy. By leveraging the attention mechanism to project the graph representations from heterogeneous agents into a unified space, our proposed algorithm facilitates coordination among heterogeneous agents, thereby enhancing the overall system performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms several benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.}

	abstract = {A variable-length cross-packet hybrid automatic repeat request (VL-XP-HARQ) is proposed to boost the spectral efficiency (SE) and the energy efficiency (EE) of communications. The SE is firstly derived in terms of the outage probabilities, with which the SE is proved to be upper bounded by the ergodic capacity (EC). Moreover, to facilitate the maximization of the SE, the asymptotic outage probability is obtained at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with which the SE is maximized by properly choosing the number of new information bits while guaranteeing outage requirement. By applying Dinkelbach’s transform, the fractional objective function is transformed into a subtraction form, which can be decomposed into multiple sub-problems through alternating optimization. By noticing that the asymptotic outage probability is a convex function, each sub-problem can be easily relaxed to a convex problem by adopting successive convex approximation (SCA). Besides, the EE of VL-XP-HARQ is also investigated. An upper bound of the EE is found and proved to be attainable. Furthermore, by aiming at maximizing the EE via power allocation while confining outage within a certain constraint, the methods to the maximization of SE are invoked to solve the similar fractional problem. Finally, numerical results are presented for verification.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a novel deep learning framework for the general nonconvex quality-of-service (QoS)-constrained beamforming design problems in multi-user systems. While existing deep learning-based approaches have shown great success for various power allocation and beamforming design problems, most of the considered problems are equipped with simple constraints (e.g., power budget constraints), which can be satisfied by a simple projection operation. However, it is still a challenge to tackle the more complicated QoS constraints, in which the beamformers and the wireless channels are commonly coupled. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an augmented Lagrangian based penalty-dual training algorithm, which trains two individual neural networks for inferring the beamformers and the corresponding Lagrange multipliers alternatingly. Furthermore, we apply the proposed penalty-dual learning framework to optimize the energy-efficient unicast beamformers and the power-minimized multicast beamformers, respectively. The neural network architectures are judiciously designed based on the solution structures of the two problems. Simulation results on the two applications demonstrate that the proposed penalty-dual approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning approaches and optimization-based algorithms in terms of the constraint violation and the computational time, respectively.}

	abstract = {Electromagnetic skins (EMSs) have been recently considered as a booster for wireless sensing, but their usage on mobile targets is relatively novel and could be of interest when the target reflectivity can/must be increased to improve its detection or the estimation of parameters. In particular, when illuminated by a wide-bandwidth signal (e.g., from a radar operating at millimeter waves), vehicles behave like extended targets, since multiple parts of the vehicle’s body effectively contribute to the back-scattering. Moreover, in some cases perspective deformations challenge the correct localization of the vehicle. To address these issues, we propose lodging EMSs on vehicles’ roof to act as high-reflectivity planar retro-reflectors toward the sensing terminal. The advantage is twofold: 1) by introducing a compact high-reflectivity structure on the target, we make vehicles behave like point targets, avoiding perspective deformations and related ranging biases and 2) we increase the reflectivity of the vehicle, improving localization performance. We detail the EMS design from the system-level to the full-wave-level considering both reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and cost-effective static passive electromagnetic skins (SP-EMSs). Localization performance of the EMS-aided sensing system is also assessed by Cramér-Rao bound analysis in both narrowband and spatial wideband operating conditions.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been widely deployed to assist the covert transmission thanks to its ability of channel reconfiguration. Compared with the conventional RIS, simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) can transmit and reflect the incident signal simultaneously, which provides an opportunity for the full-space covert transmission. This paper investigates the robust covert multicasting aided by the STAR-RIS with the hardware impairment. Specifically, Alice covertly transmits the common information to two single-antenna users assisted by the STAR-RIS against two non-colluding multi-antenna wardens. Furthermore, both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) protocols of the STAR-RIS are considered. With perfect wiretap channel state information (CSI), the covert rate is maximized via jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the reflection and transmission coefficient matrices, satisfying the transmit power constraint, the covertness constraint and the protocol of the STAR-RIS. Moreover, we also investigate the covert rate maximization problem under the case of imperfect wiretap CSI. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we propose iterative algorithms based on the alternating optimization, successive convex approximation and penalty-based semi-definite relaxation to obtain a near-optimal solution to each problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the STAR-RIS, and show that the ES is superior to the MS.}

	abstract = {Multicast short video streaming can enhance bandwidth utilization by enabling simultaneous video transmission to multiple users over shared wireless channels. The existing network management schemes mainly rely on the sequential buffering principle and general quality of experience (QoE) model, which may deteriorate QoE when users’ swipe behaviors exhibit distinct spatiotemporal variation. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based network management scheme to enhance QoE. Firstly, user status emulated by the DT is utilized to estimate the transmission capabilities and watching probability distributions of sub-multicast groups (SMGs) for an adaptive segment buffering. The SMGs’ buffers are aligned to the unique virtual buffers managed by the DT for a fine-grained buffer update. Then, a multicast QoE model consisting of rebuffering time, video quality, and quality variation is developed, by considering the mutual influence of segment buffering among SMGs. Finally, a joint optimization problem of segment version selection and slot division is formulated to maximize QoE. To efficiently solve the problem, a data-model-driven algorithm is proposed by integrating a convex optimization method and a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results based on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DT-based network management scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of QoE improvement.}

By utilizing the ML detector, we initially derive the conditional pair error probability expression for the proposed scheme. Subsequently, we leverage the central limit theorem (CLT) to obtain the probability density function of the combined channel. Following this, the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method is applied to derive a closed-form expression for the unconditional pair error probability and establish the union tight upper bound for the average bit error probability (ABEP). Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of the proposed RIS-SM scheme. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted not only to assess the complexity and reliability of the three detection algorithms but also to validate the results obtained through theoretical derivation results.}

In passive RIS-CBC-APSK, the backscatter information is conveyed through the number of RIS reflecting elements being in the ON state and their phase shift values, whereas, in active RIS-CBC-APSK, this information is embedded through the number of RIS elements being in the active mode as well as the phase shift values of all elements. By using the optimal APSK constellation to ensure that reflected signals from the RIS undergo APSK modulation, a bit-mapping mechanism is developed. Assuming maximum-likelihood detection, we also present closed-form upper bounds for the symbol error rate (SER) performance for both proposed passive and active RIS-CBC-APSK schemes over Rician fading channels. In addition, we devise a low-complexity detector that can achieve flexible trade-offs between performance and complexity. Finally, we extend RIS-CBC-APSK to multiple-input single-output scenarios and present an alternating optimization approach for the joint design of transmit beamforming and RIS reflection. Our extensive simulation results on the SER performance of the proposed RIS-CBC-APSK framework corroborate our conducted performance analysis and showcase the superiority of both designed modulation schemes over the state-of-the-art RIS-CBC benchmarks.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a cognitive multicast communication system aided by active reconfigurable intelligent surface (active RIS). Specifically, for an underlay spectrum sharing cognitive multicast network, a cognitive radio base station (CRBS) communicates with secondary users (SUs) assisted by an active RIS. Meanwhile, the interference to primary users (PUs) is suppressed within the constraints of the transmit power of both the CRBS and active RIS, together with the restriction of the active RIS amplitude gain. We aim at the fairness problem for maximizing the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) via joint beamforming design at the CRBS and the active RIS. To cope with this problem, the optimization and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithms are proposed. Specifically, the decision variables are decoupled by the alternating optimization (AO) method and then, the non-convex problem is transformed into a solvable convex form by using the successive convex approximation (SCA), Schur complement, and penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) methods. Furthermore, we design an AO-based algorithm for the formulated problem. Due to the characteristics of both exploration and exploitation, the DRL-based algorithms outperform the AO-based algorithm with proper parameter settings. Meanwhile, the DRL algorithm inherits the advantages of low execution complexity. The original optimization problem is first converted into a Markov decision process (MDP) form in DRL. Due to the complex objective function and various restrictions of power/amplification gain budget and quality of service (QoS), the constraints are categorized as the switching constraints for action adjustment and performance constraints for reward function setting, respectively. Subsequently, a segmented incentive-based reward function is developed to attain higher performance on SINR. We also propose two effective deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based algorithms. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate a notable enhancement in system performance upon the introduction of active RIS compared to the case with a passive RIS and the case without using an RIS. Moreover, with appropriately configured parameters, DRL algorithms outperform the AO-based algorithm, and notably, the TD3 algorithm is superior to the DDPG algorithm in optimization effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Backscatter is an emerging ultra-low-power wireless communication technology for Internet-of-Things. However, as the widely used modulation scheme in OFDM systems, the combination of QAM and WiFi backscatter is not very satisfactory. To deploy QAM in the WiFi backscatter system, we propose PilotScatter, the first OFDM backscatter system supporting both 16-QAM modulation and non-redundant coding. These changes significantly improve the throughput of PilotScatter over previous backscatter systems. The key insight of PilotScatter is the use of pilot tones and differential demodulation. By modifying the phase and amplitude of pilot tones of the carrier signal, PilotScatter can modulate tag data on ambient WiFi with a 16-QAM scheme. At the receiver, PilotScatter uses a differential algorithm to demodulate tag data. It makes PilotScatter achieve 16-QAM demodulation without relying on ambient WiFi data and past symbols. We prototype PilotScatter using FPGAs, commodity radios, and USRPs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PilotScatter achieves up to 932.22 kbps throughput for WiFi 802.11g, and the backscatter communication range (Tag-to-Rx) is up to 19 m in Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 16 m in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS). Compared with the symbol-level backscatter research, PilotScatter has 7.49x and 3.78x goodput gains over MOXcatter and RapidRider, respectively.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled full-duplex backscatter communications in multi-user symbiotic radio (SR) systems. Specifically, an RIS is integrated with a primary transmission in which the primary transmitter (PT) broadcasts common messages to multiple primary receivers (PRs) and the RIS. Thanks to the full-duplex backscatter communication nature, the RIS absorbs part of the PT signals to decode the PT messages and, meanwhile, reflects the remaining part to convey its own messages for the PRs. By doing so, the RIS and the PRs can receive common messages, like the pairing messages, from the PT, and simultaneously establish information links between them without requiring additional spectrum and radio resources. However, it brings a challenging task on how to properly design the reflection matrix to resolve the conflicts between the signal absorption and reflection in the RIS-enabled full-duplex backscatter communication. Towards this end, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to jointly optimize the PT transmit beamforming vector and the RIS reflection matrix subject to the transmission rate constraints for the PT and the RIS. The problem is solved by the proposed alternating optimization (AO) method combined with difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm. Simulation results are presented to show that the RIS-enabled full-duplex backscatter communication can efficiently save the transmit power as compared to its half-duplex counterpart.}

	abstract = {One-bit massive MIMO has gained much attention in the areas of wireless communication and sensing. Among the various receiver designs, the maximum-likelihood-based receivers achieve state-of-the-art performance. Through this work we provide both analytical insight into the likelihood formulation, and develop a one-bit MIMO receiver, motivated specifically from this analysis. In particular, (i) Properties of the original Gaussian CDF based likelihood function are analyzed, culminating in an improved gradient descent (GD) algorithm for one-bit MIMO. (ii) This improved GD update rule is further enhanced through an accelerated GD method, improving convergence performance. (iii) The likelihood analysis is extended to an effective surrogate function for the Gaussian CDF, i.e., the logistic regression (LR). The presented analytical framework for the CDF also serves as a robust mathematical model to explain the enhanced performance of the LR, when utilized as a surrogate likelihood. (iv) Detection from a finite M-QAM constellation is incorporated by introducing a Gaussian denoiser to project the detected symbols onto the M-QAM subspace. This is implemented as a novel, unfolded, DNN architecture for one-bit detection. Through our experimental validation we demonstrate results on par with the current state-of-the-art methods for one-bit MIMO detection.}

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of the next generation of communications and internet of things (IoT) technologies has made the provision of location-based services for diverse devices an increasingly pressing necessity. Localizing devices with/without intelligent computing abilities, including both active and passive devices is essential, especially in indoor scenarios. For traditional RF positioning systems, aligning transmission signals and dealing with signal interference in complex environments are inevitable challenges. Therefore, this paper proposed a new passive positioning system, the RF-band resonant beam positioning system (RF-RBPS), which achieves energy concentration and beam alignment by amplifying echoes between the base station (BS) and the passive target (PT), without the need for complex channel estimation and time-consuming beamforming and provides high-precision direction of arrival (DoA) estimation for battery-free targets using the resonant mechanism. The direction information of the PT is estimated using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm at the end of BS. The feasibility of the proposed system is validated through theoretical analysis and simulations. Results indicate that the proposed RF-RBPS surpasses RF-band active positioning system (RF-APS) in precision, achieving millimeter-level precision at 2m within an elevation angle of 35°, and an error of less than 3cm at 2.5m within an elevation angle of 35°.}

Specifically, we show that the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain estimator design for each TB domain channel element can be transformed into that of a low-dimensional TB domain estimator and the resulting SFT domain estimator is beam structured. We also present a method to select the TBs used for BSCE. Then we generalize the proposed BSCE by introducing window functions and a turbo principle to achieve a superior trade-off between complexity and performance. Furthermore, we present a low-complexity design and implementation of BSCE by exploiting the characteristics of the TB matrix. Simulation results validate the proposed theory and methods.}

The dataset is built from the radio propagation measurements conducted at 142 GHz in four diverse factories during 2021 and 2022, including 82 transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) location pairs covering propagation distances between 5 and 87 m in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) environments. The measurements employed rotatable directional antennas with 8° half power beam width at both TX and RX, gathering over 75,000 directional power delay profiles, which provide complete multipath delay and angular statistics. For accurate multipath temporal and angular parameter estimation, this paper introduces a novel antenna de-embedded multipath extraction (ADME) with degree-level precision. The parameters required for channel response generation are derived through distribution fitting and validated using goodness-of-fit metrics. The proposed statistical channel model is integrated into the open-source channel simulator NYUSIM. The simulated and measured channel statistics show a solid agreement with differences within one ns in root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread and within 1° RMS angular spread. This sub-THz InF statistical channel model may contribute critical insights on channel modeling development above 100 GHz within standardization bodies such as 3GPP and IEEE 802.}

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require timely information updates for safety and operational efficiency. The Age of Information (AoI) quantifies the freshness of information exchanged among WSN nodes. However, in the presence of noise and fading, sensors communicating with each other as well as with Access Points (APs) may suffer from degraded communication reliability. Here, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are capable of enhancing communication links and, thus, maintaining information freshness. This paper aims at minimizing the AoI perceived by communicating sensors in multi-RIS-assisted WSNs. Precisely, an original AoI-minimal, Deadline-constrained and Cooperative Multi-RIS-assisted (ADCMR) wireless sensor communication framework is presented. This framework embeds a convoluted Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation aiming at optimizing the schedules of collaborative data transfers subject to deadline and RIS selection constraints. Owing to this ILP’s remarkable complexity, a GReedy Algorithm (GRA) is proposed to generate acceptable sub-optimal schedules with a maximum of 6.66% performance difference compared to their optimal counterparts. GRA, though, is not scalable. This problem is resolved using a Lagrange Relaxation Algorithm (LRA). The difference between LRA and the optimal solution is 2.2%. Also, for large-scale networks, LRA outperforms GRA by 24.8%. Extensive simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to gauge LRA’s benefits and highlight its notable AoI performance improvements over existing benchmarks.}

Instead, the proposed model utilizes a limited set of geo-tagged Channel State Information (CSI) samples for training. The approach combines a Fully-Connected Auto-Encoder (FC-AE) with a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. The GPR model is efficient, as it requires only a minimal amount of labeled data for training, although it presents challenges in computational complexity. To address this complexity, the FC-AE is introduced, which encodes the Angle-Delay Profile (ADP) transformation of the CSI data. The training dataset for the FC-AE is crafted by employing data augmentation techniques on a small collection of unlabeled data. The simulation results demonstrate that FC-AE is scenario-independent and adaptable to new scenarios with similar ADP characteristics. Additionally, our FC-AE-GPR model surpasses the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network model and the non-parametric grid search method when provided with limited labeled data, applicable in both indoor and outdoor settings.}

	abstract = {The orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation is an effective technique to deal with the high-mobility challenge in vehicular wireless communications, whose data detection depends heavily on accurate channel estimation (CE). In pilot-aided CE, reducing guard symbols can achieve higher spectral efficiency. However, data interference is inevitable, especially in fractional Doppler channels. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of data interference on CE, and aims to mitigate such data interference by adding a non-rectangular window in the time-frequency (TF) domain. To fulfill this goal, a Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived by considering the presence of data interference and a non-rectangular window for CE in OTFS. Different from the existing CRLB analysis for embedded-pilot OTFS, data interference is considered and treated as noise interference, resulting in a tighter derived CRLB that effectively reflects the impact of data interference on CE. By minimizing the derived CRLB with the rectangular window, a new pilot sequence is obtained, which can achieve lower CRLB and better BER performance compared to the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence. On the other hand, windowing can loosen the CRLB due to its ability to suppress data interference. Under the same main lobe width, it is found that the Kaiser window and Slepian window are more effective in reducing data interference than Dolph-Chebyshev (DC) window and rectangular window. Our simulation results indicate that the interference from data to the pilot can be significantly reduced by employing appropriate windowing techniques, and the windowing functions employed play an important role in pilot-aided CE.}

	abstract = {Spectrum sharing is promising as a solution to address the spectrum crunch by enabling the coexistence of different networks in the same frequency band. However, interference from concurrent transmissions remains an obstacle to further enhance spectral efficiency. Therefore, to overcome the bottleneck caused by multi-user interference, both rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled underlay and overlay spectrum-sharing strategies are proposed in this paper. To facilitate a robust resource allocation design, the common and the private beamforming vectors as well as the common rate allocation are jointly optimized under the norm-bounded channel state information (CSI) error model to maximize the worst-case weighted sum rate (WSR) of the secondary networks. To address the formulated challenging non-convex quadratically-constrained resource allocation optimization problems, a computationally efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm capitalizing on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based benchmark schemes in worst-case WSR and robustness. Moreover, the results indicate that the proposed novel RSMA-enabled overlay spectrum-sharing strategy can offer a higher flexibility in resource allocation compared to their underlay counterparts. Furthermore, the tradeoff between interference management and spectral performance enhancement for the proposed RSMA-enabled overlay spectrum-sharing strategy is unveiled.}

If the photodetector area is too large, the channel capacity degrades due to lower modulation bandwidth of the detector. A smaller photodetector maximizes the bandwidth, but minimizes the captured signal power and the subsequent signal-to-noise ratio. Therein lies an opportunity in this trade-off to maximize the channel rate by choosing the optimal photodetector area. In this study, we have optimized the photodetector area in order to maximize the channel capacity of a free-space optical link for a diverse set of communication scenarios. We believe that the study in this paper in general—and the closed-form solutions derived in this study in particular—will be helpful to maximize achievable data rates of a wide gamut of optical wireless communication systems: from long range deep space optical links to short range indoor visible light communication systems.}

The proposed framework incorporates multi-connectivity and captures the impact of molecular absorption coefficient variations in a TW, beam-squint, molecular absorption noise, and link blockages. To make the problem tractable, we first propose a convex approximation of the molecular absorption coefficient using curve fitting in a TW, determine the feasible bandwidths of the leading and trailing edge-bands, and then derive closed-form optimal solution for the number of sub-bands considering beam-squint constraints. We then decompose joint user associations, sub-band assignment, and power allocation problem into two sub-problems: 1) joint user association and sub-band assignment, and 2) power allocation. To solve the former problem, we analytically prove the unimodularity of the constraint matrix which enables us to relax the integer constraint without loss of optimality. To solve power allocation sub-problem, a fractional programming (FP)-based centralized solution as well as an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based light-weight distributed solution is proposed. The overall problem is then solved using alternating optimization until convergence. Complexity analysis of the algorithms and numerical convergence are presented. Numerical findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and extract useful insights about the interplay of the density of base stations (BSs), Average order of multi-connectivity (AOM), molecular absorption, hardware impairment, imperfect CSI, and link blockages.}

	abstract = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architecture is a promising solution for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) because it not only provides massive connectivity but also eliminates the traditional cell edges. Considering the heterogeneous traffic and requirements in the industry, in this paper, we propose a device priority-aware resource allocation policy under cell-free mMIMO IIoT networks. Specifically, we design a priority-aware frame structure that can be used to provide differentiated age of information (AoI) guarantees for devices of different priorities and locations. To characterize the proposed policy, we develop a general analysis framework to evaluate the signal-to-interference ratio meta distribution and the average AoI of a generic device. The framework captures multiple main features under wireless IIoT networks, including cell-free mMIMO architecture, frame structure, finite-sized geographic areas, densely deployed devices, device priority, retransmission, and interaction among different transmission links. The analytical framework is validated by simulations. Based on the analysis, we study a mean-variance optimization problem to improve the network average AoI, while guaranteeing the average AoI per device. Numerical results show that the proposed frame structure works effectively in enhancing the AoI performance of cell-free IIoT networks.}

	abstract = {For seamless and ubiquitous connectivity in 6G, three-dimensional (3D) network design using flourishing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be an inevitable task. Notably, integrating terahertz (THz) networks with UAVs remains an open question, despite its immense potential to achieve exceptional flexibility and high capacity. Spurred by this, we delve into the promising 3D network: the multi-UAV radio access network (RAN) with THz-empowered backhaul. For reliable last-mile connectivity in the end-to-end (E2E) system, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is applied with sub-6GHz spectrum. To maximize the E2E throughput, we formulate an optimization problem with diverse design variables of access and backhaul, including 3D UAV deployment, UAV transmit power, and NOMA decoding orders, with hybrid precoding and transmit power of the backhaul terminal. For this intricate problem, we propose an optimization process where the design variables are optimized sequentially. Using numerical results, we verify the feasibility of our optimization process and demonstrate supremacy of the proposed network scheme and optimization algorithm compared to other baselines. Furthermore, we corroborate design guidelines for the proposed network over access and backhaul links with various factors, such as antenna structure, the number of antennas, transmit power level, and interference.}

	abstract = {In aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided networks, high line-of-sight (LoS) and agility characteristics provide favorable conditions for RIS reflection. However, this also introduces extra LoS RIS reflection interference, especially when aerial RIS is fixedly deployed. This paper proposes a dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted RIS aided multi-cell multi-user communication scheme, where the minimum ergodic rate of randomly mobile users is maximized through joint optimization of BS beamforming, RIS phases, user scheduling and UAV trajectory under the assumption of only statistical channel state information. Specifically, a closed-form ergodic rate approximation is derived, based on which the block coordinate descent framework is leveraged to solve the above four variables due to the non-convexity of the problem. Furthermore, the optimal beamforming is acquired in closed form utilizing fractional programming and quadratic transformation, RIS phases are optimized by the complex circle manifold, user scheduling is obtained by the reconstruction-based relaxation, and UAV trajectory is solved through the first-order Taylor expansion and successive convex optimization techniques. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and its convergence is carefully proved. The numerical results demonstrate our proposed scheme achieves a better ergodic rate than traditional methods and other aerial schemes with heuristic trajectories.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as a promising technology to potentially enhance communications and localization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate a challenging received signal strength (RSS) based localization problem utilizing RIS. In particular, we consider a mixed line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight (LOS/NLOS) scenario with multiple sources and sensors as well as one RIS. Firstly, we obtain a closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the CRLB. Due to the non-convex objective function and coupled relationship between variables, it is difficult to solve directly. To overcome such issues, a novel two-stage alternating localization and passive beamforming (PBF) scheme is proposed, where the optimization problems corresponding to two stages, namely the joint localization and NLOS identification (JLNI) stage and the PBF optimization (PBFO) stage are alternately addressed. Specifically, for the JLNI stage, we adopt alternating optimization, parametric sparse Bayesian dictionary learning and block coordinate descent approaches to jointly estimate the locations of sources and LOS/NLOS path condition. Subsequently, for the PBFO stage, we optimize the PBF vector by exploiting semi-definite relaxation, difference-of-convex programming and successive convex approximation approaches. Finally, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of CRLB, localization error and NLOS identification accuracy.}

	abstract = {Received signal strength (RSS)–based cooperative localization has gained significant attention due to its straightforward system architectures and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cooperative Localization Techniques (with Unknown Parameters), referred to as CTUP(s), which consider uncertainty in anchor nodes’ locations and assume the transmit power and path loss exponent (PLE) to be unknown. Unlike prior studies, CTUP(s) address unknowns by estimating these parameters, along with the location of target nodes. The non-convex and non-linear nature of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of the problem is addressed through relaxation techniques, employing Taylor series expansion, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and the epigraph method. The resulting problem is solved using semidefinite second-order cone programming (SDP-SOCP), leveraging the precision of SDP and the simplicity of SOCP. We deployed an extensive network comprising 50 BLE nodes covering an area of 640 m \\times 180 m to gather RSS data. The precise location of the nodes is obtained using real-time kinematics global positioning system (RTK-GPS), which is treated as the ground truth. Furthermore, to replicate real-world scenarios, we recorded the positions of the anchor nodes using a standard GPS, thereby introducing uncertainty into the anchor node locations. Extensive simulation and hardware experimentation demonstrate the superior performance of CTUP compared to existing techniques.}

We aim to combine the power of quantum neural networks and the success of classical deep neural networks to enhance the learning performance. Specifically, we propose two hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to maximize the sum rate of a downlink system. The first one proposes a quantum neural network employing parameterized quantum circuits that follows a classical convolutional neural network. The classical neural network can be jointly trained with the quantum neural network or pre-trained leading to a fine-tuning transfer learning method. The second one designs a quantum convolutional neural network to better extract features followed by a classical deep neural network. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid neural networks, and reveal that the first method can achieve similar sum rate performance compared to a benchmark classical neural network with significantly less training parameters; while the second method can achieve higher sum rate especially in presence of many users still with less training parameters. The robustness of the proposed methods is verified using both software simulators and hardware emulators considering noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.}

	abstract = {The development of orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based radio vortex transmission presents a promising opportunity for increasing the capacity of wireless communication in correlated channels due to its inherent orthogonality among different OAM modes. One of the most popular schemes for high-efficient OAM transmission is the digital baseband associated with uniform circular array (UCA) based transceiver. However, the periodicity of complex-exponential feed makes the maximum number of orthogonal signals carried by multiple OAM modes generally restricted to the array-element number of UCA antenna, which poses an open question of how to employ more OAM modes given a fixed number of array elements. Furthermore, signals modulated with high-order OAM modes are difficult to be captured by the receiver due to their serious divergence as propagating in free space, thus severely limiting the capacity of radio vortex communications. To overcome the above challenges, in this paper based on the partly element-overlapped fractal geometry layout and effectively using low-order OAM modes, we propose the quasi-fractal UCA (QF-UCA) antenna based OAM multiplexing transmission. We perform the two-dimension OAM modulation (TOM) and demodulation (TOD) schemes with the orthogonal OAM mode number exceeding the array-element number, which is beyond the traditional concept of multiple antennas based wireless communications. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve more number of orthogonal multiplexing streams than the maximum number of orthogonal multiplexing corresponding to traditional multiple antenna systems.}

	abstract = {With the emerging environment-aware applications, ubiquitous sensing is expected to play a key role in future networks. In this paper, we study a 3-dimensional (3D) multi-target localization system where multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are applied to create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links that bypass the base station (BS) and targets. To fully unveil the fundamental limit of IRS for sensing, we first study a single-target-single-IRS case and propose a novel two-stage localization protocol by controlling the on/off state of IRS. To be specific, in the IRS-off stage, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the azimuth/elevation direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the BS-target link and design a DoA estimator based on the MUSIC algorithm. In the IRS-on stage, the CRB of the azimuth/elevation DoA of the IRS-target link is derived and a simple DoA estimator based on the on-grid IRS beam scanning method is proposed. Particularly, the impact of echo signals reflected by IRS from different paths on sensing performance is analyzed and we show that only the signal passing through the BS-IRS-target link is required while that of the BS-target link can be neglected provided that the number of BS antennas is sufficiently large and the dedicated sensing beam at the BS is aligned with the departure transmit array response from the BS to the IRS. Moreover, we prove that the single-beam of the IRS is not capable of sensing, but it can be achieved with multi-beam. Based on the two obtained DoAs, the 3D single-target location is constructed. We then extend to the multi-target-multi-IRS case and propose an IRS-adaptive sensing protocol by controlling the on/off state of multiple IRSs, and a multi-target localization algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme and show that sub-meter-level positioning accuracy can be achieved.}

	abstract = {This paper studies a lattice-based broadcasting (LBC) scheme for a single-cell downlink system. The base station (BS) has N antennas and the K user-equipments (UEs) have a single-antenna. The system is referred to as massive-user MIMO (mU-MIMO) when K is very large. At the transmitter side, the BS encodes the messages for the UEs with state-of-the-art channel codes and q-PAM modulation. We suggest a codeword-level precoding, which transforms the K UEs’ coded sequences by an invertible integer matrix \\mathbf {A}^{-1} over \\mathbb {Z}_{q} , resulting in K codeword-level precoded (CLP) streams. Then, the CLP streams undergo a linear signal-level precoding (SLP) with regularized integer-forcing, and the resultant signals are transmitted via the N antennas of BS. The operations of CLP and SLP are both linear. At the receiver side, each UE attempts to compute an integer-combination (ICB) of the K CLP streams w.r.t. the integer matrix A, which turns out to be its desired message thanks to the CLP. For computing the ICB, we put forth new soft detection algorithms, which efficiently calculate the a posteriori probability of ICB over the lattice. The complexity is shown to be (much) less than O(Kq) , which is suited for large values of K. Further, we develop a particle swarm based approach that jointly optimizes A and the power allocation matrix. Numerical results demonstrate dramatically enhanced performance over baseline schemes including regularized zero-forcing and vector perturbation precoding, for both slow and fast fading channels.}

The resource allocation scheme applying orthogonal frequency division multiple (OFDM) modulation and the power splitting (PS) method is proposed for the SPVLCP system. Based on this scheme, a corresponding optimization allocation strategy is provided, aiming to maximize the data rate by optimizing the PS factor and the power allocated to subcarriers while ensuring positioning accuracy, harvested energy, and the LED transmit power. To solve the optimization issue, the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and a series of equivalent substitutions are applied to convert the optimization issue from non-convex to convex. The findings demonstrated that the optimization allocation strategy can solve the trade-off problem among communication, positioning, and energy harvesting better than the uniform allocation strategy. Furthermore, the SCA-based algorithm has an obvious superiority over the conventional heuristic algorithm in solving the optimization issue for the proposed resource allocation scheme of the integrated SPVLCP system.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new wireless sensing system equipped with the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can flexibly adjust the positions of antenna elements for improving the sensing performance over conventional antenna arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). First, we show that the angle estimation performance in wireless sensing is fundamentally determined by the array geometry, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is derived as a function of the antennas’ positions for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays. Then, for the case of 1D MA array, we obtain a globally optimal solution for the MAs’ positions in closed form to minimize the CRB of AoA estimation MSE. While in the case of 2D MA array, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to (w.r.t.) the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In particular, for the special case of circular antenna movement region, an optimal solution for the MAs’ positions is derived under certain numbers of MAs and circle radii. Thereby, both the lower- and upper-bounds of the min-max CRB are obtained for the antenna movement region with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution for MAs’ positions by iteratively optimizing one between their horizontal and vertical coordinates with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed 1D/2D MA arrays can significantly decrease the CRB of AoA estimation MSE as well as the actual MSE compared to conventional uniform linear arrays (ULAs)/uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with different values of uniform inter-antenna spacing. Furthermore, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing the ambiguity of angle estimation.}

We formulate the maximum effective secrecy throughput (EST) that satisfies reliability and secrecy constraints. Our key contributions are threefold. Firstly, we propose an analytical framework that unifies fluctuating two-ray (FTR) and independent FTR (IFTR) fading distributions into a single model. While FTR/IFTR distributions are recognized as the statistical models suitable for the mmWave fading channel, they have traditionally been treated as separate models. Secondly, we propose a novel approximation method to statistically characterize end-to-end channels, accounting for the combined impact of the non-uniform RIS amplitude response and phase estimation errors at Bob and Eves over the unified FTR/IFTR channels. Finally, a new approximate closed-form expression of the EST is derived, extensively validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our numerical findings highlight the superior benefits of deploying a larger RIS over increasing the number of antennas at Alice and the improved EST performance in a mmWave scenario compared to the microwave counterpart.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be densely deployed in complex environments to create cascaded line-of-sight (LoS) links between base stations (BSs) and users, which significantly enhance the signal coverage for both wireless information transfer and wireless power transfer (WPT). In this paper, we consider the WPT from a multi-antenna BS to multiple energy users (EUs) by exploiting the signal beam routing via multi-IRS reflections. First, we present a baseline beam routing scheme with each IRS serving at most one EU, where the BS transmits wireless power to all EUs simultaneously while the signals to different EUs undergo disjoint sets of multi-IRS reflection paths. Under this setup, we aim to tackle the joint beam routing and resource allocation optimization problem by jointly optimizing the reflection paths for all EUs, the active/passive beamforming at the BS/each involved IRS, as well as the BS’s power allocation for different EUs to maximize the minimum received signal power among all EUs. Next, to further improve the WPT performance, we propose two new beam routing schemes, namely dynamic beam routing and subsurface-based beam routing, where each IRS can serve multiple EUs via different time slots and different subsurfaces, respectively. In particular, we prove that dynamic beam routing outperforms subsurface-based beam routing in terms of minimum harvested power among all EUs. In addition, we show that the optimal performance of dynamic beam routing is achieved by assigning all EUs with orthogonal time slots for WPT. A clique-based optimization approach is also proposed to solve the joint beam routing and resource allocation problems for the baseline beam routing and proposed dynamic beam routing schemes. Numerical results are finally presented, which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed dynamic beam routing scheme to the baseline scheme.}

	abstract = {Space-time scheduling for multi-user networks under fairness considerations is investigated. Scheduling is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem under the Markov Decision Processes (MDP) framework. Although the initial focus of the work is underwater acoustic networks, the proposed strategies are also validated for terrestrial radio frequency networks. If environment exploration is expensive, planning is more efficient than online learning. A challenge of the proportional fairness is that the additive structure between current and future rewards does not hold. An approximate reward function that is additive is proposed, enabling dynamic programming. Computational complexity is addressed through sample-based approximations. Error accumulation and error bounds are analyzed to show that error decays with time. As mobility induces model-shifts, a novel re-planning scheme is proposed to optimize the timings of policy updates. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves network capacity while maintaining a high level of fairness. Furthermore, the proposed approach yields average capacity and fairness gains as high as 37% and 27%, respectively, compared to current approaches.}

To optimize overall energy efficiency, joint subchannel, transmit power, and multi-UAV trajectory optimization algorithms are examined in a multi-cell heterogeneous network of UAV and sidelink with quality of service (QoS) sensitivity restrictions. To allocate subchannel appropriately in each period, a grouping and matching approach is first developed that can handle the subchannel assignment of multi-cell.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the uplink transmission of an integrated satellite-terrestrial network, wherein the low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites provide backhaul services to isolated cellular base stations (BSs) for forwarding mobile user (UE) data to the core network. In this integrated system, the high mobility of LEO satellites (LEOSats) introduces significant challenges in managing radio resource allocation (RA), as well as the associations between UEs, BSs, and LEOSats for supporting users’ demands efficiently, while also dynamically balancing the capacity of UE-BS access and BS-LEO backhaul links. Regarding these critical issues, the paper aims to jointly optimize the two-tier UE-BS and BS-LEOSat association, sub-channel assignment, bandwidth allocation, and power control to meet users’ demands in the shortest transmission time. This optimization problem, however, falls into the category of mixed-integer non-convex programming, making it very challenging and requiring advanced solution techniques to find optimal solutions. To tackle this complex problem efficiently, we first develop an iterative centralized algorithm by utilizing convex approximation and compressed-sensing-based methods to deal with binary variables. Furthermore, for practical implementation and to offload computation from the central processing node, we propose a Dec-Alg that can be implemented in parallel at local controllers and achieve efficient solutions. Numerical results are also illustrated to strengthen the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms compared to traditional greedy and benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the critical challenge of securing two-way Time-of-Arrival (ToA) localization in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) against cooperative distance-enlargement attacks. Existing schemes often rely on heuristic test statistics, are limited to specific attack strategies e.g., Amplify and Forward (AF), or require collaboration among multiple anchor nodes, which hinders their effectiveness against sophisticated adversaries and often incurs high communication overhead. We propose two novel detection schemes based on signal characteristics that overcome these limitations, offering both high accuracy and low complexity. The first scheme, termed the Efficient Detection Scheme of Distance-Enlargement Attacks using Log-Likelihood Ratio (EDDEA-LLR), leverages the Neyman-Pearson (NP) lemma to derive an optimal test statistic for scenarios involving AF attacks. Recognizing the limitations of existing schemes and the EDDEA-LLR scheme in countering Decode and Forward (DF) attacks, we introduce the Efficient Detection Scheme of Distance-Enlargement Attacks by Embedding a Secret Tag (EDDEA-EST). This scheme exploits embedded secret tags within the challenge signal to effectively detect DF attacks. Importantly, the proposed schemes do not require collaboration among multiple anchor nodes, eliminating the need for additional communication and featuring low computational complexity. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for the detection performance of both schemes. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes over existing methods in terms of detection accuracy, robustness against both AF and DF attacks, and comprehensive performance considering communication overhead.}

	abstract = {WiFi-enabled Power Line Communications (PLC) range extenders can extend coverage in homes and enterprises. However, a dense deployment of a large number of PLC extenders in enterprise settings can cause an inefficient sharing of the PLC capacity, where many extenders contend for a share of access to the backhaul network comprising of the electrical wiring (power lines), thereby drastically impacting any gains from using these extenders on the wireless part of the network. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a framework, Priza, for clustering the WiFi-PLC extenders to intelligently form a DAS (distributed antenna system) to mitigate the inefficiency of sharing the PLC backhaul. By appropriately managing clustering and reuse, Priza improves the PLC backhaul sharing, while at the same time, harnessing the power pooling and diversity gains from DAS on the wireless part of the network, to boost user throughputs. We evaluate Priza via real testbed experiments and high-fidelity simulations and demonstrate that it can increase the aggregate throughput by up to 131.5% over the non-DAS reuse baseline, 74% over the best DAS baseline that constructs equally-sized DAS cells based on extender proximity, and 331.3% over a greedy DAS baseline that creates as large DAS cells as possible.}

In the system, sensors collect the state information of each process and transmit it to the controller through wireless channels. The communication constraints, including transmission delays, packet loss, and bandwidth limitation, are taken into account. To evaluate control timeliness for each process, this paper adopts the concept of age of information (AoI) in the context of closed-loop control. Meanwhile, to strike a tradeoff between transmission delay and outage, this paper introduces an innovative cross-slot scheduling policy not covered in existing literature, which can freely allocate transmission time and occupancy bandwidth. We prove that the scheduling problem in bandwidth limited remote control is an NP-hard problem, and establish the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem. The Deep-Double-Dueling-Q-Learning (D3QN) algorithm is employed to approximate the optimal scheduling policy for the scenario where the channel information is unknown and the system is model-free. By extensive simulations, the proposed cross-time slot scheduling policy demonstrates superior effectiveness in allocating time-frequency resources and achieving outstanding results.}

	abstract = {Current iterative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detectors suffer from slow convergence when the wireless channel is ill-conditioned. The ill-conditioning is mainly caused by spatial correlation between channel columns corresponding to the same user equipment, known as intra-user interference. In addition, in the emerging MIMO systems using an extremely large aperture array (ELAA), spatial non-stationarity can make the channel even more ill-conditioned. In this paper, user-wise singular value decomposition (UW-SVD) is proposed to accelerate the convergence of iterative MIMO detectors. Its basic principle is to perform SVD on each user’s sub-channel matrix to eliminate intra-user interference. Then, the MIMO signal model is effectively transformed into an equivalent signal (e-signal) model, comprising an e-channel matrix and an e-signal vector. Existing iterative algorithms can be used to recover the e-signal vector, which undergoes post-processing to obtain the signal vector. It is proven that the e-channel matrix is better conditioned than the original MIMO channel for spatially correlated (ELAA-)MIMO channels. This implies that UW-SVD can accelerate current iterative algorithms, which is confirmed by our simulation results. Specifically, it can speed up convergence by up to 10 times in both uncoded and coded systems.}

The first challenge is the possible interference to the ground base stations (BSs) and users possibly at unknown locations. This paper develops a radio-map-based approach to predict the channel to the receivers and the unintended nodes. Therefore, a predictive communication strategy can be optimized ahead of time to reduce the interference power and duration for the ground nodes. Such predictive optimization raises the second challenge of developing a low-complexity solution for a batch of transmission strategies over T time slots for N receivers before the flight. Mathematically, while the proposed interference-aware predictive communication problem is non-convex, it is converted into a relaxed convex problem, and solved by a novel dual-based algorithm, which is shown to achieve global optimality at asymptotically small slot duration. The proposed algorithm demonstrates orders of magnitude of the computational time saving compared to several existing solvers. Simulations show that the radio-map-assisted scheme can reduce the interference to the unintended receivers at known locations below a prescribed threshold and significantly reduce the interference to the users at unknown locations.}

	abstract = {The continuous aperture of Holographic MIMO enables us to encode and transmit information spatially. This paper investigates the achievable rate of linear Holographic MIMO with arbitrary aperture-length using the finite blocklength information theory. Specifically, we first employ the prolate spheroidal wave functions to expand the received wavenumber band-limited electromagnetic field. This orthogonal representation enables two schemes to convey information related to the normal additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the non-normal AWGN channel, namely the NA and NNA schemes, respectively. Then we derive the accurate achievable rates and the converse bounds of the two schemes by extending the \\kappa \\beta bound in finite blocklength information theory. Moreover, we derive an approximate closed-form expression of the achievable rate in the large aperture-length regime based on normal approximation. The approximation indicates that for a given space efficiency, the error probability decreases rapidly as the aperture length L increases, with the rate of decline determined by Q\\left ({{O\\left ({{\\sqrt {L}}}\\right)}}\\right) . Finally, we obtain the asymptotic results when the aperture-length tends to infinity. Numerical results demonstrate that the NA scheme outperforms the NNA scheme when the blocklength is small, while the NNA scheme excels in the large blocklength regime. The accuracy of the approximation and the validity of the asymptotic results are verified.}

This paper introduces a novel approach to model and analyze GEO satellite networks using stochastic geometry. We model the distribution of GEO satellites in the geostationary orbit according to a binomial point process (BPP) and examine satellite visibility depending on the terminal’s latitude. Then, we identify potential distribution cases for GEO satellites and derive case probabilities based on the properties of the BPP. We also obtain the distance distributions between the terminal and GEO satellites and derive the coverage probability of the network. We further approximate the derived expressions using the Poisson limit theorem. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the analytical findings, demonstrating a strong alignment between the analyses and simulations. The simplified analytical results can be used to estimate the coverage performance of GEO satellite networks by effectively modeling the positions of GEO satellites.}

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the development of federated learning (FL) that allows wireless devices (WDs) to collaboratively learn a global model under the coordination of a parameter server without sharing their local datasets. To meet the communication efficiency and privacy requirements, over-the-air computation and differential privacy (DP) have been incorporated in FL by leveraging the signal-superposition property of multiple-access channels and using artificial noises to perturb local model updates, thereby preserving DP. In this paper, we propose an exploration into device sampling with replacement as a potential mechanism for augmenting the DP levels of WDs in over-the-air FL. In particular, we delve into the joint optimization of device sampling strategy, the number of training rounds, and over-the-air transceiver design. Our goal is to maximize the learning performance while ensuring each WD meets the DP requirement. The problem is challenging due to the intractable FL convergence rate and privacy losses under random sampling, coupled with the strong interconnection among mixed continuous and integer decision variables. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the learning convergence rate and privacy losses of WDs. The analysis allows us to derive the optimal transceiver design per round in closed forms. Then, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm by deriving the optimal device sampling strategy and the number of training rounds in semi-closed forms. Our numerical results, based on real-world learning tasks, showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with representative baselines.}

	abstract = {Joint monitoring, by integrating observations from multiple types of equipment, is essential for a thorough understanding of physical processes in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, it does demand sufficient resources to ensure reliable and timely delivery of such observations. Although network slicing is widely used to meet such heterogeneous requirements, it falls short in this system, because it causes interconnected impacts on system performance across multiple slices. In this paper, we introduce an innovative associated network slicing framework for joint monitoring, which focuses on system cost minimization while accounting for slice associations. Particularly, to better understand the characteristics, we introduce a new concept, Age of Inexact Task (AoIT), to capture inter-slice associations. We then decompose the optimization variables to facilitate efficient Associated Network Slicing (ANS) algorithmic design, leading to a closed-form solution for intra-slice small-timescale resource allocation and an iterative block coordinate gradient descent algorithm for inter-slice large-timescale resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed ANS balances heterogeneous requirements and associations, showing significant reductions in system costs compared to existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) is a promising technology for the future networks, enabling communication nodes to change uplink and downlink traffic opportunistically in the time domain to improve communication resource management. In this article, we propose an innovative system architecture where a full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serves as a base station (BS) to enhance the performance of D-TDD networks composed of multiple full-duplex ground users and provides essential mobility and duplexing flexibility. We theoretically and numerically analyze two typical communication scenarios under this architecture, namely single transceiver pair (single-pair case) and multiple transceiver pairs (multi-pair case), at any time slot. In the single-pair case, the full-duplex UAV-BS communicates with at most one uplink user and one downlink user at the same time. In the multi-pair case, the UAV-BS supports multiple uplink and downlink users simultaneously. We formulate the throughput optimization problems for each case by jointly considering the uplink/downlink scheduling, power allocation, energy consumption and UAV-BS trajectory. Efficient algorithms are developed to deal with the non-convex problems and proved to be convergent. In addition, extensive simulation results show that our algorithms can cater to asymmetric uplink and downlink traffic and outperform other competitive benchmarks.}

To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.}

	abstract = {Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial platforms to provide both sensing and communication services is envisioned as a promising paradigm, due to their inherent flexibility and maneuverability. In this paper, we propose a UAV-enabled sensing-assisted communication scheme for vehicular networks using the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique. Specifically, we consider the geometry of vehicles as extended targets with multiple resolvable scatters and adjust beamwidth to cover the entire vehicle in the ISAC duration. Based on the reflected signals, the UAV can predict the state of vehicle, which is then exploited to generate tailored beams to effectively track the vehicle. To address the asymmetric sensing and communication requirements, a three-stage ISAC scheme with dynamic sensing duration and frequency is proposed according to the communication/sensing performance in real time. The initial state of vehicle is estimated in the first stage, followed by the use of ISAC wide beams in the second stage to achieve the vehicle coverage, employing an extended Kalman filtering (EKF) approach for state tracking and prediction. In the third stage, the UAV selectively transmits either an ISAC beam or a communication-only beam based on monitored sensing and communication performance metrics. Finally, simulation results are provided to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme as compared to other benchmarks and also shed light on the tradeoff between communication and sensing.}

Deep learning has revolutionized the efficiency of non-contact sensing technology. Owing to its robust feature extraction capabilities and the interconnectedness of diverse sensing tasks, methods that address multiple tasks at once, like joint activity recognition and indoor localization (JARIL), have gained prominence. The primary goal of JARIL is to improve performance while reducing computational demands. Nevertheless, there remains substantial potential for enhancing its effectiveness through additional refinement and optimization measures. To address this, we introduce a regularized multi-label learning (RML) framework specifically designed for JARIL. This framework combines a parameter-efficient backbone network based on multi-scale separable convolution with residual connections, and a regularization training strategy. The latter strategy boosts performance by linearly combining two distinct CSI samples with their labels, creating new training instances in the training process. Simulation results show that the proposed method boasts a recognition accuracy of 91.73% and a localization precision of 99.64%. This marks an improvement of 4.32% and 3.60% respectively, in comparison to the prior ResNet1D+-based JARIL method. The codes can be downloaded from https://github.com/BeechburgPieStar/JARIL.}

A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented. Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users’ data distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the power allocation is achieved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed cluster-based FL framework can outperform FL baselines in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, jointly optimizing sub-channel and power allocation in NOMA-enhanced networks can lead to a significant improvement.}

	abstract = {Both the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and the hybrid analog-digital antenna array have been envisioned as two cost-effective and promising technologies for achieving various types of functionality enhancement of future wireless systems. In this paper, we develop a framework for the multi-functional optimization in the RIS-aided hybrid analog-digital multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where a board of performance metrics related to diverse system functionalities are considered, such as capacity and mean square error (MSE) for information transmission (IT), Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for radar sensing, harvested energy for energy harvesting (EH) and so on. Under this framework, we focus on two types of multi-functional optimization problems, namely, the multi-objective multi-functional optimization and the single-objective optimization subject to multi-functional constraints, and propose a unified low-complexity algorithm by separately optimizing analog and digital matrix variables. Specifically, for the multi-objective optimization, we firstly propose the numerical quadratic optimization based (QuaOpt-based) algorithm and the low-complexity channel alignment based algorithm to separately optimize analog matrices, including the RIS reflecting matrix, the analog precoder and the analog equalizer. Then, for the optimization of digital precoder, the numerical semidefinite programming (SDP)-based algorithm and the QuaOpt-based algorithm are proposed to iteratively solve the digital precoder optimization problem, while the matrix-monotonic optimization based algorithm derives the optimal closed-form solution in low computational complexity. Whereas for the single-objective optimization, the above proposed algorithms are still applicable by applying the Lagrangian duality theory to tackle the multi-functional constraints. Numerical simulation results reveal that the proposed low-complexity algorithm can achieve comparable performance to numerical algorithms.}

The emerging paradigm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has the potential to overcome this issue by its ability to arbitrarily reflect the incident signals toward desired directions. This paper proposes a Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion-based blockage-aware algorithm to improve communication resilience against blockage in mobile mmWave multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. By virtue of this pragmatic blockage-aware technique, we further propose an outage-constrained beamforming design for downlink mmWave MIMO transmission to achieve outage probability minimization and achievable rate maximization. To minimize the outage probability, a robust RIS beamformer with variant beamwidth is designed to combat uncertain channel state information (CSI). For the rate maximization problem, an accelerated projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm is developed to solve the computational challenge of high-dimensional RIS phase-shift matrix (PSM) optimization. Particularly, we leverage a subspace constraint to reduce the scope of the projection operation and formulate a new Nesterov momentum acceleration scheme to speed up the convergence process of PGD. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed blockage-aware approach, and the proposed accelerated PGD algorithm outperforms a number of representative baseline algorithms in terms of the achievable rate.}

In practical implementations, however, the RIS has finite size and the incident wave is a beam of finite k-content, rather than a plane wave of \\delta\n-like k-content. To understand the implications of the finite extent of both the RIS and the incident beam, here we treat the RIS as a spatial filter, the transfer function of which is determined by both the prescribed RIS operation and the shape of the RIS boundary. Following this approach, we study how the RIS transforms the incident k-content and we demonstrate how, by engineering the RIS shape, size, and response, it is possible to shape beams with nontrivial k-content to suppress unwanted interference, while concentrating the reflected power to desired directions. We also demonstrate how our framework, when applied in the context of near-field communications, provides the necessary insights into how the wavefront of the beam is tailored to enable focusing, propagation with invariant profile, and bending, beyond conventional beamforming.}

In the conventional scenario without IRS, the covariance-based approach, which exploits the probability density function (PDF) of the received signals at the base station (BS), has been demonstrated to outperform the compressed sensing approach. However, when taking the impact of the IRS into account, due to the newly introduced cascaded channels, it is difficult to obtain the exact PDF of the received signals at the BS. To tackle this challenge, we propose an approximation for the intended PDF with tunable parameters in the covariance matrix of the received signals. Based on the proposed tractable reformulation, an analytic framework is established to reveal the guideline for the phase shift design. Moreover, to determine the optimal correlation parameters, a deep unfolding approach is further leveraged by regarding them as trainable parameters. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed learning approach.}

Here, the RIS is partitioned into distinctive groups where each part of the RIS serves a different user equipment (UE) to perform multiple accessing. The BS transmits an unmodulated signal to the RIS, and each partition modulates the impinging signal over-the-air by introducing a phase shift according to the incoming information bits to serve the corresponding UE. First, the end-to-end system model for the proposed system is presented.

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation mobile networks to embed sensing function on communication waveforms. A major challenge in ISAC is the effective integration of sensing and communication functions. Addressing this, this paper introduces a dual-functional waveform design that builds on the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. Unlike prior approaches that generally sacrifice communication performance to enhance sensing performance, our design contains a null-space sensing precoder that utilizes the null space of the communication channel to project additional sensing signals, thus improving the sensing functionality of the OFDM waveform without degrading any communication performance. We formulate a waveform optimization problem aimed at maximizing the sensing performance under the null-space sensing precoder and then propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based waveform design algorithm. Additionally, to meet the real-time communication requirement in practice, we analyze the intrinsic characteristics of the high-performance sensing waveform and then develop a low-complexity waveform design algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed MM-based algorithm can dramatically improve sensing performance without incurring any additional sensing power and degrading the communication performance. Furthermore, the low-complexity algorithm achieves substantial improvements in the sensing performance with much reduced computational complexity.}

	abstract = {This research paper introduces an unsupervised scalable probabilistic approach for radio resource management in device-to-device (D2D) communication networks, essential for enhancing wireless data service capacity. We propose a joint optimization framework for spectrum allocation and power control, aiming to optimize the network’s mean rate while meeting minimum data rate requirements. Although deep learning (DL) models have been explored for this purpose, their scalability is constrained by the fixed sizes of their input/output features, and their effectiveness is often limited by an insufficient understanding of the network’s geometric structure. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were introduced to integrate the wireless network’s topology into the learning process. However, GNNs typically lose spatial correlation data when converting the tensorized channel state information (CSI) into a graph structure. To overcome this limitation, our solution combines GNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and variational autoencoders to extract meaningful embeddings from the CSI, preserving spatial and geometric features. We also introduce an innovative graph attention mechanism that enhances the model’s focus on crucial node and edge features. Our holistic approach exploits the wireless network’s topological and spatial relationships, offering a scalable, unsupervised, and generalizable solution without the need for retraining or architectural adjustments across various wireless setups. Our findings confirm our method’s superior performance and adaptability to different wireless environments.}

	abstract = {Consider a communication system in which a single-antenna user equipment exchanges information with a multi-antenna base station via a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in the presence of spatially correlated channels and electromagnetic interference (EMI). To exploit the attractive advantages of RIS technology, accurate configuration of its reflecting elements is crucial. In this paper, we use statistical knowledge of channels and EMI to optimize the RIS elements for 1i) accurate channel estimation and 2) reliable data transmission. In both cases, our goal is to determine the RIS coefficients that minimize the mean square error, resulting in the formulation of two non-convex problems that share the same structure. To solve these two problems, we present an alternating optimization approach that reliably converges to a locally optimal solution. The incorporation of the diagonally scaled steepest descent algorithm, derived from Newton’s method, ensures fast convergence with manageable complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under various propagation conditions. Notably, it shows significant advantages over existing alternatives that depend on a suboptimal configuration of the RIS and are derived on the basis of different criteria.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication (SC) is one of the promising solutions for future wireless communications due to its superior transmission efficiency. However, the semantic information cannot be transmitted accurately under noisy channels by the existing methods. For this reason, we propose a fairness-based transmission strategy for STAR-RIS assisted SC systems. On this basis, we investigate two operating protocols of STAR-RIS, energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS). More specifically, we maximize the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the users by jointly optimizing the active beamforming and the passive beamforming under the constraint of limited power at the base station (BS). To tackle this max-min optimization problem, for ES, we develop a double-loop iterative algorithm by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty function methods. For MS protocol, we further add an additional penalty in the objective function to address the optimization problem. Moreover, we rigorously prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to a locally optimal solution. At last, we conduct various experiments to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other benchmark methods in fairness and semantic similarity.}

	abstract = {In this paper, a 3D geometry-based reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided channel model is proposed with directional antenna at base station (BS) side. Different from traditional RIS-assisted channel model, visible area (i.e., range of observed scatters) and radiated power of directional antenna with uniform, cos and Gaussian patterns are considered. The time-varying large- and small-scale parameters of complete communication links including BS-receiver, BS-RIS, and RIS-receiver links are modeled considering intensively line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) paths. Three transmission cases at BS antenna side, that is, LoS Case, Mixed Case, and RIS Case are defined by directivity and number of beams. The principle of case selection is to maximize absolute value of CIR as optimization objective. Based on the proposed channel model and directional transmission cases, some second-order statistical characteristics, such as space-time correlation function and Doppler power spectrum density are derived, and conversion between different cases causes the simulation results to vary discontinuously in time or space domains. Furthermore, impacts of different cases and switching of direction antenna, radiated patterns of directional beam, RIS optimization phase, and environment conditions on channel characteristics are investigated. The results show that the proposed case selection method can well enhance correlation and lead to correlation taking on a sawtooth shape. In addition, it is also able to reduce the Doppler power spectrum curve. Furthermore, the proposed model is validated by comparing root mean square delay spread with measurement. These observations can be used to present a reference for designing and evaluating directional RIS-assisted communication systems.}

	abstract = {Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) signal detection is central to nearly every state-of-the-art communication system, and enhancements in error performance and computational complexity of MIMO detection would significantly enhance data rate and latency experienced by the users. Theoretically, the optimal MIMO detector is the maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detector; however, due to its extremely high complexity, it is not feasible for large real-world communication systems. Over the past few years, algorithms based on physics-inspired Ising solvers, like Coherent Ising machines and Quantum Annealers, have shown significant performance improvements for the MIMO detection problem. However, the current state-of-the-art is limited to low-order modulations or systems with few users. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage Ising machine-based MIMO detector that extends the performance gains of physics-inspired computation to Large and Massive MIMO systems with a large number of users and very high modulation schemes (up to 256-QAM). We enhance our previously proposed delta Ising formulation and develop a heuristic that adaptively optimizes the performance and complexity of our proposed method. We perform extensive micro-benchmarking to optimize several free parameters of the system and evaluate our methods’ BER and spectral efficiency for Large and Massive MIMO systems (up to 32 users and 256-QAM modulation).}

The proposed algorithm consists of a two-stage channel estimation scheme and a reliable sensing scheme, which enables high-quality channel estimation and precise sensing in three-dimensional (3D) space. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first puts forward an improved simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that utilizes structural relation between the sparse basis and indexes to implement coarse estimation of multiple parameters. Subsequently, taking the obtained coarse parameters as initial values, optimization of channel parameters is achieved using the idea of maximum likelihood and gradient descent algorithm. Finally, we develop a reliable sensing scheme to realize user localization and mapping of scattering environment in various scenarios. Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the parameters and positions are also derived and used as a benchmark in simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better channel estimation and sensing performance and is closer to CRBs. Moreover, even in challenging environment with unknown user orientation and clock bias, the proposed algorithm can achieve precise user localization and mapping of scattering environment.}

Although existing works have achieved certain transmission efficiency, challenges such as efficiently interpretable semantic extraction, and dynamically adaptive channel coding have not been fully explored. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a task-oriented scene graph-based semantic communication system with adaptive channel coding, named GRACE, to perform image retrieval task. To enhance the interpretability of semantic communications and reduce semantic redundancy, we introduce a scene graph semantic encoder. This encoder fully exploits informative scene graph semantics, effectively extracting scene graphs and performing further semantic coding. Additionally, to handle variable channel conditions in real-world scenarios, we develop a semantic-aware adaptive channel coding to adapt to channel conditions and reduce the communication resources. At the receiver, the image retrieval task is accomplished based on the recovered scene graph semantics. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system compared to other communication systems in terms of task-execution performance, robustness against channel variations, transmission efficiency, and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {Multiport network theory has been proved to be a suitable abstraction model for analyzing and optimizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an electromagnetically consistent manner, especially for studying the impact of the electromagnetic mutual coupling among radiating elements that are spaced less than half of the wavelength apart and for considering the interrelation between the amplitude and phase of the reflection coefficients. Both representations in terms of Z-parameter (impedance) and S-parameter (scattering) matrices are widely utilized. In this paper, we embrace multiport network theory for analyzing and optimizing the reradiation properties of RIS-aided channels, and provide four new contributions. (i) First, we offer a thorough comparison between the Z-parameter and S-parameter representations. This comparison allows us to unveil that typical scattering models utilized for RIS-aided channels ignore the structural scattering from an RIS, which is well documented in antenna theory. We show that the structural scattering results in an unwanted specular reflection. (ii) Then, we develop an iterative algorithm for optimizing, in the presence of electromagnetic mutual coupling, the tunable loads of an RIS based on the S-parameters representation. We prove that small perturbations of the step size of the algorithm result in larger variations of the S-parameter matrix compared with the Z-parameter matrix, resulting in a faster convergence rate. (iii) Subsequently, we generalize the proposed algorithm to suppress the specular reflection due to the structural scattering, while maximizing the received power towards the direction of interest, and analyze the effectiveness and tradeoffs of the proposed approach. (iv) Finally, we validate the theoretical findings and algorithms with numerical simulations and a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator based on the method of moments.}

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks are highly vulnerable to an active eavesdropping attack called pilot spoofing attack. The pilot spoofing attack causes information leakage to the active eavesdropper (ED) and also weakens the strength of the signal received by the attacked legitimate user equipment (UE) during the downlink transmission. In this paper, a deep neural network, called identification network (IDNet), is proposed to detect asynchronous pilot spoofing attacks and identify the attacked UE. We show that an asynchronous pilot spoofing attack leads to increasing the signal subspace dimension by one unlike the synchronous one. This property is then exploited to improve the attack detection/identification accuracy. In the proposed IDNet, the input features are the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal at the base station (BS) as well as the ratio between the power of the received signal at the BS projected onto the pilot signals and its expected value. Numerical results show the effectiveness of IDNet in identifying the attacked UE and reveal that the larger the timing and/or frequency mismatches of the ED, the higher the identification accuracy confirming that asynchronous pilot spoofing attacks can be identified more accurately than synchronous pilot spoofing attacks.}

Particularly, low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations can substitute for offering data services to mobile devices like UAVs when flying into TN service-deficient areas. In this paper, viewing TN and NTN as both competitors and collaborators, we present a novel approach to optimize UAV mobility management in integrated TN and NTN, thereby improving network service continuity. Specifically, we enable UAVs to opportunistically handover (HO) between TN and NTN during flight to maintain reliable data reception while minimizing HO overhead. The decision to switch from TN to NTN involves comparative assessments of service capabilities and HO rates between two segments over time, considering their link quality variations during UAV flight, TN coverage distributions, and orbital dynamics of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant advantages of UAV HO planning in integrated TN and NTN over standalone TN or NTN for HO numbers and service rates. We also demonstrate that in various scenarios, our UAV mobility management solution consistently outperforms existing heterogeneous HO methods that underrate the dynamic differences in service capabilities between TN and NTN.}

Different from prior works that investigate them independently, this paper studies the joint signal detection and automatic modulation classification (AMC) by considering a realistic and complex scenario, in which multiple signals with different modulation schemes coexist at different carrier frequencies. We first generate a coexisting RADIOML dataset (CRML23) to facilitate the joint design. Different from the publicly available AMC dataset, ignoring the signal detection step and containing only one signal, our synthetic dataset covers the more realistic multiple-signal coexisting scenario. Then, we present a joint framework for detection and classification (JDM) for such a multiple-signal coexisting environment, which consists of two modules for signal detection and AMC, respectively. In particular, these two modules are interconnected using a designated data structure called “proposal”. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations over the newly developed dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs.

Relying on a general capacity upper bound derived by using a maximum-trace argument, we respectively characterize the capacity slope of low-signal-to-noise-ratio channels and the exact capacity of rank-one channels, in which the optimal configuration of the RIS is proved to be beamforming-only with carefully-chosen phase shifts. To exploit the potential of modulating extra information on the RIS, by leveraging a strategy named partially beamforming and partially information-carrying based on QR decomposition and successive interference cancellation, we propose a novel transceiver architecture with only a single RF front end at the transmitter, by which the considered channel can be regarded as a concatenation of a vector Gaussian channel and several phase-modulated channels. Especially, we investigate a class of vector Gaussian channels with a hypersphere input support constraint, and not only generalize the existing result to arbitrary-dimensional real spaces but also present its high-order capacity asymptotics, by which both capacities of hypersphere-constrained channels and achievable rates of the proposed transceiver with two different signaling schemes can be well-approximated. Information-theoretic analyses show that the transceiver architecture designed for the SIMO channel has a boosted multiplexing gain, rather than one for the conventionally-used optimized beamforming scheme. Numerical results verify our derived asymptotic results and show notable superiority of the proposed transceiver as compared with the beamforming and the receive spatial modulation schemes.}

	abstract = {Mutual coupling is increasingly important in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communications, particularly when RIS elements are densely integrated in applications such as holographic communications. This paper experimentally investigates the mutual coupling effect among RIS elements using a mutual coupling-aware communication model based on scattering matrices. Utilizing a fabricated 1-bit quasi-passive RIS prototype operating in the mmWave band, we propose a practical model training approach based on a single 3D full-wave simulation of the RIS radiation pattern, which enables the estimation of the scattering matrix among RIS unit cells. The formulated estimation problem is rigorously convex with a limited number of unknowns un-scaling with RIS size. The trained model is validated through both full-wave simulations and experimental measurements on the fabricated RIS prototype. Compared to the conventional communication model that does not account for mutual coupling in RIS, the mutual coupling-aware model incorporating trained scattering parameters demonstrates improved prediction accuracy. Benchmarked against the full-wave simulated RIS radiation pattern, the trained model can reduce prediction error by up to approximately 10.7%. Meanwhile, the S-parameter between the Tx and Rx antennas is measured, validating that the trained model exhibits closer alignment with the experimental measurements. These results affirm the accuracy of the adopted model and the effectiveness of the proposed model training method.}

	abstract = {Channel estimation stands as a pivotal and challenging task for millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, especially in a time-varying scenario, where exists a massive number of channel coefficients and severe propagation loss due to the Doppler shifts. Conventional estimation schemes may fail to track the fast varying channels and not be able to fully exploit the unique characteristics of mmWave channels in their model designs. In this work, we leverage the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and meticulously design a novel framework named Homogeneous Denoising Generative Adversarial Network (HDnGAN) to tackle the challenge of time-varying channel estimation for mmWave MIMO system. Our framework incorporates the distinctive traits of mmWave channels, such as temporal and spatial correlations, as well as angular sparsity, into the network architecture design. Theoretically, a special case of our proposed HDnGAN with a linear structure is demonstrated to be not inferior to the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator. Numerical simulations underscore the superiority of HDnGAN over existing channel estimation methods, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Furthermore, it exhibits robustness across varying scenarios. Notably, it remains applicable in out-of-distribution situations and in the absence of ground truth.}

	abstract = {A distributed control of vehicle platooning is referred to as distributed consensus (DC) since many autonomous vehicles (AVs) reach a consensus to achieve coordinated movement with the same velocity and inter-distance. For DC control to be stable, each AV utilizes other AVs’ real-time position information obtained via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. On the other hand, too many V2V links should be simultaneously established and frequently retrained, causing a longer communication latency due to frequent packet losses and thereby hampering stable DC. This paper proposes a novel DC algorithm called over-the-air consensus (AirCons), a joint communication-and-control design with two key features to overcome the above limitations. First, exploiting a wireless signal’s superposition and broadcasting properties renders every AV’s signal converge to a specific value. We show that the consensus value is proportional to the weighted average of participating AVs’ real-time positions and has a tight lower bound as the ground-truth average. In other words, the average position location can be directly estimated without the neighbor AVs’ positions, thereby achieving ultra-low latency data sharing. Next, the estimated average position is inputted into each AV’s controller to adjust its dynamics distributively. The average position, considered a real-time value due to its low latency, contributes to achieving the stability of vehicle platooning. We design AirCons based on New Radio architecture with its feasibility study by analyzing required radio resources, i.e., time and bandwidth. Through analytic and numerical studies, the effectiveness of the proposed AirCons is verified by showing a 16.40% control gain compared to the benchmark without the average position.}

	abstract = {One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning solutions, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile clients. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile clients comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely channel decoding also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile clients in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile clients by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that wireless FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as the case with error-free communication provided the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of wireless FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by \\sim ~20 % when compared to an existing approach.}

	abstract = {We optimize the Age of Information (AoI) in mobile networks using the age-threshold slotted ALOHA (TSA) protocol. The network comprises multiple source-destination pairs, where each source sends a sequence of status update packets to its destination over a shared spectrum. The TSA protocol stipulates that a source node must remain silent until its AoI reaches a predefined threshold, after which the node accesses the radio channel with a certain probability. Using stochastic geometry tools, we derive analytical expressions for the transmission success probability, mean peak AoI, and time-average AoI. Subsequently, we obtain closed-form expressions for the optimal update rate and age threshold that minimize the mean peak and time-average AoI, respectively. In addition, we establish a scaling law for the mean peak AoI and time-average AoI in mobile networks, revealing that the optimal mean peak AoI and time-average AoI increase linearly with the deployment density. Notably, the growth rate of time-average AoI under TSA is half of that under SA. When considering the optimal mean peak AoI, the TSA protocol exhibits comparable performance to the traditional slotted ALOHA protocol. These findings conclusively affirm the advantage of TSA in reducing higher-order AoI, particularly in densely deployed networks.}

	abstract = {Multi-user MIMO is a key component of modern wireless networks. As such, investigating the related security weaknesses is a compelling necessity. A major issue unveiled by existing work is that adversaries can “poison” the channel information feedback reported to the beamformer to decrease the performance experienced by a legitimate user. Prior work, however, assumes that the feedback is reported in an uncompressed fashion, which is not the case in current wireless standards such as Wi-Fi or 5G. In this work, we first show that assuming uncompressed feedback leads to overestimating the attack effectiveness by up to 60%. Next, we formulate ACFP (Adversarial Compressed Feedback Problem), a novel non-convex constrained optimization problem to find the compressed feedback that maximizes a victim’s bit error rate (BER) while satisfying maximum power constraints. We propose WHACK (Wireless Harmful Adversarial Compressed feedbacK), a new algorithm to solve ACFP and find the malicious compressed feedback based on the convexity of the objective function and constraint using a nonlinear conjugate gradient method. WHACK has been prototyped and extensively evaluated with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices. Experimental results show that it maximizes the victim’s BER, while modifying less than 60% of the feedback. Our dataset and code are available.}

Our framework incorporates end-to-end training with channel noise to enhance resilience, incorporates vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) for efficient and robust communication, and utilizes pre-trained encoder-decoder transformers for improved generalization capabilities. Simulations, across various communication scenarios, reveal that our framework achieves a 50% reduction in transmission size while demonstrating substantial generalization ability and noise robustness under standardized 3GPP channel models.}

	abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as a promising enabler for representing the real-time states of physical worlds and realizing self-sustaining systems. In practice, DTs of physical devices, such as mobile users (MUs), are commonly deployed in multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks for the sake of reducing latency. To ensure the accuracy and fidelity of DTs, it is essential for MUs to regularly synchronize their status with their DTs. However, MU mobility introduces significant challenges to DT synchronization. Firstly, MU mobility triggers DT migration which could cause synchronization failures. Secondly, MUs require frequent synchronization with their DTs to ensure DT fidelity. Nonetheless, DT migration among MEC servers, caused by MU mobility, may occur infrequently. Accordingly, we propose a two-timescale DT synchronization and migration framework with reliability consideration by establishing a non-convex stochastic problem to minimize the long-term average energy consumption of MUs. We use Lyapunov theory to convert the reliability constraints and reformulate the new problem as a partially observable Markov decision-making process (POMDP). Furthermore, we develop a heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization with Beta distribution (Beta-HAPPO) method to solve it. Numerical results show that our proposed Beta-HAPPO method achieves significant improvements in energy savings when compared with other benchmarks.}

Specifically, the localization performance is measured by the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) on the transmission delay and direction of arrival (DoA) of the backscattered signals, whose closed-form expression is obtained by deriving the corresponding Fisher information matrix (FIM), and the communication performance is characterized by the sum transmission rate of all BDs. Then, to characterize the trade-off between the localization and communication performances, the CRB minimization problem with the communication rate constraint is formulated, and is shown to be non-convex in general. By exploiting the hidden convexity, we propose an approach that combines fractional programming (FP) and Schur complement techniques to transform the original problem into an equivalent convex form.

	abstract = {The conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) combats inter-symbol interference (ISI) by adding cyclic prefix (CP) at the beginning of OFDM block. Current standardization employs fixed CP duration irrespective of wireless channel characteristics, which is effective for channels with a long root mean-square (RMS) delay spread. However, this is impractical for industrial environments where the channel exhibits a shorter delay spread leading to a more pronounced CP overhead. Therefore, the classical problem of waveform design and optimization has to be revisited for industrial applications in the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication systems. With the understanding of wave propagation characteristics in industrial environments, in this paper, we first analyze the impact of insufficient CP duration on OFDM and subsequently derive the closed-form expressions for ISI and desired power. Then, we design a multi-objective optimization problem (OP) which determines the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CP duration conditioned on link reliability. To solve the proposed OP, we adopt the weighted-sum approach that transforms the multi-objective OP into a single-objective OP. We present numerical results for channels with various RMS delay spreads and confirm the spectral efficiency (SE) gains attainable by the proposed method with no need for additional equalization complexities.}

	abstract = {Holographic multiple-input-multiple output (HMIMO) technology, which is enabled by large-scale antenna arrays with quasi-continuous apertures, is expected to be an important technology in the forthcoming 6G wireless network. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-based antennas provide an energy-efficient solution for implementing HMIMO. Most existing works in this area focus on single-polarized RIS-enabled HMIMO, where the RIS can only reflect signals in one polarization towards users and signals in the other polarization cannot be received by intended users, leading to degraded data rate. To improve multiplexing performance, in this paper, we consider a dual-polarized RIS-enabled single-user HMIMO network, aiming to optimize power allocations across polarizations and analyze corresponding maximum system capacity. However, due to interference between different polarizations, the dual-polarized system cannot be simply decomposed into two independent single-polarized ones. Therefore, existing methods developed for the single-polarized system cannot be directly applied, which makes the optimization and analysis of the dual-polarized system challenging. To cope with this issue, we derive an asymptotically tight upper bound on the ergodic capacity, based on which the power allocations across two polarizations are optimized.

	abstract = {It is envisioned that the sixth generation (6G) and beyond 6G (B6G) wireless communication networks will enable global coverage in space, air, ground, and sea. In such networks, both base stations and users can be mobile and will tend to move continuously in three-dimensional (3D) space. Therefore, obtaining channel state information (CSI) in 3D continuous-space is crucial for the design and performance evaluation of future 6G and B6G wireless systems. On the other hand, new 6G technologies such as integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) will also require prior knowledge of CSI in 3D continuous-space. In this paper, a 3D continuous-space electromagnetic channel model is proposed for tri-polarized multi-user communications, taking into account scatterers and spherical wavefronts. Scattered fields are calculated using the method of moments (MoM) with high accuracy. Spherical wave functions are utilized to decompose the dyadic Green’s functions that connect the transmitted source currents and the received electric fields. Simulation results demonstrate that transmit power, apertures, scatterers, and sample intervals have significant impacts on statistical properties and channel capacities, providing insights into the performance of continuous-space electromagnetic channel models and the design of future wireless systems.}

	abstract = {Federated edge learning (FL) has become an unprecedented machine learning paradigm that enables distributed training across multiple edge devices without sharing their private data. Nevertheless, recent privacy eavesdropping attacks have raised severe privacy concerns, which make FL untrustworsthy and thus hinder the wide deployment of FL in emerging high-stake applications, such as vehicular networks and healthcare industry. Fortunately, differential privacy (DP) provides a flexible approach by introducing additional randomness to the released model updates so that the eavesdroppers cannot divulge any private information. However, the injected perturbation ensures privacy at the expense of learning accuracy and communication cost, yielding an accuracy-privacy-communication dilemma. In this article, we propose an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) approach to tackle the dilemma in differentially private FL, which is achieved by exploiting the reconfigurability of active RIS to address the heterogeneous wireless links and privacy concerns, as well as the waveform superposition property with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for low-latency model aggregation. We comprehensively analyze the convergence behavior and systematic privacy guarantee of the active RIS-enabled differentially private FL system, followed by proposing a two-step online power adaptation scheme to minimize the learning optimality gap while satisfying the systematic privacy and power constraints by jointly designing the transmit scalar and artificial noise at the edge devices and the reflection beamforming pattern at the active RIS. Simulation results validate our theoretical achievements and demonstrate the advancements of active RIS in addressing the accuracy-privacy-communication dilemma in differentially private FL.}

	abstract = {This paper considers reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled federated learning (FL) system, where the FL users communicate with the access point (AP) via RIS. To reveal the impact of RIS and learning rate on FL aggregation, the theoretical result of minimum global communication rounds and local iteration rounds are derived. Based on the obtained convergence results of FL, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption of the proposed RIS-assisted FL system by jointly optimizing the passive beamforming of RIS, the CPU computing frequency, the bandwidth, and the transmit power of users. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) to decompose the original problem into four sub-problems. Specifically, the closed-form solutions are derived for the CPU frequency, RIS reflection matrix, and communication bandwidth. For the transmit power sub-problem, we propose a linear approximation algorithm based on the first-order Taylor expansion to ensure solution accuracy. Finally, simulation results show that: 1) the energy consumption of the proposed RIS-assisted FL system can be greatly reduced compared to that without optimizing the passive beamforming of RIS and the transmit power; 2) The learning performance of the proposed RIS-enabled FL system is closed to the FL without wireless communication interference; and 3) The proposed algorithm can not only significantly reduce energy consumption, but also fast convergence in terms of the FL model training and testing.}

	abstract = {Distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce and Spark are often used to process large-scale data computing jobs. In wireless scenarios, exchanging data among distributed nodes would seriously suffer from the communication bottleneck due to limited communication resources such as bandwidth and power. To address this problem, we propose a coded parallel computing (CPC) scheme for distributed computing systems where distributed nodes exchange information over a half-duplex wireless interference network. The CPC scheme achieves the multicast gain by utilizing coded computing to multicast coded symbols intended to multiple receiver nodes and the cooperative transmission gain by allowing multiple transmitter nodes to jointly deliver messages via interference alignment. To measure communication performance, we apply the widely used latency-oriented metric: normalized delivery time (NDT). It is shown that CPC can significantly reduce the NDT by jointly exploiting the parallel transmission and coded multicasting opportunities. Surprisingly, when the number of computation nodes K tends to infinity and the computation load is fixed, CPC approaches zero NDT while all state-of-the-art schemes achieve positive values of NDT. Finally, we establish an information-theoretic lower bound for the NDT-computation load trade-off over the half-duplex network, and prove our scheme achieves the minimum NDT within a multiplicative gap of 3, i.e., our scheme is order optimal.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered one of the key technologies for next-generation wireless communication. To achieve satisfactory communication and sensing performance simultaneously, it is necessary to maximize compatibility with the existing communication waveform. In this paper, we mainly investigate the ISAC constellation design based on communication waveforms (random waveforms). Firstly, we derive the modulated waveform with constant modulus has a smaller side lobe of periodic auto-correlation function (PACF), i.e., the modulated waveform with constant modulus is more suitable for sensing. To improve the sensing performance of the modulated waveform with non-constant modulus, we propose a ISAC constellation design method based on PCS, which designs the power spectrum of the modulated waveform by adjusting the probabilities of constellation points, thereby reducing the side lobe of PACF. In addition, we design a joint optimization problem between the weighted variance of normalized energy and the communication information entropy (CIE) to obtain the tradeoff between communication and sensing. Finally, we simulate the communication performance and sensing performance of the reshaped waveform, and obtain some interesting conclusions. The simulation results show that, for the modulated waveform with non-constant modulus, the proposed method can reduce the side lobe of PACF, and increase the probability of detection (Pd), along with a minimal loss for CIE and a tiny growth for bit error rate (BER). This work is helpful for the theoretical exploration and system design for ISAC.}

During serving communication users, each UAV also senses targets and collaborates with the edge server to run a deep neural network (DNN) model to process the obtained sensing data for target classification. Considering that applying the fixed collaborative computation configurations for the UAVs and edge server cannot adapt to various task latency requirements and dynamic network conditions, we propose to adaptively split the DNN into two parts and execute them on the UAV and the edge server separately to realize flexible collaborative computation. We aim to maximize the average sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the user association, target assignment, DNN splitting, transmit beamforming, computation resource allocation, and UAVs’ locations, subject to the latency and accuracy requirements of sensing tasks. We apply alternating optimization algorithm to solve this complicated non-convex optimization problem. Specifically, the problem is decomposed into four subproblems, and the matching-based method, penalty dual decomposition, and successive convex approximation are leveraged to solve them. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed adaptive DNN splitting scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) assisted multi-user downlink multiple-input signal-output (MISO) multi-cellular edge caching system is investigated. The deployment of STARS enhances the coverage of base stations (BSs), particularly at cellular boundaries. However, this advancement introduces a complex user association issue that necessitates the consideration of both caching state and channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we formulate a joint optimization problem involving content caching, user association, active beamforming at BS, and passive beamforming at STARS for minimizing long-term power consumption. We propose two algorithms for the formulated problem: 1) A two time-scale cooperative twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients (TD3). Considering the distinct time scales of the pushing and delivering phases in edge caching, the Markov decision process (MDP) models of dual time scales are constructed and two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents work together to jointly address the optimization problem. 2) A bio-inspired DRL framework, especially, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-inspired TD3 algorithm is introduced in detail. Inspired by the behavior of the biological population in nature, this algorithm regards agents as individuals and enables the concurrent training of multiple agents while they interact with global information via a biological population information interaction mode, thereby enhancing the performance of power optimization. The numerical results demonstrate that the STARS-assisted multi-cellular edge caching system has advantages over traditional cellular systems, especially in scenarios where the number of mobile users and Zipf skewness factor is large. Moreover, the proposed two time-scale cooperative TD3 and PSO-inspired TD3 algorithms are superior in reducing network power consumption than conventional TD3.}

	abstract = {Bi-static sensing is crucial for exploring the potential of networked sensing capabilities in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, it suffers from the challenging clock asynchronism issue. Channel state information (CSI) ratio-based sensing is an effective means to address the issue. Its performance bounds, particular for Doppler sensing, have not been fully understood yet. This work endeavors to fill the research gap. Focusing on a single dynamic path in high-SNR scenarios, we derive the closed-form Cramér-Rao bounds (CRB). Then, through analyzing the mutual interference between dynamic and static paths, we simplify the CRB results by deriving close approximations, further unveiling new insights of the impact of numerous physical parameters on Doppler sensing. Moreover, utilizing the new CRB and analyses, we propose novel waveform optimization strategies for noise- and interference-limited sensing scenarios, which are also empowered by closed-form and efficient solutions. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the preciseness of the derived CRB results and analyses, with the aid of the maximum-likelihood estimator. The results also demonstrate the substantial enhanced Doppler sensing accuracy and the sensing capabilities for low-speed target achieved by the proposed waveform design.}

	abstract = {Spectrum sharing among the satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial components is crucial to alleviate spectrum scarcity in a hybrid maritime communication network (MCN). Fine-grained spectrum sharing based on ms-level time-domain slices is widely envisioned. However, ms-level time synchronization is challenging in the hybrid MCN due to the large diversity in the link delay. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fine-over-coarse spectrum sharing framework based on coordinated link scheduling, which is realized by joint subcarrier and time slice allocation. Specially, by link-cluster-based scheduling with grouped time slice allocation for the satellite links, time-slice-oriented spectrum sharing is realized with coarse time synchronization at time scales much larger than a single time slice duration. In the framework, only large-scale channel state information (CSI) is utilized for saving cost. A worst-case model is introduced to depict interference caused by satellite link clusters, and an NP-hard mixed integer programming (MIP) problem is formulated. Based on analysis on the characteristics of the optimal solution, a novel link clustering algorithm is proposed to form a group of shaped virtual cells within the coverage area of the MCN. A suboptimal spectrum sharing scheme with only a small performance gap to the optimal one is then proposed. Simulations show that a significant improvement in both energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency can be achieved by the proposed framework.}

In this paper, we explore a novel scenario where semantic communication is integrated with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance MEC, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. Our research focuses on addressing the resource management challenge to minimize task completion time and maximize semantic spectral efficiency (SSE) while adhering to quality of service requirements and resource constraints. Given the non-convexity of this problem and the dynamic behavior of jamming attacks, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, user associations, and channel selections against jamming. In detail, the proposed anti-jamming DRL-based resource management approach can effectively capture the jammer’s behavior, and learn to adjust semantic task and resource scheduling strategies with the objective to minimize the negative effect of jamming attacks on task offloading and semantic communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of task completion time and total SSE under different real-world settings.}

	abstract = {In the fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink beamforming relies on the acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI). Codebook based limited feedback schemes have been proposed and widely used in practice to recover the downlink CSI with low communication overhead. In such schemes, the performance of downlink beamforming is determined by the codebook design and the codebook indicator feedback. However, limited by the quantization quality of the codebook, directly utilizing the codeword indicated by the feedback as the beamforming vector cannot achieve high performance. Therefore, other feedback values, such as channel qualification indicator (CQI), should be considered to enhance beamforming. In this paper, we present the relation between CQI and the optimal beamforming vectors, based on which an empirical Bayes based intelligent tuning-free algorithm is devised to learn the optimal beamforming vector and the associated regularization parameter. The proposed algorithm can handle different communication scenarios of MIMO systems, including single stream and multiple streams data transmission scenarios. Numerical results have shown the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both beamforming vector acquisition and regularization parameter learning.}

	abstract = {Network optimization plays a crucial role in wireless communications. However, the optimization of contemporary 5G networks is challenging due to its black-box nature and huge searching space. To address these challenges, this paper introduces efficient zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms and a parallel framework for optimizing large-scale networks. By leveraging the gradient-based searching strategy, the proposed algorithms, namely ZO projected gradient descent (ZO-PGD) and ZO block coordinate projected gradient descent (ZO-BCPGD), can significantly improve optimization quality and computational efficiency. Both algorithms guarantee a convergence towards stationary points under mild conditions, eliminating inherent errors in traditional ZO methods. We further propose a parallel framework for optimizing the network parameters in a simultaneous manner. By partitioning the entire network into manageable subnetworks, the original network optimization problem is reformulated as a consensus optimization problem and tackled in parallel using the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. We have also designed a tailored size-constrained grid clustering algorithm for network partitioning to ensure load balance among parallel working nodes. The efficacy of our proposed schemes is verified by extensive numerical results. Our ZO algorithms outperform existing methods in both computational efficiency and solution quality. Moreover, the parallel framework significantly reduces execution time without sacrificing network performance.}

	abstract = {Even the artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used and significantly changed our life, deploying the large AI models on resource limited edge devices directly is not appropriate. Thus, the model split inference is proposed to improve the performance of edge intelligence (EI), in which the AI model is divided into different sub-models and the resource-intensive sub-model is offloaded to edge server wirelessly for reducing resource requirements and inference latency. Unfortunately, with the sharp increasing of edge devices, the shortage of spectrum resource in edge network becomes seriously in recent years, which limits the performance improvement of EI. Refer to the NOMA-based edge computing (EC), integrating non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology with split inference in EI is attractive. However, the NOMA-based communication aspect and the influence of intermediate data transmission fail to be considered properly in model split inference of EI in previous works, and the sophistication in resource allocation caused by NOMA scheme makes it further complicated. Thus, the Effective Communication and Computing resource allocation algorithm is proposed in this paper for accelerating the split inference in NOMA-based EI, shorted as ECC. Specifically, the ECC takes the energy consumption and the inference latency into account to find the optimal model split strategy and resource allocation strategy (subchannel, transmission power, computing resource). Since the minimum inference delay and energy consumption cannot be satisfied simultaneously, the gradient descent (GD) based algorithm is adopted to find the optimal tradeoff between them. Moreover, the loop iteration GD approach (Li-GD) is developed to reduce the complexity of the GD algorithm caused by parameter discretization. The key idea of Li-GD is that: the initial value of the i\\mathrm {th}\nlayer’s GD procedure is selected from the optimal results of the former (i-1)\nlayers’ GD procedure whose intermediate data size is the closest to i\\mathrm {th}\nlayer. Additionally, the properties of the proposed algorithms are investigated, including convergence, complexity, and approximation error. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of ECC is much better than that of the previous studies.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective solution for green communications in 6G. However, its further extensive use has been greatly limited due to its fully passive characteristics. Considering the appealing distribution gains of distributed antenna systems (DAS), a flexible reconfigurable architecture called reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is proposed. RDARS encompasses DAS and RIS as two special cases and maintains the advantages of distributed antennas while reducing the hardware cost by replacing some active antennas with low-cost passive reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we present a RDARS-aided uplink multi-user communication system and investigate the system transmission reliability with the newly proposed architecture. Specifically, in addition to the distribution gain and the reflection gain provided by the connection and reflection modes, respectively, we also consider the dynamic mode switching of each element which introduces an additional degree of freedom (DoF) and thus results in a selection gain. As such, we aim to minimize the total sum mean-square-error (MSE) of all data streams by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming matrix, the reflection phase shifts and the channel-aware placement of elements in the connection mode. To tackle this nonconvex problem with intractable binary and cardinality constraints, we propose an inexact block coordinate descent (BCD) based penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with the guaranteed convergence. Since the PDD algorithm usually suffers from high computational complexity, a low-complexity greedy-search-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed to yield a semi-closed-form solution with acceptable performance. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture compared to the conventional fully passive RIS or DAS. Furthermore, some insights about the practical implementation of RDARS are provided.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of a single-user fluid antenna system (FAS), by exploiting a class of elliptical copulas to describe the dependence structure amongst the fluid antenna positions (ports). By expressing the well-known Jakes’ model in terms of the Gaussian copula, we consider two cases: (i) the general case, i.e., any arbitrary correlated fading distribution; and (ii) the specific case, i.e., correlated Nakagami-m fading. For both scenarios, we first derive analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the equivalent channel in terms of multivariate normal distribution. Then we obtain the outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR) to analyze the performance of FAS. By employing the popular rank correlation coefficients such as Spearman’s \\rho and Kendall’s \\tau , we measure the degree of dependency in correlated arbitrary fading channels and illustrate how the Gaussian copula can be accurately connected to Jakes’ model in FAS. Our numerical results demonstrate that increasing the size of FAS provides lower OP and DOR, but the system performance saturates as the number of antenna ports increases. In addition, our results indicate that FAS provides better performance compared to conventional single-fixed antenna systems even when the size of fluid antenna is small.}

	abstract = {Users’ behaviors in wireless metaverse networks are usually affected by the surrounding people and limited network resources. How to allocate network resources in a human-centric way remains an open problem in wireless metaverse scenarios. To capture the psychological influence of bandwagon effects on users’ behaviors, we first propose bandwagon effect-based metaverse behavior metrics, including the metaverse bandwagon threshold and metaverse bandwagon probability, based on the multi-dimensional contract theory. The bandwagon effect-based metaverse behavior metrics are used to quantify the number of service adopters, which consider both users’ behaviors and resource allocation strategies. Moreover, the metaverse behavior utility is derived for wireless metaverse networks based on the multi-attribute utility theory. To solve the metaverse behavior utility maximization problem, a bandwagon effect optimal transport-based (BEOT) algorithm is proposed to optimize the resource allocation strategies considering users’ behavior characteristics. Compared with the maximum metaverse behavior utility of virtual reality tracking-based resource allocation (VRT), soft actor-critic with graph convolutional networks (SAC-GCN) and the deep Q-learning-based (DQL) algorithms, simulation results show that the maximum metaverse behavior utility of proposed BEOT algorithm is improved by 22.55%, 12.36% and 18.21%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is widely recognized as a fundamental enabler for future wireless communications. In this paper, we present a joint communication and radar beamforming framework for maximizing a sum spectral efficiency (SE) while guaranteeing desired radar performance with imperfect channel state information (CSI) in multi-user and multi-target ISAC systems. To this end, we adopt either a radar transmit beam mean square error (MSE) or receive signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) as a radar performance constraint of a sum SE maximization problem. To resolve inherent challenges such as non-convexity and imperfect CSI, we reformulate the problems and identify first-order optimality conditions for the joint radar and communication beamformer. Turning the condition to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv), we develop an alternating method which finds the joint beamformer through power iteration and a Lagrangian multiplier through binary search. The proposed framework encompasses both the radar metrics and is robust to channel estimation error with low complexity. Simulations validate the proposed methods. In particular, we observe that the MSE and SCNR constraints exhibit complementary performance depending on the operating environment, which manifests the importance of the proposed comprehensive and robust optimization framework.}

With the assistance of Digital Twin (DT), a real-time understanding of physical entities can be constructed for dynamic perception and decision-making. However, DT modeling requires distributed data aggregation, resulting in privacy disclosure and communication burden. Therefore, we propose the digital twin edge network by integrating the DT technology and edge computing, which leverages an over-the-air computation enabled federated learning architecture for an efficient and secure DT model construction. Specifically, we propose a heterogeneity-aware and energy-conscious device scheduling mechanism, considering the update importance, channel condition, and computation capacity based on a probabilistic scheduling framework. To enhance energy efficiency, we introduce a virtual queue to track the difference between the cumulative energy consumption and budget. Additionally, we design a low-complexity scheduling algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results validate the superiority of our proposed mechanism in improving the test accuracy and energy efficiency in a heterogeneous and energy-constrained environment. Moreover, the proposed mechanism demonstrates significant advantages when employed to highly heterogeneous datasets, and exhibits a certain level of robustness to mapping errors arising from the utilization of DT technique.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the joint resource allocation and trajectory design for a multi-user, multi-target unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the link capacity between a ground base station (BS) and the UAV is limited. The UAV conducts target sensing and information transmission in orthogonal time slots to prevent interference. As is common in practical systems, sensing is performed while the UAV hovers, allowing the UAV to acquire high-quality sensing data. Subsequently, the acquired sensing data is offloaded to the ground BS for further processing. We jointly optimize the UAV trajectory, UAV velocity, beamforming for the communication users, power allocated to the sensing beam, and time of hovering for sensing to minimize the power consumption of the UAV while ensuring the communication quality of service (QoS) and successful sensing. Due to the prohibitively high complexity of the resulting non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), we employ a series of transformations and optimization techniques, including semidefinite relaxation, big-M method, penalty approach, and successive convex approximation, to obtain a low-complexity suboptimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that 1) the proposed design achieves significant power savings compared to two baseline schemes; 2) stricter sensing requirements lead to longer sensing times, highlighting the challenge of efficiently managing both sensing accuracy and sensing time; 3) the optimized trajectory design ensures precise hovering directly above the targets during sensing, enhancing sensing quality and enabling the application of energy-focused beams; and 4) the proposed trajectory design balances the capacity of the backhaul link and the downlink rate of the communication users.}

	abstract = {To meet the growing demand for joint data and energy transmission, research on wireless information and power transfer is being promoted. The resonant beam enabled information and power transfer (RBIPT), which supports long-distance, high-power, and wide-bandwidth information and power transfer, has sparked widespread interest. The point-to-multipoint RBIPT system shows great promise for enabling simultaneous RBIPT for multiple receivers. However, the enabling system architecture has not been well studied in the literature, which is holding back the system implementation. To solve this problem, we propose a time division multiplexing RBIPT (TDM-RBIPT) system for multiple access, and constract a novel metric to evaluate the information and power transfer performance. We explore the TDM-RBIPT mechanism and design the architectures of the transmitter and the receiver. For the information transfer performance evaluation, we take system latency and throughput into consideration. We propose to estimate the system delay with the martingale theory by modeling the dynamic data processing procedures as Markovian processes with the markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) method. To evaluate the power transmission performance, we consider the transmitter’s power costs and the receivers’ power benefits. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed TDM-RBIPT system and validate the accuracy of the proposed metric.}

	abstract = {In cognitive radio (CR) networks, non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) is a widely adopted overlay-based CR technique. However, it suffers from serious performance degradation in high-speed mobile environments due to its susceptibility to high Doppler shifts, a vulnerability inherited from OFDM. To overcome this drawback, we introduce non-contiguous orthogonal time frequency space (NC-OTFS). Unlike OFDM, OTFS spreads data symbols across all sub-carriers using the inverse symplectic finite fourier transform (ISFFT), making it challenging to deactivate unwanted sub-carriers. To address this issue, we propose two types of NC-OTFS schemes: Type 1, which generates individual OTFS signals for each disjoint contiguous sub-carrier block, and Type 2, which creates a single OTFS signal across all available non-contiguous sub-carrier blocks to achieve the maximum frequency diversity. Furthermore, we present an enhanced time domain block minimum mean squared error (MMSE) demodulation algorithm to mitigate primary user (PU) interference in the proposed NC-OTFS receivers. In addition, we provide an implementation of Type 2 NC-OTFS transceiver by adding simple pre-processing and post-processing steps to the conventional OTFS transceiver, which allows reusing all the transceiver algorithms for the conventional OTFS. Numerical results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed NC-OTFS over the conventional NC-OFDM, especially in high Doppler environments.}

To optimize the average delay while satisfying the deterministic delay constraint, initial transmission and retransmission should be handled with different priorities due to the differentiated urgency, which creates complex interdependency and brings new technical challenges to delay-oriented optimization. In this paper, we propose a retransmission-aware adaptive modulation and coding (RAMC) scheme to improve the delay performance in URLLC scenarios. Specifically, we first establish a cascaded queue system, including an initial transmission queue and a retransmission queue. The deterministic delay constraint is satisfied through Lyapunov optimization, where we transform the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty problem into an infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) by constructing a renewal system with sampling to overcome the challenge brought by queue coupling. Next, we propose the delay-optimal RAMC scheme by solving the associated Bellman equation by improved reinforcement learning, which is proved to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, the superiority of the proposed RAMC scheme is verified through simulations.}

The proposed algorithm for the NOMA network solves each subproblem using either a convex optimization solver or a closed-form expression with the help of with the help of fractional programming. For TDMA networks, we develop a more computationally efficient algorithm than the conventional algorithm for the TDMA network. The results show that active IRS is more effective than passive IRS with a moderate number of IRS elements for MISO WPCNs.

The receiver evaluates the polynomial constructed by the elements of the superposed sequence at conjugate-reciprocal zero pairs and detects the MV with a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. With differential and index-based encoders, we eliminate the need for power-delay information at the receiver while improving the computation error rate (CER) performance. The proposed methods do not use instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters and receiver. Thus, they provide robustness against phase and time synchronization errors. We theoretically analyze the CERs of the proposed methods. Finally, we demonstrate their efficacy in a distributed median computation scenario.}

	abstract = {Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) offers a new paradigm for the design and deployment of future RANs. The unique architecture of O-RAN presents two main challenges when designing a scheduler. First, it is impractical to obtain accurate and full Channel State Information (CSI) due to estimation errors and limited bandwidth of the fronthaul link between Open Radio Unit (O-RU) and Open Distributed Unit (O-DU). Second, the large-scale processing at an O-DU introduces difficulties in meeting the stringent time requirement in O-RAN, especially in the real-time (RT) control loop. To address these challenges, we propose R3—a real-time robust Multi-user, Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) scheduler for O-RAN. R3 serves as a comprehensive scheduling solution encompassing RB allocation, MCS selection, and beamforming calculation. Most notably, R3 utilizes a limited number of CSI samples to offer probabilistic QoS guarantees. To meet the timing requirements of O-RAN, R3 decomposes the scheduling problem into two distinct sub-problems and integrates them into separate control loops. Moreover, each sub-problem is designed with a parallel structure, utilizing a reduced search space, and implemented on a GPU platform to accelerate the computation time. Experimental results demonstrate that R3 offers competitive throughput performance as the state-of-the-art while simultaneously fulfilling the QoS guarantees. Further, R3 meets the timing requirements of various control loops in O-RAN over a wide range of operating conditions.}

Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that increasing the spatial degree of freedom (DoF) and deploying antennas more dispersedly can realize latency reduction while guaranteeing the system performance, and the joint collaboration of multi-users and multiple access points (APs) with large DoFs can achieve a continuous increase in SE and data rate.}

	abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) parameter plays a crucial role in wireless link prediction models such as Ray-tracing (RT), to shape and predict the effect of environmental materials on the characteristics of received signals. The use of field wireless measurements is a direct solution to sense EM parameters of materials. The locations of the field measurements have a significant effect on sensing and calibration performance of EM parameters. In this paper, a data collection algorithm is proposed to plan the measured locations of the field wireless measurement. Specifically, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning scheme for path loss data collection within a limited time to enhance the sensing and calibration of permittivity. The proposed algorithm is designed from two aspects simultaneously to enhance the sensing of permittivity: the detection of estimate-able permittivity parameters from the collected data, and the expected Cramér-Rao lower boundary (CRLB) of the detected permittivity parameters. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in reducing the expected CRLB and detecting the permittivity parameters. Furthermore, these offline trajectories are validated in a simulation scenario, which demonstrates the benefits in estimating permittivity parameters, and the gain from sensing results in path loss prediction.}

	abstract = {Multi-band radiomap reconstruction (MB-RMR) is a key component in wireless communications for tasks such as spectrum management and network planning. However, traditional machine-learning-based MB-RMR methods, which rely heavily on simulated data or complete structured ground truth, face significant deployment challenges. These challenges stem from the differences between simulated and actual data, as well as the scarcity of real-world measurements. To address these challenges, our study presents RadioGAT, a novel framework based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) tailored for MB-RMR within a single area, eliminating the need for multi-region datasets. RadioGAT innovatively merges model-based spatial-spectral correlation encoding with data-driven radiomap generalization, thus minimizing the reliance on extensive data sources. The framework begins by transforming sparse multi-band data into a graph structure through an innovative encoding strategy that leverages radio propagation models to capture the spatial-spectral correlation inherent in the data. This graph-based representation not only simplifies data handling but also enables tailored label sampling during training, significantly enhancing the framework’s adaptability for deployment. Subsequently, The GAT is employed to generalize the radiomap information across various frequency bands. Extensive experiments using raytracing datasets based on real-world environments have demonstrated RadioGAT’s enhanced accuracy in supervised learning settings and its robustness in semi-supervised scenarios. These results underscore RadioGAT’s effectiveness and practicality for MB-RMR in environments with limited data availability.}

Ray tracing (RT)-based methods have been widely used for many years, but they require significant computational effort that may become prohibitive with the increased network densification and/or use of higher frequencies in B5G/6G systems. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, model-free pathloss map prediction (PMP) method, called PMNet. PMNet uses a supervised learning approach: it is trained on a limited amount of RT data and map data. Once trained, PMNet can predict pathloss over location with high accuracy (an RMSE level of 10^{-2} ) in a few milliseconds. We further extend PMNet by employing transfer learning (TL). TL allows PMNet to learn a new network scenario quickly ( \\times 5.6 faster training) and efficiently (using \\times 4.5 less data) by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model, while retaining accuracy. Our results demonstrate that PMNet is a scalable and generalizable ML-based PMP method, showing its potential to be used in several network optimization applications.}

	abstract = {As a revolutionary paradigm for green ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been considered as a prominent architecture for enabling next-generation communication systems. Recently, a novel RIS framework, called simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR-RIS), has been proposed to facilitate both transmission and reflection through the meta-material surface, leading to full-space coverage and even better beamforming flexibility than conventional RIS. This paper investigates an energy-efficient resource allocation design scheme for a STAR-RIS-aided downlink system under various STAR-RIS modes to deliver energy-efficient URLLC services by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the base station (BS) and STAR-RIS, subject to the given requirements on the rate, packet-error probability, and latency. Owing to the non-convex and NP-hard nature of the formulated problem, we propose an alternating optimization framework that obtains suboptimal solutions to the problems of beamforming design at the BS and STAR-RIS, respectively, in an iterative manner by exploiting fractional programming and successive convex approximation approaches. Simulation results confirm that the TS, ES, and MS modes of STAR-RIS achieve approximately 30\\%-50\\% , 20\\%-40\\% , and 10\\%-15\\% , respectively better performance than a conventional reflecting-only RIS while guaranteeing strict reliability and latency requirements of URLLC. Specifically, among all the possible modes of STAR-RIS, the time-splitting mode renders an effective solution due to its better interference management.}

	abstract = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a promising modulation scheme for wireless communication in high-mobility scenarios. Recently, a reservoir computing (RC) based approach has been introduced for online subframe-based symbol detection in the OTFS system, where only a limited number of over-the-air (OTA) pilot symbols are utilized for training. However, this approach does not leverage the domain knowledge specific to the OTFS system to fully unlock the potential of RC. This paper introduces a novel two-dimensional RC (2D-RC) method that incorporates the domain knowledge of the OTFS system into the design for symbol detection in an online subframe-based manner. Specifically, as the channel interaction in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain is a two-dimensional (2D) circular operation, the 2D-RC is designed to have the 2D circular padding procedure and the 2D filtering structure to embed this knowledge. With the introduced architecture, 2D-RC can operate in the DD domain with only a single neural network, instead of necessitating multiple RCs to track channel variations in the time domain as in previous work. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the 2D-RC approach over the previous RC-based approach and compared model-based methods across different OTFS system variants and modulation orders.}

	abstract = {A robust transmission scheme for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided cognitive radio systems is designed to provide security against internal eavesdropping. By considering the secondary receiver as an internal eavesdropper, a total transmit power (TTP) minimization problem is formulated. Through a novel optimization strategy which jointly considers the transmit beamforming vector at the primary transmitter, the transmit beamforming vector at the secondary transmitter and the phase shifts at the IRS, a solution to the formulated problem is presented. By considering perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI scenarios, two optimization algorithms are proposed both aiming at reducing the TTP. For the former scenario, instead of applying the commonly used inner approximation (IA) algorithm which cannot handle maximum allowable leaked rate constraint, a novel penalty-based IA algorithm is proposed. For the latter scenario, a non-convex robust optimization problem is formulated. Because of its non-convex nature, a novel upper-bounding technique and S-procedure are used to transform it into a more tractable form which is then solved by deriving of a penalty convex-concave procedure based alternating optimization algorithm. Performance results show that, as compared to other baseline schemes, the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the TTP.}

	abstract = {We examine federated learning (FL) with over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, where mobile users (MUs) aim to reach a consensus on a global model with the help of a parameter server (PS) that aggregates the local gradients. In OTA FL, MUs train their models using local data at every training round and transmit their gradients simultaneously using the same frequency band in an uncoded fashion. Based on the received signal of the superposed gradients, the PS performs a global model update. While the OTA FL has a significantly decreased communication cost, it is susceptible to adverse channel effects and noise. Employing multiple antennas at the receiver side can reduce these effects, yet the path-loss is still a limiting factor for users located far away from the PS. To ameliorate this issue, in this paper, we propose a wireless-based hierarchical FL scheme that uses intermediate servers (ISs) to form clusters in the areas where the MUs are more densely located. Our scheme utilizes OTA cluster aggregations for the communication of the MUs with their corresponding IS, and OTA global aggregations from the ISs to the PS. We present a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm, and show through numerical evaluations of the derived analytical expressions and experimental results that utilizing ISs results in a faster convergence and a better performance than the OTA FL alone while using less transmit power. We also validate the results on the performance using different numbers of cluster iterations with different datasets and data distributions. We conclude that the best choice of cluster aggregations depends on the data distribution among the MUs and the clusters.}

In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted SEI system, in which the legitimate emitter installs an RIS to customize the wireless link signature by controlling the ON-OFF state of RIS. Specifically, we consider the worst-case that the legitimate and a suspicious emitter are in the same spatial location. The received signal strength (RSS) of the specific emitter is adopted to analyze the feasibility of the proposed system. Then, we derive the statistical properties of this wireless link signature, and find the interesting insights about the phase-shift matrix configuration and the signal-to-noise-rate (SNR) gain, which showcase the huge potential of the proposed system on the integrated communications and security (ICAS) design in the near future. Afterwards, we derive the optimal detection threshold in the context of the presented metrics. Next, considering the acquisition difficulty of the RSS samples of the suspicious emitter, we use a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) to identify the specific emitter. Finally, the actual feasibility of the proposed system is verified via proof-of-concept experiments. The experiment results show that there are 76% and 99% performance improvements for the test statistic based and the OC-SVM based RIS-assisted SEI, respectively.}

	abstract = {This work studies the unsourced random access (URA) problem via random dictionary learning over Rayleigh block-fading channels with multiple receive antennas. We propose a novel pilot-free URA equipped with a concatenated URA coding structure enabled by on-off patterns. The inherent collision problem in URA is mitigated with slotted encoding structure. Other problems of state-of-the-arts such as low code rate and inefficient transmission are well-tackled. Distinctively, activity detection is not only accomplished in the original pilot-free manner but also enhanced with softer verdict. Facing the potential false alarm (FA) error, a joint channel pruning and dictionary learning procedure maintains FA under a low level. The learning process updates the noise variance of pseudo noise with explicit models to obtain channel estimation. Subsequently, for the first time, this work realizes joint on-off pattern detection and data restoration for on-off division multiple access (ODMA) under multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). Also, a successive interference cancellation (SIC) structure is adopted as an iterative approach to produce desirable performance. Moreover, we analyze the approximation of error ceiling and the performance lower-bound determined by feasible deterministic parameters. Finally, numerical simulations with fair comparisons validate the viability of the proposed URA scheme.}

Meanwhile, the proposed turbo PDA detector can also cooperate with the CC-LDPC decoder. A sliding window decoding structure is embedded in the proposed receiver. Moreover, given that permeable collision in URA can undermine the system performance, this paper treats collision as interference and elaborates different slot-wise MUD signal models combining the feature of random scattering, based on which a collision resolution procedure is proposed. Empirically, the proposed scheme shows faster system performance convergence and more accurate MUD performance than the IDMA kind. Numerical results with fair comparisons validate the viability of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {As one of the indoor communication technologies, visible light communication (VLC) has drawn great attention for its advantages such as ultra-wide unlicensed spectrum, power saving and low complexity. The nature of the visible light propagation is an open channel, which is vulnerable to wiretapping. This paper investigates a secure VLC mechanism enabled by multiple light fixtures acting as friendly jammers. The goal of the friendly jammers is to diminish the capability of the eavesdropper to infer the undisclosed information, on the premise of causing minimal impact on the legitimate receiver. For this reason, an algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed to dynamically optimize the friendly jamming policy in realistic nonstationary environments. In order to resolve the difficult problem of the dimensional curse and to effectively represent the continuous state and action spaces, an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is devised, which utilizes deep convolutional neural networks to accelerate the convergence rate of the learning process. A differentiable neural dictionary is introduced to make full use of the experiences in similar anti-eavesdropping scenarios to improve the learning capability. Simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed schemes can achieve a higher secrecy rate and a lower bit error rate than some state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {This work proposes a maximum likelihood (ML)- based parameter estimation framework for a millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a multistatic configuration using energy-efficient hybrid digital-analog (HDA) arrays. Due to the typically large arrays deployed in the higher frequency bands to mitigate isotropic path loss, such arrays may operate in the near-field (NF) regime. The proposed parameter estimation in this work consists of a two-stage estimation process, where the first stage is based on far-field (FF) assumptions, and is used to obtain a first estimate of the target parameters. In cases where the target is determined to be in the NF of the arrays, a second estimation based on NF assumptions is carried out to obtain more accurate estimates. In particular, when operating in the near-filed of the transmitter (Tx), we select beamfocusing array weights designed to achieve a constant gain over an extended spatial region and re-estimate the target parameters at the receivers (Rxs). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in numerous scenarios through numerical simulations and demonstrate the impact of the custom-designed flat-gain beamfocusing codewords in increasing the communication performance of the system.}

	abstract = {We propose a framework to evaluate the so-called random-coding union bound with parameter s (RCUs) on the achievable error probability in the finite-blocklength regime for a pilot-assisted transmission scheme operating over an imperfectly synchronized and memoryless block-fading waveform channel. Unlike previous results, which disregard the effects of imperfect synchronization, our framework utilizes pilots for both synchronization and channel estimation. Specifically, we provide an algorithm to perform joint synchronization and channel estimation, and verify its accuracy by observing its tightness in comparison with the Cramer-Rao bound. Then, we develop an RCUs bound on the error probability, which applies for a receiver that treats the estimates provided by the algorithm as accurate. Additionally, we utilize the saddlepoint approximation to provide a numerically efficient method for evaluating the RCUs bound in this scenario. Our numerical experiments verify the accuracy of the proposed approximation. Moreover, when the delays are modeled as fully dependent across fading blocks, numerical results indicate that the number of pilot symbols needed to estimate the fading channel gains to the level of accuracy required in ultra-reliable low-latency communication is also sufficient to acquire sufficiently good synchronization. However, when the delays are modeled as independent across blocks, synchronization becomes the bottleneck for the system performance.}

	abstract = {For the two new functions that will be deployed at 6G wireless network edge, namely radio sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) inference, it is challenging to simultaneously boost the dual-functional performance due to their intrinsic conflict and resource competition. Meanwhile, to promote ubiquitous connectivity in 6G, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as representative aerial platforms for service enhancement. This paper investigates a UAV-enabled joint AI inference and target tracking system, where multiple terminals transmit local features to the UAV for edge inference, while the UAV is able to track mobile target by emitting sensing signals. Although these two functions are performed in a time division manner, we propose a contribution-based feature selection and transmission control strategy, which enables the terminals to transmit fewer features to achieve the desired inference accuracy, thereby releasing more resources for target tracking. Additionally, a tracking Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) minimization problem is established to jointly optimize the UAV trajectory and beamforming, under the constraints of AI inference uncertainty requirements. To tackle this intractable issue, we develop a hybrid offline-online approach which optimizes an offline trajectory to ensure statistically favorable feature transmission, followed by an online adaptation that adjusts the UAV velocity and beamforming exploiting the real-time estimated target state. Simulation results corroborate the outstanding performance of our approach compared to benchmark methods. Besides, interesting tradeoffs resulted from the hybrid design are elucidated.}

For a practical consideration, the observation information of the UAVs is limited, and has the risk of obsolescence, under the limited battery life. The considered optimization problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which includes the discrete on-off variables of collection, radar, communication and movement, and the continuous variables of the transmit power, UAV flying direction and velocity. For solving the problem, we propose a multi-agent hybrid proximal policy with reward shaping and pre-training optimization algorithm (MAHPPO-RSP). In particular, the proposed algorithm is performed through a two-step training way of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, upon introducing both human experience and autonomous learning. The provided results show that the proposed MAHPPO-RSP algorithm exhibits a stable convergence manner. Furthermore, it obtains a promising trade-off between data collection and energy consumption, outperforming two baseline schemes.}

	abstract = {Recently, significant progress has been made in deep learning, which has been widely applied in automatic modulation classification (AMC) with remarkable outcomes. However, current deep learning based AMC (DL-AMC) algorithms show limitations in their ability to accommodate dynamically changing communication scenarios. With the increasing number of modulation types, most DL-AMC algorithms often need to be re-trained, making it hard to transfer previous knowledge to the new models. Also, modulation classification faces the difficulty of acquiring and annotating a large number of signals. To address these challenges, we have modeled a few-shot class-incremental AMC (FSCI-AMC) task and proposed a pseudo classes and stochastic classifiers-based network (PASS-Net) to accomplish it. Firstly, the pseudo classes are generated to reserve space for new types, enhancing the model’s continuous learning capability. Additionally, stochastic classifiers ensure the reliability of generated pseudo classes. Finally, in the incremental session, both real and pseudo classes are used for modulation classification. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on 7 modulation types as base classes and another 7 modulation types as incremental classes. The results show superior performance in 7 sessions of 1-way 1-shot and 1-way 5-shot class-incremental experiments compared to other competitive methods.}

For EIT, the research foundation is reasonable and accurate channel modeling. Existing channel modeling works for EIT in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario focus on far-field modeling, which can not accurately capture the characteristics of the channel in near field. In this paper, we propose the near-field channel modeling scheme for EIT based on electromagnetic scattering theory. We model the channel by using non-stationary Gaussian random fields and derive the analytical expression of the correlation function of the random fields. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the proposed channel model, e.g., channel degrees of freedom (DoF). Finally, we design a channel estimation scheme for near-field scenario by integrating the electromagnetic prior information of the proposed model. Numerical analysis verifies the correctness of the proposed scheme and shows that it can outperform existing schemes like least square (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).}

	abstract = {This paper studies a networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where distributed base stations (BSs) implement coordinated transmit beamforming to communicate with their respective user and cooperatively perform multi-static target sensing. To fully reap the performance gains provided by the networked ISAC system, accurate channel state information (CSI) and time synchronization (TS) among distributed BSs are crucial. However, CSI errors and TS errors are inevitable in practice due to the imperfect channel training and the inaccurate synchronization. To reveal the effect of CSI errors on communication, a Gaussian distributed CSI error model is formulated based on the channel estimation process, and accordingly, the users’ achievable rates with CSI errors are derived. To characterize the effect of TS errors on multi-static sensing, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for estimating target position in the presence of TS errors is derived. It is shown that due to the existence of CSI errors and TS errors, additional terms are introduced in the achievable rate and CRLB formulas, degrading the communication and sensing performance, respectively. Based on the above derivations, we aim at maximizing the sum-rate of users by designing the coordinated transmit beamforming at the BSs, while guaranteeing the CRLB requirements for target sensing. In particular, we consider two cases with and without TS errors, for which the corresponding non-convex optimization problems are solved via a penalty-based algorithm and an alternating optimization algorithm, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform benchmark schemes for both cases with and without CSI/TS errors, thus validating the robustness in ISAC performance optimization.}

In particular, we consider an active eavesdropping attack, where an eavesdropper contaminates the uplink channel estimation phase by sending an identical pilot sequence with a legitimate user of interest. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) at the legitimate user, subject to a maximum allowable SINR at the eavesdropper and maximum transmit power at each AP, while guaranteeing specific SINR requirements on other legitimate users. The optimization problem is solved using a path-following algorithm. We also propose a large-scale-based greedy AP selection scheme to improve the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE). Finally, we propose a simple method for identifying the presence of an eavesdropper within the system. Our findings show that PPZF can substantially outperform the conventional maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) scheme by providing around 2-fold improvement in the SSE compared to the MRT scheme. More importantly, for PPZF precoding scheme, our proposed AP selection can achieve a remarkable SSE gain of up to 220%, while our power optimization approach can provide an additional gain of up to 55% compared with a CF-mMIMO system with equal power allocation.}

Then, simultaneous indoor-and-outdoor communication (SIOC) has been commonly regarded as one of the most evident and promising applications of STAR-RIS in the next generation wireless networks. However, it introduces intricate interference for wireless networks, i.e., transmission and reflection interference, which would impact the network coverage and transmission capacity drastically. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of research investigating STAR-RIS-enabled SIOC from a network-level perspective. To fill the gap, by leveraging stochastic geometry, we provide the first comprehensive analytical framework for STAR-RIS-enabled SIOC networks. We investigate three commonly used STAR-RIS protocols, i.e., energy splitting (ES), time switching (TS) and mode switching (MS), and consider both unicast communication (UC) and multicast communication (MC) schemes. Exact and approximate expressions of transmission success probability and transmission capacity are derived. Furthermore, we also optimize the key parameters of STAR-RIS protocols to maximize the transmission capacity. Finally, via simulations, the accuracy of theoretical expressions is confirmed, the optimization of the key parameters is investigated, and the advantages of STAR-RIS over conventional RISs are also demonstrated. Moreover, we also conclude the recommended STAR-RIS protocols to UC and MC schemes, respectively.}

	abstract = {Symbiotic radio (SR) offers potential benefits for large-scale Internet of Things networks through its spectrum and resource-sharing capabilities between primary and secondary systems. However, in high-mobility scenarios, rapidly changing channels present significant challenges for reliable and low-latency SR communications. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes employing orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation for SR systems in hostile environments. By processing signals in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the fast-varying channels can be efficiently characterized using a few quasi-static DD domain parameters. To enable joint primary and secondary transmissions in SR, we propose modulating primary information using phase-shift keying modulation, while the secondary information is modulated into the frequencies of the periodic rectangular wave. However, the time-varying secondary signals are intertwined with unknown DD-domain channels, making it difficult to differentiate between secondary information and the original channel state information (CSI). To overcome this challenge, we introduce coherent detection methods for secondary information using both amplitude-based and sparsity-based techniques, leveraging the spectral characteristics of signal combinations with different frequencies. Moreover, recognizing that the periodic rectangular wave of the secondary transmission would reshape the Doppler profile of the equivalent channel in a highly structured manner, we propose an off-grid structured-sparse Bayesian learning-based CSI estimator. With the obtained equivalent CSI, we propose a low-complexity symbol-wise detection algorithm for detecting primary information, leveraging the pilot guards and interference cancellation technique. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed estimator and detector.}

	abstract = {In task-oriented communications, most existing work designed the physical-layer communication modules and learning based codecs with distinct objectives: learning is targeted at accurate execution of specific tasks, while communication aims at optimizing conventional communication metrics, such as throughput maximization, delay minimization, or bit error rate minimization. The inconsistency between the design objectives may hinder the exploitation of the full benefits of task-oriented communications. In this paper, we consider a task-oriented multi-device edge inference system over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access channel, where the learning (i.e., feature encoding and classification) and communication (i.e., precoding) modules are designed with the same goal of inference accuracy maximization. Instead of end-to-end learning which involves both the task dataset and wireless channel during training, we advocate a separate design of learning and communication to achieve the consistent goal. Specifically, we leverage the maximal coding rate reduction (MCR2) objective as a surrogate to represent the inference accuracy, which allows us to explicitly formulate the precoding optimization problem. We cast valuable insights into this formulation and develop a block coordinate ascent (BCA) algorithm for efficient problem-solving. Moreover, the MCR2 objective serves the loss function for feature encoding and guides the classification design. Simulation results on the synthetic features explain the mechanism of MCR2 precoding at different SNRs. We also validate on the CIFAR-10 and ModelNet10 datasets that the proposed design achieves a better latency-accuracy tradeoff compared to various baselines with inconsistent learning-communication objectives. As such, our work paves the way for further exploration into the synergistic alignment of learning and communication objectives in task-oriented communication systems.}

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has emerged as a paradigm distinguished by its energy-efficient attributes and low-power dynamics, ideally suited to address the vast expanse of the Internet of Things (IoT). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed with flexibility can effectively establish wireless connections for isolated IoT devices through AmBC. This paper delves into the exploration of secure transmission within a UAV-assisted AmBC network, particularly addressing the challenges posed by the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Specifically, a UAV is utilized as an aerial base station to offer services to an isolated ground user, an AmBC tag transmits its information to its associated receivers by leveraging the UAV’s radio frequency (RF) signals. Furthermore, a multi-antenna cooperative jammer is integrated within the system to intentionally interfere with the eavesdropper without affecting legitimate receivers. To characterize the secrecy performance, the expressions of secrecy outage probability of the air-ground link and backscatter link are both deduced leveraging a two-layer Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature. Moreover, the asymptotic behaviors under the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are also analyzed. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the analytical results.}

	abstract = {Driven by the widespread applications of Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) in a number of practical fields, the volume of space data grows rapidly. However, the large volume of space data in SAGINs is typically intractable to be offloaded from space to the ground under the high dynamic network topology and the stochastic data arrivals. Furthermore, most nodes in SAGINs are battery-powered and energy-constrained, thereby implying that energy consumption becomes one major bottleneck for data offloading. Towards this end, this paper studies online joint data offloading and power control in SAGINs to maximize long-term time-averaged data offloaded amount under the constraints of average energy consumption. First, we propose a novelty Two-timescale Time-Expanded Graph (TTEG) to characterize the rapid change of the network topology in large-timescale slots and capture the stochastic data arrivals in small-timescale slots. Based the TTEG model, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem and transform it into a series of per-time-slot subproblems to obtain an efficient online solution. Through theoretical analyses, we show that the performance gap with optimal solution is bounded. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the maximum performance gap of our proposed online solution to the optimal solution is less than 2% in a low computation cost.}

	abstract = {Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) emphasizes the integrated robotic, artificial intelligence computing, and communication technologies, enabling more sophisticated operations and decision-making. As a crucial element of IoRT, mission-critical applications, such as industrial manufacturing and emergency services, impose stringent requirements on ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). The paper focuses on addressing URLLC challenges in the context of IoRT, particularly when autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) coexist with static sensors. We prioritize safe and efficient AMRs’ travel through trajectory design and communication resource allocation in IoRT systems without the need of any prior knowledge. To enhance network connectivity and exploit diversity gains, we introduce the flexible decoding and free clustering as the next-generation multiple access technologies in spectrum-limited downlink IoRT system. Then, aiming at minimizing the decoding error probability and travel time, we formulate a long-term multi-objective optimization problem by jointly designing AMRs’ trajectory and communication resource. To accommodate the inherent dynamics and unpredictability in the IoRT system, we introduce a multi-agent actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, offering four distinct implementations, each accompanied by comprehensive complexity analyses. Simulation results reveal the following insights: 1) in terms of DRL implementations, off-policy algorithms with deterministic policies outperform their on-policy counterparts, achieving approximately a 67% increase in rewards; 2) In terms of communication schemes, our proposed flexible decoding and free clustering strategies under designed trajectories can effectively reduce decoding errors; and 3) In terms of algorithm optimality, our DRL framework shows superior flexibility and adaptability in communication environments compared to traditional A* search and heuristic methods.}

	abstract = {Future communication systems are envisioned to employ intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band to provide reliable high-rate services. For mobile users, the time-varying channel state information (CSI) requires adequate adjustment of the reflection pattern of the IRS. We propose a novel codebook-based user tracking (UT) algorithm for IRS-assisted mmWave communication, allowing suitable reconfiguration of the IRS unit cell phase shifts, resulting in a high reflection gain. The presented algorithm acquires the direction information of the user based on a peak maximum likelihood (ML)-based direction estimation. Using the direction information, the user’s trajectory is extrapolated to proactively update the adopted codeword and adjust the IRS phase shift configuration accordingly. Furthermore, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the direction estimation error and utilize the obtained insights to design a codebook specifically optimized for direction estimation. Our results show that the proposed ML-based direction estimation algorithm outperforms a multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based reference scheme. The proposed direction estimation codebook improves the direction estimation error for both these schemes as compared to when a reference codebook is used. Also, the accuracy of the proposed UT algorithm is shown to be competitive with Kalman filter-based UT, while the proposed scheme requires fewer a priori assumptions on the user movement. Furthermore, the average achieved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the average effective rate of the proposed UT algorithm are analyzed. The proposed UT algorithm requires only a low overhead for direction and channel estimation and avoids outdated IRS phase shifts. Furthermore, it is shown to outperform three benchmark schemes based on direct phase shift optimization, optimal codeword selection, and hierarchical codebook search, respectively, via computer simulations.}

	abstract = {Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to achieve better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user using only the second-order Taylor expansion, which simplifies the problem-solving process compared to the existing two-step approximation method. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than the existing two-step approximation method, achieving a 3.4% enhancement in max-min SNR. Moreover, it can improve the max-min SNR/SINR by up to 22.5%, 181.7%, and 343.9% compared to benchmarks employing only receive MAs, only transmit MAs, and both transmit and receive FPAs, respectively.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in fluid antenna-aided communication systems under arbitrary correlated fading channels. In particular, it is considered that a single fixed-antenna transmitter aims to send confidential information to a legitimate receiver equipped with a planar fluid antenna system (FAS), while an eavesdropper, also taking advantage of a planar FAS, attempts to decode the desired message. For this scenario, we first present analytical expressions of the equivalent channel distributions at the legitimate user and eavesdropper by using copula, so that the obtained analytical results are valid for any arbitrarily correlated fading distributions. Then, with the help of Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, we derive compact analytical expressions for the average secrecy capacity (ASC), the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) for the FAS wiretap channel. Moreover, for exemplary purposes, we also obtain the compact expression of ASC, SOP, and SEE by utilizing the Gaussian copula under correlated Rayleigh fading channels as a special case. Eventually, numerical results indicate that applying the fluid antenna with only one activated port to PLS can guarantee more secure and reliable transmission, when compared to traditional antenna systems (TAS) exploiting maximal ratio combining (MRC) and antenna selection (AS) under selection combining (SC).}

We consider a practical but often overlooked multi-channel scenario where the base station is equipped with fewer radio frequency chains than there are user equipment (UEs) in the cell. In this case, analog beam selection is important because not all beams preferred by UEs can be selected simultaneously, and since the beam selection cannot vary across subchannels in a time slot, this creates a coupling between subchannels within a time slot. None of the solutions proposed in the literature deal with this important constraint. The paper begins with an offline study that analyzes the impact of different RRM procedures and system parameters on performance. An offline joint RRM optimization problem is formulated and solved that includes beam set selection, UE set selection, power distribution, modulation and coding scheme selection, and digital beamforming as a part of hybrid beamforming. The evaluation results of the offline study provide valuable insights that show the importance of not neglecting the constraint and guide the design of low-complexity and high-performance online downlink RRM schemes in the second part of the paper. The proposed online RRM algorithms perform close to the performance targets obtained from the offline study while offering acceptable runtime.}

	abstract = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) uses advanced techniques to identify radio equipment by analyzing unique characteristics in radio frequency signals. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been considered a promising tools for designing various intelligent SEI methods. This is primarily due to its ability to fully exploit hidden data features and make autonomous classification decisions, leading to effective performance. The existing DL-SEI methods are based on the availability of extensive labeled datasets, however, collecting and annotating such data is challenging and time-consuming in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these datasets often contain both device-specific and irrelevant features, which limits the adaptability of models to fixed channels. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust variable-channel SEI (VC-SEI) method. This method uses semantic consistency-powered semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA). We introduce domain adversarial training to ensure global semantic consistency (GSC), allowing the extraction of channel-irrelevant features. Additionally, we design two loss functions to maintain local semantic consistency (LSC) for extracting category-relevant features. This approach enables effective domain adaptation. Our SSDA-based VC-SEI method has been rigorously evaluated using the ORACLE RF fingerprinting datasets from 16 USRP X310 radios. When only 1% of training samples in the target domain are labeled, our method achieves 84.20% identification accuracy in the target domain and 92.00% identification accuracy in the source domain. These results surpass those of current state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results confirm the robust identification performance of our proposed VC-SEI method in both source and target domains across all scenarios.

We provide a mathematical methodology to derive the convergence bound for the proposed scheme in the context of computational heterogeneity and general loss functions, supplemented with design insights. Accordingly, we propose aggregation cost metrics and efficient algorithms to find optimized weights for the aggregation.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the geometrically averaged performance of a wireless communication network assisted by a multitude of distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), where the RIS locations are randomly dropped obeying a homogeneous Poisson point process. By exploiting stochastic geometry and then averaging over the random locations of RISs as well as the serving user, we first derive a closed-form expression for the spatially ergodic rate in the presence of phase errors at the RISs in practice. Armed with this closed-form characterization, we then optimize the RIS deployment under a reasonable and fair constraint of a total number of RIS elements per unit area. The optimal configurations in terms of key network parameters, including the RIS deployment density and the array sizes of RISs, are disclosed for the spatially ergodic rate maximization. Our findings suggest that deploying larger-size RISs with reduced deployment density is theoretically preferred to support extended RIS coverages, under the cases of bounded phase shift errors. However, when dealing with random phase shifts, the reflecting elements are recommended to spread out as much as possible, disregarding the deployment cost.Furthermore, the spatially ergodic rate loss due to the phase shift errors is quantitatively characterized. For bounded phase shift errors, the rate loss is eventually upper bounded by a constant as N\\rightarrow \\infty\n, where N is the number of reflecting elements at each RIS. While for random phase shifts, this rate loss scales up in the order of \\log N\n. These analytical observations are validated through numerical results.}

	abstract = {In passive Internet of Things, existing synthetic aperture-based 3D localization methods face many challenges, such as high computational load, a large aperture of a virtual antenna array, and sensitivity to noise. To address these challenges, this paper develops a synthetic aperture scheme for integrated localization and navigation, which implements the localization algorithm with a trajectory generated by the navigation algorithm. The localization problem is formulated by multidimensional scaling, which exploits phase differences involving the spatial information between target tags and a virtual antenna array. The new formulation allows the system to provide an accurate location estimate with a large moving step and sparse virtual antenna array of narrow apertures. The navigation problem is formulated to decrease errors of distance differences. Moreover, a navigation criterion is established to determine the feasibility of a virtual antenna position based on phase measurements, and an efficient navigation algorithm is proposed to find such a feasible point. Extensive numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The next-generation wireless network is envisioned to support real-time broadband communication (RTBC) to provision services for immersive applications. Such applications (e.g., virtual reality, VR) usually need to simultaneously transmit multi-modal (e.g., visual, audio and haptic) data streams that have different traffic characteristics and transmission requirements, within multiple transmission time intervals (TTIs). In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding within multiple TTIs for multi-modal data transmission. As it is hard to find an optimal solution, we first resort to a novel soft actor-critic (SAC)-based learning approach. Specifically, a lightweight reinforcement learning architecture is employed to learn the adaptive priority weight of each user within multiple TTIs by taking into account its remaining multi-modal data amount and dynamic interaction state. The learned priority weights are then input to an iterative weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm to adjust the precoder matrix and user transmission rates. With a scalable state design, the proposed algorithm can be tailored to different numbers of potential or active users. We also provide another practical solution to the formulated multi-TTI precoding problem, which transforms the problem into a single-TTI optimization problem by adding the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints into the traditional WMMSE problem and then solves it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, which show that the SAC-based precoding algorithm can achieve a 50.0% increment in system capacity compared to traditional WMMSE and a significant reduction in time complexity compared to the QoS-constrained WMMSE algorithm.}

	abstract = {Through deploying satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with onboard processing capability, the space-air-ground edge computing network (SAGECN) is poised to support ubiquitous access and computation offloading for Internet of Things (IoT) terminals deployed in remote areas. However, the current SAGECN faces several challenges in realizing its full potential, such as scarce spectrum resources, diverse computational demands, and dynamic network circumstances. To meet these challenges, we propose a cluster-non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA)-enabled SAGECN model, where a satellite and multiple UAVs act as collaborative edge servers to execute tasks from IoT terminals. Since each offloaded task should be processed via a specific program, the edge servers carry out program caching, whilst transfer the tasks that do not match the cached programs to another server in a multi-hop manner. Considering the delay-sensitive requirements of computation tasks, we formulate a joint task offloading, communication-computation-cache resource assignment, and routing plan problem, aimed at minimizing the average system latency. To cope with this challenging issue, we partition it into three subproblems. First, a multi-agent learning-based approach is developed to collaboratively train the task offloading, flight trajectory, and program caching. As a step further, two optimization subroutines are embedded to perform routing plan, subchannel allocation, and power control, thereby rendering the overall solution. Experimental results reveal that our approach achieves outstanding performance in terms of system delay and spectrum efficiency.}

	abstract = {With the exponential growth of mobile users, ensuring high-quality network coverage has become paramount. Large-scale mobile networks consist of numerous base stations (BSs), each with adjustable parameters such as angles and beam widths. Automatically optimizing network coverage can be difficult due to environmental factors and the interdependence of the adjustable parameters. Due to the inherent uncertainties and unpredictable nature of large-scale wireless networks, traditional methods such as heuristics and meta-heuristics lack the adaptability and scalability required to cope with their dynamic environment. To address these challenges, we propose utilizing digital twin and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques within mobile networks characterized by multiple collaborating agents. We initially introduce DT-SimNet, a digital twin-enabled mobile network simulator to facilitate optimization evaluation. DT-SimNet can efficiently simulate communication behaviors of network elements within a complex environment while revealing user mobility patterns. Moreover, to address challenges arising from multifaceted relationships among users, BSs, and the parameters across BSs, we introduce an innovative strategy named Optimized Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Self-supervised Prediction (OMAPPO-SSP). Compared to MAPPO, which leads to limited applicability and inferior performance due to the dynamic characteristics of 5G networks, this approach leverages network structure optimization and a self-supervised prediction mechanism, employing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) principles to enhance efficiency. By harnessing collaborative neural networks, OMAPPO-SSP facilitates the explicit learning of behavioral interactions among all BSs, enabling effective decision-making in environments characterized by intricate spatial relationships, dynamic user behaviors, and diverse interactions. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the OMAPPO-SSP. Within the target area, OMAPPO-SSP achieves a coverage ratio of 94.66% and an average throughput of 89746 bits per second (bps), demonstrating significant improvements compared to competing methods.}

	abstract = {In future B5G/6G broadband communication systems, non-linear signal distortion caused by the impairment of transmit power amplifier (PA) can severely degrade the communication performance, especially when uplink users share the wireless medium using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. This is because the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding technique, used in NOMA, is incapable of eliminating the interference caused by PA distortion. Consequently, each user’s decoding process suffers from the cumulative distortion noise of all uplink users. In this paper, we establish a new and tractable DPD-PA distortion signal model based on real-world measurements, where the distortion noise power is a polynomial function of PA transmit power diverging from the oversimplified linear function commonly employed in existing studies. Applying the proposed signal model, we characterize the capacity rate region of multi-user uplink NOMA by optimizing the user transmit power. Our findings reveal a significant contraction in the capacity region of NOMA, attributable to polynomial distortion noise power. For practical engineering applications, we formulate a general weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) problem under individual user rate constraints. We further propose an efficient power control algorithm to attain the optimal performance. Numerical results show that the optimal power control policy under the proposed non-linear PA model achieves on average 13% higher throughput compared to the policies assuming an ideal linear PA model. Overall, our findings demonstrate the importance of accurate PA distortion modeling to the performance of NOMA and provide efficient optimal power control method accordingly.}

	abstract = {To address the challenges of device diversity and service heterogeneity in human and machine-type communications, a predominant approach in future networks is to serve users by differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) categories. However, due to exacerbated conflicts among concurrent services for constrained resources, 6G networks call for more inclusive and equitable QoS provisioning strategies. This paper proposes a novel service provisioning framework empowered by demand-aware prioritization mechanism and diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI)-based resource allocation. Particularly, the proposed scheme discerns heterogeneous users’ resource needs by customized utility models according to specific service categories and requirements. By considering demand-aware priorities for individual users, we propose a DEI-based metric evaluated by the weighted mean-variance tradeoff of network-wide user utilities. Our overall objective is to maximize the long-term DEI value in multi-dimensional multiple-access (MDMA) network. To address this NP-hard problem, we design an alternate optimization framework wherein the subchannel and power allocation are solved by matching theory and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. Simulations verify the proposed scheme can inclusively support all users of differentiated service categories with higher average utility and smaller inter-user disparity. Furthermore, the DEI method can adaptively accommodate and prioritize diverse QoS demands based on individualized service requirements and dynamic resource conditions.}

	abstract = {In existing federated learning (FL), the base station (BS) coordinates devices to collaboratively train a shared model by avoiding the transmission of raw data. To achieve communication-efficient model uploading, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is often employed to aggregate model parameters. However, in conventional AirComp assisted FL, the BS’s abundant computation resources are underutilized due to its non-involvement in model training. Meanwhile, transmission failures resulting from fluctuating wireless channels impair the quality of model aggregation. In this paper, we propose a retransmission-based semi-federated learning (SemiFL) framework, wherein devices upload model parameters and public privacy-free data for enabling a hybrid implementation of FL and centralized learning (CL). In our new framework, the BS leverages its abundant computation resources to aid CL model training, which mitigates the resource wastage while alleviating local computational burden of devices. Moreover, the proposed new retransmission mechanism effectively overcomes detrimental transmission failures resulting from the fluctuating quasi-static channel, aiming to guarantee improved learning performance of SemiFL. Successful transmission probabilities of both retransmission-based AirComp and retransmission-based digital communication are provided in closed forms. To attain deep insights, we derive an optimality gap to capture the convergence behavior of retransmission-based SemiFL. Then, we formulate a non-convex long-term problem to minimize a weighted sum of overall latency and energy consumption by jointly optimizing communication, computation, and learning parameters. Extensive experimental results show that our retransmission-based SemiFL obtains 21.9%, 30.5%, and 44.1% accuracy gains on three datasets, while efficaciously reducing latency and energy consumption compared to benchmarks. Meanwhile, our scheme enhances learning performance on the fluctuating quasi-static channel compared to state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {High-speed train (HST) communication plays a crucial role in providing reliable data services to passengers inside the trains. However, due to the train’s high mobility, a fast time-varying channel generally exists between the static BS and high-speed users, resulting in severe communication performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided HST relaying system, where an IRS is integrated with the relay to aid the data transmission from the BS to the relay. Specifically, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the relay by jointly optimizing the active transmit beamforming at the BS, the active receive beamforming at the relay, and the passive reflect beamforming at the IRS. To solve this problem, we first decouple it into two simpler sub-problems by leveraging the low-dimensional channel decomposition of the high-dimensional BS-relay channel matrix, and then solve them in closed-form with low complexity. Additionally, an efficient transmission protocol tailored for HST communication systems is proposed to implement channel estimation and beam tracking with low complexity. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed IRS-aided HST relaying system, compared with the traditional relaying scheme without IRS and other benchmark schemes.}

To fully investigate the potential of STAR-RIS, three types of STAR-RIS protocols are employed in the SWIPT systems, namely the energy splitting (ES), the mode switching (MS), and the time switching (TS) protocols. The weighted sum power maximization problem is formulated for each STAR-RIS protocol to maximize the sum power received at the EHRs by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the AP and STAR-RIS. The non-convex problem for each STAR-RIS protocol is handled by the proposed low-complexity Gaussian randomization-based and high-precision penalty-based joint optimization algorithms to provide a more comprehensive range of algorithmic choices. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the AP only needs to send the information beam to achieve the best power supply and communication service in adopting any STAR-RIS protocol. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed schemes can achieve higher sum received power compared to the benchmarks; 2) the sum power received at the EHRs of the three STAR-RIS protocols can be ranked as ES > TS > MS; and 3) the performance gap in sum power received between penalty-based and Gaussian random algorithms depends on the number of STAR-RIS elements.}

Given the non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) nature of the problem, a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) based caching update algorithm is proposed to make an optimal caching decision by learning the dynamic network environment. In order to protect user data privacy and solve the problem of slow convergence of the single deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model training, we propose a communication-efficient federated deep reinforcement learning (CE-FDRL) method to implement cooperative training of models from multiple fog access points (F-APs) in F-RANs. To address the excessive consumption of communication resources caused by model transmission, we propose to prune and quantize the shared DRL models to reduce the number of transferred model parameters. The communication interval is increased and the communication round is reduced by periodic model aggregation. The global convergence and computational complexity of our proposed method are also analyzed. Simulation results verify that our proposed method can offer better performance in reducing user request delay and improving cache hit rate and the transmitted parameters of our proposed method can drop to 60% compared to the existing benchmark schemes. Our proposed method is also shown to have faster training speed and higher communication efficiency.}

The performance of the UAV is degraded when the signals are blocked by obstacles in dense urban scenarios. To address this issue and enhance the signal quality available to the ground users, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has emerged as a new technological paradigm. It offers an intelligent configuration for the signal propagation environment by redirecting the signals to the users. In this article, we solve a non-convex optimization problem of RIS-assisted UAV network by jointly optimizing the RIS phase shift and 3D trajectory of UAV to maximize the energy efficiency of a rotatory-wing UAV. The considered optimization problem is solved using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based techniques in an on-line fashion to reduce the computational complexity. We leverage Twin-delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) to solve the problem by considering the UAV trajectory as a set of continuous actions. For comparison, we also use the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) for continuous and discrete optimization of the UAV trajectory, respectively. Extensive simulations show that the TD3 outperforms all the considered DRL techniques with the highest energy efficiency and throughput, and the lowest propulsion energy.}

	abstract = {Existing models for Radio Frequency (RF) and Free Space Optical (FSO) attenuations, such as the recommendations published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), require physical parameters along the communication channels. In practice, the weather parameters of the entire path are usually unavailable. This paper presents RF and FSO attenuation models built using machine learning algorithms and applied to empirical data. The empirical data consists of weather parameters collected at one end of the channel. Seven pairs of RF/FSO models are trained for specific weather conditions. The importance of each weather parameter is compared. RF attenuation is found to be sensitive to humidity, while FSO attenuation is closely related to scintillation. This paper shows how to obtain a pair of generic random forests that are applicable to seven specific weather conditions. The generic random forests predict the RF and FSO attenuations which have a joint distribution similar to the empirically observed distributions. They preserve the correlation between the RF and FSO attenuations as measured by the correlation coefficient and mutual information. When applied to empirical data, the generic random forests outperform the ITU models and models constructed by linear regression with interaction, both in terms of Root-Mean-Square-Error and R-squared.}

	abstract = {To overcome the long transmission distances and limited spectrum resources issues, both the space-aerial-terrestrial relay networks (SATRNs) and hybrid-free space optical/radio frequency (FSO/RF) mode have attracted significant attentions. Specifically, high-altitude platform (HAP) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are employed in this paper to enhance the transmission reliability and improve the resource utilization along with the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) techniques. Besides, we propose a novel access-free federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which exploits the privacy-preserving security features of federated learning (FL) and DRL, to optimize active beamforming vectors, RIS reflection coefficients, UAV trajectory, and power splitting ratio. The learning process of the algorithm is performed locally which significantly reduces the computational overhead compared to traditional algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed federated DRL-aided framework achieves higher energy efficiency compared to the reference schemes.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a novel physical layer secure (PLS) potential technique which is summarized into a category of index modulation (IM) scheme, namely the spatial field digital modulation (SFDM). In an SFDM communication system, bit streams are modulated in the spatial distribution of electromagnetic (EM) field. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode groups can be utilized for beamforming and thus realize an OAM based SFDM (OAM-SFDM) system. This kind of IM systems that utilize the distribution of EM field to transmit information can radiate different signals to different directions and possess inherent anti-eavesdropping capability. Since an eavesdropper lacks prior knowledge, it is difficult to construct appropriate and effective estimators for signal demodulation. However, such system is vulnerable when potential eavesdroppers adopt clustering algorithm, a type of non-realtime demodulation. We propose two PLS strategies with different computational complexity, the power hopping (PH) method and the symbol variation (SV) method, to confront single-antenna eavesdroppers and multi-antenna eavesdroppers, respectively. Both approaches are key-free, and do not require any prior channel state information (CSI) about eavesdroppers. The mentioned methods could constantly disrupt the statistical properties of eavesdroppers’ channels and even their received signals. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations have been conducted to validate the feasibility of these two schemes. Furthermore, a prototype of OAM-SFDM based PLS communication system is built in a realistic scenario. The experimental results demonstrate that both PH method and SV method can effectively resist clustering algorithm in their corresponding application scenarios.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are being widely investigated as a potential low-cost and energy-efficient alternative to active relays for improving coverage in next-generation cellular networks. However, technical constraints in the configuration of IRSs should be taken into account in the design of scheduling solutions and the assessment of their performance. To this end, we examine an IRS-assisted time division multiple access (TDMA) cellular network where the reconfiguration of the IRS incurs a communication cost; thus, we aim at limiting the number of reconfigurations over time. Along these lines, we propose a clustering-based heuristic scheduling scheme that maximizes the cell sum capacity, subject to a fixed number of reconfigurations within a TDMA frame. First, the best configuration of each user equipment (UE), in terms of joint beamforming and optimal IRS configuration, is determined using an iterative algorithm. Then, we propose different clustering techniques to divide the UEs into subsets sharing the same suboptimal IRS configuration, derived through distance- and capacity-based algorithms. Finally, UEs within the same cluster are scheduled accordingly. We provide extensive numerical results for different propagation scenarios, IRS sizes, and phase shifters quantization constraints, showing the effectiveness of our approach in supporting multi-user IRS systems with practical constraints.}

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), a promising 6G technology, can manage interference by customizing radio propagation with controllable reflecting elements (REs). Active RIS, which amplifies signal amplitudes and adjusts phases with enhanced REs, shows potential in addressing strong interference. This paper investigates the active RIS-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel, characterizing the achievable rate region under transmit-power constraints, maximum amplitude constraint on each RE, and a power budget constraint at the active RIS. Utilizing multiple antennas at transmitters and multiple enhanced REs at the active RIS, we explore the Pareto Boundary of the achievable rate region with the rate profile method. A general alternating optimization framework iteratively optimizes the transmit beamforming vector and the reflection coefficient matrix through convex optimization techniques. We also consider a stringent case where active RIS ensures interference-free transmissions, deriving a reflection coefficient matrix structure via subspace decomposition. Additionally, a suboptimal algorithm combining this structure with maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming characterizes the achievable rate region. Simulation results demonstrate that active RIS significantly improves the rate region and ensures interference-free transmissions compared to passive RIS and relay under the same power budget.}

The cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, providing macro diversity and supporting more users, is an architecture suitable for mURLLC. This paper investigates the UAD problem with changeable pilot sequences in cell-free massive MIMO systems, and proposes deep learning based UADFormer, where users are assigned to access points (APs) for detection using user grouping algorithm and transformer-based neural networks (NNs) in APs are employed to output user activity state by exploiting the correlation between received signals and pilot sequences. For users detected by multiple APs, a fusion NN based on transfer learning in the central processing unit is utilized to enhance UAD accuracy. Additionally, considering limited computational and storage resources in APs, sparse attention mechanism is used in NNs to reduce computational complexity and residual attention score is employed to improve NN performance. Simulation results show that UADFormer outperforms other schemes in various evaluation metrics and reduces computational complexity.}

	abstract = {This article proposes a novel framework that utilizes an over-the-air Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to learn Metaverse users’ expectations. By interpreting users’ brain activities, our framework can optimize physical resources and enhance Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for users. To achieve this, we leverage a Wireless Edge Server (WES) to process electroencephalography (EEG) signals via uplink wireless channels, thus eliminating the computational burden for Metaverse users’ devices. As a result, the WES can learn human behaviors, adapt system configurations, and allocate radio resources to tailor personalized user settings. Despite the potential of BCI, the inherent noisy wireless channels and uncertainty of the EEG signals make the related resource allocation and learning problems especially challenging. We formulate the joint learning and resource allocation problem as a mixed integer programming problem. Our solution involves two algorithms: a hybrid learning algorithm and a meta-learning algorithm. The hybrid learning algorithm can effectively find the solution for the formulated problem. Specifically, the meta-learning algorithm can further exploit the neurodiversity of the EEG signals across multiple users, leading to higher classification accuracy. Extensive simulation results with real-world BCI datasets show the effectiveness of our framework with low latency and high EEG signal classification accuracy.}

To further meet the massive connection demands in beyond-fifth-generation (B5G) systems, in this paper, we propose to employ non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in both uplink and downlink relaying hops in an amplify-and-forward (AF) based UAV relaying network with multiple source-destination (SD) user pairs. Specifically, taking NOMA design in both hops into a joint consideration in relaying networks is investigated for the first time and presents a new challenge for the joint optimization problem in terms of the deployment of the UAV relay, the two-hop NOMA user grouping, and the transmit power control for both the source users and the UAV. To maximize the system sum rate, we propose an efficient joint uplink and downlink NOMA-based relay (JUDNR) scheme to decompose the problem into three sub-problems and adopt the alternating optimization (AO) method to iteratively obtain a promising solution. In detail, we provide a joint NOMA groups design of both the uplink and downlink and propose a novel recursive two-hop NOMA grouping (RTNG) algorithm to efficiently group users. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed JUDNR scheme outperforms various baselines in terms of sum rate.}

The major ones arise from the computational complexity, which scales with N^{3}\n, and from the need for accurate knowledge of the channel statistics. This paper aims to address both challenges by introducing reduced-complexity channel estimation methods that achieve the performance of MMSE in terms of estimation accuracy and uplink spectral efficiency while demonstrating improved robustness in practical scenarios where channel statistics must be estimated. This is achieved by exploiting the inherent structure of the spatial correlation matrix induced by the array geometry. Specifically, we use a Kronecker decomposition for uniform planar arrays and a well-suited circulant approximation for uniform linear arrays. By doing so, a significantly lower computational complexity is achieved, scaling as N\\sqrt {N}\nand N \\log N\nfor squared planar arrays and linear arrays, respectively.}

	abstract = {In non-cooperative communications, malicious electromagnetic interference attacks communication systems and causes higher probability of communication disruption. In order to address the challenges posed by electromagnetic interference, the wireless interference recognition technique has emerged, which identifies the interference signals without priori information. In recent years, the success of deep learning (DL) has sparked interest in introducing DL in the field of wireless interference recognition. However, most DL-based interference identification methods improve accuracy by dramatically increasing network sizes while ignoring the important effect of network inputs. For this reason, we extensively investigate the impact of different signal transformation forms of interference (called signal modalities) on performance. The artificial features of the interference signal are also utilized as one of the refined modalities, which breaks the inherent concept that artificial features are only used in the methods of feature extraction. Convolution and transformer are combined in the extraction of different modal features. In order to reduce the complexity of transformer, a dual transformer module (DTM) is proposed. Furthermore, to overcome the imbalance of modal optimization during the training process, an adaptive gradient modulation (AGM) strategy is proposed, which leads to better convergence for the multimodal training. Finally, modal information selection mechanism (MISM) selects the most appropriate modalities for each input sample, which saves computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that combining multiple interference modalities is more effective than trying different networks.}

However, existing research mostly overlooks the dynamic changes in communication links caused by the real-time UAV movement and the realistic geographical features. In this paper, we address these challenges by considering a practical three-dimensional (3D) urban scenario with a centralized IRS. Our aim is to minimize the completion time of data harvesting missions by jointly optimizing the 3D trajectory of the UAV and the phase shift of the IRS. Specifically, the formulated problem is decoupled into two subproblems. First, for the 3D continuous trajectory design, we propose a robust memory-based softmax deep double deterministic policy gradients (MSD3) approach, which enables the UAV to adaptively collect delay-tolerant data from randomly distributed ground devices starting from any arbitrary point. Second, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for the continuous IRS phase control, which provides a practical and intuitive numerical solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MSD3-IRS algorithm outperforms other mainstream baselines based on deep reinforcement learning.}

This paper develops an architecture for integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) in the vehicular network, where vehicles perform environment sensing, sensing data computation, and transmission. To support low-latency cooperation between vehicles and extend vehicles’ sensing range, over-air-computation federated learning is employed. The optimization problem of joint beamforming design and power resource allocation in the ISCC scenario is formulated to maximize the achievable data rate while ensuring sensing and computing performance. However, solving this joint optimization problem is a great challenge due to the high coupling resource and time-varying channel environment. Therefore, a hybrid reinforcement learning scheme is proposed in this work. First, the semidefinite relaxation and Gaussian randomization techniques are leveraged to obtain the approximate solution of the aggregation beamformer. Then, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to tackle the transmit beamforming design and resource allocation problem in continuous action space. Extensive simulation results validated the admirable performance of the proposed scheme in convergence and achievable sum rate compared with the benchmark schemes. In addition, the impact of variables on the optimization performance is demonstrated via numerical results.}

We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of user equipment (UEs) and MEC servers (MECSs) by jointly optimizing MECS active/sleep mode selection, UE-MECS association decision (MSAD), and task offloading, communication, and computation resource allocation (TORA) across two different timescales. Considering that the involved optimization variables affect the system performance in different timescales, we decouple the formulated stochastic optimization problem into two subproblems: MSAD operating in the large timescale and TORA in the small timescale. Leveraging the Lyapunov method, the stochastic TORA problem is decoupled into a series of deterministic problems, of which the closed-form solutions are presented. Furthermore, the MSAD problem is reformulated as a constrained Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we propose a double dueling deep Q-network (D3QN) to learn the optimal MSAD based on the TORA results.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the role of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for enhanced handover management in 6G networks with overlapping wireless network layers i.e., ground, aerial, and space. A high altitude platform system (HAPS) is equipped with RIS and the comparison of direct and RIS-assisted link performance is presented. To do this, the average bit error rate, the outage probability (OP), and the channel capacity of direct and HAPS-assisted links are obtained in closed form expressions. By estimating the link error probability, a novel handover mechanism exploits the use of RIS, resulting in enhanced connectivity management. Hard and soft handover modes are defined depending on the radio frequency (RF) connectivity by means of link error threshold. The decision for the handover execution is based on selecting the optimal link among multiple available ones from ground, aerial, and space layers. The performance of RIS-assisted handover mechanism has been compared to traditional hard and soft handover procedure, as well as link performance achieved with relay node. Numerical and simulation results reveal that the connectivity of a user equipment can be maintained through RIS-aided links in case of any performance degradation in the direct RF links. Particular scenarios highlight that the use of RIS for handover is preferred to traditional handover procedures, as well as relay nodes.}

	abstract = {Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication performance by enabling the local movement of antennas at the transmitter (Tx) and/or receiver (Rx) for achieving more favorable channel conditions. As the existing studies on MA-aided wireless communications have mainly considered narrow-band transmission in flat fading channels, we investigate in this paper the MA-aided wideband communications employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in frequency-selective fading channels. Under the general multi-tap field-response channel model, the wireless channel variations in both space and frequency are characterized with different positions of the MAs. Unlike the narrow-band transmission where the optimal MA position at the Tx/Rx simply maximizes the single-tap channel amplitude, the MA position in the wideband case needs to balance the amplitudes and phases over multiple channel taps in order to maximize the OFDM transmission rate over multiple frequency subcarriers. First, we derive an upper bound on the OFDM achievable rate in closed form when the size of the Tx/Rx region for antenna movement is arbitrarily large. Next, we develop a parallel greedy ascent (PGA) algorithm to obtain locally optimal solutions to the MAs’ positions for OFDM rate maximization subject to finite-size Tx/Rx regions. To reduce computational complexity, a simplified PGA algorithm is also provided to optimize the MAs’ positions more efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PGA algorithms can approach the OFDM rate upper bound closely with the increase of Tx/Rx region sizes and outperform conventional systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the wideband channel setup.}

However, the dimension of MPGNN is tied to the size of vertices in the graph, which varies from graph to graph, resulting in dimension mismatch that hinders the utilization of graph data distributed at the network edge. To address this issue, we in this paper leverage the attention mechanism to project the graph representation of MPGNNs into a unified space and apply over-the-air computation (AirComp) to support federated graph learning (FGL) over wireless networks. By explicitly deriving the upper bound on the convergence of over-the-air FGL, we formulate a long-term transmission distortion minimization problem, which is further decomposed into a series of online optimization problems by using Lyapunov optimization. We further propose a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm to optimize the AirComp transceiver, where the analytical expression of transmit power is exploited in the action design to reduce the searching space and also enhance the training performance. Simulations demonstrate that, compared to the benchmarks, the proposed algorithm attains two orders of magnitude acceleration in the inference stage, while exhibiting enhanced robustness and improving learning performance.}

Recent advances in device electronics and antenna design in the THz band herald the massive deployment of millimeter-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) that often have limited battery capacity due to physical constraints. Consequently, the potential employment of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in the THz band emerges as a transformative paradigm shift, albeit complicated by challenges like molecular absorption loss and spectrum-efficient waveform design. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of low-complexity signal modulation schemes to achieve SWIPT to battery-less IoT devices in the THz band. Specifically, the comparative performances of two pulse-based THz signal modulation schemes, return-to-zero on-off keying (RZ-OOK) modulation and pulse position modulation (PPM), are analyzed for SWIPT from a transmitter to a rectenna-based receiver (RRx). To this end, tractable models are proposed for both wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless information transfer (WIT) between the transmitter and RRx through a non-linear THz channel. The theoretical models are validated with circuit simulations comprising THz band GaAs Schottky diode to showcase the novel performance analysis of both pulse modulation schemes in terms of WPT and WIT metrics in the THz band.}

In this article, we propose a semantic-aware speech-to-text transmission system for the single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user MIMO communication scenarios, named SAC-ST. Particularly, a semantic communication system to serve the speech-to-text task at the receiver is first designed, which compresses the semantic information and generates the low-dimensional semantic features by leveraging the transformer module. In addition, a novel semantic-aware network is proposed to facilitate transmission with high semantic fidelity by identifying the critical semantic information and guaranteeing its accurate recovery. Furthermore, we extend the SAC-ST with a neural network-enabled channel estimation network to mitigate the dependence on accurate channel state information and validate the feasibility of SAC-ST in practical communication environments. Simulation results will show that the proposed SAC-ST outperforms the communication framework without the semantic-aware network for speech-to-text transmission over the MIMO channels in terms of the speech-to-text metrics, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. Moreover, the SAC-ST with the developed channel estimation network is comparable to the SAC-ST with perfect channel state information.}

And we focus on the power saving design when the HMIMOS has a massive number of elements. For single-cluster NOMA transmissions implemented by a single-RF-chain HMIMOS-based transmitter, the required transmit power to maintain the quality of service (QoS) of all users are derived and two holographic beamforming schemes aiming at minimizing the required transmit power are developed. For multi-cluster NOMA transmissions implemented by a multi-RF-chain HMIMOS-based transmitter, a two-layer partitioning problem is formulated and solved to minimize the power consumption. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical analysis. It is shown that the NOMA scheme has lower power consumption than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based multi-user transmission schemes when the number of RF chains is limited, and our proposed holographic beamforming schemes achieve lower power consumption than other holographic beamforming schemes.}

Most prior work, though, neglects the challenges associated with establishing multi-user (MU) communication links in mmWave MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for sensor-aided beam training in MU mmWave MIMO system. We leverage the beamspace representation of the channel that contains only the angles-of-departure (AoDs) of the channel’s significant multipath components. We show that a deep neural network (DNN)-based multimodal sensor fusion framework can estimate the beamspace representation of the channel using sensor data. To aid the DNN training, we introduce a novel supervised soft-contrastive loss (SSCL) function that leverages the inherent similarity between channels to extract similar features from the sensor data for similar channels. Finally, we design an MU beamforming strategy that uses the estimated beamspaces of the channels to select analog precoders for all users in a way that prevents transmission to multiple users over the same directions. Compared to the baseline, our approach achieves more than 4 times improvement in the median sum-spectral efficiency (SE) at 42 dBm equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) with 4 active users. This demonstrates that sensor data can provide more channel information than previously explored, with significant implications for machine learning-based communication and sensing systems.}

We formulate a non-convex mixed integer optimization problem that minimizes the energy consumption of all Internet of Things devices (IoTDs) and maximizes the number of successful IoTD tasks. To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by normalizing a DRL training algorithm named deep deterministic policy gradient for efficiently designing the variables while ensuring the problem constraints. However, in the inference stage, the proposed DRL method may encounter different devices and services. Therefore, we design an exhaustive-improved DRL method that can improve the proposed DRL effectively using information from a digital-twin module. We also propose a mathematical approximation-based solution employing two convexification approach: Dinkelbach’s method and relaxed Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). Through extensive simulations over different parameters and scenarios, we identify the polynomial complexity, stable convergence, and operating regime of the proposed solutions. It is also confirmed that the proposed approaches work well even with digital twin defects and provide improved performance in terms of energy consumption and number of successful tasks in comparison with benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have drawn considerable attention due to their ability to introduce controllable phase-shifts onto impinging electromagnetic waves and impose link redundancy. Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to make future 6G networks more connected, but they are prone to several failures, which cause network disintegration. To harness the benefits of both, we study their integration to improve connectivity of multi-RIS-assisted UAV networks. We first propose to define the criticality of nodes, which reflects the importance of some nodes over other nodes. We then employ the algebraic connectivity metric, which is adjusted by the reflected links of the RISs and their criticality weights, to formulate the problem of maximizing the network connectivity. Such problem is a computationally expensive combinatorial optimization. Using a relaxation method where the discrete scheduling constraint of the problem is relaxed to be continuous, we propose two efficient solutions, namely semi-definite programming (SDP) optimization and Laplacian matrix perturbation, which both solve the problem in polynomial time. We rigorously derive the lower and upper bounds of the algebraic connectivity obtained from the perturbation solution. Simulation results compare the performance of the proposed solutions with different schemes, including without RISs, unoptimized link scheduling and phase shifts, greedy search, and optimal. The results show that the proposed schemes achieve considerably improved performance with low computational complexity compared to other schemes.}

	abstract = {As a key technology to meet the ever-increasing data rate demand in beyond 5G and 6G communications, millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have gained much attention recently. To make the most of mmWave massive MIMO systems, acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) is crucial. However, this task is by no means easy due to the CSI feedback overhead induced by the large number of antennas. In this paper, we propose a parametric CSI feedback technique for mmWave massive MIMO systems. Key idea of the proposed technique is to compress the mmWave MIMO channel matrix into a few geometric channel parameters (e.g., angles, delays, and path gains). Due to the limited scattering of mmWave signal, the number of channel parameters is much smaller than the number of antennas, thereby reducing the CSI feedback overhead significantly. Moreover, by exploiting the deep learning (DL) technique for the channel parameter extraction and the MIMO channel reconstruction, we can effectively suppress the channel quantization error. From the numerical results, we demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the conventional CSI feedback techniques in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).}

We specifically evaluate the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) originating from non-ideal access points (APs), user equipments (UEs), and Eavesdroppers (Eves) on the system’s secrecy performance. The investigation encompasses scenarios with both colluding and non-colluding Eves orchestrating pilot spoofing attacks against a designated UE, subsequently intercepting transmissions from both common and private streams. By taking into account a spatially correlated Ricean fading channel model and imperfect channel state information, we derive closed-form expressions for both legitimate and secrecy rates. The secrecy performance is scrutinized across different system configurations, including varying HWI levels, power splitting ratios, AP/Eve transmission powers, spatial correlations, line-of-sight components, and the presence of colluding versus non-colluding Eves. To enhance the secrecy rate for the compromised UE, we propose a secure power control strategy for adjusting the downlink transmission powers of the common and private streams. A sequential convex approximation-based algorithm is introduced to iteratively address this non-convex problem. Through comprehensive simulations, we validate our theoretical propositions and extract pivotal insights for system design.}

In the RDARS-aided system, not only distribution gain but also reflection gain can be obtained by a flexible combination of the distributed antennas and reflecting surface, which differentiates the system from the others and also makes the TTS design challenging. To enable the optimal TTS transceiver design, the achievable rate of the system is first derived in closed-form. The rate expression is general and covers that of the distributed antenna systems (DAS) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided systems as special cases. Then the TTS design aiming at the weighted sum rate maximization is considered. To solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem with high order design variables, i.e., the transmit powers and the phase shifts at the RDARS, a block coordinate descent based method is proposed to find the optimal solutions in semi-closed forms iteratively. Specifically, two efficient algorithms are proposed with provable convergence for the optimal phase shift design, i.e., Riemannian Gradient Ascent based algorithm by exploiting the unit-modulus constraints, and Two-Tier Majorization-Minimization based algorithm with closed-form optimal solutions in each iteration. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of deploying RDARS in massive MIMO systems to provide substantial rate improvement with a significantly reduced total number of active antennas/RF chains and lower transmit power when compared to the DAS and RIS-aided systems.}

	abstract = {Air-to-ground (A2G) networks, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as base stations to serve terrestrial user equipments (UEs), are promising for extending the spatial coverage capability in future communication systems. Coordinated transmission among multiple UAVs significantly improves network coverage and throughput compared to a single UAV transmission. However, implementing coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission for UAV mobility requires complex cooperation procedures, regardless of the handoff mechanism involved. This paper designs a novel CoMP transmission strategy that enables terrestrial UEs to achieve reliable and seamless connections with mobile UAVs. Specifically, a computationally efficient CoMP transmission method based on the theory of Poisson-Delaunay triangulation is developed, where an efficient subdivision search strategy for a CoMP UAV set is designed to minimize search overhead by a divide-and-conquer approach. For concrete performance evaluation, the cooperative handoff probability of the typical UE is analyzed, and the coverage probability with handoffs is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional Voronoi scheme with the nearest serving UAV regarding coverage probabilities with handoffs. Moreover, each UE has a fixed and unique serving UAV set to avoid real-time dynamic UAV searching and achieve effective load balancing, significantly reducing system resource costs and enhancing network coverage performance.}

	abstract = {This research exploits the applications of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, specifically addressing the enhancement of communication reliability with modulated signals. Specifically, we first derive the analytical downlink symbol error rate (SER) of each user as a multivariate function of both the phase-shift and beamforming vectors. The analytical SER enables us to obtain insights into the synergistic dynamics between the RIS and MIMO communication. We then introduce a novel average SER minimization problem subject to the practical constraints of the transmitted power budget and phase shift coefficients, which is NP-hard. By incorporating the differential evolution (DE) algorithm as a pivotal tool for optimizing the intricate active and passive beamforming variables in RIS-assisted communication systems, the non-convexity of the considered SER optimization problem can be effectively handled. Furthermore, an efficient local search is incorporated into the DE algorithm to overcome the local optimum, and hence offer low SER and high communication reliability. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and the proposed optimization framework, indicating that the joint active and passive beamforming design is superior to the other benchmarks.}

	abstract = {Airborne tactical networks (ATN) play a pivotal role in enabling information sharing between manned and unmanned military aircrafts. The design of effective ATNs faces two significant challenges: the network ossification problem and the complexity associated with managing heterogeneous resources. Wireless network virtualization provides a practical solution for the first challenge by abstracting, isolating, and sharing wireless resources among different entities. Flexible and scalable virtual request embedding (VRE) algorithms have the potential ability to address the other challenge. However, existing VRE algorithms are not suitable for the virtualization of an ATN because they do not adequately consider key factors such as global interference, reliability and delay-sensitive information sharing in the air-battlefield context. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework of joint wireless network virtualization and resource allocation in the context of an ATN. This framework ensures coordination between physical node and link resources for the VRE. Based on the proposed framework, we design a centralized embedding mechanism that maps available physical resources to served users by constructing a directed resource topology and designing wireless link scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, we design two VRE algorithms that account for two types of delay sensitivity: transmission time and waiting time, depending on whether virtual requests are split or not. Through simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithms and analyze the impact of key system parameters on the delay performance.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the potential of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in a cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system integrated with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Both the access points (APs) and the user equipment (UEs) deploy low-resolution ADCs. Thus, quantization noise (QN) limits the system’s performance. The limited coherence interval and the large number of users result in pilot contamination. This arises since multiple users may share the same pilot sequence in the uplink training. We investigate the spectral/energy efficiency (SE/EE) of an RSMA-enabled CF massive MIMO downlink transmission due to the robustness of RSMA against interference. We derive the closed-form SE expressions for the common and private streams which are shown to be exact when compared to Monte Carlo simulations. We optimize the combining weights of the common precoder to maximize the minimum user SE due to the common stream. It is shown that substantial SE gains and higher EE are achieved using the proposed algorithm in the presence of QN and imperfect channel state information. Our results emphasize that RSMA can be adopted to enhance the SE and EE while reducing the quantization bits.}

	abstract = {In dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks, secondary users (SUs) need to opportunistically access primary users’ (PUs) radio spectrum without causing significant interference. Since the SU-PU interaction is limited, deep reinforcement learning has been introduced to help SUs conduct spectrum access. Specifically, deep recurrent Q network (DRQN) has been utilized in DSA networks for SUs to aggregate information from recent experiences to make spectrum access decisions. DRQN is notorious for its sample efficiency since it needs a rather large number of training samples to tune its parameters which is a computationally demanding task. Deep echo state network (DEQN) has been introduced for DSA networks to address the sample efficiency issue of DRQN. In this work, we compare the convergence of DRQN and DEQN by comparing the upper bounds we obtain on their covering number, a notion of richness. Furthermore, we introduce a method to determine the right hyper-parameters for DEQN, providing system design guidance for DEQN-based DSA networks. Extensive performance evaluation confirms that DEQN-based DSA strategy is the superior choice with regard to computational power while outperforming DRQN-based ones.}

	abstract = {The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) service of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication network struggles to support safe robot operation. Nowadays, the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication network is proposed to provide hyper-reliable and low-latency communication to enable safer control for robots. However, current 5G/ 6G research mainly focused on improving communication performance, while the robotics community mostly assumed communication to be ideal. To jointly consider communication and robotic control with a focus on the specific robotic task, we propose goal-oriented semantic communication in robotic control (GSRC) to exploit the context of data and its importance in achieving the task at both transmitter and receiver. At the transmitter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to generate optimal control and command (C&C) data and a proactive repetition scheme (DeepPro) to increase the successful transmission probability. At the receiver, we design the value of information (VoI) and age of information (AoI) based queue ordering mechanism (VA-QOM) to rank the queue based on the semantic information extracted from AoI and VoI. The simulation results validate that our proposed GSRC framework achieves a 91.5% improvement in the mean square error compared to the traditional unmanned aerial vehicle control framework.}

Multi-UAV network systems can be coordinated to improve system performance significantly. Network time synchronization is a crucial prerequisite for establishing and operating multi-UAV networks, whereas the high-speed movement of UAVs presents challenges for time synchronization within multi-UAV networks. In this paper, we develop a practical information exchange model with high relative radial velocity and Gaussian distribution random transfer delay. By introducing Doppler information and a novel clock skew and clock offset consensus model, a Doppler and timestamp joint (DATJ) network time synchronization algorithm has been developed.

In Hyb-ERM, a hybrid RIS is partitioned into groups, with information bits transmitted through both conventional M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) modulated symbols and the number of active RIS groups. This approach, particularly the manipulation of transmitted symbols by the hybrid RIS based on the number of active groups, is designed to improve the minimum Euclidean distance, thereby significantly enhancing error performance. We have derived a theoretical upper bound for the bit error probability (BEP) and proposed two low-complexity detectors as alternatives to the maximum likelihood (ML) detector. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of Hyb-ERM, showing its superior error performance compared to benchmark schemes under both ideal and non-ideal channel conditions.

Aiming at maximizing the sum-rate of totally illuminated beam positions during the whole BH period, we consider joint beamforming and illumination pattern design subject to the HBF constraints and sum-rate requirements. To address the non-convexity of the HBF constraints, we temporarily replace the HBF constraints with the FDBF constraints. Then we propose an FDBF and illumination pattern random search (FDBF-IPRS) scheme to optimize illumination patterns and fully-digital beamformers using constrained random search and fractional programming methods. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose an FDBF and illumination pattern alternating optimization (FDBF-IPAO) scheme, where we relax the integer illumination pattern to continuous variables and after finishing all the iterations we quantize the continuous variables into integer ones. Based on the fully-digital beamformers designed by the FDBF-IPRS or FDBF-IPAO scheme, we propose an HBF alternating minimization algorithm to design the hybrid beamformers. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can achieve satisfactory sum-rate performance for BH LEO SatComs.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have recently attained growing popularity in wireless networks owning to their capability to customize the wireless channel via smartly configured passive reflections. In addition to optimizing IRS reflection patterns, the flexible deployment of IRSs offers another design degree of freedom (DoF) to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment in favour of signal transmission. To unveil the impact of IRS deployment on the system capacity, we investigate the capacity of a broadcast channel with a multi-antenna base station (BS) sending independent messages to multiple users, aided by IRSs with N elements. In particular, both the distributed and centralized IRS deployment architectures are considered. Regarding the distributed IRS, the N IRS elements form multiple IRSs and each of them is installed near a user cluster; while for the centralized IRS, all IRS elements are located in the vicinity of the BS. To draw essential insights, we first derive the maximum capacity achieved by the distributed IRS and centralized IRS, respectively, under the assumption of line-of-sight (LoS) propagation and homogeneous channel setups. By carefully capturing the fundamental tradeoff between the spatial multiplexing gain and passive beamforming gain, we rigourously prove that the capacity of the distributed IRS is higher than that of the centralized IRS provided that the total number of IRS elements is above a threshold. Motivated by the superiority of the distributed IRS, we then focus on the transmission and element allocation design under the distributed IRS. By exploiting the user channel correlation of intra-clusters and inter-clusters, an efficient hybrid multiple access scheme relying on both spatial and time domains is proposed to fully exploit both the passive beamforming gain and spatial DoF. Moreover, the IRS element allocation problem is investigated for the objectives of the sum-rate maximization and the minimum user rate maximization, respectively. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical finding and also to unveil the effectiveness of the distributed IRS for improving the system capacity under various system setups.}

With the aid of electromagnetic (EM) manipulation capability of H-MIMO, integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) system can fully exploit the EM channel to realize energy focusing and eliminate inter-user interference, which yields the concept of holographic IDET (H-IDET). In this paper, we investigate the beamforming designs for H-IDET systems, where the sum-rate of data users (DUs) are maximized by guaranteeing the energy harvesting requirements of energy users (EUs). In order to solve the non-convex functional programming, a block coordinate descent (BCD) based scheme is proposed, wherein the Fourier transform and the equivalence between the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the mean-square error (MSE) are also conceived, followed by the successive convex approximation (SCA) and an initialization scheme to enhance robustness. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed H-IDET scheme outperforms benchmark schemes, especially the one adopting traditional discrete antennas. Besides, the near-field focusing using EM channel model achieves better performance compared to that using the traditional channel model, especially for WET where the EUs are usually close to the transmitter.}

Our investigation demonstrates the necessity for precise moment computation. Succinctly put, moment quality is preferred over moment quantity.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer-enabled hybrid-powered multicell communication network with a nonlinear energy harvesting model. In this multicell environment, information interaction and energy trading are carried out among base stations (BSs), and each BS powered by hybrid sources simultaneously provides information/energy to its user equipments (UEs) over the downlinks. A novel global utility function is proposed by comprehensively considering the incomes from information and energy transmission, energy trading, and the costs from the electricity companies. To maximize this goal, a nonconvex problem that jointly optimizing energy procurement, power allocation, and power splitting ratios is formulated to deal with the imbalance between energy supply and demand at BSs. Considering the nonconvexity of the problem and the strong coupling among the optimization variables, the formulated problem is difficult to solve directly with conventional convex optimization methods. To overcome these obstacles, a two-step solution combining alternating optimization, distributed optimization, and successive convex approximation is designed, in which the BS layer scheme and the UE layer scheme are performed alternately. Different from the existing centralized schemes, the proposed distributed scheme makes local optimal decisions independently at each BS only resorting to the information of neighbor BSs, which brings great advantages in reducing signaling and computational overheads. Moreover, the convergence and advantages of the proposed distributed scheme are verified by rigorous analyses and simulations.}

In this paper, to address the computational complexity associated with conventional fingerprint positioning, we consider a novel cooperative positioning architecture that involves certain relevant access points (APs) to establish positioning similarity coefficients. Then, we propose an innovative joint positioning and correction framework employing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional sophisticated signal processing, which mainly leverages on the received signal strength information for preliminary positioning, supplemented by the angle of arrival information to refine the initial position estimation. Moreover, to mitigate the bias effects originating from remote APs, we design a cooperative weighted K-nearest neighbor (Co-WKNN)-based estimation scheme to select APs with a high correlation to participate in user positioning. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of various user positioning schemes, which reveal that the proposed MARL-based positioning scheme with Co-WKNN can effectively improve positioning performance. It is important to note that the cooperative positioning architecture is a critical element in striking a balance between positioning performance and computational complexity.}

	abstract = {The propagation loss of RF signals is a significant issue in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. Additionally, ensuring information security is crucial due to the broadcasting nature of wireless channels. To address these challenges, we exploit the potential of active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) SWIPT system. The active IRS provides better beamforming gain than the passive IRS, reducing the “double-fading” effect. Moreover, the noise introduced at the active IRS can be used as artificial noise (AN) to jam eavesdroppers. This paper formulates a secrecy sum-rate maximization problem related to precoding matrices, power splitting (PS) ratios, and the IRS matrix. Since the problem is highly non-convex, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution. Moreover, we develop a heuristic algorithm based on the zero-forcing precoding scheme to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the active IRS achieves a higher secrecy sum rate than the passive and non-IRS systems, especially when the transmit power is low or the direct link is blocked. Moreover, increasing the power budget at the active IRS can significantly improve the secrecy sum rate.}

	abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) beamforming property of the uniform circular array (UCA) in near-field wideband communication systems is comprehensively analyzed in both the distance and angular domains. It is rigorously demonstrated that the beam focal point only exists at a specific frequency in wideband UCA systems, resulting in significant beamforming loss. To facilitate near-field beamfocusing and alleviate the beam squint effect, the true-time delay (TTD)-based beamforming architecture is exploited. In particular, two wideband beamforming optimization approaches leveraging TTD units are proposed. 1) Analytical approach: In this approach, the phase shifters (PSs) and the time delay of TTD units are designed based on the analytical formula for beamforming gain. Following this design, the minimum number of TTD units required to achieve a predetermined beamforming gain is quantified. 2) Joint-optimization approach: In this method, the PSs and the TTD units are jointly optimized under practical maximum delay constraints to approximate the optimal unconstrained analog beamformer. Specifically, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where the PSs and the TTD units are alternately updated using either the closed-form solution or the low-complexity linear search approach. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed beamforming schemes effectively mitigate the beam squint effect, and 2) the joint-optimization approach outperforms the analytical approach in terms of array gain and achievable spectral efficiency.}

Since the introduction of 5G technology, wireless communication systems have had massive data throughput, so combining deep learning technology with modulation recognition technology is now one of the most mainstream development directions in the field of communication. In order to effectively improve the robust recognition accuracy of modulation signals in low SNR condition, this paper proposes an end-to-end AMR model based on deep learning, called residual convolution long short memory Improved Transformer-Encoder deep neural network model (RLITNN). First, convolutional network and LSTM network extract the initial features from the communication signals of different modes. Second, the proposed Improved Transformer-Encoder module is used to capture the global and local focus of the extracted features. Then, these features are fused. Finally, the high quality features are further captured from the fused feature vector to enhance the feature representation ability of the model. Experiments on RML2016.10A and RML2016.10B datasets show that the proposed RLITNN has better feature learning ability and better recognition accuracy than other advanced (SOTA) techniques.}

	abstract = {The sharing of flight operation data brings huge benefits to all participants, but for the privacy protection and data security, it is difficult to directly share flight operation data. Federated learning (FL) enables participants to jointly train machine learning models without exposing local data. However, due to the centralization of FL and the unreliability of FL participants, FL is vulnerable to malicious client and server attacks. In this paper, an anti-poisoning attack decentralized privacy enhanced federated learning (APDPFL) scheme is designed to mitigate the impact of server and malicious clients. Specifically, a local Rényi differential privacy is designed to protect client data privacy. Then, a verification method based on K-Means clustering is proposed to select models to participate in aggregation, which improves the anti-poisoning attack performance. Finally, a federated grouping practical Byzantine fault tolerance (FGPBFT) consensus algorithm based on consortium blockchain is proposed to dynamically change server and consensus clients, to decentralize server and improve the consensus efficiency. The theoretical analysis proves that the APDPFL achieves better convergence and provides data privacy protection and security protection. The experimental results on public datasets and flight operation datasets show that the APDPFL is robust and effective for sharing flight operation data.}

This paper presents the 41 GHz mmWave channel measurements and analysis results in open and underground parking lot scenarios for the first time. A large number of channel measurement data are obtained, including received signal strength indications (RSSIs) and channel impulse responses (CIRs) at different distances and different arrival angles for three cases. By clustering the power delay profile (PDP), cluster parameters such as cluster number, inter-cluster duration, cluster arrival rate and decay factor are obtained. The channel non-stationarity and consistency are revealed and discussed by various methods and from different perspectives. Large- and small-scale fading characteristics parameters, such as path loss, shadow fading, root-mean-square delay spread (RMS-DS), angle spread (AS), fade depth, and Ricean K factor are analyzed and discussed. The mmWave V2V channel characteristics of three cases are compared and analyzed. The measurement and modeling results fill the gaps of mmWave V2V channel measurements in open and underground parking lot scenarios and provide valuable suggestions for the design and modeling of mmWave V2V communication systems.}

However, most existing studies on decentralized FL employ half-duplex communication to achieve time-division model aggregation, which is inefficient in scenarios with massive geographically dispersed devices. To address this issue, we in this paper propose decentralized over-the-air FL (DOAFL) with full-duplex (FD) communication, where over-the-air computation (AirComp) and FD communication are fused together to enable parallel model exchange and aggregation, and antenna arrays are leveraged to suppress residual self-interference (SI). Specifically, we first conduct the convergence analysis for DOAFL to characterize the influence of the consensus error introduced by residual SI, channel fading, and receiver noise on the learning performance. Subsequently, we formulate a joint communication and computation (JC2) optimization problem with an objective to increase both the accuracy and time efficiency of the model training, followed by developing a JC2 design algorithm to efficiently optimize transceiver beamforming and computing frequencies. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed DOAFL in terms of training latency, residual SI suppression, and learning performance under low energy budgets.}

In this paper, we investigate a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted integrated sensing and two-tier task offloading (ISTTO) system in which the multi-functional access point (AP) provides task offloading services for a group of edge computing users via NOMA while performing sensing towards a target. To balance the utilization of the computing resources across different tiers, the AP can further offload part of the received workloads to a group of cloudlet servers. To investigate this problem, we formulate a joint optimization of the AP’s transmit beamforming, the two-tier dedicated sensing signals, the two-tier computation offloading strategies and the associated allocations of the communication and computing resources, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption, while guaranteeing the required sensing performance over the total duration. Although the formulated joint optimization problem is strictly non-convex, we identify the features of its solutions and exploit a decomposition-based framework for solving it. Numerical results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and show the performance advantages of our NOMA-assisted ISTTO scheme. Compared with several benchmark schemes, our NOMA-assisted ISTTO scheme achieves better performances in both sensing and task offloading, while suppressing the interference from undesired directions.}

Nevertheless, the existing works have not adequately investigated how the number or the deployment locations of IOSs should be optimized for serving multiple indoor users. In this paper, we study IOS-assisted outdoor-to-indoor mmWave communications where IOSs are installed in an exterior wall of a building to refract mmWave signals from an outdoor base station (BS) to indoor users that locate among indoor blockages. Given a fixed total number of refracting elements, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the downlink energy efficiency of the outdoor BS while satisfying the dowlink data rate requirements of the indoor users by jointly optimizing the number, locations and phase shifts of IOSs and the beamforming vectors of the BS. To address the varying dimensionality and the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems that optimize the IOSs’ phase shifts together with the BS beamforming vectors and the number and locations of IOSs, respectively, and devise successive convex approximation and Continuous Population-Based Incremental Learning-based algorithms to solve them alternately. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can obtain the optimal number and locations of IOSs, resulting in significantly enhanced energy efficiency of the outdoor BS compared to benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been recognized as a transformative technology for enabling smart and reconfigurable radio environment cost-effectively by leveraging its controllable passive reflection. In this paper, we study an IRS-assisted coverage enhancement problem for a given region, aiming to optimize the passive reflection of the IRS for improving the average communication performance in the region by accounting for both deterministic and random channels in the environment. To this end, we first derive the closed-form expression of the average received signal power in terms of the deterministic base station (BS)-IRS-user cascaded channels over all user locations, and propose an IRS-aided coverage enhancement framework to facilitate the estimation of such deterministic channels for IRS passive reflection design. Specifically, to avoid the exorbitant overhead of estimating the cascaded channels at all possible user locations, a location selection method is first proposed to select only a set of typical user locations for channel estimation by exploiting the channel spatial correlation in the region. To estimate the deterministic cascaded channels at the selected user locations, conventional IRS channel estimation methods require additional pilot signals, which not only results in high system training overhead but also may not be compatible with the existing communication protocols. To overcome this issue, we further propose a single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled IRS channel estimation method in this paper, based on only the average received signal power measurements at each selected location corresponding to different IRS random training reflections, which can be offline implemented in current wireless systems. Based on the estimated channels, the IRS passive reflection is then optimized to maximize the average received signal power over the selected locations. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the coverage performance of the target region and outperform the existing power-measurement-based IRS reflection designs.}

	abstract = {Traditional scheduling algorithms make decisions based solely on the channel conditions, without considering the transmitted semantic content. However, in multi-modal semantic communication systems, there is redundancy and variance in the importance of semantic features across modalities for task performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel feature scheduling and error probability control scheme that balances channel diversity and semantic diversity in semantic communication systems. Specifically, we first introduce a semantic feature importance metric to measure each feature’s contribution to the inference performance of semantic task. Using this metric, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to reduce overall latency while guaranteeing semantic task performance. Our detailed analysis examines feature selection strategies and transmission rate optimization to illustrate scheduling decisions based on both channel fading and semantic content. Consequently, we develop both optimal and low-complexity feature transmission scheduling schemes based on the optimization solution. Extensive experiments over multi-modal semantic communication systems validate that the semantic feature importance metric can reveal the importance of features from different modalities and accordingly affect their transmission rate. Additionally, the proposed schemes significantly reduce the system latency compared to the traditional methods.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable metasurfaces integrating numerous elements are one promising solution for empowering high-accuracy positioning applications, benefiting from their high spatial resolution, low power consumption, and low cost. In this paper, we investigate two typical types of metasurfaces, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), for target detection and positioning. Specifically, an RHS is a leaky-wave surface antenna with an embedded feed, while an RIS is a type of reflective metasurface whose feed is positioned outside the surface. Due to their distinct structures and working principles, RHSs and RISs may be suitable for different scenarios for target detection and positioning. To determine their best working scenarios, we first design the beamformers of both RIS-enabled and RHS-enabled radar systems to improve their performance. We then characterize the target detection and positioning performance analytically, and finally compare their performance in different scenarios. Theoretical and numerical results both reveal that: 1) in the one-dimensional linear array case, in general the performance of the RHS-enabled system is better than that of the RIS-enabled system; 2) in the two-dimensional planar array case, lower frequencies and larger physical sizes can contribute to a better performance of RIS-enabled systems than RHS-enabled systems, and vice versa.}

The goal is to maximize the sensing mutual information via jointly optimizing the transmit power, the trajectory of the UAV and the task completion time, while meeting the onboard energy, the communication service quality, and the UAV flight safety constraints. In particular, UAV dynamics are considered, which are usually ignored in the existing design and inferior communication and sensing quality of service might be resulted. The formulated problem is dynamic optimization problem, which is difficult to be solved. The control parameterization method and exact penalty function scheme are utilized to transform the problem into a static nonlinear program which can be solved by gradient-based methods.

	abstract = {Smart wireless environments enabled by multiple distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have recently attracted significant research interest as a wireless connectivity paradigm for sixth Generation (6G) networks. In this paper, using random matrix theory methods, we calculate the mean of the sum Mutual Information (MI) for the correlated Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Multiple Access Channel (MAC) in the presence of multiple RISs, in the large-antenna number limit. We thus obtain the capacity region boundaries, after optimizing over the tunable RISs’ phase configurations. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form expression for the variance of the sum-MI metric, which together with the mean provides a tight Gaussian approximation for the outage probability. The derived results become relevant in the presence of fast-fading, when channel estimation is extremely challenging. Our numerical investigations showcased that, when the angle-spread in the neighborhood of each RIS is small, which is expected for higher carrier frequencies, the communication link strongly improves from optimizing the ergodic MI of the multiple RISs. We also found that, increasing the number of transmitting users in such MIMO-MAC-RIS systems results to rapidly diminishing sum-MI gains, hence, providing limits on the number of users that can be efficiently served by a given RIS.}

	abstract = {To achieve accurate awareness of channel condition, the access point (AP) of a Wi-Fi network has to collect channel state information (CSI) from stations (STAs) periodically. However, existing CSI feedback mechanisms in Wi-Fi are situation agnostic, leading to substantial overhead due to the lack of adaptability and intelligence under dynamic and complex environments. To address this challenge, a concurrent dual channel information feedback mechanism with improve situation-awareness is proposed based on need-driven AP-STA coordination, aiming to maintain the accuracy of collected CSI while dramatically reducing the feedback overhead. By analyzing the latency tolerance of the channel information to be gathered, this concurrent dual feedback mechanism consists of both a delayed channel feature information (CFI) feedback by data frame and an immediate CSI feedback via control frame. In the delayed CFI feedback, a STA collaborates with AP and proactively determines when and what content of CFI to be fed back to the AP. Specifically, the CFI represents channel statistical channel features, which are crucial for the AP to learn the evolving channel conditions. Then, CFI is transmitted to the AP by piggybacking it in the uplink data payload at cost of a certain delay. On the other hand, STA can also utilize the existing CSI feedback mechanism for immediate CSI feedback. With the situation-aware CFI updates from both feedbacks, AP can effectively infer the downlink channel pattern and adapt the time-frequency resolution of CSI feedback to reduce the overhead. Accordingly, a deep cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to enable a closed-loop coordination between STA and AP for feedback. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.}

However, the optimal operation of large relay networks is still infeasible. This paper presents two approaches for the optimization of large relay networks. In the traditional approach, we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the relays are considered linear. In the second approach, we take an entirely new direction and consider the true non-linear nature of the relays. Using the similarity to neural networks, we leverage deep-learning methodology. Unlike previous applications of neural networks in wireless communications, where neural networks are added to the network to perform computational tasks, our deep relay optimization treats the relay network itself as a neural network. By exploiting the non-linear transfer function exhibited by each relay, we achieve over 15dB gain compared to traditional optimization methods. Moreover, we are able to implement part of the network functionality over the relay network. Our findings shed light on the potential of deep relay optimization, promising significant advancements in future wireless communication systems.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a large array of passive scattering elements, is able to control the properties of electromagnetic waves, thereby enhancing the channel capacity, reducing the bit error rate, and enabling novel signal modulation methods. However, the promising gain of RIS depends on the precision of channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a three-step channel reconstruction framework to improve the channel estimation accuracy inspired by the concept of integrated sensing and communication scenario. Firstly, based on the coarse channel state information (CSI), the proposed dual one-dimensional multiple signal classification (D1D-MUSIC) algorithm improves the localization precision with a reduced complexity. Secondly, expectation maximization-based refined estimation (EMRE) algorithms are proposed to refine the CSI and estimate channel statistical properties (CSP), i.e., the shadow fading, the power of line-of-sight paths, and that of non-line-of-sight components. Thirdly, a gradient descent-based pilot optimization (GDPO) algorithm is further derived to improve the channel estimation precision on the basis of estimated CSPs. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the developed D1D-MUSIC algorithm has lower localization error and complexity compared with conventional two-dimensional MUSIC algorithm. Moreover, the EMRE algorithms achieve the identical normalized mean square error (NMSE) performances as the ideal minimum mean square error estimator, while possessing robust resistance to the channel model mismatch. Furthermore, the developed GDPO technique is capable of providing an over 11 dB signal-to-noise ratio gain for channel estimation performance at NMSE \\bf = 10^{-2}\n.}

This paper focuses on the challenge of joint terminal activity detection (TAD) and channel estimation (CE) in grant-free non-orthogonal random access (GF-NORA)-enabled LEO communication networks. To leverage the dominant line-of-sight (LoS) path and the limited angular spread characteristic of terrestrial-satellite links, we propose a two-stage joint TAD and CE (TS-JDE) detection scheme aimed to achieve lower computational overhead. This scheme utilizes a high-accuracy algorithm for LoS path estimation and leverages the channel correlations for low-complexity NLoS paths estimation. Specifically, in LoS estimation stage, to mitigate the inaccuracies caused by Taylor expansion errors, we propose an enhanced message-passing algorithm, termed TaMP-LoS. This algorithm exploits the structured sparsity in the delay-Doppler domain and incorporates the Lagrange remainder to evaluate the expansion error, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy. In the NLoS estimation stage, we develop a sparse Bayesian learning-based algorithm, named SBL-NLoS, designed to estimate NLoS channels characterized by the limited residuals of delay and Doppler. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve better detection performance than the existing approaches for GF-NORA-enabled LEO networks.}

In this paper, we propose two unique word (UW)-based frame designs for bistatic ISAC. The approach consists of replacing the cyclic prefix (CP) with a Zadoff-Chu (ZC)-based sequence. With this approach, the radar receiver does not need to know the data symbols to perform sensing and the data rate is not compromised by the addition of extra pilots. The sensing performance of the UW-based frames is compared with that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as well as the pilot-symbol (PS) based radar processing. We derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) considering a band-limited system with raised-cosine filtering. Furthermore, we provide low-complexity fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based radar receivers that perform integer and fine grid multi-target delay-Doppler (DD) estimations. For the integer FFT-based receiver, an upper bound for the outlier probability is derived when the true DD falls outside the integer grid. The results demonstrate that the UW frames exhibit competitive radar performance with PS while having a 16.67% higher data rate for the cases investigated.}

	abstract = {Future wireless networks must provide ever higher data rates. The available bandwidth increases roughly linearly as we increase the carrier frequency, but the range shrinks drastically. This paper explores if we can instead reach massive capacities using spatial multiplexing over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, the rank of the MIMO channel matrix depends on the polarization and antenna arrangement. We optimize the rank and condition number by identifying the optimal antenna spacing in dual-polarized planar antenna arrays with imperfect isolation. The result is sparsely spaced antenna arrays that exploit radiative near-field properties. We further optimize the array geometry for minimum aperture length and aperture area, which leads to different configurations. Moreover, we prove analytically that for fixed-sized arrays, the MIMO rank grows quadratically with the carrier frequency in LOS scenarios, if the antennas are appropriately designed. Hence, MIMO technology contributes more to the capacity growth than the bandwidth. The numerical results show that massive data rates, far beyond 1 Tbps, can be reached both over fixed and mobile point-to-point links. It is also possible for a large base station to serve a practically-sized mobile device.}

	abstract = {In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks with the aim of effectively balancing sensing and communication (S&C) performance at the network level. Focusing on monostatic sensing, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&C performance, which facilitates us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize key network-level parameters. Based on the derived tractable expression of area spectral efficiency (ASE), we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the network performance from the view point of two joint S&C metrics. Towards this end, we further jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes for S&C and the serving/probing numbers of users/targets to achieve a flexible tradeoff between S&C at the network level. It is verified that interference nulling can effectively improve the average data rate and radar information rate. Surprisingly, the optimal communication tradeoff for ASE maximization tends to use all spatial resources for multiplexing and diversity gain, without interference nulling. In contrast, for sensing objectives, resource allocation tends to eliminate interference, especially when there are sufficient antenna resources, because inter-cell interference becomes a more dominant factor affecting sensing performance. This work first reveals the insight into spatial resource allocation for ISAC networks. Furthermore, we prove that the ratio of the optimal number of users and the number of transmit antennas is a constant value when the communication performance is optimal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme achieves a substantial gain in S&C performance at the network level.}

	abstract = {The advent of diverse frequency bands in 5G networks has promoted measurement studies focused on 5G signal propagation, aiming to understand its pathloss, coverage, and channel quality characteristics. Nonetheless, conducting a thorough 5G measurement campaign is markedly laborious given the large number of samples that must be collected. To alleviate this burden, the present contribution leverages principled active learning (AL) methods to prudently select only a few, yet most informative locations to collect samples. The core idea is to rely on a Gaussian Process (GP) model to efficiently extrapolate measurements throughout the coverage area. Specifically, an ensemble (E) of GP models is adopted that not only provides a rich learning function space, but also quantifies uncertainty, and can offer accurate predictions. Building on this EGP model, a suite of acquisition functions (AFs) are advocated to query new locations on-the-fly. To account for realistic scenaria, the proposed AFs are augmented with a novel distance-based AL rule that selects informative samples, while penalizing queries at long distances.

	abstract = {Intelligent metasurfaces are one of the favorite technologies for integrating sixth-generation (6G) networks, especially the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which has been extensively researched in various applications. Although many applications and studies of electromagnetic manipulation under the linear RIS topology were performed, applying coding sequences to the element switching enables the space-frequency scattering feature, referred to as Space-Time-Coding metasurface (STCM) topology. This type of topology causes impairments to the established communication methods by generating undesirable interference both in frequency and space, which is worsened when using wideband signals. Nevertheless, it can potentially bring forward useful features for sensing and localization. This work exploits STCM sensing capabilities in target detection, localization, and classification using narrowband downlink pilot signals at the base station (BS). The results of this novel approach reveal the ability to retrieve scattering points (SP) localization within the sub-centimeter and sub-decimeter accuracy depending on the SPs positions in space. We also analyze the associated detection and classification probabilities, which show reliable performance for both in the whole analyzed environment, especially when using the STCM information. We conclude that this method presents a promising approach for future integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) protocols by providing a tool to perform sensing and localization services using legacy communication signals.}

	abstract = {Joint channel selection and power control (JCSPC) is important to manage the interference in a heterogeneous network (HetNet), which consists of multiple base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) pairs. The JCSPC problem involves in a mixed continuous-discrete resource allocation and is typically NP-hard. Conventional methods usually obtain a quasi-optimal solution of the JCSPC problem in a centralized manner by assuming that the instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) is available. However, it is demanding to collect the instantaneous global CSI in practical scenarios. In this paper, we develop an intelligent cloud-edge collaboration assisted JCSPC algorithm. With the new algorithm, each BS can independently optimize its JCSPC policy with only local information, meanwhile enhance the sum-rate of the whole HetNet. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable and even better average sum-rate performance to the quasi-optimal method with a much lower time complexity.}

	abstract = {Semantic communication has emerged as new paradigm shifts in 6G from the conventional syntax-oriented communications. Recently, the wireless broadcast technology has been introduced to support semantic communication system toward higher communication efficiency. Nevertheless, existing broadcast semantic communication systems target on general representation within one stage and fail to balance the inference accuracy among users. In this paper, the broadcast encoding process is decomposed into compression and fusion to improve communication efficiency with adaptation to tasks and channels. Particularly, we propose multiple task-channel-aware sub-encoders (TCEs) and a channel-aware feature fusion sub-encoder (CFE) towards compression and fusion, respectively. In TCEs, multiple local-channel-aware attention blocks are employed to extract and compress task-relevant information for each user. In GFE, we introduce a global-channel-aware fine-tuning block to merge these compressed task-relevant signals into a compact broadcast signal. Notably, we retrieve the bottleneck in DeepBroadcast and leverage information bottleneck theory to further optimize the parameter tuning of TCEs and CFE. We substantiate our approach through experiments on a range of heterogeneous tasks across various channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, Rayleigh fading channel, and Rician fading channel. Simulation results evidence that the proposed DeepBroadcast outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

	abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising computing paradigm and can effectively reduce the energy consumption and computing costs at mobile devices by offloading computation-intensive and latency-sensitive applications/tasks to edge servers. However, how to achieve cost-effective dependent task offloading and resource allocation subject to application completion time constraint and service configuration constraint at edge side in heterogeneous MEC environments remains a challenge. To address this challenge, in this paper, we study the multi-application dependent task offloading and resource allocation problem in heterogeneous MEC environments for jointly minimizing the energy consumption and computing cost. We first formulate this problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We propose a two-stage alternating optimization algorithm. In the first stage, a genetic-based algorithm is proposed to determine an optimized task offloading profile for given transmit power matrix, a look ahead based task scheduling algorithm is designed to obtain an optimized task schedule for the profile. In the second stage, the transmit power allocation problem for a given offloading profile is solved using convex optimization techniques. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the total cost of task executions as compared with baseline algorithms.}

We first introduce beam based channel models (BBCM) in the space domain at each subcarrier and in the space-frequency domain for all subcarriers. Based on the BBCM in the space domain, we propose a beam structured detector (BSD) for each subcarrier. Specifically, we prove that the space domain detector design can be transformed into that of a beam domain detector without sacrificing optimality, and the asymptotically optimal space domain detector is beam structured with a low-dimensional beam domain detector, thus significantly reducing the design and implementation complexities. Furthermore, we extend the BSD to the space-frequency domain based on the BBCM jointly for all subcarriers. The design of space-frequency domain detector is also converted to that of a low-dimensional beam domain detector, which enables a very efficient design and implementation of BSD. Simulation results demonstrate the low complexity and satisfactory performance of the proposed detectors.}

It is assumed that the user (UE)-RIS and UE- base station (BS) channels experience correlated Rayleigh fading and the RIS-BS link is line of sight (LOS). We present simplified versions of the derived mean SNR expression for the correlation extremes (no correlation and full correlation) in the UE-RIS and UE-BS channels. The derived mean SNR expression is then leveraged to analytically characterise the impact of error variances from the channel estimation process on the mean SNR. We show that as the error variances increase, the mean SNR expression reduces to that of a system with randomly selected RIS phases. Consequently, the growth in mean SNR reduces from \\mathcal {O}(N^{2}) to \\mathcal {O}(N) . Numerical results validate the analysis.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel hemispherical antenna array (HAA) designed for high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). A significant limitation of traditional rectangular antenna arrays for HAPS is that their antenna elements are oriented downward, resulting in low gains for distant users. Cylindrical antenna arrays were introduced to mitigate this drawback; however, their antenna elements face the horizon leading to suboptimal gains for users located beneath the HAPS. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce our HAA. An HAA’s antenna elements are strategically distributed across the surface of a hemisphere to ensure that each user is directly aligned with specific antenna elements. To maximize users’ minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we formulate an optimization problem. After performing analog beamforming, we introduce an antenna selection algorithm and show that this method achieves optimality when a substantial number of antenna elements are selected for each user. Additionally, we employ the bisection method to determine the optimal power allocation for each user. Our simulation results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed HAA outperforms the conventional arrays, and provides uniform rates across the entire coverage area. With a 20 MHz communication bandwidth, and a 50 dBm total power, the proposed approach reaches sum rates of 14 Gbps.}

However, the research work on RSMA-assisted MEC systems is still at the infancy and many design issues remain unsolved, such as the MEC server and channel allocation problem in general multi-server and multi-channel scenarios as well as the user fairness issues. In this regard, we study an RSMA-assisted MEC system with multiple MEC servers, channels and devices, and consider the fairness among devices. A max-min fairness computation offloading problem to maximize the minimum computation offloading rate is investigated. Since the problem is difficult to solve optimally, we develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Particularly, the time allocation and the computing frequency allocation are derived as closed-form functions of the transmit power allocation and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, while the transmit power allocation and the SIC decoding order are jointly optimized via the alternating optimization method, the bisection search method and the successive convex approximation method. For the channel and MEC server allocation problem, we transform it into a hypergraph matching problem and solve it by matching theory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA-assisted MEC system outperforms current MEC systems under various system setups.}

Due to the short wavelength and high directivity of optical signals, OWC has high requirements for precise positioning and beam alignment, which additionally increases the positioning and computing burden of the base station. In order to solve this pain point problem, this paper proposes an optical integrated sensing and communication system based on combination of optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) and photodiode (PD) array. This system enables the integration of sensing and communication functionalities with a single transmission, a single device, and ultimately a single network infrastructure, which saves a lot of resources and improves system performance. Based on the OWC channel model and the OIRS physical model, we deduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of channel fading and the closed-form expression of system performance, which shows the influence of various parameters on performance. Simulations have been performed to verify the accuracy of the derived results. Based on theoretical results and simulation results, we make suggestions for system design.}

This paper explores a superimposed-pilot-(SP)-assisted CF mMIMO system which avoids the separate pilot training duration by superimposing pilot symbols onto data symbols. We consider spatial-correlated Rician fading channels with and without random phase shifts, where linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimators are performed at each access point locally. Then, we derive the closed-form SE expressions with maximal-ratio (MR) combining. To fill the gap, we introduce novel expressions of MMSE combining vectors and compare their SE performance with approximate MMSE combining vectors. Next, a generic model is provided for the optimal large-scale fading decoding (LSFD), and we derive the closed-form suboptimal LSFD solutions with MR combining. A line-of-sight-based combining scheme is proposed based on the approximate analysis, where closed-form SE expressions are derived using MR and MMSE combining and corresponding optimal LSFD coefficients. Numerical results show that the combination of MMSE and optimal LSFD yields almost 200% enhancement over the combination of MR and simple centralized decoding in 95% likely per-user SE without phase shifts, and 111% enhancement when phase shifts exist.}

We start by analyzing the minimum number of sensors and show that at least two sensors with known positions are needed for this problem. For the case of all sensors at known positions, we formulate a weighted least squares (WLS) problem with the capability of bias reduction, called the bias-reduced WLS (BR-WLS) problem, to limit the bias caused by the transformation of the measurement models. The BR-WLS problem has a closed-form solution, and thus, solving it is very computationally efficient. For the case where only part of the sensors are at known positions, we first theoretically analyze the performance gain by including the sensors at unknown positions for localization, and then extend the proposed BR-WLS method to jointly estimate the object motion parameters and the unknown sensor positions. For both cases, we show that the localization mean square error (MSE) can reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) when the noise is small and Gaussian distributed. Moreover, we also derive the theoretical expressions of the residual biases for the object position and velocity estimation by the proposed solutions. Simulation results confirm the good performance of the proposed solutions and also validate the theoretical results.}

To alleviate the communication burden between the edge devices and the access point, we introduce a pioneering digital over-the-air computation strategy employing q-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, culminating in a low latency communication scheme. Indeed, we propose a new federated edge learning framework in which edge devices use digital modulation for over-the-air uplink transmission to the edge server while they have no access to the channel state information. Furthermore, we incorporate multiple antennas at the edge server to overcome the fading inherent in wireless communication. We analyze the number of antennas required to mitigate the fading impact effectively. We prove a non-asymptotic upper bound for the mean squared error for the proposed federated learning with digital over-the-air uplink transmissions under both noisy and fading conditions. Leveraging the derived upper bound, we characterize the convergence rate of the learning process of a non-convex loss function in terms of the mean square error of gradients due to the fading channel. Furthermore, we substantiate the theoretical assurances through numerical experiments concerning mean square error and the convergence efficacy of the digital federated edge learning framework. Notably, the results demonstrate that augmenting the number of antennas at the edge server and adopting higher-order modulations improve the model accuracy up to 60%.}

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to develop hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted downlink transmission. First, for the single-input single-output (SISO) scenario, i.e., each node is equipped with a single antenna, a novel hybrid NOMA scheme is introduced, where NOMA is implemented as an add-on of a legacy time division multiple access (TDMA) network. Because of the simplicity of the SISO scenario, analytical results can be developed to reveal important properties of downlink hybrid NOMA. For example, in the case that the users’ channel gains are ordered and the durations of their time slots are the same, downlink hybrid NOMA is shown to always outperform TDMA, which is different from the existing conclusion for uplink hybrid NOMA. Second, the proposed downlink SISO hybrid NOMA scheme is extended to the multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenario, i.e., the base station has multiple antennas. For the MISO scenario, near-field communication is considered to illustrate how NOMA can be used as an add-on in legacy networks based on space division multiple access and TDMA. Simulation results verify the developed analytical results and demonstrate the superior performance of downlink hybrid NOMA compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access.}

	abstract = {Wi-Fi sensing applications have achieved remarkable results over the last decade, offering accurate device-free localization and gesture recognition capabilities. Indeed, Wi-Fi sensing has quickly become a critical field of research for future communication systems under the paradigm known as joint communication and sensing. However, device-free wireless sensing can also be exploited for malign purposes against unaware victims, and the omnipresence of Wi-Fi transceivers poses a significant threat to people’s privacy. Therefore, it is essential to develop functional solutions that can effectively thwart wireless sensing. All the current attempts to hinder illegitimate wireless sensing rely on specialized hardware deployed in the environment, but their cost and complexity can undermine widespread deployment. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using native capabilities of Wi-Fi systems, namely beamforming, to thwart wireless sensing. To this end, we propose for the first time a solution that enables complete control over the beamforming in commercial Wi-Fi devices. On top of that, we build BeamDancer, which randomizes beamforming vectors to inhibit channel fingerprinting. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution against three different wireless sensing techniques, both data-driven and model-based, while preserving almost entirely the legitimate Wi-Fi traffic at the same time.}

	abstract = {The codebook-based analog beamforming is appealing for future terahertz (THz) communications since it can generate high-gain directional beams with low-cost phase shifters via low-complexity beam training. However, conventional beamforming codebook design based on array response vectors for narrowband communications may suffer from severe performance loss in wideband systems due to the “beam squint” effect over frequency. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a new codebook design method for analog beamforming in wideband THz systems. In particular, to characterize the analog beamforming performance in wideband systems, we propose a new metric termed wideband beam gain, which is given by the minimum beamforming gain over the entire frequency band given a target angle. Based on this metric, a wideband analog beamforming codebook design problem is formulated for optimally balancing the beamforming gains in both the spatial and frequency domains, and the performance loss of conventional narrowband beamforming in wideband systems is analyzed. To solve the new wideband beamforming codebook design problem, we divide the spatial domain into orthogonal angular zones each associated with one beam, thereby decoupling the codebook design into a zone division sub-problem and a set of beamforming optimization sub-problems each for one zone. For the zone division sub-problem, we propose a bisection method to obtain the optimal boundaries for separating adjacent zones. While for each of the per-zone-based beamforming optimization sub-problems, we further propose an efficient augmented Lagrange method (ALM) to solve it. Numerical results demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposed codebook design for wideband analog beamforming to the narrowband beamforming codebook and also validate our performance analysis.}

	abstract = {To tackle the issue of heterogeneous input raw data samples obtained by different devices and enhance the feature extraction capability of edge devices, we propose a vertically split neural network based edge-device collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) inference framework. The local results calculated by various light-size sub-networks at edge devices are transmitted and aggregated at the server for the downstream inference task. Nevertheless, the transmission of such high-dimensional local results involves severe communication overhead. To resolve this issue, the technique of over-the-air computation (AirComp) is adopted to enable low-latency aggregation. The same entry of all devices’ local results is transmitted over a same wireless resource block and aggregated via the waveform superposition property. Furthermore, to simultaneously support the aggregation of all dimensions of the local results, we consider a broadband channel and leverage orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to divide the system bandwidth into multiple subcarriers which are then assigned for different dimensions. Consequently, an extra degree of freedom is introduced to design the aggregation of all dimensions. We then propose a scheme of joint subcarrier allocation, power allocation, and receiver beamforming to minimize the aggregation distortion and enhance inference performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed design over benchmarks.}

	abstract = {The development of sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies is confronted with the significant challenge of spectrum resource shortage. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) system. Specifically, the underlying secondary network in the proposed CR system reuses the same frequency resources occupied by the primary network with the help of the STAR-RIS. The secondary network sum rate maximization problem is first formulated for the STAR-RIS aided MIMO CR system. The adoption of STAR-RIS necessitates an intricate beamforming design for the considered system due to its large number of coupled coefficients. The block coordinate descent method is employed to address the formulated optimization problem. In each iteration, the beamformers at the secondary base station (SBS) are optimized by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem. Concurrently, the STAR-RIS passive beamforming problem is resolved using tailored algorithms designed for the two phase-shift models: 1) For the independent phase-shift model, a successive convex approximation-based algorithm is proposed; 2) For the coupled phase-shift model, a penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is conceived, in which the phase shifts and amplitudes of the STAR-RIS elements are optimized using closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that: 1) The proposed STAR-RIS aided CR communication framework can significantly enhance the sum rate of the secondary system; 2) The coupled phase-shift model results in limited performance degradation compared to the independent phase-shift model.}

	abstract = {In wireless networks, the transmitter adapts its parameters based on the receiver’s feedback to achieve a high throughput. The throughput also depends on factors like interference level and channel gain, which can be measured at the transmitter. They provide useful information about the instantaneous throughput as well. For example, higher interference implies a lower throughput. This work treats any measurable quality with a non-zero correlation with the throughput as side information (SI). We also study how it can be exploited to quickly learn the channel that offers higher throughput (reward). When the mean value of the SI is known, using control variate theory, we develop online learning algorithms that require fewer samples to learn and can improve the learning rate compared to cases where SI is ignored. Specifically, we incorporated SI in the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and proposed the UCBwSI algorithm. We quantify the gain achieved in terms of the regret and show that the improvement in regret over state-of-the-art UCB is proportional to the correlation between the reward and SI. Simulations demonstrate a 5-10% improvement in the bit-error rate. Even when the mean of the SI is unknown, we demonstrate the superiority of the UCBwSI over UCB.}

In this paper, we develop an algorithmic solution that shows how RISs can also enhance the positioning performance in a joint localization and communication setting, even when hardware impairments are considered. We propose a realistic system architecture that considers the clock offset between the transmitter and the receiver, impairments at transmit and receive arrays, and mutual coupling between the RIS elements. We formulate the estimation of the composite channel in a RIS-aided mmWave system as a multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit problem, which can be solved with high accuracy and low complexity, even when operating with large antenna arrays as required at mmWave. In addition, we introduce a dictionary learning stage to calibrate the hardware impairments at the user array. To complete our design, we devise a localization scheme that exploits the estimated composite channel while accounting for the clock offset between the transmitter and the receiver. Numerical results show how RIS-aided mmWave systems can significantly improve the localization accuracy in a realistic 3D indoor scenario simulated by ray tracing.}

	abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has attracted growing interests for enabling the future 6G wireless networks, due to its capability of sharing spectrum and hardware resources between communication and sensing systems. However, existing works on ISAC usually need to modify the communication protocol to cater for the new sensing performance requirement, which may be difficult to implement in practice. In this paper, we study a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system by exploiting the established beam scanning operation for simultaneous mmWave communications and sensing. First, we propose a two-phase ISAC protocol, consisting of beam scanning and data transmission. Specifically, in the beam scanning phase, the semi-passive IRS finds the optimal beam for reflecting signals from the base station to a communication user via its passive elements and, meanwhile, directly estimates the angle of a nearby target based on echo signals from the target using its active sensing elements. In the data transmission phase, the sensing accuracy is further improved by leveraging the data signals via possible IRS beam splitting. Next, we derive the achievable rate of the communication user as well as the Cramér-Rao bound and the approximate mean square error of the target angle estimation. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to verify our analysis as well as the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed to enhance coverage performance in millimeter-wave bands by providing alternative links between access points and user devices in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. However, the previously-studied reflective RISs (R-RISs) only offer 180° coverage, with most studies focusing on links with one R-RIS. Recently, transmissive-reflective RISs (T-RISs) that can provide 360° coverage have been proposed. In order to understand performance limits of both types of RISs, stochastic geometry is employed to analyze connection probability when R-RISs and T-RISs are used with single-RIS and multi-RIS links. The connection probability for single-RIS links and an upper bound on connection probability for multi-RIS links are derived with sparse obstacle distributions where independence of line-of-sight (LOS) statuses of different links can be assumed. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulations. Additionally, a comparison is provided between single-RIS and two-RIS links, as well as between R-RISs and T-RISs. Numerical evaluation using Nakagami fading propagation and a sectored antenna model shows that single-RIS links offer substantial coverage improvement for shorter-distance communications, whereas two-RIS links are more effective for longer-range communications. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate that, under the same model, T-RISs exhibit significantly improved coverage compared to R-RISs, especially with denser obstacle distribution.}

	abstract = {Movable antenna (MA) is an innovative technology that facilitates the repositioning of antennas within the transmitter/receiver area to enhance channel conditions and communication performance. This paper proposes a new base station (BS) architecture employing multiple MAs for improving the multiuser network performance. First, the uplink multiple access channel (MAC) is modeled to capture the characteristics of the variation of wireless channels caused by the movement of MAs at the BS. Subsequently, we propose to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple users for MA-aided multiuser uplink transmissions by joint optimization of the MAs’ positions, their receive combining at the BS, and the transmit power of users, subject to the MAs’ positions-related constraints and the maximum transmit power of each user. To tackle this highly non-convex max-min fairness problem, we propose a two-loop iterative algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO). Specifically, the outer-loop updates the positions of a set of particles, where each particle’s position corresponds to one realization of the antenna position vector (APV) of all MAs. The inner-loop conducts the fitness evaluation for each particle, determining the max-min achievable rate for multiple users based on the current APV. Therein, for given APV, the receive combining matrix at the BS and the transmit power for each user are optimized using the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique. To further reduce the computational complexity, we develop an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm via iteratively updating the APV, combining matrix, and transmit power. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the antenna position optimization for MAs-aided BSs can significantly improve the rate performance as compared to conventional BSs with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel split learning (SL) framework, referred to as SplitMAC, which reduces the latency of SL by leveraging simultaneous uplink transmission over multiple access channels. The key strategy is to divide devices into multiple groups and allow the devices within the same group to simultaneously transmit their smashed data and device-side models over the multiple access channels. The optimization problem of device grouping to minimize SL latency is formulated, and the benefit of device grouping in reducing the uplink latency of SL is theoretically derived. By examining a two-device grouping case, two asymptotically-optimal algorithms are devised for device grouping in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios, respectively. By merging these algorithms, a near-optimal device grouping algorithm is proposed to cover a wide range of SNR. Although our theoretical analysis holds only for the two-device case, our SL framework is also extended to consider practical fading channels and to support a general group size. Simulation results demonstrate that our SL framework with the proposed device grouping algorithm is superior to existing SL frameworks in reducing SL latency.}

	abstract = {Existing Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) techniques offer a promise for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) by managing interference and ensuring reliable data transmission. However, precoder design remains a crucial bottleneck, demanding accurate Channel State Information (CSI) feedback and complex optimization, which are challenging in practical deployment. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel Deep Learning (DL)-based method to predict the precoder design from the historical CSI directly. In particular, we first establish a predictive beamforming protocol for precoder design using historical CSI, bypassing the need for constant feedback and reducing complexity. Subsequently, we formulate a general problem for precoder design, with the Weighted Ergodic Sum Rate (WESR) serving as the objective function. Solving this problem is particularly challenging due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels in NTNs. To address this, we designed a fusion model, named TranCN, which harnesses the strengths of Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatial-temporal features from historical CSI, thereby enhancing precoder performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our predictive beamforming scheme enables RSMA to adapt to dynamic channel conditions using historical CSI, surpassing baseline methods and improving data transmission resilience.}

	abstract = {In high-dynamic low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) systems, frequent channel state information (CSI) acquisition consumes a large number of pilots, which is intolerable in resource-limited SATCOM systems. To tackle this problem, we propose to track the state-dependent parameters including Doppler shift and channel angles, by exploiting the physical and approximate on-orbit mobility characteristics for LEO satellite and ground users (GUs), respectively. As a prerequisite for tracking, we formulate the state evolution models for kinematic (state) parameters of both satellite and GUs, along with the measurement models that describe the relationship between the state-dependent parameters and states. Then the rough estimation of state-dependent parameters is initially conducted, which is used as the measurement results in the subsequent state tracking. Concurrently, the measurement error covariance is predicted based on the formulated Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Finally, with the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based state tracking as the bridge, the Doppler shift and channel angles can be further updated and the CSI can also be acquired. Simulation results show that compared to the rough estimation methods, the proposed joint parameter and channel tracking (JPCT) algorithm performs much better in the estimation of state-dependent parameters. Moreover, as to the CSI acquisition, the proposed algorithm can utilize a shorter pilot sequence than benchmark methods under a given estimation accuracy.}

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) facilitates rapid channel modeling for 5G and beyond wireless communication systems. Many existing ML techniques utilize a city map to construct the radio map; however, an updated city map may not always be available. This paper proposes to employ the received signal strength (RSS) data to jointly construct the radio map and the virtual environment by exploiting the geometry structure of the environment. In contrast to many existing ML approaches that lack of an environment model, we develop a virtual obstacle model and characterize the geometry relation between the propagation paths and the virtual obstacles. A multi-screen knife-edge model is adopted to extract the key diffraction features, and these features are fed into a neural network (NN) for diffraction representation. To describe the scattering, as oppose to most existing methods that directly input an entire city map, our model focuses on the geometry structure from the local area surrounding the transmitter and receiver, and the spatial invariance of such local geometry structure is exploited. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing a 3D virtual environment, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in radio map construction with 10\\%- 18\\%\naccuracy improvements. It can also reduce 20% data and 50% training epochs when transferred to a new environment.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based bandwidth allocation policy that is: 1) scalable with the number of users and 2) transferable to different communication scenarios, such as non-stationary wireless channels, different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, and dynamically available resources. To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by 8.79%, and sample efficiency by 73%, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization. Numerical results validate that our HML can reduce the computation time by approximately 200 to 2000 times than the optimal iterative algorithm.}

	abstract = {This article investigates a reliable and secure wireless-powered communication system assisted by a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) serving indoor and outdoor users. To align with practical application, we consider two eavesdropping conditions: mixed and indirect eavesdropping links. To improve the reliability and security of downlink energy transfer (ET) and uplink information transmission (IT), we propose four STAR-RIS schemes utilizing time-switching (TS) and energy-splitting (ES) protocols: 1) The dual-TS (DTS) scheme employs the TS protocol for both downlink ET and uplink IT; 2) The mixed ES-TS (MET) scheme switches from the ES protocol in downlink ET to the TS protocol in uplink IT; 3) The dual-ES (DES) scheme employs the ES protocol for both downlink ET and uplink IT; 4) The mixed TS-ES (MTE) scheme switches from the TS protocol in downlink ET to the ES protocol in uplink IT. Further, accurate and asymptotic connection outage probability, secrecy outage probability, and effective secrecy throughput are analyzed for each proposed scheme. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that: 1) At high transmission power or with a large number of STAR-RIS elements, the MTE scheme achieves the highest reliability. Conversely, the DES scheme provides the best reliability at lower transmission power or with fewer STAR-RIS elements; 2) Under indirect eavesdropping links, the DES scheme achieves the highest security, followed by the MTE, MET, and DTS schemes. However, this performance order is reversed under mixed eavesdropping links; 3) The DES scheme achieves the best overall performance, followed by the MTE, MET, and DTS schemes, all of which outperform the benchmark schemes.}

	abstract = {One of the essential factors for enabling sixth-generation systems is efficiently ensuring diverse quality-of-service (QoS) performance metrics to support the upcoming massive ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). This work proposes efficient transmission control in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime that statistically guarantee stringent URLLC QoS requirements. Thus, we formulate a nonconvex problem that maximizes the sum effective capacity (SEC) while ensuring statistical delay QoS constraints. To make the problem more tractable, we propose a tight upper bound for the objective function based on Jensen’s inequality and employ the concept of opportunistically minimizing an expectation. Then, we decompose the problem into two subproblems: active beamforming at the base station and phase-shift optimization at the IRS. Each subproblem is convexified by employing slack variables, penalty functions, and linear approximation, and solved using successive convex approximations. The subproblems are iteratively solved until convergence using alternating optimization. The convergence to a suboptimal stationary solution and the computing complexity of the proposed algorithm are rigorously analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical evaluations confirm that the proposed control in the FBL regime significantly improves the SEC under various QoS parameters compared to existing benchmark schemes. In particular, as the number of antennas and IRS elements increases, the proposed method becomes more efficient than the semi-definite relaxation-based approach in terms of complexity and performance.}

	abstract = {In this work, we consider a backscatter communication system wherein multiple asynchronous sources (tags) exploit the reverberation generated by a nearby radar transmitter as an ambient carrier to deliver a message to a common destination (reader) through a number of available subchannels. We propose a new encoding strategy wherein each tag transmits both pilot and data symbols on each subchannel and repeats some of the data symbols on multiple subchannels. We then exploit this signal structure to derive two semi-blind iterative algorithms for joint estimation of the data symbols and the subchannel responses that are also able to handle some missing measurements. The proposed encoding/decoding strategies are scalable with the number of tags and their payload and can achieve different tradeoffs in terms of transmission and error rates. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the merits of the proposed solutions.}

	abstract = {Owing to its ability to offer collaborative data utilization while ensuring data privacy, federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm to enable cooperative intelligent tasks across multiple low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, such as carbon estimation, traffic surveillance, and forest fire detection. Although the advantages of pushing intelligence to satellites are multi-fold, limited communication channels along with the rigid global model aggregation conditions result in dramatic convergence delays. In order to reduce the convergence time, we propose an asynchronous FL framework in LEO satellite networks by exploiting multiple high-altitude platforms for model aggregation, where the advanced over-the-air computation (AirComp) transmission scheme is utilized for the sake of further reducing energy consumption. Considering the practical constraint of AirComp signal distortion, the objective function of optimizing FL performance is carefully formulated and solved by the proposed quantity-quality jointed linkage search algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed asynchronous FL framework outperforms the conventional synchronous FL framework by a decline of 30.07% in convergence time at most. It also provides an average increase of 110% and 580%, respectively, in terms of throughput and energy efficiency in all scenarios considered. Overall, our study presents a beneficial asynchronous FL framework and a fast aggregation scheduling algorithm in LEO satellite networks, accelerating the convergence of the global model with reduced energy expenditure.}

	abstract = {The codebook-based scheme for intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) decouples the training and control signaling overheads from the number of IRS elements by selecting the IRS reflection pattern from a pre-specified codebook. We analyze the performance of a training scheme that exploits a novel trade-off between the powers allocated for selection pilots, which are used to select the reflection pattern, and the demodulation pilot, which is used for estimating the channel for demodulation. We develop a selection-aware linear minimum mean-square error estimator of the effective channel gain of the selected reflection pattern. When the direct link is blocked, we derive an elegant closed-form expression for the beamforming gain. When the direct link is present, which requires a different analysis, we derive a novel upper bound and insightful asymptotic expressions for the beamforming gain. We then present a novel expression for the achievable rate that accounts for the impact of noisy channel estimates on both selection of the reflection pattern and demodulation of data. We optimize the pilot and data powers and the codebook size. Our approach yields a significantly better rate than conventional schemes, and establishes the advantages of allocating substantially different powers to the selection and demodulation pilots and data.}

However, the sensing function will affect the communication performance in cellular networks. To study the sensing and communication performance of PMNs and their interactions, this paper investigates a millimeter-wave PMN with dual-functional base stations (BSs) for simultaneous detection of unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and user communication via the unified transmit signal and beamforming. We develop a system-level theoretical framework to investigate the sensing and communication performance of PMNs based on stochastic geometry, which captures the mutual interference and resource contention between the two functions and builds a foundation for the optimization of network configurations. In addition, by leveraging the collaboration of multiple BSs in PMNs, we propose a cooperative sensing strategy combining the monostatic and bistatic sensing processes to enhance the reliability of UAV surveillance. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical framework and demonstrate the benefits of cooperative sensing in UAV detection and communication performance, as compared with the standalone sensing by individual BSs.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of scalable user-centric (UC) distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (D-mMIMO) systems with multiple central processing units (CPUs), commonly called cell-free mMIMO. Specifically, a framework incorporating processing capacity and inter-CPU communication constraints is proposed. Two methods are presented for limiting the number of radio units (RUs) serving each user equipment (UE). The first method is performed by the CPUs, while the second one is implemented at the UEs and RUs. Both methods prevent the computational complexity (CC) for channel estimation and precoding signals from increasing with the number of RUs. The backhaul signaling demands are presented and modeled, and it is considered that each CPU can serve only a restricted number of UEs managed by other CPUs to mitigate inter-CPU communication. Two strategies to adjust the RU clusters according to the network implementations are also proposed. We compare the proposed approaches with a traditional scalable UC system. Simulation results reveal that the proposed techniques allow UC systems to keep their spectral efficiency (SE) under minor degradation while reducing the CC by 98% and improving energy efficiency (EE). Besides, managing inter-CPU communication controls backhaul traffic effectively, and RU cluster adjustments further reduce CC.}
