	abstract = {Energy forecasting using Renewable energy sources (RESs) is gradually gaining weight in the research field due to the benefits it presents to the modern-day environment. Not only does energy forecasting using renewable energy sources help mitigate the greenhouse effect, it also helps to conserve energy for future use. Over the years, several methods for energy forecasting have been proposed, all of which were more concerned with the accuracy of the prediction models with little or no considerations to the operating environment. This research, however, proposes the uses of Deep Neural Network (DNN) for energy forecasting on mobile devices at the edge of the network. This ensures low latency and communication overhead for all energy forecasting operations since they are carried out at the network periphery. Nevertheless, the cloud would be used as a support for the mobile devices by providing permanent storage for the locally generated data and a platform for offloading resource-intensive computations that exceed the capabilities of the local mobile devices as well as security for them. Electrical network topology was proposed which allows seamless incorporation of multiple RESs into the distributed renewable energy source (D-RES) network. Moreover, a novel grid control algorithm that uses the forecasting model to administer a well-coordinated and effective control for renewable energy sources (RESs) in the electrical network is designed. The electrical network was simulated with two RESs and a DNN model was used to create a forecasting model for the simulated network. The model was trained using a dataset from a solar power generation company in Belgium (elis) and was experimented with a different number of layers to determine the optimum architecture for performing the forecasting operations. The performance of each architecture was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE) and the r-square.}

	abstract = {Functional encryption (FE) is a novel paradigm for encryption scheme which allows tremendous flexibility in accessing encrypted information. In FE, a user can learn specific function of encrypted messages by restricted functional key and reveal nothing else about the messages. Inner product encryption (IPE) is a special type of functional encryption where the decryption algorithm, given a ciphertext related to a vector x and a secret key related to a vector y, computes the inner product x·y. In this paper, we construct an efficient private-key functional encryption (FE) for inner product with simulation-based security, which is much stronger than indistinguishability-based security, under the External Decisional Linear assumption in the standard model. Compared with the existing schemes, our construction is faster in encryption and decryption, and the master secret key, secret keys and ciphertexts are shorter.}

In the modern industry, the user often stores data collected by IoT devices in the cloud, but the data at the edge of the network involves a large of the sensitive information, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In order to address these two challenges, we propose a security strategy in the edge computing. Our security strategy combines the Feistel architecture and short comparable encryption based on sliding window (SCESW). Compared to existing security strategies, our proposed security strategy guarantees its security while significantly reducing the computational overhead. And our GRC algorithm can be successfully deployed on a hardware platform.}

	abstract = {Decompilation aims to analyze and transform low-level program language (PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis, malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications (e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides, we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron’s average program accuracy is 96.96%, which is better than the traditional NMT model.}

One source of complexity in such systems is due to the intra-system interactions and inter-dependencies. Consequently, these systems are a potential target for attackers. When one or more of these infrastructure are attacked, the connected systems may also be affected due to potential cascading effects. In this paper, we report a study to investigate the cascading effects of cyber-attacks on two interdependent critical infrastructure namely, a Secure water treatment plant (SWaT) and a Water Distribution System (WADI).}

	abstract = {Anomaly detection has been an essential and dynamic research area in the data mining. A wide range of applications including different social medias have adopted different state-of-the-art methods to identify anomaly for ensuring user’s security and privacy. The social network refers to a forum used by different groups of people to express their thoughts, communicate with each other, and share the content needed. This social networks also facilitate abnormal activities, spread fake news, rumours, misinformation, unsolicited messages, and propaganda post malicious links. Therefore, detection of abnormalities is one of the important data analysis activities for the identification of normal or abnormal users on the social networks. In this paper, we have developed a hybrid anomaly detection method named DT-SVMNB that cascades several machine learning algorithms including decision tree (C5.0), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayesian classifier (NBC) for classifying normal and abnormal users in social networks. We have extracted a list of unique features derived from users’ profile and contents. Using two kinds of dataset with the selected features, the proposed machine learning model called DT-SVMNB is trained. Our model classifies users as depressed one or suicidal one in the social network. We have conducted an experiment of our model using synthetic and real datasets from social network. The performance analysis demonstrates around 98% accuracy which proves the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system.}

Unfortunately, this has attracted the attention of cybercriminals who made IoT a target of malicious activities, opening the door to a possible attack on the end nodes. To this end, Numerous IoT intrusion detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed in the literature to tackle attacks on the IoT ecosystem, which can be broadly classified based on detection technique, validation strategy, and deployment strategy. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review of contemporary IoT IDS and an overview of techniques, deployment Strategy, validation strategy and datasets that are commonly applied for building IDS. We also review how existing IoT IDS detect intrusive attacks and secure communications on the IoT. It also presents the classification of IoT attacks and discusses future research challenges to counter such IoT attacks to make IoT more secure. These purposes help IoT security researchers by uniting, contrasting, and compiling scattered research efforts. Consequently, we provide a unique IoT IDS taxonomy, which sheds light on IoT IDS techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, IoT attacks that exploit IoT communication systems, corresponding advanced IDS and detection capabilities to detect IoT attacks.}

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure face serious threats of attack, motivating research into a wide variety of defence mechanisms such as those that monitor for violations of invariants, i.e. logical properties over sensor and actuator states that should always be true. Many approaches for identifying invariants attempt to do so automatically, typically using data logs, but these can miss valid system properties if relevant behaviours are not well-represented in the data. Furthermore, as the CPS is already built, resolving any design flaws or weak points identified through this process is costly. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants from an analysis of a CPS design, based on principles of the axiomatic design methodology from design science. Our method iteratively decomposes a high-level CPS design to identify sets of dependent design parameters (i.e. sensors and actuators), allowing for invariants and invariant checkers to be derived in parallel to the implementation of the system. We apply our method to the designs of two CPS testbeds, SWaT and WADI, deriving a suite of invariant checkers that are able to detect a variety of single- and multi-stage attacks without any false positives. Finally, we reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, how it can be complemented by other defence mechanisms, and how it could help engineers to identify and resolve weak points in a design before the controllers of a CPS are implemented.}

	abstract = {Reading text in images automatically has become an attractive research topic in computer vision. Specifically, end-to-end spotting of scene text has attracted significant research attention, and relatively ideal accuracy has been achieved on several datasets. However, most of the existing works overlooked the semantic connection between the scene text instances, and had limitations in situations such as occlusion, blurring, and unseen characters, which result in some semantic information lost in the text regions. The relevance between texts generally lies in the scene images. From the perspective of cognitive psychology, humans often combine the nearby easy-to-recognize texts to infer the unidentifiable text. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method for intermediate semantic features enhancement, called Text Relation Networks. Specifically, we model the co-occurrence relationship of scene texts as a graph. The nodes in the graph represent the text instances in a scene image, and the corresponding semantic features are defined as representations of the nodes. The relative positions between text instances are measured as the weights of edges in the established graph. Then, a convolution operation is performed on the graph to aggregate semantic information and enhance the intermediate features corresponding to text instances. We evaluate the proposed method through comprehensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks, and get highly competitive results. For example, on the SCUT-CTW1500, our method surpasses the previous top works by 2.1% on the word spotting task.}

	abstract = {The IEEE 1588 precision time protocol (PTP) is very important for many industrial sectors and applications that require time synchronization accuracy between computers down to microsecond and even nanosecond levels. Nevertheless, PTP and its underlying network infrastructure are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can stealthily reduce the time synchronization accuracy to unacceptable and even damage-causing levels for individual clocks or an entire network, leading to financial loss or even physical destruction. Existing security protocol extensions only partially address this problem. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of strategies for advanced persistent threats to PTP infrastructure, possible attacker locations, and the impact on clock and network synchronization in the presence of security protocol extensions, infrastructure redundancy, and protocol redundancy. It distinguishes between attack strategies and attacker types as described in RFC7384, but further distinguishes between the spoofing and time source attack, the simple internal attack, and the advanced internal attack. Some experiments were conducted to demonstrate the impact of PTP attacks. Our analysis shows that a sophisticated attacker has a range of methodologies to compromise a PTP network. Moreover, all PTP infrastructure components can host an attacker, making the comprehensive protection of a PTP network against a malware infiltration, as for example exercised by Stuxnet, a very tedious task.}

	abstract = {Outside the explosive successful applications of deep learning (DL) in natural language processing, computer vision, and information retrieval, there have been numerous Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based alternatives for common security-related scenarios with malware detection among more popular. Recently, adversarial learning has gained much focus. However, unlike computer vision applications, malware adversarial attack is expected to guarantee malwares’ original maliciousness semantics. This paper proposes a novel adversarial instruction learning technique, DeepMal, based on an adversarial instruction learning approach for static malware detection. So far as we know, DeepMal is the first practical and systematical adversarial learning method, which could directly produce adversarial samples and effectively bypass static malware detectors powered by DL and machine learning (ML) models while preserving attack functionality in the real world. Moreover, our method conducts small-scale attacks, which could evade typical malware variants analysis (e.g., duplication check). We evaluate DeepMal on two real-world datasets, six typical DL models, and three typical ML models. Experimental results demonstrate that, on both datasets, DeepMal can attack typical malware detectors with the mean F1-score and F1-score decreasing maximal 93.94% and 82.86% respectively. Besides, three typical types of malware samples (Trojan horses, Backdoors, Ransomware) prove to preserve original attack functionality, and the mean duplication check ratio of malware adversarial samples is below 2.0%. Besides, DeepMal can evade dynamic detectors and be easily enhanced by learning more dynamic features with specific constraints.}

	abstract = {Due to its provable security and remarkable device-independence, masking has been widely accepted as a noteworthy algorithmic-level countermeasure against side-channel attacks. However, relatively high cost of masking severely limits its applicability. Considering the high tackling complexity of non-linear operations, most masked AES implementations focus on the security and cost reduction of masked S-boxes. In this paper, we focus on linear operations, which seems to be underestimated, on the contrary. Specifically, we discover some security flaws and redundant processes in popular first-order masked AES linear operations, and pinpoint the underlying root causes. Then we propose a provably secure and highly efficient masking scheme for AES linear operations. In order to show its practical implications, we replace the linear operations of state-of-the-art first-order AES masking schemes with our proposal, while keeping their original non-linear operations unchanged. We implement four newly combined masking schemes on an Intel Core i7-4790 CPU, and the results show they are roughly 20% faster than those original ones. Then we select one masked implementation named RSMv2 due to its popularity, and investigate its security and efficiency on an AVR ATMega163 processor and four different FPGA devices. The results show that no exploitable first-order side-channel leakages are detected. Moreover, compared with original masked AES implementations, our combined approach is nearly 25% faster on the AVR processor, and at least 70% more efficient on four FPGA devices.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we greatly increase the number of impossible differentials for SIMON and SIMECK by eliminating the 1-bit constraint in input/output difference, which is the precondition to ameliorate the complexity of attacks. We propose an algorithm which can greatly reduce the searching complexity to find such trails efficiently since the search space exponentially expands to find impossible differentials with multiple active bits. There is another situation leading to the contradiction in impossible differentials except for miss-in-the-middle. We show how the contradiction happens and conclude the precondition of it defined as miss-from-the-middle. It makes our results more comprehensive by applying these two approach simultaneously. This paper gives for the first time impossible differential characteristics with multiple active bits for SIMON and SIMECK, leading to a great increase in the number. The results can be verified not only by covering the state-of-art, but also by the MILP model.}

	abstract = {Malware analysis is a task of utmost importance in cyber-security. Two approaches exist for malware analysis: static and dynamic. Modern malware uses an abundance of techniques to evade both dynamic and static analysis tools. Current dynamic analysis solutions either make modifications to the running malware or use a higher privilege component that does the actual analysis. The former can be easily detected by sophisticated malware while the latter often induces a significant performance overhead. We propose a method that performs malware analysis within the context of the OS itself. Furthermore, the analysis component is camouflaged by a hypervisor, which makes it completely transparent to the running OS and its applications. The evaluation of the system’s efficiency suggests that the induced performance overhead is negligible.}

However, it is always facing unavoidable security risks, such as open-source code defects and security vulnerabilities. To find out the OSS risks in time, we carry out an empirical study to identify the indicators for evaluating the OSS. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the OSS assessment, we collect 56 papers from prestigious academic venues (such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, DBLP, and Google Scholar) in the past 21 years. During the process of the investigation, we first identify the main concerns for selecting OSS and distill five types of commonly used indicators to assess OSS. We then conduct a comparative analysis to discuss how these indicators are used in each surveyed study and their differences. Moreover, we further undertake a correlation analysis between these indicators and uncover 13 confirmed conclusions and four cases with controversy occurring in these studies. Finally, we discuss several possible applications of these conclusions, which are insightful for the research on OSS and software supply chain.}

	abstract = {Codes of Open Source Software (OSS) are widely reused during software development nowadays. However, reusing some specific versions of OSS introduces 1-day vulnerabilities of which details are publicly available, which may be exploited and lead to serious security issues. Existing state-of-the-art OSS reuse detection work can not identify the specific versions of reused OSS well. The features they selected are not distinguishable enough for version detection and the matching scores are only based on similarity.This paper presents B2SMatcher, a fine-grained version identification tool for OSS in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. We first discuss five kinds of version-sensitive code features that are trackable in both binary and source code. We categorize these features into program-level features and function-level features and propose a two-stage version identification approach based on the two levels of code features. B2SMatcher also identifies different types of OSS version reuse based on matching scores and matched feature instances. In order to extract source code features as accurately as possible, B2SMatcher innovatively uses machine learning methods to obtain the source files involved in the compilation and uses function abstraction and normalization methods to eliminate the comparison costs on redundant functions across versions. We have evaluated B2SMatcher using 6351 candidate OSS versions and 585 binaries. The result shows that B2SMatcher achieves a high precision up to 89.2% and outperforms state-of-the-art tools. Finally, we show how B2SMatcher can be used to evaluate real-world software and find some security risks in practice.}

	abstract = {SOHO (small office/home office) routers provide services for end devices to connect to the Internet, playing an important role in cyberspace. Unfortunately, security vulnerabilities pervasively exist in these routers, especially in the web server modules, greatly endangering end users. To discover these vulnerabilities, fuzzing web server modules of SOHO routers is the most popular solution. However, its effectiveness is limited due to the lack of input specification, lack of routers’ internal running states, and lack of testing environment recovery mechanisms. Moreover, existing works for device fuzzing are more likely to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities.In this paper, we propose a solution ESRFuzzer to address these issues. It is a fully automated fuzzing framework for testing physical SOHO devices. It continuously and effectively generates test cases by leveraging two input semantic models, i.e., KEY-VALUE data model and CONF-READ communication model, and automatically recovers the testing environment with power management. It also coordinates diversified mutation rules with multiple monitoring mechanisms to trigger multi-type vulnerabilities. With the guidance of the two semantic models, ESRFuzzer can work in two ways: general mode fuzzing and D-CONF mode fuzzing. General mode fuzzing can discover both issues which occur in the CONF and READ operation, while D-CONF mode fuzzing focus on the READ-op issues especially missed by general mode fuzzing.We ran ESRFuzzer on 10 popular routers across five vendors. In total, it discovered 136 unique issues, 120 of which have been confirmed as 0-day vulnerabilities we found. As an improvement of SRFuzzer, ESRFuzzer have discovered 35 previous undiscovered READ-op issues that belong to three vulnerability types, and 23 of them have been confirmed as 0-day vulnerabilities by vendors. The experimental results show that ESRFuzzer outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of types and number of vulnerabilities found.}

	abstract = {While consumers use the web to perform routine activities, they are under the constant threat of attack from malicious websites. Even when visiting ‘trusted’ sites, there is always a risk that site is compromised, and, hosting a malicious script. In this scenario, the injected script would typically force the victim’s browser to undergo a series of redirects before reaching an attacker-controlled domain, which, delivers the actual malware. Although these malicious redirection chains aim to frustrate detection and analysis efforts, they could be used to help identify web-based attacks. Building upon previous work, this paper presents the first known application of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect Exploit Kit (EK) traffic, utilising the structure of HTTP redirects. Samples are processed as sequences, where each timestep represents a redirect and contains a unique combination of 48 features. The experiment is conducted using a ground-truth dataset of 1279 EK and 5910 benign redirection chains. Hyper-parameters are tuned via K-fold cross-validation (5f-CV), with the optimal configuration achieving an F1 score of 0.9878 against the unseen test set. Furthermore, we compare the results of isolated feature categories to assess their importance.}

However, the existing quantum attacks on lightweight block ciphers only focused on the quantum exhaustive search, while the quantum attacks combined with classical cryptanalysis methods haven’t been well studied. In this paper, we study quantum key recovery attack on SIMON32/64 using Quantum Amplitude Amplification algorithm in Q1 model. At first, we reanalyze the quantum circuit complexity of quantum exhaustive search on SIMON32/64. We estimate the Clifford gates count more accurately and reduce the T gate count. Also, the T-depth and full depth is reduced due to our minor modifications. Then, using four differentials given by Biryukov in FSE 2014 as our distinguisher, we give our quantum key recovery attack on 19-round SIMON32/64. We treat the two phases of key recovery attack as two QAA instances separately, and the first QAA instance consists of four sub-QAA instances. Then, we design the quantum circuit of these two QAA instances and estimate their corresponding quantum circuit complexity. We conclude that the quantum circuit of our quantum key recovery attack is lower than quantum exhaustive search. Our work firstly studies the quantum dedicated attack on SIMON32/64. And this is the first work to study the complexity of quantum dedicated attacks from the perspective of quantum circuit complexity, which is a more fine-grained analysis of quantum dedicated attacks’ complexity.}

Towards this end, a class of anomaly detectors, created using data-centric approaches, are gaining attention. Using machine learning algorithms such approaches can automatically learn the process dynamics and control strategies deployed in an ICS. The use of these approaches leads to relatively easier and faster creation of anomaly detectors compared to the use of design-centric approaches that are based on plant physics and design. Despite the advantages, there exist significant challenges and implementation issues in the creation and deployment of detectors generated using machine learning for city-scale plants. In this work, we enumerate and discuss such challenges. Also presented is a series of lessons learned in our attempt to meet these challenges in an operational plant.}

	abstract = {The fuzzing test is able to discover various vulnerabilities and has more chances to hit the zero-day targets. And ICS(Industrial control system) is currently facing huge security threats and requires security standards, like ISO 62443, to ensure the quality of the device. However, some industrial proprietary communication protocols can be customized and have complicated structures, the fuzzing system cannot quickly generate test data that adapt to various protocols. It also struggles to define the mutation field without having prior knowledge of the protocols. Therefore, we propose a fuzzing system named ICPFuzzer that uses LSTM(Long short-term memory) to learn the features of a protocol and generates mutated test data automatically. We also use the responses of testing and adjust the weight strategies to further test the device under testing (DUT) to find more data that cause unusual connection status. We verified the effectiveness of the approach by comparing with the open-source and commercial fuzzers. Furthermore, in a real case, we experimented with the DLMS/COSEM for a smart meter and found that the test data can cause a unusual response. In summary, ICPFuzzer is a black-box fuzzing system that can automatically execute the testing process and reveal vulnerabilities that interrupt and crash industrial control communication. Not only improves the quality of ICS but also improves safety.}

This paper first develops a domain ontology of social engineering in cybersecurity and conducts ontology evaluation by its knowledge graph application. The domain ontology defines 11 concepts of core entities that significantly constitute or affect social engineering domain, together with 22 kinds of relations describing how these entities related to each other. It provides a formal and explicit knowledge schema to understand, analyze, reuse and share domain knowledge of social engineering. Furthermore, this paper builds a knowledge graph based on 15 social engineering attack incidents and scenarios. 7 knowledge graph application examples (in 6 analysis patterns) demonstrate that the ontology together with knowledge graph is useful to 1) understand and analyze social engineering attack scenario and incident, 2) find the top ranked social engineering threat elements (e.g. the most exploited human vulnerabilities and most used attack mediums), 3) find potential social engineering threats to victims, 4) find potential targets for social engineering attackers, 5) find potential attack paths from specific attacker to specific target, and 6) analyze the same origin attacks.}

	abstract = {Water management infrastructures such as floodgates are critical and increasingly operated by Industrial Control Systems (ICS). These systems are becoming more connected to the internet, either directly or through the corporate networks. This makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Abnormal behaviour in floodgates operated by ICS could be caused by both (intentional) attacks and (accidental) technical failures. When operators notice abnormal behaviour, they should be able to distinguish between those two causes to take appropriate measures, because for example replacing a sensor in case of intentional incorrect sensor measurements would be ineffective and would not block corresponding the attack vector. In the previous work, we developed the attack-failure distinguisher framework for constructing Bayesian Network (BN) models to enable operators to distinguish between those two causes, including the knowledge elicitation method to construct the directed acyclic graph and conditional probability tables of BN models. As a full case study of the attack-failure distinguisher framework, this paper presents a BN model constructed to distinguish between attacks and technical failures for the problem of incorrect sensor measurements in floodgates, addressing the problem of floodgate operators. We utilised experts who associate themselves with the safety and/or security community to construct the BN model and validate the qualitative part of constructed BN model. The constructed BN model is usable in water management infrastructures to distinguish between intentional attacks and accidental technical failures in case of incorrect sensor measurements. This could help to decide on appropriate response strategies and avoid further complications in case of incorrect sensor measurements.}

	abstract = {For block ciphers, Bogdanov et al. found that there are some linear approximations satisfying that their biases are deterministically invariant under key difference. This property is called key difference invariant bias. Based on this property, Bogdanov et al. proposed a related-key statistical distinguisher and turned it into key-recovery attacks on LBlock and TWINE-128. In this paper, we propose a new related-key model by combining multidimensional linear cryptanalysis with key difference invariant bias. The main theoretical advantage is that our new model does not depend on statistical independence of linear approximations. We demonstrate our cryptanalysis technique by performing key recovery attacks on LBlock and TWINE-128. By using the relations of the involved round keys to reduce the number of guessed subkey bits. Moreover, the partial-compression technique is used to reduce the time complexity. We can recover the master key of LBlock up to 25 rounds with about 260.4 distinct known plaintexts, 278.85 time complexity and 261 bytes of memory requirements. Our attack can recover the master key of TWINE-128 up to 28 rounds with about 261.5 distinct known plaintexts, 2126.15 time complexity and 261 bytes of memory requirements. The results are the currently best ones on cryptanalysis of LBlock and TWINE-128.}

	abstract = {Performance/security trade-off is widely noticed in CFI research, however, we observe that not every CFI scheme is subject to the trade-off. Motivated by the key observation, we ask three questions: ➊ does trade-off really exist in different CFI schemes? ➋ if trade-off do exist, how do previous works comply with it? ➌ how can it inspire future research? Although the three questions probably cannot be directly answered, they are inspiring. We find that a deeper understanding of the nature of the trade-off will help answer the three questions. Accordingly, we proposed the GPT conjecture to pinpoint the trade-off in designing CFI schemes, which says that at most two out of three properties (fine granularity, acceptable performance, and preventive protection) could be achieved.}

	abstract = {In a digital society, the rapid development of computer science and the Internet has greatly facilitated image applications. However, one of the public network also brings risks to both image tampering and privacy exposure. Image authentication is the most important approaches to verify image integrity and authenticity. However, it has been challenging for image authentication to address both issues of tampering detection and privacy protection. One aspect, image authentication requires image contents not be changed to detect tampering. The other, privacy protection needs to remove sensitive information from images, and as a result, the contents should be changed. In this paper, we propose a practical image authentication scheme constructed from chameleon hashes combined with ordinary digital signatures to make tradeoff between tampering detection and privacy protection. Our scheme allows legitimate users to modify contents of authenticated images with a privacy-aware purpose (for example, cover some sensitive areas with mosaics) according to specific rules and verify the authenticity without interaction with the original authenticator. The security of our scheme is guaranteed by the security of the underlying cryptographic primitives. Experiment results show that our scheme is efficient and practical. We believe that our work will facilitate image applications where both authentication and privacy protection are desirable.}

	abstract = {Side-channel resistance is nowadays widely accepted as a crucial factor in deciding the security assurance level of cryptographic implementations. In most cases, non-linear components (e.g. S-Boxes) of cryptographic algorithms will be chosen as primary targets of side-channel attacks (SCAs). In order to measure side-channel resistance of S-Boxes, three theoretical metrics are proposed and they are reVisited transparency order (VTO), confusion coefficients variance (CCV), and minimum confusion coefficient (MCC), respectively. However, the practical effectiveness of these metrics remains still unclear. Taking the 4-bit and 8-bit S-Boxes used in NIST Lightweight Cryptography candidates as concrete examples, this paper takes a comprehensive study of the applicability of these metrics. First of all, we empirically investigate the relations among three metrics for targeted S-boxes, and find that CCV is almost linearly correlated with VTO, while MCC is inconsistent with the other two. Furthermore, in order to verify which metric is more effective in which scenarios, we perform simulated and practical experiments on nine 4-bit S-Boxes under the non-profiled attacks and profiled attacks, respectively. The experiments show that for quantifying side-channel resistance of S-Boxes under non-profiled attacks, VTO and CCV are more reliable while MCC fails. We also obtain an interesting observation that none of these three metrics is suitable for measuring the resistance of S-Boxes against profiled SCAs. Finally, we try to verify whether these metrics can be applied to compare the resistance of S-Boxes with different sizes. Unfortunately, all of them are invalid in this scenario.}

The PLS blockchain is not a cryptocurrency instrument; it is an immutable ledger offering guaranteed non-repudiation to low-power clients without use of public key crypto. The novelty of the situation is in the fact that every PLS client has to obtain a proof of absence in all blocks of the chain to which its counterparty does not contribute, and we show that it is possible without traversing the block’s Merkle tree. We obtain weight statistics of a leaf path on a sparse Merkle tree theoretically, as our ground case. Using the theory we quantify the communication cost of a client interacting with the blockchain. We show that large savings can be achieved by providing a bitmap index of the tree compressed using Tunstall’s method. We further show that even in the case of correlated access, as in two IoT devices posting messages for each other in consecutive blocks, it is possible to prevent compression degradation by re-randomising the IDs using a pseudorandom bijective function. We propose a low-cost function of this kind and evaluate its quality by simulation, using the avalanche criterion.}

	abstract = {Double auction mechanisms have been designed to trade a variety of divisible resources (e.g., electricity, mobile data, and cloud resources) among distributed agents. In such divisible double auction, all the agents (both buyers and sellers) are expected to submit their bid profiles, and dynamically achieve the best responses. In practice, these agents may not trust each other without a market mediator. Fortunately, smart contract is extensively used to ensure digital agreement among mutually distrustful agents. The consensus protocol helps the smart contract execution on the blockchain to ensure strong integrity and availability. However, severe privacy risks would emerge in the divisible double auction since all the agents should disclose their sensitive data such as the bid profiles (i.e., bid amount and prices in different iterations) to other agents for resource allocation and such data are replicated on all the nodes in the network. Furthermore, the consensus requirements will bring a huge burden for the blockchain, which impacts the overall performance. To address these concerns, we propose a hybridized TEE-Blockchain system (system and auction mechanism co-design) to privately execute the divisible double auction. The designed hybridized system ensures privacy, honesty and high efficiency among distributed agents. The bid profiles are sealed for optimally allocating divisible resources while ensuring truthfulness with a Nash Equilibrium. Finally, we conduct experiments and empirical studies to validate the system and auction performance using two real-world applications.}

AME quality is a key factor to the robustness enhancement. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a kind of AME generation method, but the existing GAN-based AME generation methods have the issues of inadequate optimization, mode collapse and training instability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach (denote as LSGAN-AT) to enhance ML-based malware detector robustness against Adversarial Examples, which includes LSGAN module and AT module. LSGAN module can generate more effective and smoother AME by utilizing brand-new network structures and Least Square (LS) loss to optimize boundary samples. AT module makes adversarial training using AME generated by LSGAN to generate ML-based Robust Malware Detector (RMD). Extensive experiment results validate the better transferability of AME in terms of attacking 6 ML detectors and the RMD transferability in terms of resisting the MalGAN black-box attack. The results also verify the performance of the generated RMD in the recognition rate of AME.}

In the field of machine learning, deep neural networks automatically learn text features from a large number of datasets, but this data-driven method usually lacks the ability to deal with rare entities. Gasmi et al. proposed a deep learning method for named entity recognition in the field of cyber security, and achieved good results, reaching an F1 value of 82.8%. But it is difficult to accurately identify rare entities and complex words in the text.To cope with this challenge, this paper proposes a new model that combines data-driven deep learning methods with knowledge-driven dictionary methods to build dictionary features to assist in rare entity recognition. In addition, based on the data-driven deep learning model, an attention mechanism is adopted to enrich the local features of the text, better models the context, and improves the recognition effect of complex entities. Experimental results show that our method is better than the baseline model. Our model is more effective in identifying cyber security entities. The Precision, Recall and F1 value reached 90.19%, 86.60% and 88.36% respectively.}

It remains a considerable challenge to authenticate users continuously and accurately with short keystroke inputs collected in uncontrolled settings. In this work, we propose a Timely Keystroke-based method for Continuous user Authentication, named TKCA. It integrates the key name and two kinds of timing features through an embedding mechanism. And it captures the relationship between context keystrokes by the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network. We conduct a series of experiments to validate it on a public dataset - the Clarkson II dataset collected in a completely uncontrolled and natural setting. Experiment results show that the proposed TKCA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8.28% of EER when using only 30 keystrokes and 2.78% of EER when using 190 keystrokes.}

In order to improve automation and scalability, we propose an alternative direction based on distributed representations of binary programs with applicability to a number of downstream tasks. We introduce Bin2vec, a new approach leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) along with computational program graphs in order to learn a high dimensional representation of binary executable programs. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using our representations to solve two semantically different binary analysis tasks – functional algorithm classification and vulnerability discovery. We compare the proposed approach to our own strong baseline as well as published results, and demonstrate improvement over state-of-the-art methods for both tasks. We evaluated Bin2vec on 49191 binaries for the functional algorithm classification task, and on 30 different CWE-IDs including at least 100 CVE entries each for the vulnerability discovery task. We set a new state-of-the-art result by reducing the classification error by 40% compared to the source-code based inst2vec approach, while working on binary code. For almost every vulnerability class in our dataset, our prediction accuracy is over 80% (and over 90% in multiple classes).}
