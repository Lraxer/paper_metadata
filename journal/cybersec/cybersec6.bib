	abstract = {Nowadays, cloud computing provides easy access to a set of variable and configurable computing resources based on user demand through the network. Cloud computing services are available through common internet protocols and network standards. In addition to the unique benefits of cloud computing, insecure communication and attacks on cloud networks cannot be ignored. There are several techniques for dealing with network attacks. To this end, network anomaly detection systems are widely used as an effective countermeasure against network anomalies. The anomaly-based approach generally learns normal traffic patterns in various ways and identifies patterns of anomalies. Network anomaly detection systems have gained much attention in intelligently monitoring network traffic using machine learning methods. This paper presents an efficient model based on autoencoders for anomaly detection in cloud computing networks. The autoencoder learns a basic representation of the normal data and its reconstruction with minimum error. Therefore, the reconstruction error is used as an anomaly or classification metric. In addition, to detecting anomaly data from normal data, the classification of anomaly types has also been investigated. We have proposed a new approach by examining an autoencoder’s anomaly detection method based on data reconstruction error. Unlike the existing autoencoder-based anomaly detection techniques that consider the reconstruction error of all input features as a single value, we assume that the reconstruction error is a vector. This enables our model to use the reconstruction error of every input feature as an anomaly or classification metric. We further propose a multi-class classification structure to classify the anomalies. We use the CIDDS-001 dataset as a commonly accepted dataset in the literature. Our evaluations show that the performance of the proposed method has improved considerably compared to the existing ones in terms of accuracy, recall, false-positive rate, and F1-score metrics.}

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning gained proliferating popularity in the cybersecurity application domain, since when being compared to traditional machine learning methods, it usually involves less human efforts, produces better results, and provides better generalizability. However, the imbalanced data issue is very common in cybersecurity, which can substantially deteriorate the performance of the deep learning models. This paper introduces a transfer learning based method to tackle the imbalanced data issue in cybersecurity using return-oriented programming payload detection as a case study. We achieved 0.0290 average false positive rate, 0.9705 average F1 score and 0.9521 average detection rate on 3 different target domain programs using 2 different source domain programs, with 0 benign training data sample in the target domain. The performance improvement compared to the baseline is a trade-off between false positive rate and detection rate. Using our approach, the total number of false positives is reduced by 23.16%, and as a trade-off, the number of detected malicious samples decreases by 0.68%.}

	abstract = {Internet security has become a major concern with the growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing technologies. Even though data processing is handled by the edge server, sensitive data is generated and stored by the IoT devices, which are subject to attack. Since most IoT devices have limited resources, standard security algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA hamper their ability to run properly. In this paper, a lightweight symmetric key cipher termed randomized butterfly architecture of fast Fourier transform for key (RBFK) cipher is proposed for resource-constrained IoT devices in the edge computing environment. The butterfly architecture is used in the key scheduling system to produce strong round keys for five rounds of the encryption method. The RBFK cipher has two key sizes: 64 and 128 bits, with a block size of 64 bits. The RBFK ciphers have a larger avalanche effect due to the butterfly architecture ensuring strong security. The proposed cipher satisfies the Shannon characteristics of confusion and diffusion. The memory usage and execution cycle of the RBFK cipher are assessed using the fair evaluation of the lightweight cryptographic systems (FELICS) tool. The proposed ciphers were also implemented using MATLAB 2021a to test key sensitivity by analyzing the histogram, correlation graph, and entropy of encrypted and decrypted images. Since the RBFK ciphers with minimal computational complexity provide better security than recently proposed competing ciphers, these are suitable for IoT devices in an edge computing environment.\n}

	abstract = {The handy biometric data is a double-edged sword, paving the way of the prosperity of biometric authentication systems but bringing the personal privacy concern. To alleviate the concern, various biometric template protection schemes are proposed to protect the biometric template from information leakage. The preponderance of existing proposals is based on Hamming metric, which ignores the fact that predominantly deployed biometric recognition systems (e.g. face, voice, gait) generate real-valued templates, more applicable to Euclidean metric and Cosine metric. Moreover, since the emergence of similarity-based attacks, those schemes are not secure under a stolen-token setting. In this paper, we propose a succinct biometric template protection scheme to address such a challenge. The proposed scheme is designed for Euclidean metric and Cosine metric instead of Hamming distance. Mainly, the succinct biometric template protection scheme consists of distance-preserving, one-way, and obfuscation modules. To be specific, we adopt location sensitive hash function to realize the distance-preserving and one-way properties simultaneously and use the modulo operation to implement many-to-one mapping. We also thoroughly analyze the proposed scheme in three aspects: irreversibility, unlinkability and revocability. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted on publicly known face databases. All the results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized our world today by providing greater levels of accessibility, connectivity and ease to our everyday lives. It enables massive amounts of data to be traversed across multiple heterogeneous devices that are all interconnected. This phenomenon makes IoT networks vulnerable to various network attacks and intrusions. Building an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT networks is challenging as they enable a massive amount of data to be aggregated, which is difficult to handle and analyze in real time mainly because of the heterogeneous nature of IoT devices. This inefficient, traditional IDS approach accentuates the need to develop advanced IDS techniques by employing Machine or Deep Learning. This paper presents a deep ensemble-based IDS using Lambda architecture by following a multi-pronged classification approach. Binary classification uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to differentiate between malicious and benign traffic, while the multi-class classifier uses an ensemble of LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network and Artificial Neural Network classifiers to detect the type of attacks. The model training is performed in the batch layer, while real-time evaluation is carried out through model inferences in the speed layer of the Lambda architecture. The proposed approach gives high accuracy of over 99.93% and saves useful processing time due to the multi-pronged classification strategy and using the lambda architecture.}

	abstract = {Malware attacks on the Android platform are rapidly increasing due to the high consumer adoption of Android smartphones. Advanced technologies have motivated cyber-criminals to actively create and disseminate a wide range of malware on Android smartphones. The researchers have conducted numerous studies on the detection of Android malware, but the majority of the works are based on the detection of generic Android malware. The detection based on malware categories will provide more insights about the malicious patterns of the malware. Therefore, this paper presents a detection solution for different Android malware categories, including adware, banking, SMS malware, and riskware. In this paper, a novel Huffman encoding-based feature vector generation technique is proposed. The experiments have proved that this novel approach significantly improves the efficiency of the detection model. This method makes use of system call frequencies as features to extract malware’s dynamic behavior patterns. The proposed model was evaluated using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the proposed model with the Random Forest classifier outperforms some existing methodologies with a detection accuracy of 98.70%.\n}

	abstract = {The continuous increase of electric vehicles is being facilitating the large-scale distributed charging-pile deployment. It is crucial to guarantee normal operation of charging piles, resulting in the importance of diagnosing charging-pile faults. The existing fault-diagnosis approaches were based on physical fault data like mechanical log data and sensor data streams. However, there are other types of fault data, which cannot be used for diagnosis by these existing approaches. This paper aims to fill this gap and consider 8 types of fault data for diagnosing, at least including physical installation error fault, charging-pile mechanical fault, charging-pile program fault, user personal fault, signal fault (offline), pile compatibility fault, charging platform fault, and other faults. We aim to find out how to combine existing feature-extraction and machine learning techniques to make the better diagnosis by conducting experiments on realistic dataset. 4 word embedding models are investigated for feature extraction of fault data, including N-gram, GloVe, Word2vec, and BERT. Moreover, we classify the word embedding results using 10 machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Multilayer Perceptron, Recurrent Neural Network, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, Decision Tree, Extra Tree, and VOTE. Compared with original fault record dataset, we utilize paraphrasing-based data augmentation method to improve the classification accuracy up to 10.40%. Our extensive experiment results reveal that RF classifier combining the GloVe embedding model achieves the best accuracy with acceptable training time. In addition, we discuss the interpretability of RF and GloVe.}

The standard, dating back to 2008, marginally addresses security aspects, notably not encompassing the frames designed for management purposes (Type Length Values or TLVs). In this work we show that the TLVs can be abused by an attacker to reconfigure, manipulate, or shut down time synchronization. The effects of such an attack can be serious, ranging from interruption of operations to actual unintended behavior of industrial devices, possibly resulting in physical damages or even harm to operators.

	abstract = {Locating bug code snippets (short for BugCode) has been a complex problem throughout the history of software security, mainly because the constraints that define BugCode are obscure and hard to summarize. Previously, security analysts attempted to define such constraints manually (e.g., limiting buffer size to detect overflow), but were limited to the types of BugCode. Recent researchers address this problem by extracting constraints from program documentation, which shows the potential for API misuse. But for bugs beyond the scope of API misuse, such an approach becomes less effective since the corresponding constraints are not defined in documents, not to mention the programs without documentation In this paper, inspired by the fact that expert programmers often correct the BugCode on open forums such as StackOverflow, we design an approach to automatically extract knowledge from StackOverflow and leverage it to detect BugCode. As we all know, the contexts in StackOverflow come from ordinary developers. Their writing tends to be loosely organized and in various styles, which are more challenging to analyze than program documentation. To address the challenges, we design a custom tokenization approach to segment sentences and employ sentiment analysis to find the Controversial Sentences (CSs) that typically contain the constraints we need for code analysis. Then we use constituency parsing to extract knowledge from CSs, which helps locate BugCode. We evaluated our system on 41,144 comments from the questions tagged with Java and Android. The results show that our approach achieves 95.5% precision in discovering CSs. We have discovered 276 pieces of BugCode proved to be true through manual validation including an assigned CVE. 89.3% of the discovered bugs remained in the current version of answers, which are unknown to users.}

Models trained on the dataset will passively implant the backdoor, and triggers on the input can mislead the models during testing. Our study shows that the model shows different learning behaviors in clean and poisoned subsets during training. Based on this observation, we propose a general training pipeline to defend against backdoor attacks actively. Benign models can be trained from the unreliable dataset by decoupling the learning process into three stages, i.e., supervised learning, active unlearning, and active semi-supervised fine-tuning. The effectiveness of our approach has been shown in numerous experiments across various backdoor attacks and datasets.}

In the past, it has been shown how an attacker can fool these models by placing an adversarial patch within a scene. However, these patches must be placed in the target location and do not explicitly alter the semantics elsewhere in the image. In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial patch which alters a model’s perception of an image’s semantics. These patches can be placed anywhere within an image to change the classification or semantics of locations far from the patch. We call this new class of adversarial examples ‘remote adversarial patches’ (RAP). We implement our own RAP called IPatch and perform an in-depth analysis on without pixel clipping on image segmentation RAP attacks using five state-of-the-art architectures with eight different encoders on the CamVid street view dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the attack can be extended to object recognition models with preliminary results on the popular YOLOv3 model. We found that the patch can change the classification of a remote target region with a success rate of up to 93% on average.}

	abstract = {Mutation-based greybox fuzzing has been one of the most prevalent techniques for security vulnerability discovery and a great deal of research work has been proposed to improve both its efficiency and effectiveness. Mutation-based greybox fuzzing generates input cases by mutating the input seed, i.e., applying a sequence of mutation operators to randomly selected mutation positions of the seed. However, existing fruitful research work focuses on scheduling mutation operators, leaving the schedule of mutation positions as an overlooked aspect of fuzzing efficiency. This paper proposes a novel greybox fuzzing method, PosFuzz, that statistically schedules mutation positions based on their historical performance. PosFuzz makes use of a concept of effective position distribution to represent the semantics of the input and to guide the mutations. PosFuzz first utilizes Good-Turing frequency estimation to calculate an effective position distribution for each mutation operator. It then leverages two sampling methods in different mutating stages to select the positions from the distribution. We have implemented PosFuzz on top of AFL, AFLFast and MOPT, called Pos-AFL, -AFLFast and -MOPT respectively, and evaluated them on the UNIFUZZ benchmark (20 widely used open source programs) and LAVA-M dataset. The result shows that, under the same testing time budget, the Pos-AFL, -AFLFast and -MOPT outperform their counterparts in code coverage and vulnerability discovery ability. Compared with AFL, AFLFast, and MOPT, PosFuzz gets 21% more edge coverage and finds 133% more paths on average. It also triggers 275% more unique bugs on average.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of communication technology, a large number of data are constantly transmitted through the internet for various purposes, which are prone to be illegally accessed by third parties. Therefore, securing such data is crucial to protect the transmitted information from falling into the wrong hands. Among data protection schemes, Secret Image Sharing is one of the most popular methods. It protects critical messages or data by embedding them in an image and sharing it with some users. Furthermore, it combines the security concepts in that private data are embedded into a cover image and then secured using the secret-sharing method. Despite its advantages, this method may produce noise, making the resulting stego file much different from its cover. Moreover, the size of private data that can be embedded is limited. This research works on these problems by utilizing prediction-error expansion and histogram-based approaches to embed the data. To recover the cover image, the SS method based on the Chinese remainder theorem is used. The experimental results indicate that this proposed method performs better than similar methods in several cover images and scenarios.}

	abstract = {Personally identifiable information (PII) refers to any information that links to an individual. Sharing PII is extremely useful in public affairs yet hard to implement due to the worries about privacy violations. Building a PII retrieval service over multi-cloud, which is a modern strategy to make services stable where multiple servers are deployed, seems to be a promising solution. However, three major technical challenges remain to be solved. The first is the privacy and access control of PII. In fact, each entry in PII can be shared to different users with different access rights. Hence, flexible and fine-grained access control is needed. Second, a reliable user revocation mechanism is required to ensure that users can be revoked efficiently, even if few cloud servers are compromised or collapse, to avoid data leakage. Third, verifying the correctness of received PII and locating a misbehaved server when wrong data are returned is crucial to guarantee user’s privacy, but challenging to realize. In this paper, we propose Rainbow, a secure and practical PII retrieval scheme to solve the above issues. In particular, we design an important cryptographic tool, called Reliable Outsourced Attribute Based Encryption (ROABE) which provides data privacy, flexible and fine-grained access control, reliable immediate user revocation and verification for multiple servers simultaneously, to support Rainbow. Moreover, we present how to build Rainbow with ROABE and several necessary cloud techniques in real world. To evaluate the performance, we deploy Rainbow on multiple mainstream clouds, namely, AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure, and experiment in browsers on mobile phones and computers. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that Rainbow is secure and practical.}

VPAs extend their functions through third-party voice apps, thereby attracting more users to use VPA-equipped products. Previous studies demonstrate vulnerabilities in the certification, installation, and usage of these third-party voice apps. However, these studies focus on individual apps. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that explores the correlations among voice apps.Voice apps represent a new type of applications that interact with users mainly through a voice user interface instead of a graphical user interface, requiring a distinct approach to analysis. In this study, we present a novel voice app similarity analysis approach to analyze voice apps in the market from a new perspective. Our approach, called SkillSim, detects similarities among voice apps (i.e. skills) based on two dimensions: text similarity and structure similarity. SkillSim measures 30,000 voice apps in the Amazon skill market and reveals that more than 25.9% have at least one other skill with a text similarity greater than 70%. Our analysis identifies several factors that contribute to a high number of similar skills, including the assistant development platforms and their limited templates. Additionally, we observe interesting phenomena, such as developers or platforms creating multiple similar skills with different accounts for purposes such as advertising. Furthermore, we also find that some assistant development platforms develop multiple similar but non-compliant skills, such as requesting user privacy in a non-compliance way, which poses a security risk. Based on the similarity analysis results, we have a deeper understanding of voice apps in the mainstream market.}

	abstract = {Clone detection has received much attention in many fields such as malicious code detection, vulnerability hunting, and code copyright infringement detection. However, cyber criminals may obfuscate code to impede violation detection. To date, few studies have investigated the robustness of clone detectors, especially in-fashion deep learning-based ones, against obfuscation. Meanwhile, most of these studies only measure the difference between one code snippet and its obfuscation version. However, in reality, the attackers may modify the original code before obfuscating it. Then what we should evaluate is the detection of obfuscated code from cloned code, not the original code. For this, we conduct a comprehensive study evaluating 3 popular deep-learning based clone detectors and 6 commonly used traditional ones. Regarding the data, we collect 6512 clone pairs of five types from the dataset BigCloneBench and obfuscate one program of each pair via 64 strategies of 6 state-of-art commercial obfuscators. We also collect 1424 non-clone pairs to evaluate the false positives. In sum, a benchmark of 524,148 code pairs (either clone or not) are generated, which are passed to clone detectors for evaluation. To automate the evaluation, we develop one uniform evaluation framework, integrating the clone detectors and obfuscators. The results bring us interesting findings on how obfuscation affects the performance of clone detection and what is the difference between traditional and deep learning-based clone detectors. In addition, we conduct manual code reviews to uncover the root cause of the phenomenon and give suggestions to users from different perspectives.}

	abstract = {Recently, deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A backdoor is inserted into neural networks via this attack paradigm, thus compromising the integrity of the network. As soon as an attacker presents a trigger during the testing phase, the backdoor in the model is activated, allowing the network to make specific wrong predictions. It is extremely important to defend against backdoor attacks since they are very stealthy and dangerous. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism, Neural Behavioral Alignment (NBA), for backdoor removal. NBA optimizes the distillation process in terms of knowledge form and distillation samples to improve defense performance according to the characteristics of backdoor defense. NBA builds high-level representations of neural behavior within networks in order to facilitate the transfer of knowledge. Additionally, NBA crafts pseudo samples to induce student models exhibit backdoor neural behavior. By aligning the backdoor neural behavior from the student network with the benign neural behavior from the teacher network, NBA enables the proactive removal of backdoors. Extensive experiments show that NBA can effectively defend against six different backdoor attacks and outperform five state-of-the-art defenses.}

	abstract = {Publish/subscribe(pub/sub) systems are widely used in large-scale messaging systems due to their asynchronous and decoupled nature. With the population of pub/sub cloud services, the privacy protection problem of pub/sub systems has started to emerge, and events and subscriptions are exposed when executing event matching on untrustworthy cloud brokers. However, as the number of subscriptions increases, the effectiveness of the previous confidentiality protection approaches declines drastically. In this paper, we propose SBM (scalable blind matching), an effective confidentiality protection scheme for pub/sub systems. To the best of our knowledge, SBM is the first scheme that applies order-preserving encryption algorithm to protect the system’s confidentiality and ensure its scalability. In this scheme, SBM-I is highly effective in subscription matching but is unable to achieve ideal security IND-OCPA, whereas SBM-II is suggested to ensure system security and SGX is used to reduce interaction and boost ciphertext matching performance. The experiment demonstrates that this method has better matching performance compared to others: the average matching time of SBM-I is 3–4 orders of magnitude faster than the matching algorithm MP and SGX-based algorithm SCBR when the number of subscriptions is 500,000, and the average matching time of SBM-II is 40 times faster than MP and 24 times than SCBR.}

	abstract = {Side-channel analysis (SCA) has become an increasing important method to assess the physical security of cryptographic systems. In the process of SCA, the number of attack data directly determines the performance of SCA. With sufficient attack data, the adversary can achieve a successful SCA. However, in reality, the cryptographic device may be protected with some countermeasures to limit the number of encryptions using the same key. In this case, the adversary cannot use casual numbers of data to perform SCA. The performance of SCA will be severely dropped if the attack traces are insufficient. In this paper, we introduce wavelet scatter transform (WST) and short-time fourier transform (STFT) to non-profiled side-channel analysis domains, to improve the performance of side-channel attacks in the context of insufficient data. We design a practical framework to provide suitable parameters for WST/STFT-based SCA. Using the proposed method, the WST/STFT-based SCA method can significantly enhance the performance and robustness of non-profiled SCA. The practical attacks against four public datasets show that the proposed method is able to achieve more robust performance. Compared with the original correlation power analysis (CPA), the number of attack data can be reduced by 50–95%.}

	abstract = {Statistics show that more than 80 applications are installed on each android smartphone. Vulnerability research on Android applications is of critical importance. Recently, academic researchers mainly focus on single bug patterns, while few of them investigate the relations between multiple bugs. Industrial researchers proposed a series of logic exploit chains leveraging multiple logic bugs. However, there is no general model to evaluate the chaining abilities between bugs. This paper presents a formal model to elucidate the relations between multiple bugs in Android applications. To prove the effectiveness of the model, we design and implement a prototype system named AppChainer. AppChainer automatically identifies attack surfaces of Android applications and investigates whether the payloads entering these attack surfaces are “chainable”. Experimental results on 2138 popular Android applications show that AppChainer is effective in identifying and chaining attacker-controllable payloads. It identifies 14467 chainable payloads and constructs 5458 chains both inside a single application and among various applications. The time cost and resource consumption of AppChainer are also acceptable. For each application, the average analysis time is 317\xa0s, and the average memory consumed is 2368\xa0MB. Compared with the most relevant work Jandroid, the experiment results on our custom DroidChainBench show that AppChainer outperforms Jandroid at the precision rate and performs equally with Jandroid at the recall rate.}

	abstract = {Cyber attackers have constantly updated their attack techniques to evade antivirus software detection in recent years. One popular evasion method is to execute malicious code and perform malicious actions only in memory. Malicious programs that use this attack method are called memory-resident malware, with excellent evasion capability, and have posed huge threats to cyber security. Traditional static and dynamic methods are not effective in detecting memory-resident malware. In addition, existing memory forensics detection solutions perform unsatisfactorily in detection rate and depend on massive expert knowledge in memory analysis. This paper proposes MRm-DLDet, a state-of-the-art memory-resident malware detection framework, to overcome these drawbacks. MRm-DLDet first builds a virtual machine environment and captures memory dumps, then creatively processes the memory dumps into RGB images using a pre-processing technique that combines deduplication and ultra-high resolution image cropping, followed by our neural network MRmNet in MRm-DLDet to fully extract high-dimensional features from memory dump files and detect them. MRmNet receives the labeled sub-images of the cropped high-resolution RGB images as input of ResNet-18, which extracts the features of the sub-images. Then trains a network of gated recurrent units with an attention mechanism. Finally, it determines whether a program is memory-resident malware based on the detection results of each sub-image through a specially designed voting layer. We created a high-quality dataset consisting of 2,060 benign and memory-resident programs. In other words, the dataset contains 1,287,500 labeled sub-images cut from the MRm-DLDet transformed ultra-high resolution RGB images. We implement MRm-DLDet for Windows 10, and it performs better than the latest methods, with a detection accuracy of up to 98.34\\(\\%\\). Moreover, we measured the effects of mimicry and adversarial attacks on MRm-DLDet, and the experimental results demonstrated the robustness of MRm-DLDet.}

	abstract = {Intrusion detection systems are increasingly using machine learning. While machine learning has shown excellent performance in identifying malicious traffic, it may increase the risk of privacy leakage. This paper focuses on implementing a model stealing attack on intrusion detection systems. Existing model stealing attacks are hard to implement in practical network environments, as they either need private data of the victim dataset or frequent access to the victim model. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called Fast Model Stealing Attack (FMSA) to address the problem in the field of model stealing attacks. We also highlight the risks of using ML-NIDS in network security. First, meta-learning frameworks are introduced into the model stealing algorithm to clone the victim model in a black-box state. Then, the number of accesses to the target model is used as an optimization term, resulting in minimal queries to achieve model stealing. Finally, adversarial training is used to simulate the data distribution of the target model and achieve the recovery of privacy data. Through experiments on multiple public datasets, compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, FMSA reduces the number of accesses to the target model and improves the accuracy of the clone model on the test dataset to 88.9% and the similarity with the target model to 90.1%. We can demonstrate the successful execution of model stealing attacks on the ML-NIDS system even with protective measures in place to limit the number of anomalous queries.}

	abstract = {Recently, studies show that deep learning-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which add a small amount of noise to the original audio examples. These AE attacks pose new challenges to deep learning security and have raised significant concerns about deploying ASR systems and devices. The existing defense methods are either limited in application or only defend on results, but not on process. In this work, we propose a novel method to infer the adversary intent and discover audio adversarial examples based on the AEs generation process. The insight of this method is based on the observation: many existing audio AE attacks utilize query-based methods, which means the adversary must send continuous and similar queries to target ASR models during the audio AE generation process. Inspired by this observation, We propose a memory mechanism by adopting audio fingerprint technology to analyze the similarity of the current query with a certain length of memory query. Thus, we can identify when a sequence of queries appears to be suspectable to generate audio AEs. Through extensive evaluation on four state-of-the-art audio AE attacks, we demonstrate that on average our defense identify the adversary’s intent with over \\(90\\%\\) accuracy. With careful regard for robustness evaluations, we also analyze our proposed defense and its strength to withstand two adaptive attacks. Finally, our scheme is available out-of-the-box and directly compatible with any ensemble of ASR defense models to uncover audio AE attacks effectively without model retraining.}

	abstract = {Early attack detection is essential to ensure the security of complex networks, especially those in critical infrastructures. This is particularly crucial in networks with multi-stage attacks, where multiple nodes are connected to external sources, through which attacks could enter and quickly spread to other network elements. Bayesian attack graphs (BAGs) are powerful models for security risk assessment and mitigation in complex networks, which provide the probabilistic model of attackers’ behavior and attack progression in the network. Most attack detection techniques developed for BAGs rely on the assumption that network compromises will be detected through routine monitoring, which is unrealistic given the ever-growing complexity of threats. This paper derives the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) attack detection and monitoring policy for the most general form of BAGs. By exploiting the structure of BAGs and their partial and imperfect monitoring capacity, the proposed detection policy achieves the MMSE optimality possible only for linear-Gaussian state space models using Kalman filtering. An adaptive resource monitoring policy is also introduced for monitoring nodes if the expected predictive error exceeds a user-defined value. Exact and efficient matrix-form computations of the proposed policies are provided, and their high performance is demonstrated in terms of the accuracy of attack detection and the most efficient use of available resources using synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with different topologies.}

	abstract = {Hiding secret data in digital multimedia has been essential to protect the data. Nevertheless, attackers with a steganalysis technique may break them. Existing steganalysis methods have good results with conventional Machine Learning (ML) techniques; however, the introduction of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning paradigm, achieved better performance over the previously proposed ML-based techniques. Though the existing CNN-based approaches yield good results, they present performance issues in classification accuracy and stability in the network training phase. This research proposes a new method with a CNN architecture to improve the hidden data detection accuracy and the training phase stability in spatial domain images. The proposed method comprises three phases: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Firstly, in the pre-processing phase, we use spatial rich model filters to enhance the noise within images altered by data hiding; secondly, in the feature extraction phase, we use two-dimensional depthwise separable convolutions to improve the signal-to-noise and regular convolutions to model local features; and finally, in the classification, we use multi-scale average pooling for local features aggregation and representability enhancement regardless of the input size variation, followed by three fully connected layers to form the final feature maps that we transform into class probabilities using the softmax function. The results identify an improvement in the accuracy of the considered recent scheme ranging between 4.6 and 10.2% with reduced training time up to 30.81%.\n}

	abstract = {The Learning With Errors (LWE) problem is widely used in lattice-based cryptography, which is the most promising post-quantum cryptography direction. There are a variety of LWE-solving methods, which can be classified into four groups: lattice methods, algebraic methods, combinatorial methods, and exhaustive searching. The Blum–Kalai–Wasserman (BKW) algorithm is an important variety of combinatorial algorithms, which was first presented for solving the Learning Parity With Noise (LPN) problem and then extended to solve LWE. In this paper, we give an overview of BKW algorithms for solving LWE. We introduce the framework and key techniques of BKW algorithms and make comparisons between different BKW algorithms and also with lattice methods by estimating concrete security of specific LWE instances. We also briefly discuss the current problems and potential future directions of BKW algorithms.}

	abstract = {The illegal use of compromised email accounts by adversaries can have severe consequences for enterprises and society. Detecting compromised email accounts is more challenging than in the social network field, where email accounts have only a few interaction events (sending and receiving). To address the issue of insufficient features, we propose a novel approach to detecting compromised accounts by combining time zone differences and alternate logins to identify abnormal behavior. Based on this approach, we propose a compromised email account detection framework that relies on widely available and less sensitive login logs and does not require labels. Our framework characterizes login behaviors to identify logins that do not belong to the account owner and outputs a list of account-subnet pairs ranked by their likelihood of having abnormal login relationships. This approach reduces the number of account-subnet pairs that need to be investigated and provides a reference for investigation priority. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method can detect most email accounts that have been accessed by disclosed malicious IP addresses and outperforms similar research. Additionally, our framework has the capability to uncover undisclosed malicious IP addresses.}

	abstract = {In recent years, many researchers focused on unsupervised learning for network anomaly detection in edge devices to identify attacks. The deployment of the unsupervised autoencoder model is computationally expensive in resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes quantized autoencoder (QAE) model for intrusion detection systems to detect anomalies. QAE is an optimization model derived from autoencoders that incorporate pruning, clustering, and integer quantization techniques. Quantized autoencoder uint8 (QAE-u8) and quantized autoencoder float16 (QAE-f16) are two variants of QAE built to deploy computationally expensive AI models into Edge devices. First, we have generated a Real-Time Internet of Things 2022 dataset for normal and attack traffic. The autoencoder model operates on normal traffic during the training phase. The same model is then used to reconstruct anomaly traffic under the assumption that the reconstruction error (RE) of the anomaly will be high, which helps to identify the attacks. Furthermore, we study the performance of the autoencoders, QAE-u8, and QAE-f16 using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score through an extensive experimental study. We showed that QAE-u8 outperforms all other models with a reduction of 70.01% in average memory utilization, 92.23% in memory size compression, and 27.94% in peak CPU utilization. Thus, the proposed QAE-u8 model is more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.}

	abstract = {Buffer overflow poses a serious threat to the memory security of modern operating systems. It overwrites the contents of other memory areas by breaking through the buffer capacity limit, destroys the system execution environment, and provides implementation space for various system attacks such as program control flow hijacking. That makes it a wide range of harms. A variety of security technologies have been proposed to deal with system security problems including buffer overflow. For example, No eXecute (NX for short) is a memory management technology commonly used in Harvard architecture. It can refuse the execution of code which residing in a specific memory, and can effectively suppress the abnormal impact of buffer overflow on control flow. Therefore, in recent years, it has also been used in the field of system security, deriving a series of solutions based on NX technology, such as ExecShield, DEP, StackGuard, etc. However, these security solutions often rely too much on the processor architecture so that the protection coverage is insufficient and the accuracy is limited. Especially in the emerging system architecture field represented by RISC-V, there is still a lack of effective solutions for buffer overflow vulnerabilities. With the continuous rapid development of the system architecture, it is urgent to develop defense methods that are applicable to different system application environments and oriented to all executable memory spaces to meet the needs of system security development. Therefore, we propose BOP, A new system memory security design method based on RISC-V extended instructions, to build a RISC-V buffer overflow detection and defense system and deal with the buffer overflow threat in RISC-V. According to this method, NX technology can be combined with program control flow analysis, and NX bit mechanism can be used to manage the executability of memory space, so as to achieve a more granular detection and defense of buffer overflow attacks that may occur in RISC-V system environment. In addition, The memory management and control function of BOP is not only very suitable for solving the security problems in the existing single architecture system, but also widely applicable to the combination of multiple heterogeneous systems.}

However, the performance of these approaches varies with different types of DGAs. Most features in the ML methods can characterize random-looking DGAs better than word-looking DGAs. To improve the classification performance on word-looking DGAs, subword tokenization is employed for the DL models. Our experimental results proved that the subword tokenization can provide excellent classification performance on the word-looking DGAs. We then propose an integrated scheme that chooses an appropriate method for DGA classification depending on the nature of the DGAs. Results show that the integrated scheme outperformed existing ML and DL methods, and also the subword DL methods.}

	abstract = {Non-malleable code is an encoding scheme that is useful in situations where traditional error correction or detection is impossible to achieve. It ensures with high probability that decoded message is either completely unrelated or the original one, when tampering has no effect. Usually, standard version of non-malleable codes provide security against one time tampering attack. Block ciphers are successfully employed in the construction of non-malleable codes. Such construction fails to provide security when an adversary tampers the codeword more than once. Continuously non-malleable codes further allow an attacker to tamper the message for polynomial number of times. In this work, we propose continuous version of non-malleable codes from block ciphers in split-state model. Our construction provides security against polynomial number of tampering attacks and it preserves non-malleability. When the tampering experiment triggers self-destruct, the security of continuously non-malleable code reduces to security of the underlying leakage resilient storage.}

	abstract = {It is not uncommon for malicious sellers to collude with fake reviewers (also called spammers) to write fake reviews for multiple products to either demote competitors or promote their products’ reputations, forming a gray industry chain. To detect spammer groups in a heterogeneous network with rich semantic information from both buyers and sellers, researchers have conducted extensive research using Frequent Item Mining-based and graph-based methods. However, these methods cannot detect spammer groups with cross-product attacks and do not jointly consider structural and attribute features, and structure-attribute correlation, resulting in poorer detection performance. Therefore, we propose a collaborative training-based spammer group detection algorithm by constructing a heterogeneous induced sub-network based on the target product set to detect cross-product attack spammer groups. To jointly consider all available features, we use the collaborative training method to learn the feature representations of nodes. In addition, we use the DBSCAN clustering method to generate candidate groups, exclude innocent ones, and rank them to obtain spammer groups. The experimental results on real-world datasets indicate that the overall detection performance of the proposed method is better than that of the baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are utilized to find hostile network connections. This can be accomplished by looking at traffic network activity, but it takes a lot of work. The NIDS heavily utilizes approaches for data extraction and machine learning to find anomalies. In terms of feature selection, NIDS is far more effective. This is accurate since anomaly identification uses a number of time-consuming features. Because of this, the feature selection method influences how long it takes to analyze movement patterns and how clear it is. The goal of the study is to provide NIDS with an attribute selection approach. PSO has been used for that purpose. The Network Intrusion Detection System that is being developed will be able to identify any malicious activity in the network or any unusual behavior in the network, allowing the identification of the illegal activities and safeguarding the enormous amounts of confidential data belonging to the customers from being compromised. In the research, datasets were produced utilising both a network infrastructure and a simulation network. Wireshark is used to gather data packets whereas Cisco Packet Tracer is used to build a network in a simulated environment. Additionally, a physical network consisting of six node MCUs connected to a laptop and a mobile hotspot, has been built and communication packets are being recorded using the Wireshark tool. To train several machine learning models, all the datasets that were gathered—created datasets from our own studies as well as some common datasets like NSDL and UNSW acquired from Kaggle—were employed. Additionally, PSO, which is an optimization method, has been used with these ML algorithms for feature selection. In the research, KNN, decision trees, and ANN have all been combined with PSO for a specific case study. And it was found demonstrated the classification methods PSO\u2009+\u2009ANN outperformed PSO\u2009+\u2009KNN and PSO\u2009+\u2009DT in this case study.}

However, current VFL systems usually primarily focus on the privacy protection during model training, while the preparation of training data receives little attention. In real-world applications, like smart healthcare, the process of the training data preparation may involve some participant’s intention which could be privacy information for this participant. To protect the privacy of the model training intention, we describe the idea of Intention-Hiding Vertical Federated Learning (IHVFL) and illustrate a framework to achieve this privacy-preserving goal. First, we construct two secure screening protocols to enhance the privacy protection in feature engineering. Second, we implement the work of sample alignment bases on a novel private set intersection protocol. Finally, we use the logistic regression algorithm to demonstrate the process of IHVFL. Experiments show that our model can perform better efficiency (less than 5min) and accuracy (97%) on Breast Cancer medical dataset while maintaining the intention-hiding goal.}

	abstract = {It is challenging to devise lightweight cryptographic primitives efficient in both hardware and software that can provide an optimum level of security to diverse Internet of Things applications running on low-end constrained devices. Therefore, an efficient hardware design approach that requires some specific hardware resource may not be efficient if implemented in software. Substitution bit Permutation Network based ciphers such as PRESENT and GIFT are efficient, lightweight cryptographic hardware design approaches. These ciphers introduce confusion and diffusion by employing a 4\u2009×\u20094 static substitution box and bit permutations. The bit-wise permutation is realised by simple rerouting, which is most cost-effective to implement in hardware, resulting in negligible power consumption. However, this method is highly resource-consuming in software, particularly for large block-sized ciphers, with each single-bit permutation requiring multiple sub-operations. This paper proposes a novel software-based design approach for permutation operation in Substitution bit Permutation Network based ciphers using a bit-banding feature. The conventional permutation using bit rotation and the proposed approach have been implemented, analysed and compared for GIFT and PRESENT ciphers on ARM Cortex-M3-based LPC1768 development platform with KEIL MDK used as an Integrated Development Environment. The real-time performance comparison between conventional and the proposed approaches in terms of memory (RAM/ROM) footprint, power, energy and execution time has been carried out using ULINKpro and ULINKplus debug adapters for various code and speed optimisation scenarios. The proposed approach substantially reduces execution time, energy and power consumption for both PRESENT and GIFT ciphers, thus demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method for Substitution bit Permutation Network based symmetric block ciphers.}

Based on the life cycle and risk identification points we found, we propose an automatic detection model named Aparecium. First, a graph generation method which focus on the scam life cycle is adopted to mitigate the sparsity of the scam behaviors. Second, the life cycle patterns are delicate modeled because of the crypticity and antagonism of Ethereum scam behaviors.

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P cryptocurrency. It supports users to use pseudonyms instead of network addresses to send and receive transactions at the data layer, hiding users’ real network identities. Traditional transaction tracing attack cuts through the network layer to directly associate each transaction with the network address that issued it, thus revealing the sender’s network identity. But this attack can be mitigated by Bitcoin’s network layer privacy protections. Since Bitcoin protects the unlinkability of Bitcoin addresses and there may be a many-to-one relationship between addresses and nodes, transactions sent from the same node via different addresses are seen as coming from different nodes because attackers can only use addresses as node identifiers. In this paper, we proposed the evicting and filling attack to expose the correlations between addresses and cluster transactions sent from different addresses of the same node. The attack exploited the unisolation of Bitcoin’s incoming connection processing mechanism. In particular, an attacker can utilize the shared connection pool and deterministic connection eviction strategy to infer the correlation between incoming and evicting connections, as well as the correlation between releasing and filling connections. Based on inferred results, different addresses of the same node with these connections can be linked together, whether they are of the same or different network types. We designed a multi-step attack procedure, and set reasonable attack parameters through analyzing the factors that affect the attack efficiency and accuracy. We mounted this attack on both our self-run nodes and multi-address nodes in real Bitcoin network, achieving an average accuracy of 96.9% and 82%, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the attack is also applicable to Zcash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash. We analyzed the cost of network-wide attacks, the application scenario, and proposed countermeasures of this attack.}

	abstract = {Small-state stream ciphers (SSCs), which violate the principle that the state size should exceed the key size by a factor of two, still demonstrate robust security properties while maintaining a lightweight design. These ciphers can be classified into several constructions and their basic security requirement is to resist generic attacks, i.e., the time–memory–data tradeoff (TMDTO) attack. In this paper, we investigate the security of small-state constructions in the multi-user setting. Based on it, the TMDTO distinguishing attack and the TMDTO key recovery attack are developed for such a setting. It is shown that SSCs which continuously use the key can not resist the TMDTO distinguishing attack. Moreover, SSCs based on the continuous-IV-key-use construction cannot withstand the TMDTO key recovery attack when the key length is shorter than the IV length, no matter whether the keystream length is limited or not. Finally, we apply these two generic attacks to TinyJAMBU and DRACO in the multi-user setting. The TMDTO distinguishing attack on TinyJAMBU with a 128-bit key can be mounted with time, memory, and data complexities of \\(2^{64}\\), \\(2^{48}\\), and \\(2^{32}\\), respectively. This attack is comparable with a recent work on ToSC 2022, where partial key bits of TinyJAMBU are recovered with more than \\(2^{50}\\) users (or keys). As DRACO’s IV length is smaller than its key length, it is vulnerable to the TMDTO key recovery attack. The resulting attack has a time and memory complexity of both \\(2^{112}\\), which means DRACO does not provide 128-bit security in the multi-user setting.}

	abstract = {Due to the importance of Critical Infrastructure (CI) in a nation’s economy, they have been lucrative targets for cyber attackers. These critical infrastructures are usually Cyber-Physical Systems such as power grids, water, and sewage treatment facilities, oil and gas pipelines, etc. In recent times, these systems have suffered from cyber attacks numerous times. Researchers have been developing cyber security solutions for CIs to avoid lasting damages. According to standard frameworks, cyber security based on identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery are at the core of these research. Detection of an ongoing attack that escapes standard protection such as firewall, anti-virus, and host/network intrusion detection has gained importance as such attacks eventually affect the physical dynamics of the system. Therefore, anomaly detection in physical dynamics proves an effective means to implement defense-in-depth. PASAD is one example of anomaly detection in the sensor/actuator data, representing such systems’ physical dynamics. We present EPASAD, which improves the detection technique used in PASAD to detect these micro-stealthy attacks, as our experiments show that PASAD’s spherical boundary-based detection fails to detect. Our method EPASAD overcomes this by using Ellipsoid boundaries, thereby tightening the boundaries in various dimensions, whereas a spherical boundary treats all dimensions equally. We validate EPASAD using the dataset produced by the TE-process simulator and the C-town datasets. The results show that EPASAD improves PASAD’s average recall by 5.8% and 9.5% for the two datasets, respectively.}

In a report, CWE denotes the weakness of the vulnerability and thus helps quickly understand the cause of the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE assignment is useful for categorizing newly discovered vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose an automatic CWE assignment method with graph neural networks. First, we prepare a dataset that contains 3394 real world vulnerabilities from Linux, OpenSSL, Wireshark and many other software programs. Then, we extract statements with vulnerability syntax features from these vulnerabilities and use program slicing to slice them according to the categories of syntax features. On top of slices, we represent these slices with graphs that characterize the data dependency and control dependency between statements. Finally, we employ the graph neural networks to learn the hidden information from these graphs and leverage the Siamese network to compute the similarity between vulnerability functions, thereby assigning CWE IDs for these vulnerabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective compared to existing methods.}

	abstract = {In CRYPTO 2019, Gohr opens up a new direction for cryptanalysis. He successfully applied deep learning to differential cryptanalysis against the NSA block cipher SPECK32/64, achieving higher accuracy than traditional differential distinguishers. Until now, one of the mainstream research directions is increasing the training sample size and utilizing different neural networks to improve the accuracy of neural distinguishers. This conversion mindset may lead to a huge number of parameters, heavy computing load, and a large number of memory in the distinguishers training process. However, in the practical application of cryptanalysis, the applicability of the attacks method in a resource-constrained environment is very important. Therefore, we focus on the cost optimization and aim to reduce network parameters for differential neural cryptanalysis.In this paper, we propose two cost-optimized neural distinguisher improvement methods from the aspect of data format and network structure, respectively. Firstly, we obtain a partial output difference neural distinguisher using only 4-bits training data format which is constructed with a new advantage bits search algorithm based on two key improvement conditions. In addition, we perform an interpretability analysis of the new neural distinguishers whose results are mainly reflected in the relationship between the neural distinguishers, truncated differential, and advantage bits. Secondly, we replace the traditional convolution with the depthwise separable convolution to reduce the training cost without affecting the accuracy as much as possible. Overall, the number of training parameters can be reduced by less than 50% by using our new network structure for training neural distinguishers. Finally, we apply the network structure to the partial output difference neural distinguishers. The combinatorial approach have led to a further reduction in the number of parameters (approximately 30% of Gohr’s distinguishers for SPECK).}

	abstract = {The popularity of small office and home office routers has brought convenience, but it also caused many security issues due to vulnerabilities. Black-box fuzzing through network protocols to discover vulnerabilities becomes a viable option. The main drawbacks of state-of-the-art black-box fuzzers can be summarized as follows. First, the feedback process neglects to discover the missing fields in the raw message. Secondly, the guidance of the raw message content in the mutation process is aimless. Finally, the randomized validity of the test case structure can cause most fuzzing tests to end up with an invalid response of the tested device. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box fuzzing framework called MSLFuzzer. MSLFuzzer infers the raw message structure according to the response from a tested device and generates a message segment list. Furthermore, MSLFuzzer performs semantic, sequence, and stability analyses on each message segment to enhance the complementation of missing fields in the raw message and guide the mutation process. We construct a dataset of 35 real-world vulnerabilities and evaluate MSLFuzzer. The evaluation results show that MSLFuzzer can find more vulnerabilities and elicit more types of responses from fuzzing targets. Additionally, MSLFuzzer successfully discovered 10 previously unknown vulnerabilities.}

Then, we demonstrate that our scheme satisfies all security requirements, in particular, our VDF can resist several attacks, including the latest attacks for SIDH. Besides, resorting to the same techniques, a secure delay encryption from hyperelliptic curves is constructed by modifying Boneh and Frankiln’s IBE scheme, which shares the identical setup with our VDF scheme. As far as we know, these schemes are the first cryptographic applications from high-genus isogenies apart from basic protocols, i.e., hash functions and key exchange protocols.}

The anonymity of evaluation nodes is assessed based on stable intervals and behavior baselines defined according to their normal operating status. The anonymity of the network is evaluated using an improved normalized information entropy method that refines anonymity evaluation to the anonymity of each node and expands the dimensionality of evaluation features. This paper compares the effectiveness of our proposed method with static framework information entropy and single indicator methods by evaluating the degree of anonymity provided by a self-built Tor anonymous network under multiple operating scenarios including normal and under attack.

For particular systems, one crucial step in the password-cracking process is comparison or matchmaking between password-guess hashes and real hashes.

When the database size is large, the efficiency of privacy information retrieval protocols is relatively low. This paper designs an effective privacy information retrieval model based on hybrid fully homomorphic encryption. The assignment method is cleverly used to replace a large number of homomorphic encryption operations. At the same time, the multiplicative homomorphic encryption scheme is first used to deal with the large-scale serialization in the search, and then the fully homomorphic encryption scheme is used to deal with the remaining simple operations. The depth of operations supported by the fully homomorphic scheme no longer depends on the size of the database, but only needs to support the single homomorphic encryption scheme to decrypt the circuit depth. Based on this hybrid homomorphic encryption retrieval model, the efficiency of homomorphic privacy information retrieval model can be greatly improved.}

	abstract = {In today’s interconnected world, network traffic is replete with adversarial attacks. As technology evolves, these attacks are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, making them even harder to detect. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) and, specifically machine learning (ML), have shown great success in fast and accurate detection, classification, and even analysis of such threats. Accordingly, there is a growing body of literature addressing how subfields of AI/ML (e.g., natural language processing (NLP)) are getting leveraged to accurately detect evasive malicious patterns in network traffic. In this paper, we delve into the current advancements in ML-based network traffic classification using image visualization. Through a rigorous experimental methodology, we first explore the process of network traffic to image conversion. Subsequently, we investigate how machine learning techniques can effectively leverage image visualization to accurately classify evasive malicious traces within network traffic. Through the utilization of production-level tools and utilities in realistic experiments, our proposed solution achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.48% in detecting fileless malware, which is widely regarded as one of the most elusive classes of malicious software.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) suffers from the Non-IID problem in practice, which poses a challenge for efficient and accurate model training. To address this challenge, prior research has introduced clustered FL (CFL), which involves clustering clients and training them separately. Despite its potential benefits, CFL can be computationally and communicationally expensive when the data distribution is unknown beforehand. This is because CFL involves the entire neural networks of involved clients in computing the clusters during training, which can become increasingly time-consuming with large-sized models. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an efficient CFL approach called LayerCFL that employs a Layer-wised clustering technique. In LayerCFL, clients are clustered based on a limited number of layers of neural networks that are pre-selected using statistical and experimental methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LayerCFL in mitigating the impact of Non-IID data, improving the accuracy of clustering, and enhancing computational efficiency.}

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have achieved significant progress in many domains, such as autonomous driving, facial recognition, and speech recognition. However, the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks has raised serious concerns in the community because of their insufficient robustness and generalization. Also, transferable attacks have become a prominent method for black-box attacks. In this work, we explore the potential factors that impact adversarial examples (AEs) transferability in DL-based speech recognition. We also discuss the vulnerability of different DL systems and the irregular nature of decision boundaries. Our results show a remarkable difference in the transferability of AEs between speech and images, with the data relevance being low in images but opposite in speech recognition. Motivated by dropout-based ensemble approaches, we propose random gradient ensembles and dynamic gradient-weighted ensembles, and we evaluate the impact of ensembles on the transferability of AEs. The results show that the AEs created by both approaches are valid for transfer to the black box API.}

	abstract = {The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is a popular choice for cryptosystems due to its high level of security. However, with the advent of the extended Shor’s algorithm, there is concern that ECDLP may soon be vulnerable. While the algorithm does offer hope in solving ECDLP, it is still uncertain whether it can pose a real threat in practice. From the perspective of the quantum circuits of the algorithm, this paper analyzes the feasibility of cracking ECDLP using an ion trap quantum computer with improved quantum circuits for the extended Shor’s algorithm. We give precise quantum circuits for extended Shor’s algorithm to calculate discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields, including modular subtraction, three different modular multiplication, and modular inverse. Additionally, we incorporate and improve upon windowed arithmetic in the circuits to reduce the CNOT-counts. Whereas previous studies mostly focused on minimizing the number of qubits or the depth of the circuit, we focus on minimizing the number of CNOT gates in the circuit, which greatly affects the running time of the algorithm on an ion trap quantum computer. Specifically, we begin by presenting implementations of basic arithmetic operations with the lowest known CNOT-counts, along with improved constructions for modular inverse, point addition, and windowed arithmetic. Next, we precisely estimate that, to execute the extended Shor’s algorithm with the improved circuits to factor an n-bit integer, the CNOT-count required is \\(1237n^3/\\log n+2n^2+n\\). Finally, we analyze the running time and feasibility of the extended Shor’s algorithm on an ion trap quantum computer.}

	abstract = {Lightweight block ciphers are the essential encryption algorithm for devices with limited resources. Its goal is to ensure the security of data transmission through resource-constrained devices. Impossible differential cryptanalysis is one of the most effective cryptanalysis on block ciphers, and assessing the ability of resisting this attack is a basic design criterion. Shadow is a lightweight block cipher proposed by Guo et al. (IEEE Internet Things J 8(16):13014–13023, 2021). It utilizes a combination of ARX operations and generalized Feistel structure to overcome the weakness of the traditional Feistel structure that only diffuses half in one round. In this paper, we focus on the differential property of Shadow and its security against impossible differential cryptanalysis. First, we use the SAT method to automatically search for a full-round impossible differential distinguisher of Shadow-32. Then, based on the experimental results, we prove that Shadow has a differential property with probability 1 based on the propagation of the state. Further, we can obtain an impossible differential distinguisher for an arbitrary number of rounds of Shadow. Finally, we perform a full key recovery attack on the full-round Shadow-32 and Shadow-64. Both experimentally and theoretically, our results indicate that Shadow is critically flawed, and regardless of the security strength of the internal components and the number of rounds applied, the overall cipher remains vulnerable to impossible differential cryptanalysis.}

	abstract = {The attacker in white-box model has full access to software implementation of a cryptographic algorithm and full control over its execution environment. In order to solve the issues of high storage cost and inadequate security about most current white-box cryptographic schemes, WAS, an improved white-box cryptographic algorithm over AS iteration is proposed. This scheme utilizes the AS iterative structure to construct a lookup table with a five-layer ASASA structure, and the maximum distance separable matrix is used as a linear layer to achieve complete diffusion in a small number of rounds. Attackers can be prevented from recovering the key under black-box model. The length of nonlinear layer S and affine layer A in lookup table is 16 bits, which effectively avoids decomposition attack against the ASASA structure and makes the algorithm possess anti-key extraction security under the white-box model, while WAS possesses weak white-box (32\xa0KB, 112)-space hardness to satisfy anti-code lifting security. WAS has provable security and better storage cost than existing schemes, with the same anti-key extraction security and anti-code lifting security, only 128\xa0KB of memory space is required in WAS, which is only 14% of SPACE-16 algorithm and 33% of Yoroi-16 algorithm.}
