	abstract = {Fine-grained function-level encrypted traffic classification is an essential approach to maintaining network security. Machine learning and deep learning have become mainstream methods to analyze traffic, and labeled dataset construction is the basis. Android occupies a huge share of the mobile operating system market. Instant Messaging (IM) applications are important tools for people communication. But such applications have complex functions which frequently switched, so it is difficult to obtain function-level labels. The existing function-level public datasets in Android are rare and noisy, leading to research stagnation. Most labeled samples are collected with WLAN devices, which cannot exclude the operating system background traffic. At the same time, other datasets need to obtain root permission or use scripts to simulate user behavior. These collecting methods either destroy the security of the mobile device or ignore the real operation features of users with coarse-grained. Previous work (Chen et al. in Appl Sci 12(22):11731, 2022) proposed a one-stop automated encrypted traffic labeled sample collection, construction, and correlation system, A3C, running at the application-level in Android. This paper analyzes the display characteristics of IM and proposes a function-level low-overhead labeled encrypted traffic datasets construction method for Android, F3L. The supplementary method to A3C monitors UI controls and layouts of the Android system in the foreground. It selects the feature fields of attributes of them for different in-app functions to build an in-app function label matching library for target applications and in-app functions. The deviation of timestamp between function invocation and label identification completion is calibrated to cut traffic samples and map them to corresponding labels. Experiments show that the method can match the correct label within 3\xa0s after the user operation.}

Existing works on insider threat detection fail to make full use of the time information, which leads to their poor detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel behavioral feature extraction scheme: we implicitly encode absolute time information in the behavioral feature sequences and use a feature sequence construction method taking covariance into account to make our scheme adaptive to users. We select Stacked Bidirectional LSTM and Feedforward Neural Network to build a deep learning-based insider threat detection model: Behavior Rhythm Insider Threat Detection (BRITD). BRITD is universally applicable to various insider threat scenarios, and it has good insider threat detection performance: it achieves an AUC of 0.9730 and a precision of 0.8072 with the CMU CERT dataset, which exceeds all baselines.}

	abstract = {In the realm of cybersecurity, the detection and analysis of obfuscated malware remain a critical challenge, especially in the context of memory dumps. This research paper presents a novel machine learning-based framework designed to enhance the detection and analytical capabilities against such elusive threats for binary and multi type’s malware. Our approach leverages a comprehensive dataset comprising benign and malicious memory dumps, encompassing a wide array of obfuscated malware types including Spyware, Ransomware, and Trojan Horses with their sub-categories. We begin by employing rigorous data preprocessing methods, including the normalization of memory dumps and encoding of categorical data. To tackle the issue of class imbalance, a Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique is utilized, ensuring a balanced representation of various malware types. Feature selection is meticulously conducted through Chi-Square tests, mutual information, and correlation analyses, refining the model’s focus on the most indicative attributes of obfuscated malware. The heart of our framework lies in the deployment of an Ensemble-based Classifier, chosen for its robustness and effectiveness in handling complex data structures. The model’s performance is rigorously evaluated using a suite of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) with other evaluation metrics to assess the model’s efficiency. The proposed model demonstrates a detection accuracy exceeding 99% across all cases, surpassing the performance of all existing models in the realm of malware detection.}

	abstract = {In MILCOM 2015, Kelly et al. proposed the authentication encryption algorithm MK-3, which applied the 16-bit S-box. This paper aims to implement the 16-bit S-box with less circuit area. First, we classified the irreducible polynomials over \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^n}\\) into three kinds. Then we compared the logic gates required for multiplication over the finite field constructed by the three types of irreducible polynomials. According to the comparison result, we constructed the composite fields, \\(\\mathbb {F}_{(2^4)^2}\\) and \\(\\mathbb {F}_{(2^8)^2}\\). Based on the isomorphism of finite fields, the operations over \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^{16}}\\) can be conducted over \\(\\mathbb {F}_{(2^8)^2}\\). Similarly, elements over \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^8}\\) can be mapped to the corresponding elements over \\(\\mathbb {F}_{(2^4)^2}\\). Next, the SAT solver was used to optimize the operations over smaller field \\(\\mathbb {F}_{2^4}\\). At last, the architecture of the optimized MK-3\xa0S-box was worked out. Compared with the implementation proposed by the original designer, the circuit area of the MK-3\xa0S-box in this paper is reduced by at least 55.9%.}

Nonetheless, the application of FHE is constrained by its substantial computing overhead and storage cost. Researchers have proposed practical acceleration solutions to address these issues. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey for systematically comparing and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of FHE acceleration schemes, which is currently lacking in the literature. The relevant researches conducted between 2019 and 2022 are investigated.

Secondly, we classify existing acceleration schemes from algorithmic and hardware perspectives. We also propose evaluation metrics and conduct a detailed comparison of various methods. Finally, our study presents the future research directions of FHE acceleration, and also offers both guidance and support for practical application and theoretical research in this field.}

	abstract = {Models based on MLP-Mixer architecture are becoming popular, but they still suffer from adversarial examples. Although it has been shown that MLP-Mixer is more robust to adversarial attacks compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there has been no research on adversarial attacks tailored to its architecture. In this paper, we fill this gap. We propose a dedicated attack framework called Maxwell’s demon Attack (MA). Specifically, we break the channel-mixing and token-mixing mechanisms of the MLP-Mixer by perturbing inputs of each Mixer layer to achieve high transferability. We demonstrate that disrupting the MLP-Mixer’s capture of the main information of images by masking its inputs can generate adversarial examples with cross-architectural transferability. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness and superior performance of MA. Perturbations generated based on masked inputs obtain a higher success rate of black-box attacks than existing transfer attacks. Moreover, our approach can be easily combined with existing methods to improve the transferability both within MLP-Mixer based models and to models with different architectures. We achieve up to 55.9% attack performance improvement. Our work exploits the true generalization potential of the MLP-Mixer adversarial space and helps make it more robust for future deployments.}

	abstract = {The encryption of user data is crucial when employing electronic health record services to guarantee the security of the data stored on cloud servers. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is considered a powerful encryption technique that offers flexible and fine-grained access control capabilities. Further, the multi-user collaborative access ABE scheme additionally supports users to acquire access authorization through collaborative works. However, the existing multi-user collaborative access ABE schemes do not consider the different weights of collaboration users. Therefore, using these schemes for weighted multi-user collaborative access results in redundant attributes, which inevitably reduces the efficiency of the ABE scheme. This paper proposes a revocable and verifiable weighted attribute-based encryption with collaborative access scheme (RVWABE-CA), which can provide efficient weighted multi-user collaborative access, user revocation, and data integrity verification, as the fundamental cornerstone for establishing a robust framework to facilitate secure sharing of electronic health records in a public cloud environment. In detail, this scheme employs a novel weighted access tree to eliminate redundant attributes, utilizes encryption version information to control user revocation, and establishes Merkle Hash Tree for data integrity verification. We prove that our scheme is resistant against chosen plaintext attack. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme has significant computational efficiency advantages compared to related works, without increasing storage or communication overhead. Therefore, the RVWABE-CA scheme can provide an efficient and flexible weighted collaborative access control and user revocation mechanism as well as data integrity verification for electronic health record systems.}

	abstract = {Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are cryptographic protocols that offer efficient and privacy-preserving means of verifying NP language relations and have drawn considerable attention for their appealing applications, e.g., verifiable computation and anonymous payment protocol. Compared with the pre-quantum case, the practicability of this primitive in the post-quantum setting is still unsatisfactory, especially for the space complexity. To tackle this issue, this work seeks to enhance the efficiency and compactness of lattice-based zk-SNARKs, including proof length and common reference string (CRS) length. In this paper, we develop the framework of square span program-based SNARKs and design new zk-SNARKs over cyclotomic rings. Compared with previous works, our construction is without parallel repetition and achieves shorter proof and CRS lengths than previous lattice-based zk-SNARK schemes. Particularly, the proof length of our scheme is around \\(23.3\\%\\) smaller than the recent shortest lattice-based zk-SNARKs by Ishai et al. (in: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC conference on computer and communications security, pp 212–234, 2021), and the CRS length is \\(3.6\\times\\) smaller. Our constructions follow the framework of Gennaro et al. (in: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC conference on computer and communications security, pp 556–573, 2018), and adapt it to the ring setting by slightly modifying the knowledge assumptions. We develop concretely small constructions by using module-switching and key-switching procedures in a novel way.}

	abstract = {In generating adversarial examples, the conventional black-box attack methods rely on sufficient feedback from the to-be-attacked models by repeatedly querying until the attack is successful, which usually results in thousands of trials during an attack. This may be unacceptable in real applications since Machine Learning as a Service Platform (MLaaS) usually only returns the final result (i.e., hard-label) to the client and a system equipped with certain defense mechanisms could easily detect malicious queries. By contrast, a feasible way is a hard-label attack that simulates an attacked action being permitted to conduct a limited number of queries. To implement this idea, in this paper, we bypass the dependency on the to-be-attacked model and benefit from the characteristics of the distributions of adversarial examples to reformulate the attack problem in a distribution transform manner and propose a distribution transform-based attack (DTA). DTA builds a statistical mapping from the benign example to its adversarial counterparts by tackling the conditional likelihood under the hard-label black-box settings. In this way, it is no longer necessary to query the target model frequently. A well-trained DTA model can directly and efficiently generate a batch of adversarial examples for a certain input, which can be used to attack un-seen models based on the assumed transferability. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the well-trained DTA model is not sensitive to the semantic spaces of the training dataset, meaning that the model yields acceptable attack performance on other datasets. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed idea and the superiority of DTA over the state-of-the-art.}

JCLB utilizes contrastive learning to enhance similarity in the vector space between token sequence representations of entities in the same category. A Belief Rule Base (BRB) is developed using regexes to ensure accurate entity identification, particularly for fixed-format phrases lacking semantics.

The number of signatures supported by a single public key is still limited, though by a large number.

Even so, the gradient inversion attack, in which the adversary can reconstruct the original data from shared training gradients, has been widely deemed as a severe threat. Nevertheless, most existing researches are confined to impractical assumptions and narrow range of applications. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose a comprehensive framework for gradient inversion attack, with well-designed algorithms for image and label reconstruction. For image reconstruction, we fully utilize the generative image prior, which derives from wide-used generative models, to improve the reconstructed results, by additional means of iterative optimization on mixed spaces and gradient-free optimizer. For label reconstruction, we design an adaptive recovery algorithm regarding real data distribution, which can adjust previous attacks to more complex scenarios. Moreover, we incorporate a gradient approximation method to efficiently fit our attack for FedAvg scenario. We empirically verify our attack framework using benchmark datasets and ablation studies, considering loose assumptions and complicated circumstances. We hope this work can greatly reveal the necessity of privacy protection in federated learning, while urge more effective and robust defense mechanisms.}

	abstract = {The network security analyzers use intrusion detection systems (IDSes) to distinguish malicious traffic from benign ones. The deep learning-based (DL-based) IDSes are proposed to auto-extract high-level features and eliminate the time-consuming and costly signature extraction process. However, this new generation of IDSes still needs to overcome a number of challenges to be employed in practical environments. One of the main issues of an applicable IDS is facing traffic concept drift, which manifests itself as new (i.e.\xa0, zero-day) attacks, in addition to the changing behavior of benign users/applications. Furthermore, a practical DL-based IDS needs to be conformed to a distributed (i.e.\xa0, multi-sensor) architecture in order to yield more accurate detections, create a collective attack knowledge based on the observations of different sensors, and also handle big data challenges for supporting high throughput networks. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent network intrusion detection framework to address the above shortcomings, considering a more practical scenario (i.e., online adaptable IDSes). This framework employs continual deep anomaly detectors for adapting each agent to the changing attack/benign patterns in its local traffic. In addition, a federated learning approach is proposed for sharing and exchanging local knowledge between different agents. Furthermore, the proposed framework implements sequential packet labeling for each flow, which provides an attack probability score for the flow by gradually observing each flow packet and updating its estimation. We evaluate the proposed framework by employing different deep models (including CNN-based and LSTM-based) over the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Through extensive evaluations and experiments, we show that the proposed distributed framework is well adapted to the traffic concept drift. More precisely, our results indicate that the CNN-based models are well suited for continually adapting to the traffic concept drift (i.e.\xa0, achieving an average detection rate of above 95% while needing just 128 new flows for the updating phase), and the LSTM-based models are a good candidate for sequential packet labeling in practical online IDSes (i.e.\xa0, detecting intrusions by just observing their first 15 packets).}

	abstract = {Smart Grid (SG) technology utilizes advanced network communication and monitoring technologies to manage and regulate electricity generation and transport. However, this increased reliance on technology and connectivity also introduces new vulnerabilities, making SG communication networks susceptible to large-scale attacks. While previous surveys have mainly provided high-level overviews of SG architecture, our analysis goes further by presenting a comprehensive architectural diagram encompassing key SG components and communication links. This holistic view enhances understanding of potential cyber threats and enables systematic cyber risk assessment for SGs. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy of various cyberattack types based on their targets and methods, offering detailed insights into vulnerabilities. Unlike other reviews focused narrowly on protection and detection, our proposed categorization covers all five functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework. This delivers a broad perspective to help organizations implement balanced and robust security. Consequently, we have identified critical research gaps, especially regarding response and recovery mechanisms. This underscores the need for further investigation to bolster SG cybersecurity. These research needs, among others, are highlighted as open issues in our concluding section.}

	abstract = {The existing physical layer security schemes, which are based on the key generation model and the wire-tap channel model, achieve security by utilizing channel reciprocity entropy and noise entropy, respectively. In contrast, we propose a novel secure transmission framework that combines noise entropy with reciprocity entropy, achieved by inserting reciprocity entropy into the frozen bits of polar codes. Note that in real-world scenarios, when eavesdroppers employ polynomial-time attacks, the bit error rate (BER) increases due to the introduction of computational entropy. To achieve indistinguishability security, we convert the practical physical layer security metric, BER, into the average min-entropy, a widely accepted concept in cryptography. The simulation results demonstrate that the eavesdropper’s BER can be significantly increased without compromising the communication performance of the legitimate receiver. Under concrete parameters we selected, when compared to the joint scheme of physical layer key generation and one time pad, the modular semantically-secure scheme based on the wire-tap channel model, and the simple channel entropy combination scheme, our scheme achieves a message rate approximately 1.2 times, 3.8 times, and 1.4 times better, respectively. Experimental testing validates the feasibility of our scheme.}

	abstract = {Using deep learning models to deal with the classification tasks in network traffic offers a new approach to address the imbalanced Internet of Things malicious traffic classification problems. However, the employment difficulty of these models may be immense due to their high resource consumption and inadequate interpretability. Fortunately, the effectiveness of sampling methods based on the statistical principles in imbalance data distribution indicates the path. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a hybrid sampling method, termed HSS, which integrates undersampling and oversampling techniques. Our approach not only mitigates the imbalance in malicious traffic but also fine-tunes the sampling threshold to optimize performance, as substantiated through validation tests. Employed across three distinct classification tasks, this method furnishes simplified yet representative samples, enhancing the baseline models’ classification capabilities by a minimum of 6.02% and a maximum of 182.66%. Moreover, it notably reduces resource consumption, with sample numbers diminishing to a ratio of at least 83.53%. This investigation serves as a foundation, demonstrating the efficacy of HSS in bolstering security measures in IoT networks, potentially guiding the development of more adept and resource-efficient solutions.}

	abstract = {Atomic Cross-Chain Swap (ACCS) is one important topic in cryptocurrency, where users can securely and trustlessly exchange assets between two different blockchains. However, most known ACCS schemes assume specific scripting functionalities of the underlying blockchains, such as Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC). In addition, these schemes are typically only applicable to certain digital signature schemes, like Schnorr or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\xa0(ECDSA) signatures. In this paper, we propose a generic ACCS scheme, independent from the underlying blockchains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution of this kind. Our results are as follows. First, we define a formal system model of ACCS. Next, we present a generic ACCS scheme meets our model. This scheme admits atomicity in cross-chain swaps without the need for a Trusted Third Party (TTP)\xa0and protects users’ privacy. Finally, by using the Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge\xa0(NIZK) proof protocol as a tool, we instantiate our generic scheme for Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem-based (ECDLP-based)\xa0signatures. In addition, we implement our scheme, and the experimental results show that our protocol outperforms the existing ACCS schemes, such as the HTLC-based schemes.}

	abstract = {During the standardisation process of post-quantum cryptography, NIST encourages research on side-channel analysis for candidate schemes. As the recommended lattice signature scheme, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, when implemented on hardware, has seen limited research on side-channel analysis, and current attacks are incomplete or requires a substantial quantity of traces. Therefore, we conducted a more complete analysis to investigate the leakage of an FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium using the Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) method, where with a minimum of 70,000 traces partial private key coefficients can be recovered. Furthermore, we optimise the attack by extracting Point-of-Interests using known information due to parallelism (named CPA-PoI) and by iteratively utilising parallel leakages (named CPA-ITR). Our experimental results show that CPA-PoI reduces the number of traces by up to 16.67%, CPA-ITR by up to 25%, and both increase the number of recovered key coefficients by up to 55.17% and 93.10% using the same number of traces. They outperfom the CPA method. As a result, it suggests that the FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium is more vulnerable than thought before to side-channel analysis.}

	abstract = {Within the thriving e-commerce landscape, some unscrupulous merchants hire spammer groups to post misleading reviews or ratings, aiming to manipulate public perception and disrupt fair market competition. This phenomenon has prompted a heightened research focus on spammer groups detection. In the e-commerce domain, current spammer group detection algorithms can be classified into three categories, i.e., Frequent Item Mining-based, graph-based, and burst-based algorithms. However, existing graph-based algorithms have limitations in that they did not adequately consider the redundant relationships within co-review graphs and neglected to detect overlapping members within spammer groups. To address these issues, we introduce an overlapping spammer group detection algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning named DRL-OSG. First, the algorithm filters out highly suspicious products and gets the set of reviewers who have reviewed these products. Secondly, taking these reviewers as nodes and their co-reviewing relationships as edges, we construct a homogeneous co-reviewing graph. Thirdly, to efficiently identify and handle the redundant relationships that are accidentally formed between ordinary users and spammer group members, we propose the Auto-Sim algorithm, which is a specifically tailored algorithm for dynamic optimization of the co-reviewing graph, allowing for adjustments to the reviewers’ relationship network within the graph. Finally, candidate spammer groups are discovered by using the Ego-Splitting overlapping clustering algorithm, allowing overlapping members to exist in these groups. Then, these groups are refined and ranked to derive the final list of spammer groups. Experimental results based on real-life datasets show that our proposed DRL-OSG algorithm performs better than the baseline algorithms in Precision.}

Universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which are independent of the examples, have recently received wide attention for their enhanced real-time applicability and expanded threat range. However, most of the UAP research concentrates on the image domain, and less on speech. In this paper, we propose a staged perturbation generation method that constructs CommanderUAP, which achieves a high success rate of universal adversarial attack against speech recognition models. Moreover, we apply some methods from model training to improve the generalization in attack and we control the imperceptibility of the perturbation in both time and frequency domains. In specific scenarios, CommanderUAP can also transfer attack some commercial speech recognition APIs.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates more than billions of intelligent devices over the globe with the capability of communicating with other connected devices with little to no human intervention. IoT enables data aggregation and analysis on a large scale to improve life quality in many domains. In particular, data collected by IoT contain a tremendous amount of information for anomaly detection. The heterogeneous nature of IoT is both a challenge and an opportunity for cybersecurity. Traditional approaches in cybersecurity monitoring often require different kinds of data pre-processing and handling for various data types, which might be problematic for datasets that contain heterogeneous features. However, heterogeneous types of network devices can often capture a more diverse set of signals than a single type of device readings, which is particularly useful for anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on using ensemble machine learning methods for enhancing IoT cybersecurity via anomaly detection. Rather than using one single machine learning model, ensemble learning combines the predictive power from multiple models, enhancing their predictive accuracy in heterogeneous datasets rather than using one single machine learning model. We propose a unified framework with ensemble learning that utilises Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to adapt to a network environment that contains multiple IoT sensor readings. Experimentally, we illustrate their high predictive power when compared to traditional methods.}

	abstract = {Reflection attacks are one of the most intimidating threats organizations face. A reflection attack is a special type of distributed denial-of-service attack that amplifies the amount of malicious traffic by using reflectors and hides the identity of the attacker. Reflection attacks are known to be one of the most common causes of service disruption in large networks. Large networks perform extensive logging of NetFlow data, and parsing this data is an advocated basis for identifying network attacks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of NetFlow data containing 1.7 billion NetFlow records and identified reflection attacks on the network time protocol (NTP) and NetBIOS servers. We set up three regression models including the Ridge, Elastic Net and LASSO. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that studied different regression models to understand patterns of reflection attacks in a large network. In this paper, we (a) propose an approach for identifying correlations of reflection attacks, and (b) evaluate the three regression models on real NetFlow data. Our results show that (a) reflection attacks on the NTP servers are not correlated, (b) reflection attacks on the NetBIOS servers are not correlated, (c) the traffic generated by those reflection attacks did not overwhelm the NTP and NetBIOS servers, and (d) the dwell times of reflection attacks on the NTP and NetBIOS servers are too small for predicting reflection attacks on these servers. Our work on reflection attacks identification highlights recommendations that could facilitate better handling of reflection attacks in large networks.}

	abstract = {Homomorphic evaluation of hash functions offers a solution to the challenge of data integrity authentication in the context of homomorphic encryption. The earliest attempt to achieve homomorphic evaluation of SHA-256 hash function was proposed by Mella and Susella (in: Cryptography and coding—14th IMA international conference, IMACC 2013. Lecture notes in computer science, vol 8308. Springer, Heidelberg, pp 28–44, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-45239-0_3.) based on the BGV scheme. Unfortunately, their implementation faced significant limitations due to the exceedingly high multiplicative depth, rendering it impractical. Recently, a homomorphic implementation of SHA-256 based on the TFHE scheme (Homomorphic evaluation of SHA-256. https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs/tree/main/tfhe/examples/sha256_bool) brings it from theory to reality, however, its current efficiency remains insufficient. In this paper, we revisit the homomorphic evaluation of the SHA-256 hash function in the context of TFHE, further reducing the reliance on gate bootstrapping and enhancing evaluation latency. Specifically, we primarily utilize ternary gates to reduce the number of gate bootstrappings required for logic functions in message expansion and addition of modulo \\(2^{32}\\) in iterative compression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our optimization techniques are applicable to the Chinese commercial cryptographic hash SM3. Finally, we give specific comparative implementations based on the TFHE-rs library. Experiments demonstrate that our optimization techniques lead to an improvement of approximately 35–50% compared with the state-of-the-art result under different cores.}

	abstract = {With the popularity of the media cloud computing industry, individuals and organizations outsource image computation and storage to the media cloud server to reduce the storage burden. Media images usually contain a large amount of private information. To prevent disclosure of privacy of the image owners, media images are encrypted before uploading to the server. However, this operation will greatly limit the utilization of the image for the user, such as content-based image retrieval. We propose an efficient similarity query algorithm with access control based on Bkd-tree in this paper, in which a searchable encryption scheme is designed for similarity image retrieval, and the encrypted image is used to extract image features by a pre-trained CNN model. The Bkd-tree is utilized to generate an index tree for the image features to speed up retrieval and make it faster than linear indexing. Finally, the security performances of the proposed scheme is analyzed and the performance of this scheme is evaluated by experiments. The results show that the security of the image content and image features can be ensured, and it has a shorter retrieval time and higher retrieval efficiency.}

	abstract = {Unprotected gradient exchange in federated learning (FL) systems may lead to gradient leakage-related attacks. CKKS is a promising approximate homomorphic encryption scheme to protect gradients, owing to its unique capability of performing operations directly on ciphertexts. However, configuring CKKS security parameters involves a trade-off between correctness, efficiency, and security. An evaluation gap exists regarding how these parameters impact computational performance. Additionally, the maximum vector length that CKKS can once encrypt, recommended by Homomorphic Encryption Standardization, is 16384, hampers its widespread adoption in FL when encrypting layers with numerous neurons. To protect gradients’ privacy in FL systems while maintaining practical performance, we comprehensively analyze the influence of security parameters such as polynomial modulus degree and coefficient modulus on homomorphic operations. Derived from our evaluation findings, we provide a method for selecting the optimal multiplication depth while meeting operational requirements. Then, we introduce an adaptive segmented encryption method tailored for CKKS, circumventing its encryption length constraint and enhancing its processing ability to encrypt neural network models. Finally, we present FedSHE, a privacy-preserving and efficient Federated learning scheme with adaptive Segmented CKKS Homomorphic Encryption. FedSHE is implemented on top of the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm and is available at https://github.com/yooopan/FedSHE. Our evaluation results affirm the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating that FedSHE outperforms existing homomorphic encryption-based federated learning research efforts in terms of model accuracy, computational efficiency, communication cost, and security level.}

The concept was further enhanced to threshold setting to distribute signing ability among several signers. Since threshold ring signature was introduced, it was a hard problem whether one can have efficient constructions for it. In this paper, we introduce a new generic construction of threshold ring signature, named GTRS, based on canonical identification of a specific form. Our signature consists of a polynomial (represented by \\(n - t + 1\\) coefficients) and a single response, resulting in significantly shorter threshold ring signatures. Instantiating the generic construction with specific DL-based components, e.g. Schnorr identification and a novel vector argument of knowledge developed in this paper, we obtain GTRS-EC, which is shorter than all existing threshold ring signatures without any trusted setup.}

Prior studies have focused on using fuzzing-based methods to generate more exploitable heap layouts. However, the exploitable heap layout cannot fully demonstrate the exploitability of a vulnerability, as it is uncertain whether the attacker can control the data covered by the overflow. In this paper, we propose the Heap Overflow Exploitability Evaluator (Hoee), a new approach to automatically reveal the exploitability of heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities by evaluating proof-of-concepts (PoCs) generated by fuzzers. Hoee leverages several techniques to collect dynamic information at runtime and recover heap object layouts in a fine-grained manner. The overflow context is carefully analyzed to determine whether the sensitive pointer is corrupted, tainted, or critically used. We evaluate Hoee on 34 real-world CVE vulnerabilities from 16 general-purpose programs. The results demonstrate that Hoee accurately identifies the key factors for developing exploits in vulnerable contexts and correctly recognizes the behavior of overflow.}

Though many protection mechanisms are provided, they have been proved easy to bypass, and the existed detection methods show poor performance when facing malicious documents with unknown vulnerabilities or with few malicious behaviors. In this paper, we first introduce the definition of im-documents, to describe those vulnerable documents which show implicitly malicious behaviors and escape most of public antivirus engines. Then we present GLDOC—a GCN based framework that is aimed at effectively detecting im-documents with dynamic analysis, and improving the possible blind spots of past detection methods. Besides the system call which is the only focus in most researches, we capture all dynamic behaviors in sandbox, take the process tree into consideration and reconstruct both of them into graphs. Using each line to learn each graph, GLDOC trains a 2-channel network as well as a classifier to formulate the malicious document detection problem into a graph learning and classification problem. Experiments show that GLDOC has a comprehensive balance of accuracy rate and false alarm rate\u2009−\u200995.33% and 4.33% respectively, outperforming other detection methods. When further testing in a simulated 5-day attacking scenario, our proposed framework still maintains a stable and high detection accuracy on the unknown vulnerabilities.}

Simply replacing DET with fully randomized encryption is often undesirable in the scenario of an encrypted database since it incurs a large overhead in query and storage. Frequency Smoothing Encryption (FSE) is a practical encryption scheme to protect frequency information. Current FSE constructions still fall short of efficiency and a reasonable security definition. We revisit FSE and propose two security definitions from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Furthermore, we adopt a novel partitioning strategy to construct a new FSE scheme to improve performance. Experimental results show that compared with others, our scheme achieves excellent query performance while attaining security against inference attacks.}

Due to the tremendous applications of IoT networks, the number of DDoS attacks is increasing significantly, and most sophisticated DDoS attacks are generated through IoT botnets. An IoT botnet-based DDoS attack can disrupt the network quickly with a surge of malicious traffic. Especially in an SDN network, it is important to detect the DDoS attack before it occurs to the SDN controller. DDoS attacks on the centralized controller of the SDN can disrupt the whole network. So, identifying DDoS attacks at the earliest is a critical security measure for network experts and practitioners. In this paper, we analyze the DDoS attack on an SDN environment and develop a method to identify the DDoS attack using Deep Learning (DL). The proposed method converts the captured raw network traffic to image data and classifies the malicious data from normal data. The method is evaluated on our test-bed simulated dataset and two other benchmark datasets. The experimental comparison shows that the proposed method performs better on all three datasets, giving more than 99% classification accuracy.}

	abstract = {With the continuous advancement of virtualization technology and the widespread adoption of 5G networks, the application of the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture has become increasingly popular and prevalent. While the NFV architecture brings a lot of advantages, it also introduces security challenges, including the effective and efficient verification of the integrity of deployed Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and ensuring the secure operation of VNFs. To address the challenge of efficiently conducting virtual remote attestation for VNFs and establishing trust in virtualized environments like NFV architecture, we propose TVRAVNF, which is a highly efficient and low-cost TEE-based virtual remote attestation scheme for VNFs. The scheme we proposed ensures the security and effectiveness of the virtual remote attestation process by leveraging TEE. Furthermore, we introduces a novel local attestation mechanism, which not only reduces the overall overhead of the virtual remote attestation process but also shortens the attestation interval to mitigate Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use attacks, thereby enhancing overall security. We conduct experiments to validate the overhead of the TVRAVNF scheme and compare its performance with that of a typical remote attestation process within a maximum unattested time interval. The experimental results demonstrate that, by employing the local attestation mechanism, our solution achieves nearly an 80% significant performance improvement with a relatively small time overhead for small to medium-sized files. This further substantiates the significant advantages of our approach in both security and efficiency.}

At present, human pose estimation is mainly utilized for detection of large targets, and there is no solution for detection of small targets. This paper proposes a multi-channel spatial information feature based human pose (MCSF-Pose) estimation algorithm to address the issue of medium and small targets inaccurate detection of human key points in scenarios involving occlusion and multiple poses. The MCSF-Pose network is a bottom-up regression network. Firstly, an UP-Focus module is designed to expand the feature information while reducing parameter computation during the up-sampling process. Then, the channel segmentation strategy is adopted to cut the features, and the feature information of multiple dimensions is retained through different convolutional groups, which reduces the parameter lightweight network model and makes up for the loss of the feature information associated with the depth of the network. Finally, the three-layer PANet structure is designed to reduce the complexity of the model. With the aid of the structure, it also to improve the detection accuracy and anti-interference ability of human key points. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms YOLO-Pose and other human pose estimation algorithms on COCO2017 and MPII human pose datasets.}

	abstract = {As mobile internet and Internet of Things technologies continue to advance, the application scenarios of peer-to-peer Internet of Drones (IoD) are becoming increasingly diverse. However, the development of IoD also faces significant challenges, such as security, privacy protection, and limited computing power, which require technological innovation to overcome. For group secure communication, it is necessary to provide two basic services, user authentication and group key agreement. Due to the limited storage of IoD devices, group key negotiation requires lightweight calculations, and conventional schemes cannot satisfy the requirements of group communication in the IoD. To this end, a new lightweight communication scheme based on ring neighbors is presented in this paper for IoD, which not only realizes the identity verification of user and group key negotiation, but also improves computational efficiency on each group member side. A detailed security analysis substantiates that the designed scheme is capable of withstanding attacks from both internal and external adversaries while satisfying all defined security requirements. More importantly, in our proposal, the computational cost on the user side remains unaffected by the variability of the number of members participating in group communication, as members communicate in a non-interactive manner through broadcasting. As a result, the protocol proposed in this article demonstrates lower computational and communication costs in comparison to other cryptographic schemes. Hence, this proposal presents a more appealing approach to lightweight group key agreement protocol with user authentication for application in the IoD.}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) achieves internal networks penetration through multiple methods, making it difficult to detect attack clues solely through boundary defense measures. To address this challenge, some research has proposed threat detection methods based on provenance graphs, which leverage entity relationships such as processes, files, and sockets found in host audit logs. However, these methods are generally inefficient, especially when faced with massive audit logs and the computational resource-intensive nature of graph algorithms. Effectively and economically extracting APT attack clues from massive system audit logs remains a significant challenge. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces the ProcSAGE method, which detects threats based on abnormal behavior patterns, offering high accuracy, low cost, and independence from expert knowledge. ProcSAGE focuses on processes or threads in host audit logs during the graph construction phase to effectively control the scale of provenance graphs and reduce performance overhead. Additionally, in the feature extraction phase, ProcSAGE considers information about the processes or threads themselves and their neighboring nodes to accurately characterize them and enhance model accuracy. In order to verify the effectiveness of the ProcSAGE method, this study conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the StreamSpot dataset. The experimental results show that the ProcSAGE method can significantly reduce the time and memory consumption in the threat detection process while improving the accuracy, and the optimization effect becomes more significant as the data size expands.}

	abstract = {Text-to-image (TTI) models provide huge innovation ability for many industries, while the content security triggered by them has also attracted wide attention. Considerable research has focused on content security threats of large language models (LLMs), yet comprehensive studies on the content security of TTI models are notably scarce. This paper introduces a systematic tool, named EvilPromptFuzzer, designed to fuzz evil prompts in TTI models. For 15 kinds of fine-grained risks, EvilPromptFuzzer employs the strong knowledge-mining ability of LLMs to construct seed banks, in which the seeds cover various types of characters, interrelations, actions, objects, expressions, body parts, locations, surroundings, etc. Subsequently, these seeds are fed into the LLMs to build scene-diverse prompts, which can weaken the semantic sensitivity related to the fine-grained risks. Hence, the prompts can bypass the content audit mechanism of the TTI model, and ultimately help to generate images with inappropriate content. For the risks of violence, horrible, disgusting, animal cruelty, religious bias, political symbol, and extremism, the efficiency of EvilPromptFuzzer for generating inappropriate images based on DALL.E 3 are greater than 30%, namely, more than 30 generated images are malicious among 100 prompts. Specifically, the efficiency of horrible, disgusting, political symbols, and extremism up to 58%, 64%, 71%, and 50%, respectively. Additionally, we analyzed the vulnerability of existing popular content audit platforms, including Amazon, Google, Azure, and Baidu. Even the most effective Google SafeSearch cloud platform identifies only 33.85% of malicious images across three distinct categories.}

	abstract = {The group fuzzy extractor allows group users to extract and reproduce group cryptographic keys from their individual non-uniform random sources. It can be easily used in group-oriented cryptographic applications. However, current group fuzzy extractors are not dynamic, i.e. they spend a large cost when dealing with user revocation. In this work, we propose the formal definition and construction of dynamic group fuzzy extractor (DGFE) to address this issue. For the revocation, DGFE allows unrevoked group users to reproduce updated group keys from the existing group help data. Meanwhile, it prevents any revoked group user from generating new group keys using the previously authorized individual help data. We propose a DGFE construction based on the revocable group signature. Furthermore, we give formal proofs of reusability, anonymity and traceability of our construction.}

	abstract = {Partial key exposure attacks present a significant threat to RSA-type cryptosystems. These attacks factorize the RSA modulus by utilizing partial knowledge of the decryption exponent, which is typically revealed by side-channel attacks, cold boot attacks, etc. In practice, the RSA implementations typically employ countermeasures to resist physical attacks, such as additive exponent blinding \\(d' = d + r \\varphi (N)\\) with unknown random blinding factor r. Although there are a couple of partial key exposure attacks on blinding RSA, these attacks require a considerable amount of leakage and fail to work when e is up to full size. In this paper, we propose new partial key exposure attacks on RSA with additive exponent blinding, focusing on leakage scenarios where the Most Significant Bits (MSBs) or Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of \\(d'\\) are revealed. For the case where e is small, we first recover partial information of p by solving the quadratic congruence equation, and then find the small roots of the integer equation to recover entire private key. Our method relaxes the attack requirements, for instance, we reduce the amount of MSBs for a successful attack from 75 to 25% when \\(e \\approx N^{0.25}\\) and \\(r\\approx N^{0}\\). Furthermore, we propose new attacks using the unique algebraic relationship in blinding RSA, which extend the attack to the case where e is of full size.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained popularity and is widely used in modern society. The growth in the sizes of IoT networks with more internet-connected devices has led to concerns regarding privacy and security. In particular, related to the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), which lacks robust security functions, many IoT devices in RPL networks are resource-constrained, with limited computing power, bandwidth, memory, and battery life. This causes them to face various vulnerabilities and potential attacks, such as DIO neighbor suppression attacks. This type of attack specifically targets neighboring nodes through DIO messages and poses a significant security threat to RPL-based IoT networks. Recent studies have proposed methods for detecting and mitigating this attack; however, they produce high false-positive and false-negative rates in detection tasks and cannot fully protect RPL networks against this attack type. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy logic-based intrusion detection scheme to secure the RPL protocol (FLSec-RPL) to protect against this attack. Our method is built of three key phases consecutively: (1) it tracks attack activity variables to determine potential malicious behaviors; (2) it performs fuzzy logic-based intrusion detection to identify malicious neighbor nodes; and (3) it provides a detection validation and blocking mechanism to ensure that both malicious and suspected malicious nodes are accurately detected and blocked. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse scenarios, including Static-RPL and Mobile-RPL networks. We compare the performance of our proposed method with that of the state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of the detection accuracy, F1 score, power consumption, end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio metrics.}

In this paper, the problem of user notification in case of data breaches and policy changes is addressed, besides an ontology-based approach to model them is proposed. To specify the ontology concepts and properties, the requirements and recommendations for the legislative regulations as well as existing privacy policies are evaluated. A set of SPARQL queries to validate the correctness and completeness of the proposed ontology are developed. The proposed approach is applied to evaluate the privacy policies designed by cloud computing providers and IoT device manufacturers. The results of the analysis show that the transparency of user notification scenarios presented in the privacy policies is still very low, and the companies should reconsider the notification mechanisms and provide more detailed information in privacy policies.}

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being applied to improve the efficiency of software systems used in various domains, especially in the health and forensic sciences. Explainable AI (XAI) is one of the fields of AI that interprets and explains the methods used in AI. One of the techniques used in XAI to provide such interpretations is by computing the relevance of the input features to the output of an AI model. File fragment classification is one of the vital issues of file carving in Cyber Forensics (CF) and becomes challenging when the filesystem metadata is missing. Other major challenges it faces are: proliferation of file formats, file embeddings, automation, We leverage and utilize interpretations provided by XAI to optimize the classification of file fragments and propose a novel sifting approach, named SIFT (Sifting File Types). SIFT employs TF-IDF to assign weight to a byte (feature), which is used to select features from a file fragment. Threshold-based LIME and SHAP (the two XAI techniques) feature relevance values are computed for the selected features to optimize file fragment classification. To improve multinomial classification, a Multilayer Perceptron model is developed and optimized with five hidden layers, each layer with \\(i \\times n\\) neurons, where i = the layer number and n = the total number of classes in the dataset. When tested with 47,482 samples of 20 file types (classes), SIFT achieves a detection rate of 82.1% and outperforms the other state-of-the-art techniques by at least 10%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort of applying XAI in CF for optimizing file fragment classification.}

	abstract = {In certain cloud Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) applications, the data ownership may need to be transferred. In practice, not only the data but also the auditing ability should be transferred securely and efficiently. However, we investigate and find that most of the existing data ownership transfer protocols only work well between two individuals, and they become inefficient when dealing between two communities. The proposals for transferring tags between communities are problematic as well since, they require all members get involved or a fully trusted aggregator facilitates ownership transfer, which are unrealistic in certain scenarios. To alleviate these problems, in this paper we develop a secure auditing protocol with decentralized (t,\xa0n)-threshold ownership transfer for cloud EMRs. This protocol is designed to operate efficiently without requiring the mandatory participation of every user or the involvement of any trusted third-party. It is achieved by employing the threshold signature. Rigorous security analyses and comprehensive performance evaluations illustrate the security and practicality of our protocol. Specifically, according to the evaluations and comparisons, the communication and computational consumption is independent of the file size, i.e., it is constant in our protocol for both communities.}

	abstract = {The differential privacy (DP) literature often centers on meeting privacy constraints by introducing noise to the query, typically using a pre-specified parametric distribution model with one or two degrees of freedom. However, this emphasis tends to neglect the crucial considerations of response accuracy and utility, especially in the context of categorical or discrete numerical database queries, where the parameters defining the noise distribution are finite and could be chosen optimally. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework for designing an optimal noise probability mass function (PMF) tailored to discrete and finite query sets. Our approach considers the modulo summation of random noise as the DP mechanism, aiming to present a tractable solution that not only satisfies privacy constraints but also minimizes query distortion. Unlike existing approaches focused solely on meeting privacy constraints, our framework seeks to optimize the noise distribution under an arbitrary \\((\\epsilon , \\delta )\\) constraint, thereby enhancing the accuracy and utility of the response. We demonstrate that the optimal PMF can be obtained through solving a mixed-integer linear program. Additionally, closed-form solutions for the optimal PMF are provided, minimizing the probability of error for two specific cases. Numerical experiments highlight the superior performance of our proposed optimal mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art methods. This paper contributes to the DP literature by presenting a clear and systematic approach to designing noise mechanisms that not only satisfy privacy requirements but also optimize query distortion. The framework introduced here opens avenues for improved privacy-preserving database queries, offering significant enhancements in response accuracy and utility.}

This can damage the user privacy provided by anonymity systems such as Tor. Tor has implemented the WF defense called Circuit Padding Framework, which provides an interface for developers to implement their own defenses. However, these defenses in the framework were overcome by the Deep Fingerprinting (DF) attack. In this paper, we propose a novel defense approach called break burst padding (Break-Pad), which injects a random number of padding packets into an incoming burst once the number of consecutive incoming packets exceeds a set number. We integrated Break-Pad into the existing Circuit Padding Framework. In addition, we have implemented two padding machines named August and October in the new framework and conducted experiments to evaluate these machines. In the open-world setting, our results show that August, with 29% bandwidth overhead, reduces Tik-Tok’s TPR by 14.48% and DF’s TPR by 22%. October outperforms the best padding machine, RBB. With 36% bandwidth overhead, it drops Tik-Tok’s TPR to 74.24% and DF’s TPR to 65.36%. In the one-page setting, October further reduces the bandwidth overhead by 11% while achieving similar performance to RBB. In the information leak analysis, for the burst sequence feature of the traffic, October leaks at 2.453 bits, while the best comparable padding machine Interspace leaks at 2.629 bits.}

	abstract = {SM9 was established in 2016 as a Chinese official identity-based cryptographic (IBC) standard, and became an ISO standard in 2021. It is well-known that IBC is suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, since a centralized processing of client data (e.g. IoT cloud) is often done by gateways. However, due to limited computation resources inside IoT devices, the performance of SM9 becomes a bottleneck in practical usage. The existing SM9 implementations are often CPU-based, with relatively low latency and low throughput. Consequently, a pivotal challenge for SM9 in large-scale applications is how to reduce the latency while maximizing throughput for numerous concurrent inputs. After a systematic analysis of the SM9 algorithms, we apply optimization techniques including precomputation, resource caching and parallelization to reduce the overhead of SM9. In this work, we introduce the first practical implementation of SM9 and its underlying SM9_P256 curve on GPU. Our GPU implementation combines multiple algorithms and low-level optimizations tailored for GPU’s single instruction, multiple threads architecture in order to achieve high throughput for SM9. Based on these, we propose GAPS, a high-performance Cryptography as a Service (CaaS) for SM9. GAPS adopts a heterogeneous computing architecture that flexibly schedules the inputs across two implementation platforms: a CPU for the low-latency processing of sporadic inputs, and a GPU for the high-throughput processing of batch inputs. According to our benchmark, GAPS only takes a few milliseconds to process a single SM9 request in idle mode. Moreover, when operating in its batch processing mode, GAPS can generate 2,038,071 private keys, 248,239 signatures or 238,001 ciphertexts per second. The results show that GAPS scales seamlessly across inputs of different sizes, preliminarily demonstrating the efficacy of our solution.}

	abstract = {An application programming interface (API) usage specification, which includes the conditions, calling sequences, and semantic relationships of the API, is important for verifying its correct usage, which is in turn critical for ensuring the security and availability of the target program. However, existing techniques either mine the co-occurring relationships of multiple APIs without considering their semantic relationships, or they use data flow and control flow information to extract semantic beliefs on API pairs but difficult to incorporate when mining specifications for multiple APIs. Hence, we propose an API specification mining approach that efficiently extracts a relatively complete list of the API combinations and semantic relationships between APIs. This approach analyzes a target program in two stages. The first stage uses frequent API set mining based on frequent common API identification and filtration to extract the maximal set of frequent context-sensitive API sequences. In the second stage, the API relationship graph is constructed using three semantic relationships extracted from the symbolic path information, and the specifications containing semantic relationships for multiple APIs are mined. The experimental results on six popular open-source code bases of different scales show that the proposed two-stage approach not only yields better results than existing typical approaches, but also can effectively discover the specifications along with the semantic relationships for multiple APIs. Instance analysis shows that the analysis of security-related API call violations can assist in the cause analysis and patch of software vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Honey vaults are useful tools for password management. A vault usually contains usernames for each domain, and the corresponding passwords, encrypted with a master password chosen by the owner. By generating decoy vaults for incorrect master password attempts, honey vaults force attackers with the vault’s storage file to engage in online verification to distinguish the real vaults, thus thwarting offline guessing attacks. However, sophisticated attackers can acquire additional information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and partial passwords contained within the vault from various data breaches. Since many users tend to incorporate PII in their passwords, attackers may utilize PII to distinguish the real vault. Furthermore, if attackers may learn partial passwords included in the real vault, it can exclude numerous decoy vaults without the need for online verification. Indeed, both leakages pose serious threats to the security of the existing honey vault schemes. In this paper, we explore two attack variants of the inspired attack scenario, where the attacker gains access to the vault’s storage file along with acquiring PII and partial passwords contained within the real vault, and design a new honey vault scheme. For security assurance, we prove that our scheme is secure against one of the aforementioned attack variants. Moreover, our experimental findings suggest enhancements in security against the other attack. In particular, to evaluate the security in multiple leakage cases where both the vault’s storage file and PII are leaked, we propose several new practical attacks (called PII-based attacks), building upon the existing practical attacks in the traditional single leakage case where only the vault’s storage file is compromised. Our experimental results demonstrate that certain PII-based attacks achieve a 63–70% accuracy in distinguishing the real vault from decoys in the best-performing honey vault scheme (Cheng et al. in Incrementally updateable honey password vaults, pp 857–874, 2021). Our scheme reduces these metrics to 41–50%, closely approaching the ideal value of 50%.}

	abstract = {Smart contracts have significant losses due to various types of vulnerabilities. However, traditional vulnerability detection methods rely extensively on expert rules, resulting in low detection accuracy and poor adaptability to novel attacks. To address these problems, in this paper, deep learning methods are combined with smart contract vulnerability code detection approaches. Abstract syntax trees (ASTs), which are special isomorphic graph structures, are an important bridge between source code and graph neural networks. By learning the AST, the model can understand the semantics of the source code. Moreover, graph neural networks have an increasing ability to address complex heterogeneous graphs. Therefore, control flow graphs are fused with data flow graphs on the basis of the ASTs to build heterogeneous graphs with richer code semantics. Furthermore, multigranularity analysis of the vulnerability detection results is performed, including coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection and fine-grained line-level vulnerability detection. Through this multigranularity detection approach, vulnerabilities in contracts can be identified and analysed more comprehensively, providing a richer perspective and more solutions for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed multigranularity vulnerability detection method based on heterogeneous graphs (MVD-HG) improves both the accuracy and range of the detected vulnerability types in contract-level vulnerability detection tasks; moreover, in the line-level vulnerability detection task, the MVD-HG model achieves significant results and addresses the shortcomings of existing methods. In addition, based on code generation methods used in related fields, a data enhancement method based on the source code is developed, which effectively expands the experimental dataset to address the reduced credibility of the results due to insufficient amounts of data.}

	abstract = {The forward triage characteristic of telemedicine highlights its importance again in the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine can provide timely emergency response in the case of environmental or biological hazards, and the patient’s medical privacy data generated in this process can also accelerate the establishment of models for preventing and treating infectious diseases. However, the reuse process of telemedicine user privacy data based on federated learning also faces significant challenges. Differences in regions, economic levels, and grades lead to heterogeneous data and resource-constrained environments, seriously damaging the federated learning process. Besides, the weak password authentication of medical terminals and eavesdropping attacks on transmission channels may cause illegal access to terminals and platforms and leakage of sensitive data. This paper proposed a telemedicine data secure-sharing scheme based on heterogeneous federated learning. Specifically, we proposed a heterogeneous federated learning scheme with model alignment to guide telemedicine practice through the reuse of telemedicine data; in addition, we designed an SM9 threshold identity authentication scheme to guarantee that the patient’s medical privacy data is protected from leakage during the federated learning process. We evaluated our scheme using two third-party medical datasets. The evaluation results indicate that this scheme can still assist the federated learning process in resisting data heterogeneity and resource constraints with almost no performance cost.}

In order to accurately perceive the security situation of distribution automation and ensure the safe and stable operation of distribution network, the multi-source information fusion distribution automation security situation awareness technology based on risk transmission path is studied. Based on the risk transmission path, the distribution automation security situational awareness factors are analyzed, and the main factors affecting the distribution automation security situation are divided into two dimensions: internal source and external source, and eight main awareness factors; Different types of sensors are set in the main areas of security situational awareness factors to collect data of different awareness factors. Using ant colony algorithm to optimize DS evidence fusion method, data with different perception factors are fused, and data fusion results with different perception factors are obtained. The distribution automation security situational awareness model is constructed, and the security situational awareness results are obtained based on the data fusion results of the awareness factors. If the results are higher than the set threshold, the abnormal signal can be output to determine the area where the distribution automation abnormal equipment is located. The experimental results show that the multi-source data fusion effect of this method is good, and it can accurately perceive the security status of different nodes of the experimental object at different time nodes.}

	abstract = {Financial institutions and businesses face an ongoing challenge from fraudulent transactions, prompting the need for effective detection methods. Detecting credit card fraud is crucial for identifying and preventing unauthorized transactions. While credit card fraud incidents are relatively rare, they can result in substantial financial losses, particularly due to the high monetary value associated with fraudulent transactions. Timely detection of fraud enables investigators to take swift actions to mitigate further losses. However, the investigation process is often time-consuming, limiting the number of alerts that can be thoroughly examined each day. Therefore, the primary objective of a fraud detection model is to provide accurate alerts while minimizing false alarms and missed fraud cases. In this paper, we introduce a state-of-the-art hybrid ensemble (ENS) dependable machine learning (ML) model that intelligently combines multiple algorithms with proper weighted optimization using grid search, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), to enhance fraud identification. To address the data imbalance issue, we employ the instant hardness threshold (IHT) technique in conjunction with logistic regression (LR), surpassing conventional approaches. Our experiments are conducted on a publicly available credit card dataset comprising 284,807 transactions. The proposed model achieves impressive accuracy rates of 99.66%, 99.73%, 98.56%, and 99.79%, and a perfect 100% for the DT, RF, KNN, MLP and ENS models, respectively. The hybrid ensemble model outperforms existing works, establishing a new benchmark for detecting fraudulent transactions in high-frequency scenarios. The results highlight the effectiveness and reliability of our approach, demonstrating superior performance metrics and showcasing its exceptional potential for real-world fraud detection applications.}

	abstract = {The integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) in storage centers aims to enhance storage performance. However, this integration also introduces new concerns, particularly the potential eavesdropping attacks that pose a substantial risk to data privacy. By issuing flow tables (e.g., via compromised SDN switches), attackers can conveniently collect target traffic and extract confidential information with session reassembly methods. To proactively mitigate such attacks by preventing session reassembly, various moving target defense methods, such as end hopping, have been proposed. However, this study uncovers several deficiencies within existing end hopping methods. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel linkage-field-based self-synchronizing end hopping method, which obfuscates end information (e.g., IP, Port) and linkage fields (e.g., sequence number and ID number) without third-party assistance. Furthermore, to counter the potential invalidation of end hopping methods resulting from brute-force reassembly of a small number of sessions, we propose a fake segment injection method. Extensive experiments have been conducted both in simulation and real-world environment to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed methods can effectively defend against eavesdropping attacks with acceptable performance overhead.}

	abstract = {Cryptography plays consistently an essential role in securing any sort of communications or data broadcast over the network. Since the security of any designed block cipher algorithm is related to its Substitution box (S-box), several efforts have been made by researchers to design a vigorous S-box that maintains flawlessly the cost, performance, and security trade-off. From the literature, we can find a variety of input–output sizes of S-boxes, each of which has its benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, this work introduces a new S-box pattern generation based on the chaotic enhanced logistic map where its chaotic behavior offers good randomness ability, a fact that enhances its unpredictability. In our realization, the intention was the generation of a 5-bit Sbox due to its suitability and cost-effectiveness to be integrated into lightweight cryptosystems. Moreover, the S-box security strength is proved by testing it through numerous cryptanalysis measurements. We can mention non-linearity, bijectivity, linearity, differential cryptanalysis, boomerang attacks resilience, Avalanche effect, and algebraic attacks resilience. The results show that our proposition provides good resistance to the aforementioned attacks and even shows superiority over its 5-bit competitors in terms of non-linearity, differential, Boomerang, and algebraic attack resistance.}

	abstract = {Abnormal traffic detection is a crucial topic in the field of network security. However, existing methods face many challenges when processing complex high-dimensional traffic data. Especially in dealing with redundant features, data sparsity and nonlinear features, traditional methods often suffer from high computational complexity and low detection efficiency. It is challenging to capture potential patterns in complex data effectively and cannot fully meet the needs of practical applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an enhanced anomaly traffic detection framework using bidirectional generative adversarial networks (BiGAN) and contrastive learning. This method preprocesses high-dimensional data through steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and clustering to improve data quality. It uses BiGAN and contrastive learning technology to enhance the model's feature representation capabilities. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper performs well on multiple traffic data sets and significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection. Overall, the solution proposed in this paper effectively overcomes the limitations of existing methods in high-dimensional data processing and provides a more advanced abnormal traffic detection strategy.}

Adopting electronic voting can effectively increase voter participation and significantly reduce the financial burden on the organizers. In recent years, with the prevalence of blockchain technology, numerous blockchain-based electronic voting schemes have emerged. Compared with traditional electronic voting schemes, they have more favorable security features. However, existing schemes generally suffer from inefficient voting procedures, limited functionality, and dependence on specific blockchain platforms, making them challenging to deploy in diverse voting scenarios. This paper proposes an efficient and versatile electronic voting scheme on blockchain that addresses these problems using our proposed smart contract-based aggregated blind signature, zero-knowledge proofs, and threshold encryption scheme. In the paper, the scheme’s various features, including security, are analyzed in detail, and the scheme is deployed and tested on the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum blockchain platform. The experiment results demonstrate that the voting scheme satisfies the security requirement, and it has outstanding advantages in performance.}

However, it also poses a threat to the security of classical cryptographic schemes based on integer factorization and discrete logarithms. In response to this challenge, quantum cryptographic schemes based on quantum computation and quantum communication environments have become a focal point of research. The quantum public-key cryptosystem based on the QSCDff problem stands as one of the influential schemes in the realm of quantum public-key cryptography, yet its feasibility remains unexplored in current literature. Our specific focus lies in the quantum circuit implementations and fault-tolerant construction, which serve as essential prerequisites for the physical feasibility of quantum cryptographic schemes. We provide quantum circuit implementations along with rigorous theoretical proofs for the computation of the permutation product operation and the permutation sign operation in quantum public-key cryptographic schemes. Based on the fault-tolerant quantum computation process of the aforementioned quantum circuit implementations, we propose two error-correction strategies and provide a theoretical feasibility analysis within a specified range in the ion-trap quantum computation environment, adhering to the theoretical limits of quantum computation. Rigorous proofs are presented to demonstrate the correctness and reliability of the proposed methods. Our contribution provides a theoretical foundation for the physical feasibility analysis of quantum cryptographic algorithms, offering insights into the challenges and prospects of implementing these algorithms in quantum computation environments.}

	abstract = {Malware classification has been successful in utilizing machine learning methods. However, it is limited by the reliance on a large number of high-quality labeled datasets and the issue of overfitting. These limitations hinder the accurate classification of advanced malware with only a few samples available. Meta-learning methods offer a solution by allowing models to quickly adapt to new tasks, even with a small number of samples. However, the effectiveness of meta-learning approaches in malware classification varies due to the diverse nature of malware types. Most meta-learning-based methodologies for malware classification either focus solely on data augmentation or utilize existing neural networks and learning rate schedules to adapt to the meta-learning model. These approaches do not consider the integration of both processes or tailor the neural network and learning rate schedules to the specific task. As a result, the classification performance and generalization capabilities are suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a multi-improved model-agnostic meta-learning (MI-MAML) model that aims to address the challenges encountered in few-shot malware classification. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation techniques to improve the classification performance of few-shot malware. These techniques involve utilizing grayscale images and the Lab color space. Additionally, we customize neural network architectures and learning rate schemes based on the representative few-shot classification method, MAML, to further enhance the model’s classification performance and generalization ability for the task of few-shot malware classification. The results obtained from multiple few-shot malware datasets demonstrate that MI-MAML outperforms other models in terms of categorical accuracy, precision, and f1-score. Furthermore, we have conducted ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of each stage of our work.}

	abstract = {Network traffic anomaly detection is a critical issue in network security. Existing Abnormal traffic detection methods rely on statistical-based or anomaly-based approaches, and these detection methods all require a full understanding of traffic characteristics and attack patterns. Information entropy has been widely studied in abnormal traffic detection because it can describe the distribution characteristics of network traffic. However, this method makes it difficult to cope with the timing and variability of network traffic. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a network traffic anomaly detection method based on Renyi entropy. Simultaneously, we introduce a fixed time window and utilize an improved EWMA model within this window to dynamically set thresholds for anomaly detection. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is superior to popular abnormal traffic detection methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, it is better adapted to the dynamic changes of network traffic and provides a more reliable solution for anomaly detection.}

	abstract = {PRESENT is a lightweight block cipher, which has attracted many scholars to research its security. In 2022, Zahednejad et al. proposed the integral neural distinguisher on round-reduced PRESENT. In this paper, a new integral neural distinguisher for PRESENT is constructed. In contrast to Zahednejad’s works, the proposed integral neural distinguisher can improve the number of attack rounds in one round. This paper proposes a new data format (\\(invP_{0}^{n},invP_{1}^{n},\\ldots ,invP_{15}^{n},invS_{0}^{n},invS_{1}^{n},\\ldots ,invS_{15}^{n}\\)), which can exposes more features of PRESENT previous round ciphertext. Simultaneously, this paper incorporates MBConv module into the convolutional layers of DenseNet, which enable the neural network to identify a greater variety of features in ciphertext. The data format of the paper is analysed. The results of the analysis show that the data format in this paper is able to identify more features compared to Zahednejad’s data format. Further to this, experiments are performed on PRESENT using the integral neural distinguisher in this paper. The experimental results show that the changes make to the neural network and data format have improved the accuracy of distinguishers. Finally, key recovery attacks are conducted on the integral neural distinguishers of SmallPresent-(8) to demonstrate the efficacy of the distinguisher proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that the key recovery success rates for 5-round and 6-round are 98% and 90%, considering error bits within a range of two bits.}

	abstract = {The semi-classical One-Way to Hiding (SC-O2H) lemma given by Ambainis et al. (CRYPTO 2019) is a crucial technique to solve the reprogramming problem in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), which can lead to quadratically better bounds for many cases involving guessing games. To achieve tighter bounds, Bindel et al. (TCC, 2019) introduced the double-sided One-Way to Hiding (DS-O2H) lemma, which avoids the loss of query times suffered by the SC-O2H lemma. However, the potential of the DS-O2H lemma to provide better bounds for guessing games has not been considered by far. In this paper, a new double-sided O2H lemma is proposed. By using it, we for the first time give fully tight bounds for several cases involving guessing games. In summary, we show the following results in the QROM: (i) The hardness of inverting a random oracle with the leakage of a one-way injective function can be tightly reduced to the hardness of inverting the involved one-way injective function. (ii) Duman et al. (PKC 2023) introduced the randomness recoverability and defined two transformations \\(\\textsf {ACWC}_0\\) and \\(\\textsf {ACWC}\\) relative to random oracles. For \\(\\textsf {ACWC}_0\\), we prove that its OW-CPA security can be tightly reduced to the OW-CPA security of the underlying public key encryption (PKE) scheme with the randomness recoverability. For \\(\\textsf {ACWC}\\), we design a variant \\(\\textsf {ACWC}_1\\), and prove that its OW-CPA security can be tightly reduced to the OW-CPA security of the underlying PKE scheme with the unique randomness recoverability (a property slightly stronger than randomness recoverability). (iii) The OW-CPA security of the modular Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transformation T introduced by Hofheinz et al. (TCC 2017), can be tightly reduced to the OW-CPA security of the underlying PKE scheme with the unique randomness recoverability. Additionally, assuming the underlying PKE scheme is unique randomness recoverable, we prove the IND-CCA security of FO-like transformations \n\n(TCC, 2017) in the QROM, and as far as we know, our proof is tighter than the currently best proof.}

However, a designated confirmer signature is insufficient when the secret keys are damaged and incapable of collaborative signature generation. In this paper, we circumvent these limitations by introducing the notion of designated confirmer threshold signature. First, we present a formal security model, then give a generic construction, which utilizes threshold signature schemes, encryption schemes and \\(\\Sigma\\)-protocols. Instantiating this generic construction, we have two specific schemes, based on threshold Schnorr and threshold ECDSA, respectively. We further design two efficient \\(\\Sigma\\)-protocols for efficient proofs. We also implement these schemes, and the experiment results show that our schemes are practical with rich functionalities. Finally, we demonstrate interesting applications for blockchains, such as verifiable asset auctions in blockchain and traditional electronic bidding.}

	abstract = {The emergence of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in the era of the Internet of Things represents a remarkable advancement, but also brings its own set of challenges. Low-cost RFID tags, key elements of this ecosystem, face major security and privacy issues due to their limited computational and memory capacities. To overcome these issues, we focused on the design of an ultralightweight RFID authentication protocol named UDAP, which incorporates simplified cryptographic techniques such as dot product, XOR, and left rotation. This approach aims to enhance the levels of security and confidentiality while concurrently minimizing the impact on the tag’s limited resources. Both informal and formal analysis of our protocol, including the use of the Scyther simulation tool, has demonstrated its effectiveness in countering the most known security attacks. To measure the efficiency of our proposed protocol, an Field-Programmable Gate Array\xa0(FPGA) implementation was carried out, allowing for precise evaluation of the resource consumption of the key function used in our protocol. This implementation has shown that our protocol is not only secure but also utilizes minimal resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for resource constrained RFID tags.}

	abstract = {Internal network attacks pose a serious security threat to enterprises and organizations, potentially leading to critical information leaks and network system damage. Hosts, as the core data and service bearers, are often primary targets of cyber attacks. Therefore, accurately identifying hosts with malicious behavior in the network is crucial. However, detecting malicious hosts on this intranet presents several challenges. Firstly, the network state is unstructured data that dynamically changes in real-time. Secondly, the large amount of normal traffic in the network drowns out the traces generated by malicious behaviors, leading to the problem of category imbalance. Lastly, the traditional graph neural network model has limitations in processing edge information and is unable to directly learn the information in netflow. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a malicious host detection system. The system extracts the Host Communication Graph by time slicing and uses a random undersampling method to balance samples. For malicious host detection, this paper proposes the Relational-Edge Graph Convolutional Network (RE-GCN) model, which can directly aggregate and learn features on edges and use them to accurately classify nodes, compared to other GNN models. Comparative experiments were conducted on various netflow datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach outperformed other common GNN models in detecting malicious hosts.}

	abstract = {With the development of deep learning technology, great progress has been made in the field of coverless steganography based on deep learning technology, including some selection-based steganography methods that use deep learning technology and all generation-based steganography methods, however both of which have their limitations. The former is difficult to meet actual communication requirements in terms of communication capacity and completeness due to the limit of the algorithm. Due to the irreversibility of the process of generating secret images from message codeword, the recovery accuracy of the latter is very poor. To this end, this paper designs a robust joint coverless image steganography scheme called Joint Coverless Image Steganography (JoCS). Firstly, this paper proposes the Semantic Factorization Fitting module (SeFF) and the Transform Domain Steganography module (TrDS). The former adds the secret message to the input vector of the low resolution layer in the StyleGAN generator network, which establishs a mapping rule between message codeword and the coarse feature of the generated image, and then the extractor is used to fit the above mapping rule, which has excellent robustness and completeness; the latter encodes the main content area of the image based on the encoder in VQGAN, and then adds secret message to the latent vector of the encoded image, which achieves the steganography in the latent domain of the image. Secondly, we demonstrate the independence between two modules and the advantages of connecting two modules. By using the image generated in the SeFF module as the cover image in the TrDS module, secondary steganography of a single image is achieved, based on which we design the JoCS scheme. The results show that our scheme breaks through the communication capacity limit in the selection-based coverless methods while guaranteeing 100% completeness, excellent image quality and outstanding robustness against various image attacks. Moreover, our scheme exhibits strong security against detection by multiple steganalysis tools and excellent practicality in practical communication. Finally, this paper also discusses the following three points as further elaboration of the scheme: (1) the advantages of the mapping rule in the SeFF module (2) the verification of the independence between the two modules (3) the flexibility of the joint steganography scheme.}

	abstract = {Ransomware attacks are increasingly prevalent in recent years. Crypto-ransomware corrupts files on an infected device and demands a ransom to recover them. In computing devices using flash memory storage (e.g., SSD, MicroSD, etc.), existing designs recover the compromised data by extracting the entire raw flash memory image, restoring the entire external storage to a good prior state. This is feasible through taking advantage of the out-of-place updates feature implemented in the flash translation layer (FTL). However, due to the lack of “file” semantics in the FTL, such a solution does not allow a fine-grained data recovery in terms of files. Considering the file-centric nature of ransomware attacks, recovering the entire disk is mostly unnecessary. In particular, the user may just wish a speedy recovery of certain critical files after a ransomware attack. In this work, we have designed \\(\\textsf{FFRecovery}\\), a new ransomware defense strategy that can support fine-grained per file data recovery after the ransomware attack. Our key idea is that, to restore a file corrupted by the ransomware, we (1) restore its file system metadata via file system forensics, and (2) extract its file data via raw data extraction from the FTL, and (3) assemble the corresponding file system metadata and the file data. Another essential aspect of \\(\\textsf{FFRecovery}\\) is that we add a garbage collection delay and freeze mechanism into the FTL so that no raw data will be lost prior to the recovery and, additionally, the raw data needed for the recovery can be always located. A prototype of \\(\\textsf{FFRecovery}\\) has been developed and our experiments using real-world ransomware samples demonstrate the effectiveness of \\(\\textsf{FFRecovery}\\). We also demonstrate that \\(\\textsf{FFRecovery}\\) has negligible storage cost and performance impact.}

	abstract = {Federated learning is a promising new distributed machine learning paradigm, where the client realizes secure and collaborative multi-user training of machine learning models by retaining private data and sharing model parameters with the server. However, with the frequent interaction of model parameters between the client and the server, the client will consume a large amount of network and arithmetic resources, and resource-constrained clients can hardly maintain model security while ensuring the efficiency of collaborative user training. Therefore, we propose FedRtid, a shuffle differential privacy federated learning scheme with random participation and adaptive time constraints, to improve the efficiency of collaborative user training while considering model privacy. First, in model training, the participating clients have the right to decide on random participation in training locally and independently, to alleviate the user’s resource constraints and reduce the time of user interaction to train the model, while adding differential noise to the shared model parameters to ensure model security. In addition, to avoid the global model security decline of server aggregation due to fewer clients participating in training, and the model accuracy decline caused by adding differential noise to all model parameters, we constructed user sparsification and adaptive time-constrained shuffle techniques to reduce the number of model parameters to which the user adds noise, and enhance the model security. Under two types of data distributions, independently and identically distributed and non-independently and identically distributed, we conduct a large number of experiments on three real datasets, and the results show that FedRtid can effectively balance the accuracy and privacy of the model.}

	abstract = {Efforts have been made to safeguard DNNs from intellectual property infringement. Among different techniques, model fingerprinting has gained popularity due to its ability to examine potential infringement without altering the model’s parameters. However, there is a concern regarding the vulnerability of previous model fingerprints to “ambiguity attacks,” where attackers may use fabricated fingerprints to bypass ownership verification, potentially leading to disputes. To address this issue, we propose a dual-verification-based fingerprint authentication system that incorporates the verification of fingerprint genuineness. Briefly, this system involves two authentication processes: conventional fingerprint methods for authenticating model copyrights and the incorporation of copyright information into the fingerprint feature map to confirm ownership of the model fingerprint. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in resisting ambiguity attacks and managing attempts to remove the fingerprint.}
