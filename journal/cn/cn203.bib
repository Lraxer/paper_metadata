	abstract = {In recent years, the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aims to enhance the users’ quality of experience through proposing more sophisticated services ranging from guaranteeing the user safety to improving his comfort. The IoV ecosystem is complex, heterogeneous, and evolving. Many entities participate to compose its architecture (such as vehicles, humans, roadside units, ITS). Moreover, different communication types co-exist to ensure the IoV connectivity and continuity. This diversity leads to new security requirements that seem more complex to take into account and enlarge the attack surface of such ecosystem. Many security mechanisms should be considered to enforce the security of IoV environment at many levels: data, entities, communications, storage, etc.. Trust management is one of the potential security mechanisms that aims to increase the reliability within the IoV environment. The topic has been widely explored within the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, the VANET represents only one component of the IoV ecosystem. Thus, the approaches proposed for the VANET should be adapted to be applied for the IoV. Moreover, the advent of the emerging technologies like blockchain, cloud, SDN as well as artificial intelligence bring new opportunities to propose more relevant approaches within the trust management mechanisms within the IoV context. Accordingly, this survey deals with the literature about the trust management topic in vehicular environments. The scope considers the IoV environment as well as the relevant approaches proposed for the VANET context since it is one of the important component of the IoV ecosystem. We start by quickly reviewing the existing surveys about security of the vehicular environments. Then, we give a general overview about trust concepts. Afterwards, we present the security and trust challenges and attacks in the vehicular context. Later, we classify and compare the most relevant approaches related to the trust management for the IoV proposing a new taxonomy. We complete this survey by highlighting the open future directions and perspectives for research.}

	abstract = {Migration and replication of virtual network functions (VNFs) are well-known mechanisms to face dynamic resource requests in Internet Service Provider (ISP) edge networks. They are not only used to reallocate resources in carrier networks, but in case of excessive traffic churns also to offload VNFs to third party cloud providers. We propose to study how traffic forecasting can help to reduce the number of required migrations and replications when the traffic dynamically changes in the network. We analyze and compare three scenarios for the VNF migrations and replications based on: (i) the current observed traffic demands only, (ii) specific maximum traffic demand value observed in the past, or (iii) predictive traffic values. For the prediction of traffic demand values, we use an LSTM model which is proven to be one of the most accurate methods in time series forecasting problems. Based on the traffic prediction model, we then use a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model as well as a greedy algorithm to solve this optimization problem that considers migrations and replications of VNFs. The results show that LSTM-based traffic prediction can reduce the number of migrations up to 45% when there is enough available resources to allocate replicas, while less cloud-based offloading is required compared to overprovisioning.}

	abstract = {Cloud-assisted electronic health (e-health) system has played an important role in the management of healthcare data, which can provide efficient and convenient storage services for the patients to store their electronic health records (EHRs). However, there are the security challenges in the existing e-health system, where the malicious doctors may collude with cloud storage service provider (CSP) to tamper with the patients’ EHRs, or directly reveal the content of EHRs to other adversaries for profit. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preserving e-health system to ensure the security and confidentiality of the patients’ EHRs. In the system, we introduce the pairing-based cryptography to generate the tamper-proof records of the EHRs and allow the patients to integrate them into the transactions deployed on the blockchain, which can make the patients’ EHRs verifiable and protect them from illegal modification. Moreover, we will design secure payment protocols by performing blockchain-based smart contracts, which can enable the patients and hospital to reliably pay for the diagnostic and storage service, respectively. Security analysis and the performance evaluation demonstrate that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient with a limited computation overhead.}

	abstract = {The spectrum sensing (SS) is employed to identify the status of licensed channel in the cognitive radio/user (CR/CU). Arbitrarily choosing the licensed channel for sensing in high traffic intensity network results into reduced throughput of cognitive user due to wait state problem in interweave mode. However, the wait state problem is overcome with hybrid spectrum access, resulting into improvement in throughput of CU. In addition, the sensing decisions without cooperation increases the sensing error and affect the sensing performance of CU resulting into reduction in throughput of CU. In this paper, we have proposed new approach that is Hybrid Spectrum Access with Spectrum Prediction and Cooperation (HSA-SPC) of cognitive users in which we have collectively employed spectrum prediction, cooperation and hybrid spectrum access to improve the sensing performance and throughput of CU. Further, for the proposed approach we have considered a new frame structure in multiuser environment and derived the closed form expression for the throughput. In addition to this, we have also shown the computation of energy efficiency for our proposed approach. Further, with the help of simulation results, we have shown the improvement in CU throughput with our proposed approach over reported literature. Comparison of various approaches with the proposed method HSA-SPC is also illustrated.}

	abstract = {Log anomaly detection on edge devices is the key to enhance edge security when deploying IoT systems. Despite the success of many newly proposed deep learning based log anomaly detection methods, handling large-scale logs on edge devices is still a bottleneck due to the limited computational power on these devices to fulfil the real-time processing requirement for accurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight log anomaly detection algorithm, named LightLog, to tackle this research gap. In specific, we achieve real-time processing speed on the task via two aspects: (i) creation of a low-dimensional semantic vector space based on word2vec and post-processing algorithms (PPA); and (ii) design of a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) for the detection. These two components significantly reduce the number of parameters and computations of a standard TCN while improving the detection performance. Experimental results show that our LightLog outperforms several benchmarking methods, namely DeepLog, LogAnomaly and RobustLog, by achieving 97.0 F1 score on HDFS Dataset and 97.2 F1 score on BGL with smallest model size. This effective yet efficient method paves the way to the deployment of log anomaly detection on the edge. Our source code and datasets are freely available on https://github.com/Aquariuaa/LightLog.}

	abstract = {The Terahertz (THz) band (0.1–10 THz) is a key asset to unlock the next generation of wireless communication systems. With larger available bandwidths, THz systems would allow for faster data rates to interconnect many more users than traditional communication systems in the microwave and millimeter wave frequency ranges. While the hardware for THz communications is quickly emerging, the wireless research community lacks access to THz signals. In addition to hardware solutions, much is left to explore on the signal processing side for THz communications. Thus, in this paper, an extensive data set consisting of 260 frames of information-carrying ultrabroadband signals transmitted and received at 120–140 GHz, 210–240 GHz, and 1–1.05 THz is presented. This data set will enable the wireless community to experimentally explore solutions relating to ultrabroadband time, frequency and phase synchronization, channel estimation and equalization, and modulation, to name a few.}

	abstract = {Information may flow across multiple social network platforms and spread simultaneously on them. These platforms constitute a multiplex network in which each social network platform functions as a subnetwork. One problem in information propagation analysis on the multiplex network is to reveal the corresponding relationship of accounts belonging to the same user across different subnetworks. It can be summarized as the interlayer link prediction problem in a multiplex network. To predict more unobserved interlayer links accurately, most of the current structure-based approaches adopt an iterative strategy. However, iterative manners suffer from a big challenge of high time consumption. In this paper, we propose an interlayer link prediction framework based on multiple structural attributes (MulAtt). It calculates the matching degree of unmatched nodes once by leveraging the information of closed triad, intralayer links, matched neighbors and intralayer links of neighbors simultaneously to guarantee accuracy while reducing time consumption. We also propose a fast possible matched closed triad counting algorithm to improve the efficiency of obtaining the clues from the closed triad. Experiments on four widely used real-world multiplex networks demonstrate that the MulAtt framework can achieve better performance than several existing network structure-based methods in a non-iterative way.}

Three-dimensional Network-on-Chips (3D NoCs) have been adopted as a promising architecture in the communication of many-core systems and present lower latency and area compared to 2D NoCs, and they introduce the higher performance. However, 3D NoCs possess thermal challenges due to the high power consumption of 3D routers. The approximation can be used in communication in NoCs to reduce the congestion and latency in the network in error-tolerant applications. In this paper, we employ an approximation mechanism to truncate data packets based on the approximate nature of their applications. So, we reduce network congestion, data volume on communication, and latency. This approach makes it possible to use energy-saving methods in an efficient way, as the network congestion and resource workload are decreased. To show the approach, after employing approximation in communication, we modify the architecture of the routers and links by applying the voltage scaling technique, which is controlled based on the network congestion and approximate regions of the applications. Therefore, the amount of energy saving due to employing the voltage scaling is significantly increased, which alleviates the thermal problems in 3D NoCs. Simulation results indicate that our approach reduces the energy consumption by 21.6% while reducing the latency by 22% compared to some related works for NoCs, with only about 1.3% hardware overhead.}

However, we should address several challenges to facilitate the end-users finding and consuming the relevant services from the edge at the Internet scale. First, the scale and diversity of the edge hinder seamless access. Second, a framework where researchers openly share their services and data in a secured manner among themselves and with external consumers over the Internet does not exist. Third, the lack of a unified interface and trust across the service providers hinder their interchangeability in composing workflows by chaining the services. Thus, creating a workflow from the services deployed on the various edge nodes is presently impractical.}

Constrained nodes in interactive scenarios need to be highly responsive but can only manage limited control state.

	abstract = {The application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to the well-known intrusion detection systems (IDS) is key to cope with increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks through an effective and efficient detection process. In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation. Additionally, we identify a set of challenges and future directions based on the existing literature and the analysis of our evaluation results.}

Enterprise users can analyze their consumers’ data and infer the business value, such as purchasing goods correlations and customer preferences. To unveil such hidden values from big data, various big data processing frameworks, such as Hadoop and Tensor-flow, are developed. One fundamental approach of accelerating such big data processing frameworks is to efficiently evaluate queries for big data analytics based on materialization of intermediate results. In this paper, we consider problems of dynamic and proactive QoS-aware query evaluation of big data analytics with intermediate result materialization in a mobile edge cloud. We propose a one-shot online algorithm for the dynamic QoS-aware big data query evaluation within a finite time horizon, which can intelligently determine whether some immediate results during query evaluation need to be materialized for later use of other queries, by making use of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method with predictions. We also devise an online learning algorithm based on the technique of multi-armed bandits, for the proactive QoS-aware big data query evaluation problem with resource reservations, where the query arrival information and their required datasets are uncertain before the actual evaluation of the queries. We finally investigate the performance of the proposed algorithms by experimental simulations, and results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is promising, by achieving 12% higher system throughput while reducing 50% and 40% average evaluation cost and time per query compared to the comparison benchmarks.}

	abstract = {IPv6 target generation is critical in fast IPv6 scanning for Internet-wide surveys and cybersecurity analysis. However, existing techniques generally suffer from low hit rates because the targets are generated from inappropriate address patterns. To address the problem, we propose 6Graph, a graph-theoretic method for IPv6 address pattern mining. It first divides the IPv6 address space into different regions according to the structural information of a set of known addresses. Then, 6Graph maps the addresses of each region into undirected graphs and conducts the density-based graph cutting for address clustering to mine IPv6 address patterns and detect the misclassified addresses iteratively. Besides, we exploit the random IPv6 target generation based on Hamming distance without additional and complicated target selection. Experiments on 11 large-scale candidate datasets show that the address patterns of 6Graph have a higher seed density than the existing methods. Further results over real-world networks indicate that 6Graph can achieve 12.6%–35.8% hit rates on the candidate datasets, which is an 8.8%–275.0% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in Internet-wide scanning.}

	abstract = {Along with the high demand for network connectivity from both end-users and service providers, networks have become highly complex; and so has become their lifecycle management. Recent advances in automation, data analysis, artificial intelligence, distributed ledger technologies (e.g., Blockchain), and data plane programming techniques have sparked the hope of the researchers’ community in exploring and leveraging these techniques towards realizing the much-needed vision of trustworthy self-driving networks (SelfDNs). In this vein, this article proposes a novel framework to empower fully distributed trustworthy SelfDNs across multiple domains. The framework vision is achieved by exploiting (i) the capabilities of programmable data planes to enable real-time in-network telemetry collection; (ii) the potential of P4 – as an important example of data plane programming languages – and AI to (re)write the source code of network components in a fashion that the network becomes capable of automatically translating a policy intent into executable actions that can be enforced on the network components; and (iii) the potential of blockchain and federated learning to enable decentralized, secure and trustable knowledge sharing between domains. A relevant use case is introduced and discussed to demonstrate the feasibility of the intended vision. Encouraging results are obtained and discussed.}

	abstract = {Computation offloading has been considered as a promising solution for resource-constrained mobile devices supporting computation-intensive mobile collaborative applications in beyond 5G networks. By leveraging network-assisted device-to-device (D2D) collaboration, resource-constrained mobile devices are able to offload computation tasks to nearby resource-sharing mobile devices. Meanwhile, blockchain technology is developing rapidly and has been applied to mobile scenarios with massive information interaction for establishing trust between mobile devices. However, the computing power of mobile devices is limited by the physical size and battery capacity, which is not enough to cope with the high computation overhead for blockchain mining process. Thus, offloading mining tasks to the edge servers becomes a viable option. This paper investigates both of the D2D task offloading problem and the mining task offloading problem in a blockchain-enabled beyond 5G network. For the purpose of efficient resource allocation, the former is formulated as a double auction market and the latter is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Moreover, we propose two pricing based schemes to solve these two computation offloading problems, among which Bayes-Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibrium are analyzed. At last, by comparison with the benchmark, the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed schemes are evaluated. Numerical results show that both of the double auction based normal task offloading scheme and the Stackelberg game based mining task offloading scheme are able to improve the utility of resource demanders and providers.}

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization is putting a strain on the transport systems of cities worldwide. The effects of this trend include prolonged traffic jams and increasing environmental pollution from rising\nC\nO\n2\nemissions. As city planning requires innovative ways of dealing with the rapid urbanization trend, technological solutions were proposed such as cloud computing, smart vehicles, and Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET). In this paper, we take advantage of next-generation network technologies to propose a responsive and lightweight framework for smart transportation system which employs blockchain for authentication using fog computing’s improvement over cloud computing for distributed applications to provide an efficient and secure transportation system. We take into account the future technologies of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) and argue that the integration of B5G technologies, federated learning, blockchain, and edge computing provides the perfect platform necessary for a smart transportation system The evaluation of the proposed framework is done by comparing it to the current cloud-based approach in iFogSim, a popular simulation tool for fog computing research. The evaluation of blockchain-based authentication was done using a customized implementation of blockchain executed in an experimental setup. The simulation results showed that the proposed framework provides superior performance in terms of security, latency, and energy consumption of the system.}

	abstract = {The exponential growth of IoT devices poses security concerns, in part because they provide a fertile breeding ground for botnets. For example, the Mirai botnet infected almost 65,000 devices in its first 20 h. With the prevalence of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones and devices on the networks today, the attacker could easily target and recruit these IoT devices as bots. Conventional network security measures do not provide adequate attack prevention, detection, and mitigation for these widely distributed IoT devices. This paper presents microVNF, a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) that leverages the programmable data plane feature on the edge switch. Based on knowledge gained from the Mirai botnet incident and following the defense-in-depth principle, microVNF protects IoT devices against SIP DDoS attacks in two stages: before and after infection. Prior to infection, it protects against SIP scanning, enumeration, and dictionary attacks. After infection, microVNF blocks botnet registration attempts to the command-and-control (CNC) server, thereby preventing the botnet from receiving commands sent from the CNC server, and detects and mitigates botnet SIP DDoS attacks. We conducted six experiments that involved using popular attack tools against microVNF, and it successfully performed deep-packet inspection of unencrypted SIP packets so as to track anomalies from a typical SIP state-machine. In this use case, besides providing physical connectivity to the IoT devices, the edge switch containing microVNF also provides the first line of defense in stopping malicious packets from propagating upstream to the core network. In addition to securing SIP, the microVNF approach can be adapted to other text-based, application-layer protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. MicroVNF leverages the native capability of programmable data planes without depending on external devices, thereby making this approach practical for securing edge-computing environments against application-layer attacks.}

	abstract = {The conventional IP address is designed with fixed length and lacking of extensibility, while the demand for addresses varies greatly in different scenarios. Flexible IP (FlexIP), as a variable length IP address, proactively makes address structure flexible enough to adapt to various network cases. Different lengths of the addresses could be used to accommodate different demands. However, how to efficiently addressing with length variable addresses is still a problem to be solved. The Bloom filter-based addressing scheme appears to be an excellent candidate with the possibility of compact storage and efficient member query. In this paper, we propose an adaptable IP Address Structure, which is expected to proactively adapt various network cases under flexible address structure and make Internet Protocol agilely cover futuristic and unknown scenarios. Moreover, we propose an OBF (One Bloom filter) based addressing scheme using only one Bloom filter for FlexIP. While keeping nearly the same false positive ratio as the conventional Bloom filter-based scheme, the OBF-based scheme significantly improves the addressing efficiency. OBF-based has two key features, one is that it achieves constant, yet small IP lookup time, and another is that it is insensitive to the length of the address. Simulation results show that the addressing scheme we proposed is more suitable for FlexIP addressing than well-known schemes.}

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a novel technology that enables flexible and cost-effective network services by replacing the hardware-based middleboxes with software instances named virtual network functions (VNFs). In NFV, each requested Service Function Chain (SFC) is an ordered sequence of VNFs that must be placed optimally on the geographically distributed data centers (DCs). For the popular Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) with flexible bandwidth management, a major challenge is optimal placement of the VNF-based Service Chain (VNF-SC) on data centers and steering traffic through deployed VNFs in the substrate network. In this paper, we study both the problems of VNF placement and Routing/Spectrum Allocation (RSA) for inter-DC EONs with the aim of minimizing the total network cost while considering the balanced resource utilization to reduce the blocking probability. We first formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to solve the problem exactly, and then propose a heuristic algorithm based on the resource-balancing and fragmentation-aware solution to reduce the blocking probability. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms an existing algorithm.}
