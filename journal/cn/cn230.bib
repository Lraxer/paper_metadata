	abstract = {This paper addresses two main aspects related to the application of the IEEE 802.11ad technology in an industrial environment, i.e., to guarantee a low latency and reliable data delivery while reducing the number of the deployed Access Points (APs). First, we discuss the parameter settings of the IEEE802.11ad MAC which guarantee a low delay by exploiting the synchronous service periods (SPs) mechanism. Then, we propose a binary linear programming model to enhance the reliability of the system under the Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER). The model minimizes the number of deployed APs by taking into account the constraints on the available synchronous SPs. We also propose two heuristics, based on the described mathematical model, in order to efficiently solve the design problem, then compare the computational performance of the proposed approaches. The reported computational results highlight the complementary features of the compared methods and provide useful guidelines about the usage of the proposed approaches.}

	abstract = {In vehicular environments, the cooperation of radar and communications has been recognized as a promising solution to alleviate the shortage of spectrum resources. In this paper, we investigate the joint radar sensing and communication (JSC) system based on the cooperative spectrum sharing strategy. Via the full cooperation between both radar sensing and wireless communication functionalities, we can avoid the under-utilization of spectral resource while improving system efficiency. To implement our JSC control scheme, we focus on coalitional bargaining solutions according to the cooperative game theory. Especially, the coalitional Nash bargaining solution (CNBS) and coalitional Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining (CKSBS) are employed to get a mutually desirable solution in the radar-communication coexistence platform. The main ides of CNBS is adopted to distribute the spectrum resource among roadside units, and both radar and communication functions in each individual vehicle. The concept of CKSBS is applied to allocate the spectrum resource for vehicles in order to maximize their payoffs. In the proposed scheme, the CNBS and CKSBS work together to share the surplus of a coalition with the fairness and efficiency properties. The main contribution of our proposed approach is the reciprocal combination of the CNBS and CKSBS to obtain the synergy effect. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for the JSC system operations.}

	abstract = {Identifying the top-\nK\nflows that require much more bandwidth resources in a large-scale Software-Defined Network (SDN) is essential for many network management tasks, such as load balancing, anomaly detection, and traffic engineering. However, identifying such top-\nK\nflows is not trivial, not only because of the fluctuations in flow bandwidth requirements but also because of the combinatorial explosion of problem instance sizes. In this paper, we weaken the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation and innovatively define the online top-\nK\nflows identification problem as identifying the top-\nK\narms in a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) model. Then, we propose a general greedy selection mechanism with some identification strategies that focus on temporal variations in the rewards. Extensive simulation experiments based on real traffic data are conducted to evaluate the performance of different strategies. In addition, the results of numerical simulations demonstrate that our proposed greedy selection mechanism significantly outperforms existing counterparts on top-\nK\narms identification.}

	abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is commonly used for tracking and identifying objects. However, this technology poses serious security and privacy concerns for individuals carrying the tags. To address these issues, various security protocols have been proposed. Unfortunately, many of these solutions suffer from scalability problems, requiring the back-end server to work linearly in the number of tags for a single tag identification. Some protocols offer O(1) or O(\nlog\nn) identification complexity but are still susceptible to serious attacks. Few protocols consider attacks on the reader-side. Our proposed RFID authentication protocol eliminates the need for a search in the back-end and leverages Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to securely store tag secrets, making it resistant to tag corruption attacks. It provides constant-time identification without sacrificing privacy and offers\nlog\n2\nn\ntimes better identification performance than the state-of-the-art protocol. It ensures destructive privacy for tag holders in the event of reader corruption without any conditions. Furthermore, it enables offline readers to maintain destructive privacy in case of corruption.}

	abstract = {The current explosion of user traffic compels Internet service providers to cache contents at edge servers, so as to reduce the response time of user requests. To deal with such vast amounts of content in edge servers with limited storage, an efficient caching replacement strategy is necessary, consisting of admission and eviction processes. Facing such a large number of user requests and limited storage of edge servers, traditional caching replacement strategies have encountered two major problems. Firstly, they conduct eviction process immediately after cache miss, which ignores the fetching time, during which there may still be multiple access requests to the evicted contents. Secondly, most existing solutions treat admission process and eviction process separately, with different standards, some contents might be fetched and evicted back and forth, seriously affecting user experience. To solve these two problems and improve caching performance, we design two caching modules, Delayed-Eviction and Unified-Standard, and integrate them together into Adele framework. By conducting extensive simulations using real traces, we demonstrate that Adele can improve the hit rate by 31% compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Traditionally, the networking industry has been dominated by closed and proprietary hardware and software. Vendors have been controlling the network by hard-coding how packets should be processed and providing the network operators with a set of predefined protocols. Recently, the industry, operators, and the research community have started to pay special attention to data plane programmability, which allows the user to define the packet processing behavior. Allowing the network operators and programmers to define, deploy, and test new forwarding behaviors in a relatively short time paved the way for a significant wave of innovation and experimentation. With the emergence of programmable data planes, traffic rerouting has been used by the research community. Rerouting approaches are deployed to mitigate various network issues. Despite the considerable number of works that deploy innovative rerouting mechanisms using programmable switches, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey. To this end, this paper provides an in-depth overview, detailed analysis, and unique categorization of the recent programmable data plane-based rerouting approaches. The survey explains the need for rerouting by highlighting the promising results while dealing with link/node failures, load imbalance, and congestion. It then discusses the challenges and considerations and presents future perspectives and open research issues.}

	abstract = {Extracting the protocol format specifications from packets plays a critical role in many applications, such as application protocol parsing, vulnerability scanning, as well as malware behaviour analysis. In this study, we propose RelaNet, a novel relational reasoning-based method for network protocol reverse engineering. It is based on the key insight that n-grams of packets have context relations. Such relations are especially informative between keywords and can be used to infer protocol formats. RelaNet contains three modules to mimic the analysis strategy used by experts: coarse structure generation, relation learning and fine structure generation. In coarse structure generation, RelaNet first constructs a coarse-grained structure based on the occurrence frequency of n-grams. Relation learning is then performed to discover the context relations between the n-grams in the structure. By using such relations, we can eventually discover the strong context relations that exist between keywords, which can be used to accurately generate a fine-grained structure, namely the protocol format. We implement RelaNet and evaluate it on two publicly available datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RelaNet for protocol format inference. Furthermore, we compare RelaNet with state-of-the-art methods, and the results show our approach outperforms those methods.}

	abstract = {We propose a self-sovereign and decentralized naming scheme for Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architectures that makes content items self-verifiable. Our scheme is based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), an emerging identification scheme under standardization by the W3C. With our solution, DIDs are used as content name prefixes and act as the root of trust for the corresponding namespaces. A content item in our scheme includes tamper-proof metadata that can be used to verify its authenticity and integrity based only on the contentâ€™s name, without relying on a trusted third party. The owner of a DID can authorize content providers to publish items under a sub-space of its namespace, or even fully delegate the management of a sub-space of its namespace to a controlling entity. We implement our scheme for the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture and show that it removes the need for trusted third parties, enables hassle-free key rotation, and allows joint namespace ownership and namespace management delegation, with negligible computational and space overhead.}

	abstract = {The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) helps to exchange the information over the internet. However, BGP is susceptible to malicious attacks and misconfigurations meanwhile BGP does not focus on providing security during routing information advertisement. The secure BGP environment provides constant routing services on the internet, but existing works does not provide an optimal solution for BGP router security. To overcome these issues, we proposed decentralized low complexity framework for providing security to BGP attacks using deep learning and blockchain technologies. The proposed SDBGPChain (SDN based BGP using dendrimer tree blockchain) model whereas the SDN provides network management, flexibility and scalability for BGP environment, the proposed work includes three processes such as entity authentication, low complexity BGP attack detection and prevention, and deep learning-based route update validation. Initially, users and BGP routers are authenticated using Enhanced Blowfish and Elliptical Curve Cryptography (EB-ECC) which generated the unique key using EB algorithm and the unique is encrypted by enhanced ECC for improving security. Every Autonomous System (AS) is constructed as a graph structure using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) which improves the scalability and interoperability of the network. Secondly, we perform BGP attack detection using Dual Agent based Twin Actor Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-T2TD3) algorithm by performing both proactive and reactive methods. Finally, we perform route update validation by Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by considering update message tuples which validate the updates by identifying misconfigurations and errors in the updated messages. Here, updated messages are passed to the blockchain for validation using the DiemBFT consensus algorithm which improves high security. The simulation of the proposed SDBGPChain model is conducted by OMNET++ simulation tool, and the performance of this work is evaluated based on various performance metrics such as Packet drop ratio (0.22), Throughput (39.8 bits/sec), Block validation time (20.2 s), Detection accuracy ((no. of attacks 92.5%) and (no of anomalies 93%)), and Network traffic (27.6%) which proved that the proposed work achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art works.}
