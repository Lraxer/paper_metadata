	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a significant interest in ubiquitous coverage, high data rate connectivity, and mobile edge computing (MEC) as crucial services within the future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. These services are regarded as essential components, exemplifying the advancements anticipated in 6G technology. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of these services in MEC-enabled vehicular networks significantly relies on the availability of robust network coverage and telecommunication framework. Unfortunately, in far-flung and isolated regions, such framework is often lacking, posing significant challenges in achieving uninterrupted connectivity, comprehensive coverage, and efficient computation offloading. Targeting the aforementioned horizon, in this paper, an uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-MEC-enabled aerial-vehicular network operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) is proposed in which the ground vehicles are provided edge computing services by an aerial autonomous vehicle, i.e., a high-altitude platform (HAP). We present a system model in which a HAP equipped with MEC servers offers computation offloading capabilities to a vehicular network. Our main objective is to minimize the transaction time of a NOMA cluster offloading its data to MEC servers located at the HAP. We devise a dual-layer optimization scheme for optimizing the transmission power and computational resource allocation by using the Lagrange multipliers method and then attain convergence by implementing a sub-gradient approach. We further extend our work by proposing a data-aware NOMA clustering scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, showing a notable reduction in the transaction time in comparison to the baseline scheme. The optimal power allocation enhances the data rates which subsequently reduces the transmission time, and the optimal cores assignment effectively minimizes the computation time. Additionally, the data-aware NOMA clustering scheme shows promising results by enhancing the system effective throughput and the spectral efficiency in comparison to the conventional NOMA clustering.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with mobile edge computing (MEC) servers assist ground terminals (GTs) for communication and computation in wireless networks. Intelligent reflecting surface(IRS) can effectively assist the UAV to improve the communication quality between UAV and GTs, at the same time, reducing processing delay in UAV for remote areas. In this paper, we propose a framework where an MEC server is mounted on the UAV and an IRS is used to enhance the communication channel in the uplink. The optimization problem of computation offloading strategy and 3D trajectory planning is formulated for minimizing the system service energy consumption. It is an NP-hard nonconvex optimization issue with extra difficulty that offloading tasks is highly dynamic. To tackle this challenging problem, we get a convex upper bound. On this basis, an energy consumption minimization algorithm (SAC-Enc) evolved from the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) soft actor critic (SAC) algorithm is proposed. Numerical evaluations confirm that the proposed approach is capable of rapid convergence and achieves superior performance in terms of energy consumption and computation delay compared to other benchmark algorithms.}

	abstract = {In order to fully exploit the power of Multi-Access Edge Computing, services need to be cached at the network edge in an adaptive and responsive way to accommodate the high system dynamics and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the online service caching problem in MEC, with the goal to minimize users’ perceived latency while at the same time, ensure the rate of tasks processed by the edge server is no less than a preset threshold. We model the problem with a Constrained stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit formulation, and propose a simple yet effective online caching algorithm called Constrained Confidence Bound (CCB). CCB achieves\nO\n(\nT\nln\nT\n)\nbounds on both regret and violation of the constraint, and is able to achieve a good balance between them. We further consider the scenario when there is cost (i.e., delay) due to service switches, and propose two service switch-aware caching algorithms — Explore-First (EF) and Successive Elimination-based (SE) caching, together with a novel sampling scheme. We prove that EF achieves\nO\n(\nT\n2\n3\n(\nln\nT\n)\n1\n3\n)\nbound on regret and violation, whereas SE achieves\nO\n(\nT\nln\nT\n)\nand converges significantly faster.

	abstract = {Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) comprising pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists are more susceptible to road traffic accidents and fatalities than other road users. Improving safety for vulnerable road users is a priority for many cities and governments, and various measures are being taken to reduce the risk of accidents and increase road safety. Advanced Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) that facilitate Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication encompass Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) schemes. To address the issues and decrease the number of VRU fatalities, efficient VRU protection solutions can be seamlessly incorporated into evolving C-ITS services. This paper introduces a novel implementation and integration of VRU protection models into the Artery/OMNeT++ V2X-simulation framework as a promising solution for further wide-scale evolution in enhancing the safety of vulnerable road users. VRUs can transmit messages about their existence using the VRU Awareness Message (VAM) messaging protocol. This paper presents a performance evaluation of cooperative VRU protection scenarios with VAM protocol and deployment. Simulation results will be given for pedestrian protection models with VRU detection using sensors, collective perception, and active, VAM-based VRU Awareness message transmission.}

	abstract = {The Edge Computing paradigm is increasingly gaining traction in modern telecommunication scenarios, as it enables the offloading of computational tasks from end devices to a variety of nodes located in close proximity to them. This approach is essential for meeting the ever-stricter Quality of Service requirements imposed by modern applications. Concurrently, the advent of Data Plane Programmability allows for unmatched flexibility on the networking plane, supporting processing of multiple protocols in a logically centralized fashion with simple in-line computation, and offering the possibility to offload additional services to networking equipment. Reaping those benefits necessitates heedful management of resources and infrastructure. This, in turn, calls for the introduction of a service orchestration entity, capable of taking advantage of device heterogeneity to enable efficient and swift service provisioning. This work delves into the potential of introducing an orchestration system able to cope with the challenges of offloading security tasks at the Edge. This effort involves developing and implementing novel architectural components that capitalize on the heterogeneous nature of the Edge infrastructure as well as of the Programmable Data Plane as a potential tool for service offloading. To establish the feasibility and performance of this approach, an industrial scenario is considered, where the integrity of data from legacy devices must be ensured. Following an evaluation of the hashing performance of the Programmable Data Plane in comparison to general-purpose devices, a simulation study is conducted on the overall orchestration system, demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {We consider a one-leader multi-follower Stackelberg pricing game in urban Internet-of-Things networks. The leader manages multiple services and sets service prices to maximize profit, while followers seek the most cost-effective services, taking into account service prices, service congestion, and individual locations. Existing approaches often simplify the game process by neglecting followers’ locations, but they are not applicable to real-world complex spatial distributions. In this paper, we focus on the congestion-aware Stackelberg pricing game in urban Internet-of-Things networks, using electric vehicle charging as a case study. The game is reformulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) that considers both congestion effects and followers’ spatial distributions. To solve the MPEC, we introduce the Segmentation-based Pricing with ITERative Optimization (SPITER) algorithm, which converges to a local maximum. Additionally, optimization techniques are developed to improve the performance of solving SPITER in urban environments. We evaluate the performance of SPITER using extensive experiments with two real-life urban datasets, demonstrating the advantages of our model and illustrating SPITER’s effectiveness and convergence.}

	abstract = {We present an investigation into the design of an acoustic communication network, where multiple users are distributed across space and transmit and receive simultaneously in the same band to and from a common base station. Specifically, we focus on a system that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing as a modulation method, and allows users to transmit and receive in either synchronous or asynchronous fashion. To distinguish between users on the uplink, the base station employs a combination of code-division and space-division multiple access. The base station iteratively steers a beam to each stable propagation path of the desired user’s channel while placing nulls in the direction of other paths, as well as in the directions of interfering users. Finally, the multiple paths of the desired user are recombined before data detection. The process is repeated for each user. Broadband beamforming is employed to account for the broadband nature of acoustic signals. The beamformer coefficients on each carrier depend on the angles of signal arrivals, which are estimated during the uplink transmission and used to construct both the uplink and the downlink beamformer. On the downlink, the base station utilizes angle information to assemble beamforming weights and point in the direction of stable paths of the users. It superimposes multiuser signals and transmits the sum signal to the users. The signal intended for a given user reaches only that user, requiring just a simple detector. Each user is equipped by a single-element transducer. To demonstrate the design concepts, we conducted simulations using a shallow water channel model and performed experimental over-the-air tests in an indoor environment using an acoustic communications testbed. The results were excellent, thereby encouraging future implementations in practical systems.}

	abstract = {Multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC) enables mobile users (MUs) to offload tasks to proximal multiple MEC servers for fast task processing. Since MUs generally have stringent delay requirements and limited energy and MEC servers have finite communication, computation, and caching (3C) resources, the joint co-design and optimization over computation offloading and 3C resource allocation for wireless-powered multi-access MEC systems have been highly demanded, while having not been well studied yet. We consider a wireless-powered multi-access MEC, where multiple energy harvesting (EH) based MUs and multiple base stations (BSs) each equipped with an MEC server coexist. Each MU first harvests energy from nearby MEC servers, and then offloads its sub-tasks to multiple MEC servers concurrently based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), so as to reduce data offloading delay. We first formulate a delay minimization problem, by jointly optimizing MUs’ computation offloading, MEC servers’ computation and caching resources allocation, and system communication resources allocation. Then we propose an alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) based distributed scheme to decompose the formulated optimization problem into several sub-problems, and use the block coordinate descending (BCD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to transform all sub-problems each corresponding to one MEC server to convex subproblems. Finally, we validate and evaluate our proposed scheme through numerical analyses, which show that our proposed distributed scheme can greatly reduce the min–max delay of all MUs by allowing each MU’s concurrent data offloading to multiple MEC servers using NOMA and by jointly optimizing computation offloading and 3C resource allocations. Also, the delay imposed by our proposed scheme is much smaller than that imposed by the Interior Point method, which shows the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.}

A scheduling algorithm for VNF is proposed, which aims to minimize the SFC rejection rate while taking into account VNF mapping, scheduling, and traffic routing during the scheduling process. To achieve this goal, a Markov decision process (MDP)-based VNF scheduling model is established that guarantees SFC resource requirements are met. The model uses the D3QN (Dueling Double DQN) algorithm based on composite rules to select the SFC at each scheduling time point, and selects virtual nodes and routes using a routing optimization algorithm to minimize the SFC rejection rate. We compare our algorithm with the single rule, DQN and genetic algorithm, and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the rejection rate of SFC by approximately 8% compared to genetic algorithms.}

	abstract = {Adaptive routing plays a pivotal role in the overall performance of Network-on-Chips (NoCs). However, with many-core architectures supporting complex and constantly changing traffic patterns for emerging applications, this aspect presents significant challenges. Our meticulous examination and analysis of existing heuristic adaptive routing algorithms revealed three key limiting factors: single network status metric, lack of system feedback awareness, and lack of ability to customize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising opportunities for exploring adaptive routing design. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, in particular, enable efficient exploration in adaptive routing design spaces where heuristic strategies may be inadequate. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for adaptive routing called DRLAR that is suitable for diversified traffic patterns and resolves multi-objective optimization simultaneously. DRLAR formulates routing as an agent, which makes routing decisions based on autonomous learning using multiple network state features and system-level feedback information. We conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art routing algorithms to evaluate our design. The results show that DRLAR reduces packet latency by an average of 33.3%, achieving a reduction of 41.6% and 10.5% on average under heavy synthetic traffic and the PARSEC 2.1 benchmark, respectively. We also perform a cost analysis to validate the potential implementation of DRLAR on NoCs with low computational, storage, and power.}

The study brings the following significant contributions to the field of dynamic network traffic management within a network slicing framework:\n(\ni\n)\nassessing the performance of three popular machine learning models to predict QoNSS-aware data traffic patterns at slice-delivered applications granularity;\n(\ni\ni\n)\ndesigning an intelligent decision-making function capable of proactively fostering inter-slice offloading of slice-delivered applications flows in response to QoNSS degradation predictions; and,\n(\ni\ni\ni\n)\nproviding testing outcomes to offer a better understanding of the different mapping features displayed by each machine learning model. The experiments were conducted atop different testbed settings featuring real-world slice-defined network and computing infrastructure. Detailed mappings and statistical outcome analyses suggest that the proactive load-balancing function outperformed a regular rule-based approach by significantly reducing the total packet loss of the network system while allowing high accuracy and anticipation reaction time.}

	abstract = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides real-time data collection and access services to medical entities by connecting their devices to Internet. However, within such a complex architecture, achieving patient-centric data access still presents trustworthiness challenges of transmission security and usage reliability. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and blockchain are both the promising primitives that support patients with secure access control over their data. Nevertheless, both have their unique key management issues. In this paper, we propose a novel patient-centric and trusted data access (PCT-DA) system in blockchain-enabled IoMT. Firstly, we develop an online/offline encryption and verifiable outsourced decryption CP-ABE scheme to relieve the computation pressure on patients and users. Secondly, we design a flexible attribute-based key management mechanism to overcome the security drawbacks of encryption and attribute keys, such as single point of failure, key escrow and privacy leakage. Finally, we build a trusted integrity audit contract to guarantee the incentive fairness between patients and users in access services. Moreover, theoretical analyses prove that the PCT-DA system not only achieves confidentiality, integrity, traceability and forward/backward security, but also guarantees static security under random oracles. Simulation experiments indicate that our proposal reduces the time cost by approximately 14.10 seconds over state-of-the-art and is more practical in blockchain-enabled IoMT system.}

	abstract = {Avionics Full-DupleX (AFDX) is a switched Ethernet-based network used in modern commercial airplanes for the transmission of command and control avionics flows. These critical flows require deterministic guarantees leading to a lightly loaded network. Aircraft manufacturers envision to carry additional non avionics flows (i.e. video, audio, service) to take advantage of the spare bandwidth. However, it is then compulsory to preserve the real-time guarantees of avionics flows in terms of bounded jitter at the transmitter output and of bounded end-to-end latency. Depending on the type of additional traffic, Quality of Service (QoS) end-to-end guarantees may be offered to the additional flows of lower criticality in terms of reduced delay or bounded jitter for instance. These guarantees can be ensured by scheduling policies at transmitter and switch level. However, an important safety-related constraint is the asynchronous design of avionics distributed systems that prohibits the use of a network-wide synchronization of end systems and switches. Thus, time-triggered networking such as emerging Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) or Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) cannot be leveraged. This paper underlines the benefits of only scheduling flows at the transmitter, which is compatible with the asynchronous safety constraint of avionics systems. We show that it is possible to build a table schedule that carries both critical avionics flows and additional video flows that meet their timing and bandwidth allocation constraints. Therefore, we design scheduling strategies for efficient distribution of flows in the table scheduling whose performance is compared to the optimal schedule minimizing the emission lag of additional flows. Proposed heuristics are constructed such as to favor the network responsiveness for avionics flows thanks to slot over-provisioning. Extensive results on an A350 AFDX industrial configuration show that for a transmitter load of up to 70% of the available bandwidth, the uniform allocation heuristic provides a performance close to optimal in terms of minimum emission lag for additional flows, so offering a practical configuration heuristic to industry.}

	abstract = {Cooperative edge computing serves as an effective solution to provide reliable and elastic edge computing services through pooling geographically proximate edge resources and efficiently allocating them to users. The incentive mechanism is critical for realizing cooperative edge computing. In this paper, we propose a virtual machine (VM) or container based resource allocation scheme and two market-based mechanisms to stimulate collaboration among edge servers (ESs). Our first mechanism is a novel two-stage double auction based approach where edge resources are allocated to services/VMs at the first stage and then distributed among ESs at the second stage via a two-sided multi-unit auction. To make it more practical, we use markups to set the ask and bid prices for the participants in the market. Moreover, with the concept of virtual sellers and virtual buyers, we cast the multi-unit auction as single-unit one so that the auction becomes tractable. We further propose a price-based decentralized mechanism in case there is no central authority. With an appropriately constructed objective function, we formulate the resource allocation task as a network utility maximization (NUM) problem and leverage the dual-based decomposition theory for a distributed solution. We theoretically prove that both mechanisms guarantee properties such as budget balance and individual rationality for all ESs. Numerical studies with real-world dataset are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of our mechanisms over baselines.}
