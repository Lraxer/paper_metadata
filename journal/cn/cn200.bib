	abstract = {With the vast data loads produced by numerous applications and services, network softwarization became a vital addition to the design of intelligent heterogeneous vehicular networks. Smart Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (S-SDVN) are promising solutions that support various applications and protocols such as network mobility management, routing, traffic control and provides a centralized innovative decision-making protocol. SDVNs remove the limitations imposed by traditional hardware-based network devices to offer a global view of the networks’ status and give a standard framework for heterogeneous wireless technologies (WiMAX, WiFi/6, 5G, 6G). However, to capture the network’s topology and manage data traffic, an efficient discovery protocol is needed to mitigate the challenges under vehicles’ rapid mobility. In this article, we present an efficient and scalable topology discovery protocol for distributed software-defined vehicular networks, which we refer to as EDiPSo. The proposed protocol reduces the overhead and time complexity of the discovery process based on the centrality score measurements and vehicle traffic densities over switch-enabled roadside units. EDiPSo protocol is evaluated and compared to existing benchmark solutions using realistic mobility traces of Shenzhen City. The results showed that the proposed distributed discovery process significantly reduces the overhead compared to other protocols and decreases the time required to complete a discovery cycle as the number of locally distributed controllers increases.}

	abstract = {This paper considers a problem of real-time control of uplink transmissions over dual links. In the problem, a UE is configured with dual links. We propose a joint control algorithm to choose a primary link and activate or deactivate each link in every slot. The activation of a link incurs uplink transmission power. Switching a primary link also incurs cost. The control algorithm aims to jointly minimize the transmission power and primary link switching cost, while minimizing transmission queues to reduce delays. The problem introduces several constraints on transmission power allocation and link activation. In particular, the secondary link can be activated only when it has non-empty transmission queues and the primary link is activated. For the primary link, no such restriction is imposed. These heterogeneous transmission constraints require the decisions to treat a time-varying decision set. Furthermore, the primary link switching cost may enforce the previous decisions to skew the current decision. To tackle such difficulties, we use Lyapunov optimization techniques and develop a control algorithm. We investigate the algorithm structure from the decisions made for special cases. We reveal that the primary link selection has a Shortest-Queue with Hysteresis structure. We also show that link activation control largely relies on transmission efficiency. We analyze the performance bound of our algorithm in terms of cost and queues to show that our algorithm can achieve an optimal target value. Finally, we present simulation results to verify the performance of our algorithm.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as Base Stations (UAV-BS) is a promising technology for mitigating Terrestrial Base Stations (TBS) failures or becoming an ideal temporary solution to offloading. UAV-BS can be deployed to complement existing cellular systems by providing additional capacity to hotspot areas, as well as to provide network coverage in emergency and public safety situations, for instance, during a parade or flash-crowd events. A key issue for the success of UAV-BS is to design and model how to define the position and behavior of UAV-BSs to improve the coverage area for mobile users while enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS). This article proposes ProactivE Radio-QoS-aware UAV-BS deployment mechanism to improve Cellular nEtwork oPeraTion (PERCEPT) to define the positioning of the UAV-BS’s in specific zones according to the conditions of the LTE networks and QoS. PERCEPT divides the optimal positioning problem into three parts, prediction of users mobility, radio- and QoS-aware user clustering, and positioning of the UAV-BS’s. Simulation results show the gains of PERCEPT by improving in 33%, 30%, and 50% the throughput, packet delivery ratio, and delay, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in UAV-assisted cellular scenarios.}

This paper surveys crosschain communications protocols, presenting them based on the top-level usage scenarios they are trying to meet: value swapping, crosschain messaging, and blockchain pinning.

	abstract = {The worldwide debate over Network Neutrality (NN) has been raging on for nearly two decades. According to NN principles, all traffic in the Internet must be treated with impartiality. In particular, unfair Traffic Differentiation (TD) is not allowed. Several strategies have been proposed for detecting TD, but locating the source of TD is still an under-explored topic. In this work, we present a holistic approach for unifying TD detection solutions into a single framework with the purpose of locating the source of TD. We propose an algorithm for combining measurements from multiple vantage points, and a strategy for selecting good vantage points. Our proposals leverage Internet peering properties to infer the behavior of individual Autonomous Systems (ASes), without requiring knowledge of the exact routes traversed by measurement probes. To evaluate our proposals, we first ran several experiments to confirm that indeed Internet routes do present the required properties. Then, several simulations were performed to assess the efficiency of our proposals. Results show that our approach is capable of locating TD under several different conditions. Another finding is that issuing measurements from a few end-hosts of core Internet ASes achieves similar results than from a much larger number of end-hosts at the edge.}

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) are two promising technologies to enable 5G and 6G services and achieve cost reduction, network scalability, and deployment flexibility. However, migration to full SDN/NFV networks in order to serve these services is a time-consuming process and costly for mobile operators. This paper focuses on energy efficiency during the transition of mobile core networks (MCN) to full SDN/NFV networks and explores how energy efficiency can be addressed during such migration. We propose a general system model containing a combination of legacy nodes and links, in addition to newly introduced NFV and SDN nodes. We refer to this system model as partial SDN and hybrid NFV MCN, which can cover different modes of SDN and NFV implementations. Based on this framework, we formulate energy efficiency by considering joint routing and function placement in the network. Since this problem belongs to the class of non-linear integer programming problems, to solve it efficiently, we present a modified Viterbi algorithm (MVA) based on multi-stage graph modeling and a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. We simulate this algorithm for a number of network scenarios with different fractions of NFV and SDN nodes and evaluate how much energy can be saved through such transition. Simulation results confirm the expected performance of the algorithm, which saves up to 70% energy compared to a network where all nodes are always on. Interestingly, the amount of energy saved by the proposed algorithm in the case of hybrid NFV and partial SDN networks can reach up to 60%–90% of the saved energy in full NFV/SDN networks.}

Most of the existing works have one or more of the following limitations: static modeling, non co-evolved strategy and synchronized setting, not accounting for the dynamic nature of the cyber arms race between the defensive and offensive sides. In this paper, we apply differential game theory to analyze the antagonistic dynamics between the attacker and the defender and study two complementary game theoretic formulations, namely the black-box game the and the white-box game: The black-box game can cogently model the opaque-information confrontation and the white-box one is capable to depict the partially transparent-information confrontation. To gain insight into the evolution rule of the antagonistic dynamics between the defensive and the offensive sides, we establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium and the corresponding conditions in the black-box game. Moreover, an iteration algorithm is designed to find the numerical solutions of the Nash equilibrium in the general case and further its analytical solutions in a special case for the white-box game. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed games.}

	abstract = {The future of multi-blockchain architecture depends on the emergence of new protocols that enable consensus between trustless cross-blockchain participants. However, interoperability between blockchains remains a research challenge. The existing interoperability approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, making it difficult to gain confidence in the security and correctness of the process. A cross-blockchain protocol must provide a self-verifiable state proof that encodes trust in the transfer process to guarantee consensus. Inspired by the burn-address concept, we propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-blockchain protocol to exchange assets between two networks. The proposed protocol transfers assets from one blockchain system to another so that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and recreated on the destination blockchain. Our protocol makes use of digital signatures, hash-time-locks and integration mechanisms to perform cross-blockchain transactions in a distributed manner. We theoretically prove that the proposed cross-blockchain protocol transfers assets securely and correctly. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the Burn-to-Claim protocol when used in an application environment.}

Among them, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are becoming more complex to detect. Recently, several models have been reported in the literature to identify them, but it remains a challenging issue due to the significant changes in signatures and traffic rate. To address this problem, a new automatic detection methodology is developed by reducing the feature space, which in turn reduces overfitting and computational time of the model. Initially, data pre-processing is performed to improve the generalizability of the model. Next, feature selection is applied to select the most appropriate features, which helps in improving classification accuracy. Further, the performance of the model is enhanced using hyperparameter tuning by selecting the appropriate parameters for learning approaches. Finally, both the optimal features and hyperparameters are fed to various supervised learning approaches namely-Logistic regression(LR), Decision tree (DT), Gradient boost(GB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Support vector machine (SVM). All these experiments are evaluated on the CICDDoS2019 dataset. The experimental results show that the GB model performed well compared to the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 99.97 %.}

Breaching a healthcare system causes the disclosure of sensitive health data. This data is usually saved into centralized databases, which creates vulnerabilities and gives rise to cyber attacks. This research focuses on enhancing the security and privacy of EHRs by using blockchain technology. This paper proposes a new architecture that takes advantage of decentralized databases to avoid centralized storage issues. The decentralized used database for storing patient electronic health records is the OrbitDB with Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Besides, we have deployed a blockchain network built on Hyperledger fabric by using Hyperledger composer to save hashes of stored data and control access when retrieving it. The proposed Blockchain-based architecture is designed to contribute to the healthcare management systems’ robustness and to avoid recorded security limitations in commonly used systems for smart healthcare. Performance evaluation results issued from Hyperledger Caliper and comparative analysis have proved the robustness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of security and privacy requirements, key features of blockchain-based healthcare systems, and performance metrics including various throughput and latency.}

Many anomaly detection methods are based on the inspection of packets collected at the network core routers, with consequent disadvantages in terms of computational cost and privacy. We propose an alternative method in which packet header inspection is not needed. The method is based on the extraction of a normal subspace obtained by the tensor decomposition technique considering the correlation among metrics. In its online version, the proposed approach for tensor decomposition allows efficient tracking of changes in the normal subspace. The flexibility of the method is illustrated by applying it to distinct examples that include supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection. The examples use actual data collected at residential routers.}

The choice of trust metric will depend on context, circumstance and user requirements and there is no single best metric for use in all circumstances. Where different users require different trust metrics to be employed the trust score calculations should still be based on all available trust evidence. Trust is normally computed using past experiences but, in practice (especially in centralised systems), the validity and accuracy of these experiences are taken for granted. In this paper, we provide a formal framework and practical blockchain-based implementation that allows independent trust providers to implement different trust metrics in a distributed manner while still allowing all trust providers to base their calculations on a common set of trust evidence. Further, our design allows experiences to be provably linked to interactions without the need for a central authority. This leads to the notion of evidence-based trust with provable interactions. Leveraging blockchain allows the trust providers to offer their services in a competitive manner, charging fees while users are provided with payments for recording experiences. Performance details of the blockchain implementation are provided.}

We construct a spanning tree to organize the forwarding group, and maximize the hit ratio subject to a budget constraint on cooperation cost. We first address the optimization problem using the method of Lagrangian multipliers and derive the optimal group parameter. Furthermore, a distributed optimization algorithm with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) via constraint projection and variable splitting is proposed to achieve the desired goal. Finally, we build an edge computing simulation platform consisting of hundreds of edge nodes and users as a case study to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Numerical results show that it significantly improves the caching hit ratio up to 60%, compared to the classic scheme.}

	abstract = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is an emerging technology that faces many challenges for monitoring patient health state information and early diagnosis of any disease (e.g. COVID-19). In addition, WBAN has many issues such as high energy consumption, overhead and latency due to the scarcity in resources, for that we bring edge assisted 5G environment in WBAN. The patient information is sensitive and easily traced by the attackers due to insecurity, for that, we proposed the EiA-H2B model (Edge intelligent Agent Hybrid Hierarchical Blockchain) which includes five phases. Firstly we proposed Biological PUF based sensor authentication, which is a strong credential that provides high security. All the sensors are authenticated by the virtual authenticator that is deployed by a blockchain ledger. Due to the mobility of WBAN, we focused on handover that is done by Bi-Partite One to N matching theory. Secondly, we proposed high voting based virtual clustering, in this phase high voting sensor is elected as a super node and that is used to create a virtual cluster. Thirdly, we proposed duty cycle MAC scheduling protocol is used to predict the original state of the sensors which is done by Attention Matrix based Gated Recurrent Unit (AM-GRU), and then the timeslots are allocated for avoiding packet loss and retransmission. Fourth, we perform relay selection and routing that is done by Global Optimization based Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA). And finally, we predict emergency data and generate an alert in EiA using Human Learning aided State Action Reward State Action (SARSA) algorithm that finds the current state and predicts the corresponding action. Based on that current state information SARSA provides an efficient recommendation to the patients. Experiments are conducted by OMNeT ++ network simulator and evaluate the performance of the proposed EiA-H2B model in terms of energy consumption, success rate, network throughput, end to end delay, packet loss rate, authentication time and processing time.}

	abstract = {Botnets have become a major threat in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, due to the damages that these sets of compromised IoT devices may cause. To increase their attacks’ success, modern botnets are designed in a distributed manner, following a P2P structure. Recently, several botnet detection solutions have been proposed. Among them, community behavior analysis solutions seem to be promising because of their high detection accuracy. However, such solutions are not optimized for real life scenarios since they only run in a static mode, that is, reading all network traffic at once. As such, they do not support real-time data analysis. In order to handle such issue, these solutions should run in a dynamic distributed environment where different actors participate in the detection process. However, this collaborative environment brings up the issue of trust among the actors.}

We notice that the video configurations, i.e., frames per second (fps) and resolution, significantly affect the key metrics such as detection accuracy, data transmission latency and energy consumption in real AR application. Besides the time-varying bandwidth, we observe that the video contents, such as moving velocities of target objects, have remarkable impacts on the configuration selection. In addition, we take the energy consumption on data transmission into consideration. In this paper, we propose VCMaker, a system that generates video configuration decisions using reinforcement learning (RL). VCMaker trains a neural network model that selects configuration for future video chunks based on the collected observations. Rather than rely on any pre-programmed models, VCMaker learns to make configuration decisions solely through empirical observations of the resulting performances of historical decisions. In addition, we leverage the dynamic Region of Interest (RoI) encoding and motion vector-based object detection mechanisms to advance VCMaker. We implemented VCMaker and conducted extensive evaluations. The results show that VCMaker achieves a 20.5%–32.8% higher detection accuracy, and 25.2%–45.7% lower energy consumption than several state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of data transmission requirements, the massive bursty traffic results in more frequent and serious network congestion. To deal with the burst traffic, the buffer size of the network is designed to be much larger than required. However, increasing buffer size leads to bufferbloat problem, which exacerbates network congestion. To address this problem, Active Queue Management (AQM) is proposed to cooperate with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control mechanism. But it is hard to model dynamic AQM/TCP system and tune the parameters of conventional AQM schemes to obtain good performance under different congestion scenarios. In this paper, we aim to study the AQM scheme from a whole new perspective by leveraging emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A model-free approach, DRL-AQM, enables the AQM to learn the best dropping policy as human beings learn skills. DRL-AQM can capture intricate patterns in the data traffic model after trained in a simple network scenario, and leverage this to improve performance in a great variety of scenarios. There are two phases in our scheme, offline training phase and deployment phase. Once the model is trained, it can work well without any parameter-tuning in many scenarios. Experimental results show that (1) DRL-AQM outperforms conventional AQM algorithms in a variety of complex network scenarios and it is robust and insensitive to network conditions. (2) DRL-AQM keeps persistently low buffer capacity utilization without over dropping and damaging throughput. (3) DRL-AQM adapts automatically and continuously to the dynamics of the network links.}

	abstract = {Segment routing (SR) combines the advantages of source routing powered by software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm and hop-by-hop routing in legacy network infrastructure. The recent applications of SR in multi-domain network and service function chaining (SFC) entail the efficient use of multiple segments. However, because of the computation inefficiency, it is nearly impossible to accurately evaluate whether and to what extent various types of networks will benefit from SR with multiple segments using conventional approaches. In this paper, we propose a flexible Q-SR framework as well as its formulation in order to fully explore the potential of SR from an algorithmic perspective. The framework is highly extensible to design and evaluate algorithms that can be adapted to various network topologies and traffic matrices. For the offline setting, we develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) which can find a\n(\n1\n+\nω\n)\n-approximation solution for any specified\nω\n>\n0\nin time that is a polynomial function of the network size. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FPTAS is the first algorithm that can compute arbitrarily accurate solution. For the online setting, we develop an online primal–dual algorithm that is proven to be\nO\n(\n1\n)\n-competitive and violates link capacities by a factor of\nO\n(\nlog\nn\n)\n, where\nn\nis the node number of the network. For the proposed approximation algorithms, we prove theoretical performance bounds and conduct extensive simulations on synthetic and realistic networks to analyze SR related and algorithmic parameters and validate the computation efficiency in both offline and online scenarios.}

However, the scale-free topology is very vulnerable to malicious attacks in which the nodes with high importance are attacked first, and its energy efficiency is also unsatisfactory. Therefore, how to build a comprehensively robust and energy-efficient WSN becomes a challenging issue. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Robust and Energy-efficient Scale-free double stage Topology evolution model (REST). In the first stage of REST, a scale-free backbone topology is built to achieve good fault tolerance, and in the second stage, the backbone topology is optimized using a memetic evolutionary algorithm to achieve good intrusion tolerance and energy efficiency. The topology constructed by REST is organized in a clustering manner, which is applicable to most task scenarios. Analytical and simulation results have demonstrated that REST can obtain a more satisfactory topological structure spending less time than existing algorithms.}

	abstract = {Enabling cloud–edge collaboration to Internet of Things (IoT) systems can better satisfy the application requirements of mobile devices (MDs). In the environments where cloud service providers (CSPs) and edge service providers (ESPs) coexist, it is critical to design a mechanism for the competitive IoT markets to maximize the revenues of CSPs and ESPs and optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of MDs. This area is less considered by the existing works. To this end, we propose a distributed pricing and task offloading mechanism for multi-cloud and multi-edge IoT environments. We introduce a multi-leader multi-follower two-tier Stackelberg game to model the interaction between service provides and MDs. We further design two distributed algorithms, namely, an iterative proximal offloading algorithm (IPOA) and an iterative Stackelberg game pricing algorithm (ISPA). The former solves the follower non-cooperative game among MDs and the latter uses backward induction to deal with the price competition among service providers. Experimental results show that IPOA can markedly reduce the disutility of MDs compared with other traditional task offloading schemes, and the price of anarchy (PoA) is always less than 2. Besides, the results also demonstrate that ISPA is reliable in improving the revenue of service providers while guaranteeing the QoE of MDs.}

Very limited attempts can instead be found tackling prediction at packet-level granularity. This much harder problem (whose solution extends trivially to the aggregated prediction) allows a finer-grained knowledge and wider possibilities of exploitation. The recent investigation and success of sophisticated Deep Learning algorithms is now providing mature tools to face this challenging but promising goal.}

	abstract = {In recent days, Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) have arisen as a viable solution to improve spectrum utilization by elastically assigning spectral resources customized for diverse bandwidth requirements. The key facilitators for EONs are flexible grid technology and sliceable bandwidth variable transponders (SBVTs). SBVT in EONs has recently been proposed as a next-generation bandwidth variable transponder (BVT), which supports high data-rate super-channels (i.e., coherent optical subcarriers are aggregated to build a channel of desired capacity which is provisioned in a single operational cycle) and sliceability (i.e., optical flows are flexibly related to the arriving traffic demands, and apart from forming a super-channel, they could be transmitted towards distinct destinations simultaneously). In this paper, we present an explication on SBVT technology enabling distance adaptive hybrid super-channels. This paper begins by proposing a novel SBVT architecture, including a distance adaptive sub-carrier estimator module (DASEM) and transmission and modulation module (T&MM). DASEM is a programmable controller which operates on the concept of distance adaptive modulation technique and accomplishes the transmission of the data-streams/main-streams via distance adaptive hybrid super-channels by configuring the T&MM dynamically. Further, we implement the proposed distance adaptive hybrid super-channels using the two most promising transmission techniques: Coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) and Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing (NWDM). It has been exhibited that distance adaptive hybrid super-channels outperform conventional super-channels by achieving an increment in spectral efficiency of approximately 55%. In addition, the system transmission performance (NWDM super-channel) with an acceptable bit error rate (BER) of\n1\n0\n3\nis analyzed over 240 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The proposed SBVT architecture with a programmable controller enables cost reduction and provides a significant saving in spectrum consumption.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of communication network technology, the types and quantity of network traffic data are accordingly increasing. Network traffic classification has become a non-trivial research task in the area of network management and security, which not only helps to improve the fine-grained network resource allocation but also enables policy-driven network management. As the closest network element to the subscribers, SDN Edge Gateway can tremendously enhance the user experience with the capability of traffic classification. Deep Learning (DL) performs automatic feature extraction without human intervention, which undoubtedly makes it a highly desirable approach for traffic classification, especially encrypted traffic. However, capturing large labeled datasets is cumbersome and time-consuming manual labor. Semi-Supervised learning is an appropriate technique to overcome this problem. With that in mind, we proposed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based Semi-Supervised Learning Encrypted Traffic Classification method called ByteSGAN embedded in SDN Edge Gateway to achieve the goal of traffic classification in a fine-grained manner to further improve network resource utilization. ByteSGAN can only use a small number of labeled traffic samples and a large number of samples to achieve a good performance of traffic classification by modifying the structure and loss function of the regular GAN discriminator network in a semi-supervised learning way. Based on the public datasets ‘ISCX2012 VPN-non VPN’ and ‘Crossmarket’, two experimental results show that the ByteSGAN can efficiently improve the performance of traffic classifiers and outperform the other supervised learning methods like CNN.}

While blockchain technologies provide a helpful mechanism in the form of technical consensus, originally created to resolve the double-spending problem, little does it address impediments to proper contract formation that have to do with the quality of exogenous data, asymmetry of information, or even its suitability (the colloquial garbage-in/garbage-out problem). In the face of the limitations of technical consensus, we explore how the strengths of technical consensus can be utilized by introducing another dimension of consensus – what we have called social consensus – which directly addresses the formation of true (if retrospective) Common Knowledge essential to arms-length agreement between multiple actors. We have eschewed the notion that social consensus as an epistemological concern, and instead focus on mechanisms by which environments of multiple actors form and sustain bodies of information that enable them to go about their activities with a reasonable level of confidence that others in the supply chain will ‘do their bit,’ backed by a ‘failsafe’ mechanism enforced by cryptography which holds the actors unharmed in case the envisioned finality is not obtained. These bodies of information create what is essentially a retrospective form of common knowledge, and a lesser variant, mutual knowledge. We propose an implementation from the preferred mechanism of a multisig primitive, which builds and improves on the Gnosis multisig, in the use case of decentralized blockchain-powered supply chains consisting of multiple parties, human and machine.}

	abstract = {Cryptographic protocols have been widely used to protect the user’s privacy and avoid exposing private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), including the version originally designed by Google (GQUIC) and the version standardized by IETF (IQUIC), as alternatives to the traditional HTTP, demonstrate their unique transmission characteristics: based on UDP for encrypted resource transmitting, accelerating web page rendering. However, existing encrypted transmission schemes based on TCP are vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing adversaries to infer the users’ visited websites by eavesdropping on the transmission channel. Whether GQUIC and IQUIC can effectively resist such attacks is worth investigating. In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities of GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS to WFP attacks from the perspective of traffic analysis. Extensive experiments show that, in the early traffic scenario, GQUIC is the most vulnerable to WFP attacks among GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS, while IQUIC is more vulnerable than HTTPS, but the vulnerability of the three protocols is similar in the normal full traffic scenario. Features transferring analysis shows that most features are transferable between protocols when on normal full traffic scenario, which enable the adversary to use features proven effective on a special protocol efficiently attacking a new protocol. However, combining with the qualitative analysis of latent feature representation, we find that the transferring is inefficient when on early traffic, as GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS show the significantly different magnitude of variation in the traffic distribution on early traffic. By upgrading the one-time WFP attacks to multiple WFP Top-\na\nattacks, we find that the attack accuracy on GQUIC and IQUIC reach 95.4% and 95.5%, respectively, with only 40 packets and just using simple features, whereas reach only 60.7% when on HTTPS. Finally, by conducting the attacks on flawed networks, we also demonstrate that the vulnerability of IQUIC is only slightly dependent on the network environment.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using both blockchain and searchable encryption to build a medical data-sharing platform. The latter is designed to allow one to uniformly search for patients' (encrypted) data in different medical institutions. Building on the assumption that medical records are stored locally by the hospital, we use smart contracts to build a global encrypted search index and a verification index for multiple data owners on the blockchain. In our approach, fully functional access control is provided to ensure that patients and medical institutions can control access to the data. This allows the user to promptly verify the integrity of the results after the search. Our approach also supports the addition, modification, and deletion of medical records, and it complies with the requirements of forward security. The experimental results on the local Ethereum network show that our scheme efficiently facilitates secure data sharing.}

	abstract = {It is important for network operators to carry out traffic and application characterization to gain insights into the activity of their networks. Several studies proposed methods that extract features from network traffic to characterize it, or to classify the application that produced it, based on a “man in the middle” network interception point that can analyze the entire network traffic of an organization. This network topology, however, is increasingly becoming irrelevant, due to mobile and remote traffic joining the corporate network by passing through VPN channels or relay networks.}
