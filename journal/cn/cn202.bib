	abstract = {An increasing number of physical assets, such as academic certificates and credentials, are being represented in the form of digital assets. These assets always involve multiple statuses, rules, and complex associations. It is challenging to determine the transaction execution order using the existing blockchains because they lack the ability to record and execute associations between assets, which results in problems of inconsistency of assets, such as the loss of asset status changes and status conflict between transactions. This study proposes a blockchain-native mechanism supporting complex physical assets, including a novel digital asset model and transaction validity guarantee protocol. Under the premise of ensuring safety and performance, the proposed mechanism can fully describe different associations and their influence on the transaction execution order. This study builds a global deterministic transaction execution sequence that can be executed in parallel to guarantee the consistency of complex digital assets based on partial orders. Theoretical analysis of the proposed mechanism demonstrates that it can guarantee digital asset consistency and can protect against attacks such as reentrant and transaction sequence attacks. Furthermore, experiments show that the proposed mechanism can achieve a transaction execution speed of up to 10,000 transactions per second, and this speed can be further increased by increasing the number of CPU cores.}

	abstract = {Given the increasing popularity of social media and other Internet-related technologies, individuals spend a lot of time across different online activities, such as doing Google searches or credit card purchases, enjoying social networks interactions, performing job finding or travel plannings activities. Unfortunately, very often, individuals unwittingly disseminate a huge amount of personal and sensitive information that fundamentally represents an essential part of their private life. A large part of this information is embedded into text messages typed during online activities. Therefore, there is an increasing need for mechanisms to assist individuals during such activities, raising their awareness about potential violation of privacy at the time of disclosure; however, it is also essential to give them full control on whether and how to manage their data, thereby empowering them to make heedful decisions. The awareness can be realized through simple alert/highlight mechanisms, while the full control can be ensured by allowing users to make the final choice, that is, ignore warnings, or conversely accept them and thus (a) think twice before disseminating data (to avoid future regrets), or (b) anyway send data, but only after their anonymization.}

	abstract = {Over the last years, several works have proposed highly accurate machine learning (ML) techniques for network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS), that are hardly used in production environments. In practice, current intrusion detection schemes cannot easily handle network traffic’s changing behavior over time, requiring frequent and complex model updates to be periodically performed. As a result, unfeasible amounts of labeled training data must be provided for model updates as time passes, making such proposals unfeasible for the real world. This paper proposes a new intrusion detection model based on stream learning with delayed model updates to make the model update task feasible with a twofold implementation. First, our model maintains the intrusion detection accuracy through a classification assessment approach, even with outdated underlying ML models. The classification with a reject option rationale also allows suppressing potential misclassifications caused by new network traffic behavior. Second, the rejected instances are stored for long periods and used for incremental model updates. As an insight, old rejected instances can be easily labeled through publicly available attack repositories without human assistance. Experiments conducted in a novel dataset containing a year of real network traffic with over 2.6 TB of data have shown that current techniques for intrusion detection cannot cope with the network traffic’s evolving behavior, significantly degrading their accuracy over time if no model updates are performed. In contrast, the proposed model can maintain its classification accuracy for long periods without model updates, even improving the false-positive rates by up to 12% while rejecting only 8% of the instances. If periodic model updates are conducted, our proposal can improve the detection accuracy by up to 6% while rejecting only 2% of network events. In addition, the proposed model can perform model updates without human assistance, waiting up to 3 months for the proper event label to be provided without impact on accuracy, while demanding only 3.2% of the computational time and 2% of new instances to be labeled as time passes, making model updates in NIDS a feasible task.}

However, despite the attention that research on FL has drawn, the concept still lacks broad adoption in practice. One of the key reasons is the great challenge to implement FL systems that simultaneously achieve fairness, integrity, and privacy preservation for all participating clients. To contribute to solving this issue, our paper suggests a FL system that incorporates blockchain technology, local differential privacy, and zero-knowledge proofs. Our implementation of a proof-of-concept with multiple linear regressions illustrates that these state-of-the-art technologies can be combined to a FL system that aligns economic incentives, trust, and confidentiality requirements in a scalable and transparent system.}

	abstract = {In modern days, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) are being extensively used in various fields like military, healtcare, security, government sectors, supervision, home delivery agents, etc. They significantly enhance the potential of IoT devices by processing their data. However, issues like efficient trajectory planning, security and privacy protection, task scheduling, a delegation of tasks from one UAV to another in multi-UAV systems, etc., require rigorous research and analysis. In this paper, we consider a multi-UAV multi-IoT network, which is divided into certain hexagonal cells. Each cell consists of some IoT devices and a UAV to process the data those IoT devices collect from the environment. IoT devices in each cell are grouped into clusters so that UAVs hover only above cluster heads and midpoints of cell boundaries to collect and delegate tasks whenever required. Provision of both single and multi-hop task delegation exists in our system. The schedule is formed based on the UAV’s next intended arrival time as computed by cluster heads in the cell using the Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model. Timestamps of visiting midpoints of cell boundaries are fitted between predicted next arrival times of visiting cluster heads. Energy consumption and time of transition from one hovering point to another can be optimized. However, the most energy-efficient solution may not necessarily be the most delay efficient. A multi-objective optimization technique is applied to identify the Pareto-optimal front and select the best possible solution. Simulation results show that compared to other trajectory planning algorithms viz. Dijkstra’s and HEA, our proposed technique saves much more energy (approx 78% over the other two) and time (42% over the other two).}

	abstract = {In this work, we provide a Machine Learning framework for augmenting the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) protocol with fine-grained dynamic traffic classification. The framework is called L-DiffServ. It is composed of two classification algorithms able to detect the QoS classes of incoming packets only looking at three packet header fields; the first algorithm, referred to as Inter-L-DiffServ, is a semi-supervised classification procedure able to replicate DiffServ classification; the second one, referred to as Intra-L-DiffServ, is an unsupervised algorithm for intra-class classification, useful for classes taking large portions of the overall traffic. We apply the latter to the low priority best-effort class. The performance evaluation shows that our solution is able to dynamically classify packets and to detect new QoS sub-classes hence adapting to traffic aggregate characteristics. We also show that network resource management can be improved exploiting the new generated QoS sub-classes: two active queue management algorithms based on WRED and CHOKe show a reduction of the number of sessions affected by packet losses up to 40% with respect to the legacy DiffServ procedure.}

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging approach to serve diverse demands of network services by decoupling network functions and dedicated network devices. Traffic needs to traverse through a sequence of software-based Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a preset order, which is named as Service Function Chain (SFC). Since network operators usually deploy the same type of VNFs in different locations in NFV-enabled networks. How to steer a SFC request to an appropriate path in substrate networks to meet service demands becomes an important issue, which is typically known as SFC mapping. However, the existing research works on SFC mapping often assume that service chain graphs are given in advance. They do not consider VNF interdependency and traffic volume change, which are both theoretically challenging for NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework. To this end, we study the joint optimization of Service Chain Graph Design and Mapping (SCGDM) in NFV-enabled networks. Our objective is to minimize the maximum link load factor to improve the performance of network system. We first formulate the SCGDM problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, and prove that it is an NP-hard problem by reduction from a classical Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem. Further, we develop an approximation algorithm using randomized rounding method and analyze the approximation performance. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduce the maximum link load factor.}

The existing algorithms, e.g. decision-tree-based or hash-based, achieve fast packet classification at the sacrifice of the rule updating or vice versa. We propose the Dynamic Adaptive Tuple (DynamicTuple) for both fast packet classification and rule updating simultaneously. DynamicTuple builds a performance model of tuple based packet classification and exploits dynamic programming to find the appropriate tuple formulation to minimize the lookup time. When the rules keep updating, DynamicTuple can retain the proper tuples and rebuild the improper tuples, thus the tuple in DynamicTuple is dynamic adaptive. The experimental results demonstrate that DynamicTuple achieves 33.1x, 5.6x, 5.7x classification speed and 2.9x, 11.0x, 8.5x updating speed compared to Tuple Space Search, TupleMerge, PartitionSort. By implementing DynamicTuple, the OpenFlow table of Open vSwitch achieves 26.6x classification speed.}

With the rollouts of provider-managed WiFi networks that are more structured and operate under authenticated regimes, WiFi offloading, or use of available (roadside) WiFi networks for V2I data communication, has different opportunities and challenges. To study the current landscape,we develop a system (X-Fi), which efficiently selects, associates to, authenticates with, and performs WiFi offloading for V2I communication with these networks, and a tool (X-Perf), which illustrates opportunities of WiFi offloading available today in these networks, with measurements and experiments across four metro areas across three continents over 22 months. Our results indicate the feasibility of achieving 1 GB/hour application goodput, an order of magnitude higher than the number provided by open WiFi networks in the past, which can take a significant load away from alternative communication paths for V2I systems. Moreover, we provide several implications on transport protocols and WiFi deployments to shed light on the use of such WiFi networks for V2I communication.}

	abstract = {Monitoring air quality plays a critical role in the sustainable development of developing regions where the air is severely polluted. Air quality monitoring systems based on static monitors often do not provide information about the area each monitor represents or represent only small areas. In addition, they have high deployment costs that reflect the efforts needed to ensure sufficient quality of measurements. Meanwhile, the mobile air quality monitoring system, such as the one in this work, shows the feasibility of solving those challenges. The system includes environmental sensors mounted on buses that move along their routes, broadening the monitoring areas. In such a system, we introduce a new optimization problem named opportunistic sensing that aims to find (1) optimal buses to place the sensors and (2) the optimal monitoring timing to maximize the number of monitored critical regions. We investigate the optimization problem in two scenarios: simplified and general bus routes. Initially, we mathematically formulate the targeted problem and prove its NP-hardness. Then, we propose a polynomial-time\n1\n2\n-,\ne\n−\n1\n2\ne\n−\n1\n-approximation algorithm for the problem with the simplified, general routes, respectively. To show the proposed algorithms’ effectiveness, we have evaluated it on the real data of real bus routes in Hanoi, Vietnam. The evaluation results show that the former algorithm guarantees an average performance ratio of 72.68%, while the latter algorithm achieves the ratio of 63.87%. Notably, when the sensors can be on (e.g., enough energy) during the whole route, the\ne\n−\n1\n2\ne\n−\n1\n-approximation algorithm achieves the approximation ratio of\n(\n1\n−\n1\ne\n)\n. Such ratio, which is almost twice as\ne\n−\n1\n2\ne\n−\n1\n, enlarges the average performance ratio to 78.42%.}

	abstract = {Network malicious traffic detection is one of the essential tasks of computer networks, which has become an obstacle to network development as networks are expanding in size and complexity. Current works generally investigate a variety of features, while most of them suffer from high characteristic design cost, difficult feature selection, and poor real-time performance, etc. More seriously, data imbalance makes models hard to train, resulting in the low detection rate of abnormal samples. In this paper, we propose a multi-level feature fusion model (MFFusion) that combines data timing, byte, and statistical features to extract valid information from multiple perspectives, to obtain a more efficient and robust model. To deal with the problem of data imbalance, we propose the adaptive balance training method (ABT) and design a new loss function called Attention Loss. Experiments show that ABT can stabilize the training process, reduce the training time, and improve the model performance; Attention Loss adjusts the weights of samples adaptively, which improves the detection rate of abnormal samples. MFFusion has achieved the excellent performance of detection rate and false alarm rate on a series of real network datasets, outperforming other state of art works. We also apply MFFusion to IoT network anomaly detection with the latest IoT malicious traffic dataset IoT23. Experiments show that MFFusion is versatile, and it is suitable for network anomaly detection in the IoT environment, whose performance has reached the application level.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for synthesizing wireless network protocols in IoT and Wireless Sensor Networks with low-complexity transceivers. Wireless medium access control (MAC) behavior is first formulated as a Multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MAMDP), and then solved using distributed Reinforcement Learning as a temporal difference MDP solution method. Since the proposed learning approach is distributed, it allows network nodes to independently learn optimal MAC-layer transmission strategies for maximizing network throughput. It is shown that by learning with limited network information from up to two-hop neighborhoods, the proposed paradigm can offer network throughput that is comparable with the known benchmark obtained from the ALOHA family of protocols. It is also demonstrated that unlike with ALOHA, the proposed RL based MAC layer can adjust its transmission strategies such that the maximum throughout can be sustained at higher and heterogenous traffic load conditions. Another distinctive feature of the proposed mechanism is that the wireless bandwidth can be shared more equitably than the benchmark ALOHA, especially in the presence of load and topological heterogeneities. The mechanism is also able to change nodes’ access priorities parametrically while learning, which can be useful for sensing applications with heterogeneous wireless bandwidth needs. Finally, the online MAC learning abilities are shown to be able to adjust nodes’ transmission policies on the fly in a dynamic network traffic environment.}
