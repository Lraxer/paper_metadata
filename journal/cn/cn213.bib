	abstract = {The advent of virtualization-based infrastructure needed for 5G brought new challenges in utilizing the existing physical network infrastructure effectively. Designing physical routes between virtual network functions in a multi-cloud environment is usually handled as a maximum flow problem, separately considering latency requirements. This paper presents an algorithm designed for low latency edge-cloud environments, where results meet both bandwidth and latency requirements of the planned traffic in one step. The proposed algorithm is much faster compared to the wide-spread linear program based flow maximization approach as the incorporated filtering of route candidates by latency allows more efficient search. The paper demonstrates the operation of the algorithm by a detailed example.}

	abstract = {Multi-access computing (MEC) represents an effective technology to satisfy low-latency demands by capacitating the execution of data-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks at the edge of mobile networks. While recent studies have investigated cost-awareness regarding where to execute service tasks and how to schedule user requests to edge servers, most have primarily leveraged deep reinforcement learning or concentrated on less-complicated assumptions. In this paper, we design an online algorithm for joint service placement and request scheduling in MEC networks, subjected to multi-dimensional constraints, aiming to minimize the operational cost. However, the problem is non-trivial since it involves time-correlated service placement cost and future information. Our proposed online algorithm employs the online learning technique and rounding method to address these challenges, consisting of the following basic modules: (1) a regularization approach to decouple the offline cost-minimization problem into multiple convex sub-problems, each to be efficiently solved in each time slot; (2) a rounding method to transform an optimal fractional solution of the convex sub-problem into an integer solution of the original cost-minimization problem, with provable the performance guarantee. Our analytical results and simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm.}

	abstract = {Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is one of the most popular and fits access control methods for the Internet of Things (IoT). Yet, despite its popularity, just a few works address the attribute management and retrieval challenges that ABAC carries when applied to IoT. ABAC builds access policies using attributes, and most of the attributes needed for a policy evaluation in a massive and mobile IoT scenario come from an external source. As a result, the policy decision point must send an across-the-network attribute request for each policy evaluation, impacting ABAC latency and performance. Deploying attribute caches over the network can mitigate this problem, thus reducing the latency to get the needed attributes. However, due to attributes dynamic nature, the cost of keeping those caches refreshed increases for each new replica stored. Since the refreshment cost may get out of hand for massive and mobile IoT scenarios, this article presents a method to increase the performance of attribute caches without a considerable cost. The proposed method considers the mobility pattern of IoT devices and predicts where an attribute request will occur. Then, the new method proactively places the attributes closer to the subsequent access request, avoiding unnecessary caching. This approach enhances the tradeoff between the cost of creating a new replica and the benefits to the ABAC performance. Moreover, we characterize an actual authorization application running into the campus, and we use its logs to evaluate the method through trace-driven simulations. Evaluation results show our new approach can reduce up to 80% in the number of hops to achieve the attributes in the caches at negligible refreshment cost.}

	abstract = {The emergence of new uplink (UL) intensive applications, coupled with the ambitious vision of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), will soon unleash unprecedented increases in UL wireless data traffic. However, current network designs are mainly concerned with optimizing the downlink (DL) performance, hence cannot give full play to UL communications. Exacerbated by high path-loss and low UL to DL duration ratio in the 5G new radio time division duplex (TDD-NR) spectrum, the UL capacity is much smaller than that of the DL one. To overcome such a problem, a DLâ€“UL decoupled access (DUDe) approach has been proposed, in which the users are allowed to connect to different base-stations (BSs) at different frequency bands in each link direction. Moreover, DUDe can be an add-on to many 5G (and beyond) technologies, such as millimeter-wave communication, multi-connectivity, device-to-device (D2D) communication, cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication, and mobile edge computing (MEC). However, despite the apparent consensus on its advantages, the realization of DUDe in 5G networks is in its infancy and still requires more efforts from both academia and industry. This survey provides a holistic overview on the DUDe approach, including operating bands DUDe (i.e. supplementary UL) and serving BS DUDe, reviews its fundamentals and explores potential use-cases. Other 5G UL coverage enhancement technologies, such as UL carrier aggregation, evolved universal terrestrial radio access-new radio (EUTRA-NR) dual connectivity (EN-DC), and UL Tx Switching are also compared with DUDe. Lastly, cutting edge research works in this area are summarized along with a discussion on the potential challenges and open research problems.}

This paper is among the first to study fast yet resource-efficient UAV transitions for aerial group communications while maintaining high group communication performance. We develop a set of novel analytic and algorithmic results to form the efficient transition formation (ETF) algorithm, in order to deal with different UAV transition scenarios in a group communication environment. The ETF algorithm first evaluates the seamlessness of a straight-line trajectory (SLT) by processing low-complexity computations (e.g., Euclidean distances) or fast checks with controlled traffic overheads. For a non-seamless SLT, the ETF algorithmm establishes a new trajectory consisting of a minimal number of seamless straight lines that join at specially selected locations to control mobile UAVsâ€™ seamless travel distances. Our simulation studies quantify the performance gains that the ETF algorithm may achieve, outperforming compared studies by admitting 66% more traffic with reduced energy consumption and guaranteed communication performance for both transitional and non-transitional UAVs.}

	abstract = {Relaying that can be classified as fixed or mobile is an effective technique to improve the throughput and reliability and also to extend the coverage in wireless networks. Compared with the conventional fixed relaying, mobile relaying has attracted great interest recently, because of the the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) having high mobility, low cost and deployment flexibility properties. Thus, in this study, mobile relaying technique in which the relay nodes are mounted on the fixed wing UAVs is considered. Due to the increasing energy consumption costs, environmental reasons, low lifetime of the mobile devices and limited on-board energy of the UAVs, energy-efficient communication is an important topic for the future wireless network design. Therefore, energy-efficient communication is examined for the UAV-enabled Decode-and-Forward (DF) mobile relay networks in this paper. Energy-efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated as the ratio of the total data rate to the total energy consumption by considering the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users. As the formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex, it is hard to solve in this form. Thus, we decompose it into two subproblems as user-scheduling and power allocation and propose to solve each subproblem separately to overcome the complexity of the problem. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is shown by performing extensive simulations for various system parameters.}

	abstract = {In many areas, such as electrical power distribution, industry or the financial sector, time synchronization of devices in their local network is important. The high requirements for synchronization accuracy are often met by the widely used Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which up to now communicates in an unsecured manner. Attacks on the time protocol can lead to high economic damages, for which reason security is becoming more and more important. The current PTP standard IEEE Std 1588-2019 therefore defines initial security mechanisms to potentially enable checking of the authenticity and integrity of PTP messages. However, distribution and application of these security parameters are not part of the specification, and thus no viable protection exists in PTP so far. In this article, we describe our emerging NTS4PTP protocol, which is under development in cooperation with the IEEE Security Subcommittee to address this problem. It is a practical solution for an automated distribution of these security parameters using a key management system that follows the principle of the immediate security processing in PTP. NTS4PTP bases on the recently released Network Time Security (NTS) protocol and provides basic features for PTP such as group management and parameters updating. In addition, our protocol supports all common PTP modes (e.g., multicast, unicast, 802.3) and can be used in combination with the NTS-secured Network Time Protocol (NTP). Here, we step into the most important details of our protocol, describe the advantages and disadvantages and discuss the security requirements and challenges. The work on NTS4PTP is also available with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an Internet draft and a proof-of-concept implementation is already under development.}

The landing of astronauts and their sojourn on the Martian surface will impose the presence in situ of some basic supporting infrastructures. Recent research by NASA highlighted the urgent necessity of providing efficient and readily-available wireless connection on the Martian surface, as well as long-haul connection to Earth. Thus, to fulfill the former, the objective of this paper is to study and assess a flexible 6G-based 3D network solution for mobile connectivity on Mars. 6G is going to provide guaranteed Quality-of-Service (QoS) for heterogeneous applications, while optimizing the use of the network resources. The Radio Access Network (RAN) of such an infrastructure will be fully softwarized together with the Next Generation Core (NGC). 6G 3D networks will employ drones, small satellites and orbiters due to the reduced distances between them, which can support low-latency wireless links. Moreover, rovers, landers and humans are regarded as end users of the system. An in-depth analysis regarding trade-offs to be accounted, when selecting a specific orbital altitude is detailed. Intensive end-to-end (E2E) emulation trials in OpenAirInterface (OAI) environment is carried out to test the feasibility of the whole network. The performance is evaluated by means of metrics such as E2E delay, packet loss and throughput. Finally, computational complexity and memory usage is estimated for each node of the proposed architecture.}

	abstract = {In-Network caching is one of the most prominent features of Information-Centric Networks (ICN). This feature, designed to reduce the content delivery time, can improve data availability, especially during the sleeping mode of the original data producer. However, the fact that caching mechanism is simultaneously performed with data forwarding, limited processing power, and limited memory capacity of routers has posed challenges in fully profiting from this feature. The synchronization of caching mechanism with data forwarding limits the speed of decision-making in content placement policies. These challenges as well as the limitations of ICN routers have not been taken into consideration by the existing strategies for content placement of IoT data. In this paper, the restrictions for content placement policies in ICN-based IoT are outlined, and a data prioritization-based approach that prevents ICN nodes from filling their Content Store (CS) with inappropriate and inferior data is proposed to improve cache efficiency. Besides, fog computing is used as a middle layer between IoT devices and ICN networks to resolve the speed limits of decision-making and improve cache performance. In the fog layer, prioritization is performed based on the popularity and freshness of data object, and, thus, low-priority data are removed from the caching mechanism of ICN nodes. As the result shows the total number of cached data is reduced. Freshness is an essential property of multiple IoT data that significantly affects caching performance. That's why we prioritized data based on popularity and freshness. Eventually, the simulation results performed by the NDNsim simulator show that decreasing the number of data objects could improve the cache mechanism efficiency in terms of both delay and hit ratio.}

	abstract = {Granular traffic classification categorizes traffic into detailed classes like application names and services. Application names represent parent applications, such as Facebook, while application services are the individual actions within the parent application, such as Facebook-comment. These granular classes are still insufficient to keep pace with modern applications that offer various services. Accordingly, this paper further divides the application service class into inter-application and intra-application services to provide more insights. Inter-application service refers to a similar service between different parent applications, such as Facebook-comment and Youtube-comment, whereas intra-application service differentiates services within the same parent application, such as Facebook-comment and Facebook-post. Most studies focus on classification at the application name and inter-application service levels. In contrast, classification at the intra-application service level receives far less attention due to its complexity despite providing the highest flexibility. Therefore, this paper presents GRAIN, a granular multi-label approach to classify encrypted traffic at all three levels of granular classification: application name, inter-application and intra-application service levels using a classifier chain. GRAIN chains two random forest classifiers to produce a multi-label classification using seven novel statistical features based on packet payload length. The utilized features are independent of the packet payload content, thus unaffected by packet encryption and preserving user privacy. Our performance evaluation showed that GRAIN achieved an average F-measure of 99% at the application name level, 93% at the inter-application service level and 88% at the intra-application service level. To test for robustness, we compared GRAIN against four baseline classifiers and the ISCX VPN-nonVPN public dataset in which GRAIN maintained its comparable performance across all tests.}

One of these challenges is the development of new routing protocols specially designed for VANETs. In this paper, we present a novel game-theoretical approach of a multimetric geographical routing protocol for VANETs to forward video-reporting messages in smart cities. Game theory is considered a very interesting theoretical framework to analyze and optimize resource allocation problems in digital communication scenarios. Our contribution has shown to enhance the overall performance of VANETs in urban scenarios, in terms of percentage of packet losses, average end-to-end packet delay and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).}

	abstract = {Because of the popularity of mobile devices, crowdsensing has emerged as a data sensing paradigm for collecting large-scale data. Blockchain technology is promising to address problems of privacy and trust existing in centralized crowdsensing systems. However, it is challenging for crowdsensing applications to use a public blockchain to collect real-time or large-scale data since current blockchain systems lack of scalability. We propose a crowdsensing scheme that combines Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) with a public blockchain, achieving high efficiency with guarantees of privacy and trust. The scheme is a layer-two blockchain solution that supports off-chain multi-round sensing-data evaluations inside TEE enclaves, so that the sensing data needs not be propagated over the blockchain network. Besides, the scheme prevents false-reporting and free-riding for workers and requesters without reliance on a trusted third party. Moreover, the scheme secures the sensing data, letting only the worker and the corresponding requester know the data. Evaluations of our experimental prototype demonstrate the efficiency of our designs, as well as the reasonable on-chain monetary cost of running a taskâ€™s smart contract and performing token payments using Ethereum.}

While demand-aware networks may be significantly more efficient than demand-oblivious networks, frequent adjustments are still costly. Furthermore, a centralized controller of such networks may become a bottleneck. We present CBNet (Counting-Based self-adjusting Network), a demand-aware network that relies on a distributed control plane supporting concurrent adjustments, while significantly reducing the number of reconfigurations. CBNet comes with formal guarantees and is based on concepts of self-adjusting data structures.

This has been possible by the separation of concern principle, for which the network functionalities are organized as a stack of layers, each providing some communication functionalities through specific network protocols. In this survey, we aim at highlighting the impossibility of adapting the classical Internet protocol stack to the Quantum Internet, due to the marvels of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the design of the Quantum Internet requires a major paradigm shift of the whole protocol stack for harnessing the peculiarities of quantum entanglement and quantum information. In this context, we first overview the relevant literature about Quantum Internet protocol stack. Then, stemming from this, we sheds the light on the open problems and required efforts toward the design of an effective and complete Quantum Internet protocol stack. To the best of authorsâ€™ knowledge, a survey of this type is the first of its own. What emerges from this analysis is that the Quantum Internet, though still in its infancy, is a disruptive technology whose design requires an inter-disciplinary effort at the border between quantum physics, computer and telecommunications engineering.}

These IoT devices will mostly use cellular networks for transferring a huge amount of IoT data to the cloud for machine learning (ML) based forecasting. Keeping in view a large number of application scenarios for highly resource constraint IoT devices connected with the cellular networks, we propose a value-added IoT service (VAIS) for the cellular network operators based on the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Through simulation experiments, we show, for real air quality data and specific ML models, the proposed VAIS reduces the backhaul data by\n70\nÃ—\nand requires less energy than its equivalent cloud-based conventional approach, however, with a slight increase in communication time. From the insights we gained, we believe that a properly designed VAIS would efficiently utilize network resources, not only reduce management for IoT users but also the operating costs for cellular operators, and encourage IoT applications on limited backhaul cellular networks.}

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks provides the enabling environment for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Hence, the vast proliferation of 5G-enabled IoT devices and services led to an overwhelming growth of data traffic that could saturate the core networkâ€™s backhaul links. Nowadays, caching is an unavoidable technique to solve this issue, whereby popular contents are stored on edge nodes near to end-users. There exist several initiatives to motivate caching actors for improving the caching process, but not designed for the real-world competitive caching market. In this work, we propose an incentive caching strategy in a 5G-enabled IoT network by considering a completely competitive caching scenario with multiple 5G mobile network operators (MNOs) and multiple content providers (CPs). The MNOs manage a set of edge caches on their base stations and they are competing to fill these caching resources, while the CPs detain a set of popular contents and are in conflict to rent the MNOsâ€™ caches. Each MNO aims to maximize its monetary profit and offload its backhaul links, as each CP aims to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of its end-users. Then, we formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game to model the interaction between MNOs and CPs and define the different playersâ€™ utilities. Subsequently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the convex optimization method to investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, the numerical results of the different experimentations demonstrate that our game-based incentive strategy can significantly alleviate the backhaul links while improving the user QoE.}

	abstract = {Reliable emergency message (EM) transmission in vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs) necessitates an effective routing scheme. Position-based routing is considered more suitable for VANETs for not having to maintain any routing table or sharing connection states with neighbors. However, position-based routing is challenging in VANETs because vehicles change their positions instantly, and the next-hop can often go out of the communication range in greedy forwarding mode. This unstable behavior of the next-hop triggers route redundancy and leads to a high end-to-end delay (ED) and lower packet delivery ratio (PDR). Moreover, routing decisions based on a next-hop (relay) vehicle may be less optimal if we do not consider the stability and predict the position of a next-hop vehicle in such dynamic environments. To that end, we propose a position-based reliable emergency message routing (REMR) scheme based on our mobility metrics, which exploits the vehicle moving behaviors to enhance EM delivery. We describe how the choice of next-hop in greedy forwarding can be enhanced by leveraging neighborâ€™s future location information. By taking into account the Euclidean distance and position information, REMR predicts the relative positions of neighbor vehicles to exclude unstable neighbors from the list of candidate next-hops. In addition, REMR employs the vehiclesâ€™ movement information (e.g., position, speed variation, and moving angle) to minimize a possible link disruption and to choose an optimal next-hop for robust routing of EMs. REMR also offers a beaconing control strategy to enhance message reliability and to deal with the problem of beacons congestion. To minimize beacons congestion, REMR adjusts the beacon interval based on the neighborhood density. By consolidating mobility metrics and beacon control strategy, REMR can respond adequately to variation in the network traffic and frequent topology changes as validated by our simulation results.}

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that offers flexible network management. Although the decoupling of the control plane and data plane provides network programmability for SDN, it also makes SDN become vulnerable to several attacks. The saturation attack is one of these attacks. It is a concealed attack that has a highly negative impact by overwhelming the SDN controller. Once the SDN controller is crashed, the network cannot work. Currently, the cusp catastrophe theory has already been used for detecting saturation attack against SDN controller. When using the cusp catastrophe theory to detect saturation attack in SDN, most instances will be identified as unstable instances. The additional detection of unstable instances is achieved using the distance between current state and previous state, leading to the low detection accuracy. To overcome that issues, in this work, we propose LICENSE, a saturation attack detection mechanism designed based on confusable instance analysis. More specifically, a Condition Transferring Mechanism (CTM) method is designed to first classify the input instances into two kinds, the unconfusable instance that clearly belongs to attack or benign instance and the confusable instance which is not easy to distinguish. Then a Network State Base Cusp model is proposed to further distinguish the confusable instance to stable instance and unstable instance. At last, a method recorded as Unstable Instance Detection (UID) is proposed for identifying unstable instances. The evaluation results demonstrate that LICENSE can reduce the number of unstable instances and improve the detection accuracy of unstable instances, thus achieving a higher overall detection performance. In conclusion, LICENSE can effectively detect saturation attack in SDN.}

	abstract = {Protecting privacy in Location-based services (LBSs) has been one of the major concerns over the last few years. Usersâ€™ queries can reveal sensitive information to LBSs, thus giving an opportunity for the adversaries to track the querying user. Existing location privacy protection mechanisms either use a trusted third party (TTP) or a location obfuscation-based scheme. TTP-based schemes require users to report their location-related information to the TTP before sending a query to the location-based service provider (LSP). Once the TTP is compromised, usersâ€™ privacy can be breached. On the other hand, location obfuscation schemes achieve privacy at the cost of accuracy. We address these problems by proposing a collaborative caching-based privacy-preserving scheme for LBSs. The scheme prevents the usersâ€™ location information leakage from untrusted communication channels as well as LSP while maintaining the quality of service. The scheme uses a novel dummy location generation technique and a virtual identity mechanism to improve usersâ€™ location and identity privacy. Furthermore, one-time spatial groups are created with the nearby neighbors to access the localized services, thus providing less interaction with the untrusted LSP. The proposed work has the potential to preserve usersâ€™ location privacy and reduce the computation and communication costs of the system. The aforementioned claims are verified by the experimental results.}

	abstract = {With the growing popularity of immersive interaction applications, e.g., industrial teleoperation and remote-surgery, the service demand of communication network is switching from packet delivery to remote control-based communication. The Tactile Internet (TI) is a promising paradigm of remote control-based wireless communication service, which enables tactile users to perceive, manipulate, or control real and virtual objects in perceived real-time. To support TI, the ultra-reliable and low latency communication service is required. However, the multi-tactile to multi-teleoperator interactive property, in-network computing demand, ordered service function chaining (SFC) requirement, as well as other features of TI, challenge the ultra-low latency provisioning. This paper studies the joint wireless resource allocation and SFC routing and scheduling problem for end-to-end delay reduction. We first formulate the problem as an end-to-end delay minimization problem constrained to SFC and wireless resource. Then, a distributed and cooperative scheme, which consists of the minâ€“max (MM) wireless resource allocation algorithm and the delay-aware scheduling (DAS) of SFC algorithm, thus called MM-DAS, is proposed to address the problem. In MM-DAS, we use the MM algorithm for uplink/downlink communication at wireless edges, while DAS is proposed to solve the virtual network function (VNF) mapping and scheduling at the wireless core, for achieving the goal of providing low end-to-end delay to tactileâ€“teleoperator pairs. The simulation results have illustrated the efficiency of the proposal for low end-to-end delay performance provisioning in TI environments.}

	abstract = {The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh profile, standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), has an increasing interest in IoT solutions. However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the destination. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24 %.}

Thus, necessitating the requirement to assess the NIDPS performance in terms of various parameters such as resource consumption, packet processing, packet drop rate, throughput, and latency. In this study, we scrutinized three Open-Source Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) Snort (both variants: single-threaded and multi-threaded), Suricata, and Zeek; while, using similar performance parameters normally used to evaluate commercial IDPS solutions. Such a comprehensive performance review has not been considered in the prior works. We considered typical NIDPS deployment in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and conducted system assessment by using variations of various factors such as packet capturing modules, detection engine algorithms, packet size, and ruleset size.

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) plays an important role in digital era due to its applicability in a wide range of applications such as military, smart city, healthcare, etc. Since the nodes in WSN experience power constraints and function via wireless connections, network survivability becomes a major design issue. Energy efficiency and secure data transmission are the most important solutions to be accomplished to enhance WSN survivability. The recent phenomena like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and metaheuristics can be involved in designing effective routing protocols. With this motivation, the current research paper presents a novel Trust Aware Oppositional Sine Cosine-based Multihop Routing (TAOSC-MHR) protocol to improve the survivability of WSNs. The major goal of the proposed TAOSC-MHR protocol is to increase the network's survivability by assuring trust and energy efficiency. Primarily, a weighted clustering scheme is applied to partition the network into clusters after which the Cluster Heads (CHs) are selected. Besides, TAOSC-MHR protocol involves an optimal route selection technique i.e., Oppositional Based Learning (OBL) concept with Sine Cosine Optimization (SCO) algorithm. In order to derive the optimal routes in WSN, the proposed TAOSC-MHR protocol derives an objective function with the inclusion of three parameters namely, residual energy, distance, and trust level of nodes. The design of trust aware routing protocol using OBL with SCO algorithm demonstrates the novelty of the study. A wide range of simulation analyses was conducted under different network scenarios and the obtained results signify the promising performance of the proposed technique over other techniques.}

	abstract = {Advancement in Internet has led to the creation of a digital community in which everything is connected and is accessible remotely. However, such advancement comes with many problems as traditional networks have become more complex and harder to configure according to predefined policies. Named Software-Defined Network (NSDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networks. It is gaining interest because it promises to control and manage networks more simply and efficiently than traditional networks. NSDN is considered the adoption of Named Data Network (NDN) and Software Defined Network (SDN). Named Data Network (NDN) is a great platform to overcome the traditional Internet addressing limitations. Instead of IP addresses, content names are used to communicate between various nodes in NDN. On other hand, the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) is an emerging new application of the Internet of Things (IoT) that is getting popularity because it promises to extend network connectivity to a large extent. IoV relies on the broadcast pattern to exchange useful information with a specific range of vehicles. However, this exchange of information often leads to many problems in terms of security and duplication of packets. This article proposes an efficient scheme to address problems related to the routing (broadcast storm and isolated network) of Named Software-Defined Internet of Vehicle (NSDIoV). Moreover, a Timing Attack problem is also addressed in this article. This article proposes a novel scheme named Interest Broadcasting and Timing Attack in IoV (IBTA-IoV). The first part of the proposed scheme addresses the Timing Attack issue while the second part of the proposed scheme tackles the Interest packets broadcasting and isolated network problem. IBTA-IoV is compared with native Vehicular Named Data Network (VNDN), IBFS, and IBFS with the attacker. The evaluation results show that the proposed solution in this article is simple, efficient, and provides high performance in terms of variable traffic scenarios.}

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of Internet of Things (IoT) has made the management of computer networks more troublesome. The softwarized control provided by Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is not sufficient to overcome the problems raising in this context. An increasing number of attacks can, in fact, occur in SDN-aware IoT networks if the security configuration enforced on the SDN switches is manually computed and not formally verified. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a novel methodology which leverages Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories (MaxSMT) to automatically compute a formally correct and optimized allocation scheme and configuration of SDN switches by refining security policies, user-defined or derived from detected attacks. This mechanism is compliant with the main characteristics of virtualized IoT-based networks, such as the simultaneous presence of numerous interconnected devices and strict latency requirements. The feasibility and the performance of the framework developed to implement this methodology have been validated in a realistic use case.}

	abstract = {The advancement of Internet of Things based technologies in healthcare monitoring systems has evolved a new terminology, named Internet of Medical Things for medical services and devices. It is integrated with cloud-fog computing environment to facilitate load balancing solutions and enhance the quality of service using message exchange protocols. However, challenges for the quality parameters such as energy consumption, latency, resource utilization, scalability and packet loss associated with the existing architectural models are still of a great concern for researchers. This paper presents an energy efficient fuzzy data offloading scheme with a four tier cloud-fog architectural design to improve the quality parameters. The proposed Message Queuing Telemetry Transfer protocol based message exchange mechanism encapsulates the payload area of messages with client-ID and timestamp to provide authentication and ordering in packet transmission. Fuzzy logic based categorization of medical data has been used to classify it as emergency data, significant data and general data. Clustering of fog nodes has been done based on CPU speed and remaining energy. An adaptive scheduling technique has been proposed which considers the memory value for assigning the weight to different classified queues. The proposed scheme is evaluated and validated using iFogSim toolkit. The performance analysis shows maximum of 77% reduction in energy consumption, 48%, 60% and 44% reduction in end to end delay for different Quality of Services QoS 0, QoS 1, and QoS 2, respectively compared to other existing schemes.}
