	abstract = {In spite of the performance that existing approaches for drone collaborative planning have demonstrated, there is still a need for new solutions which are capable of effectively identifying the right tasks for the right drones at the right times while maximizing the total benefits obtained from the drones’ actions. These new solutions should be particularly tested within the context of intelligent transportation systems to assess their impact on mobility and traffic flow. In order to address these issues, we present in this paper a new a five-step solution for drone collaborative planning. Our solution uses a Multi-Agent System as well as a Firefly Algorithm solution to enable drones jointly neutralize ongoing events by considering trust factors and cost/benefit analysis. The solution, which is also capable of issuing appropriate warnings to vehicles to prevent them from incurring any undesirable/dangerous impact due to ongoing events, is using a reward-driven competition to encourage drones to join collaborating teams. Our simulations are showing promising results in terms of processing time, energy consumption, and total reward obtained compared to two other planning approaches relaying on random and priority-based selection of the next locations that drones will visit respectively.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting (WF) attack stands opposite against privacy protection in using the Internet, even when the content details are encrypted, such as Tor networks. Whilst existing difficulty in the preparation of many training samples, we study a more realistic problem — few-shot website fingerprinting attack where only a few training samples per website are available. We introduce a novel Transfer Learning Fingerprinting Attack (TLFA) that can transfer knowledge from the labeled training data of websites disjoint and independent to the target websites. Specifically, TLFA trains a stronger embedding model with the training data collected from non-target websites, which is then leveraged in a task-agnostic manner with a task-specific classifier model fine-tuned on a small set of labeled training data from target websites. We conduct expensive experiments to validate the superiority of our TLFA over the state-of-the-art methods in both closed-world and open-world attacking scenarios, at the absence and presence of strong defense.}

	abstract = {Vehicular networks are expected to support many time-critical services requiring huge amounts of computation resources with very low delay. However, such requirements may not be fully met by vehicle on-board devices due to their limited processing and storage capabilities. The solution provided by 5G is the application of the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm, which represents a low-latency alternative to remote clouds. Accordingly, we envision a multi-layer job-offloading scheme based on three levels, i.e., the Vehicular Domain, the MEC Domain and Backhaul Network Domain. In such a view, jobs can be offloaded from the Vehicular Domain to the MEC Domain, and even further offloaded between MEC Servers for load balancing purposes. We also propose a framework based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model the interactions among stakeholders working at the three different layers. Such a MDP model allows a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to take optimal decisions on both the number of jobs to offload between MEC Servers, and on the amount of computing power to allocate to each job. An extensive numerical analysis is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with static policies not applying RL.}

	abstract = {Most attacks on the Internet are progressive attacks and exploit multiple nodes. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) cannot detect the original attack node, making it difficult to block the attack at its source. This paper focuses on using IDS’ alerts corresponding to abnormal traffic to correlate attacks detected by the IDS, reconstruct multi-step attack scenarios and discover attack chains. Due to many false positives in the information provided by IDS, accurate reconstruction of the attack scenario and extraction of the most critical attack chain is challenging. Therefore, we propose a method to reconstruct multi-step attack scenarios in the network based on multiple information fusion of attack time, risk assessment and attack node information. First, we propose a Convolution and Agent Decision Tree Network (CTnet), a convolutional neural network that evaluates the attacks detected by the IDS and gives an alert with an attack risk assessment. Then, we reconstruct the weighted attack scenario by applying Graph-based Fusion Module (GM) on the captured attacks’ risk assessment and time information. Finally, we extract the high-risk attack chain by Depth First Search with Time and Weight (TW-DFS) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct multi-step attack scenarios and trace them back to the original host. It can help administrators to deploy security measures more effectively to ensure the overall security of the network.}

In this work, we exploit the trend of multiple chipsets integrated in the same mobile device to study a set of non-mmwave input data that can be leveraged jointly to provide faster beam search and better data rate. We leverage these findings to introduce SLASH, an algorithm that adaptively narrows the sector search space and accelerates link establishment, link maintenance and handover between mm-wave devices. We experimentally evaluate SLASH with commodity hardware, including a 60 GHz testbed, commercial sub-6 GHz WiFi APs and smartphones. SLASH can increase the median data rate by more than 22% for link establishment and 25% for link maintenance with respect to prior work.}

In this work, we present a novel HPC network which employs distributed FOS interconnecting by removing ES (Firefly). In Firefly, Dragonfly topology is adopted for the inter-group connection of blades, while the intra-group connection of blades is implemented by FOS with fast optical flow control. The Firefly exploits the wavelength, space, and time switching domain with nanoseconds reconfiguration time of the FOS to achieve efficient statistical multiplexing operation. We numerically investigate the Firefly performance with real HPC traffic traces collected by running multiple computing applications in MareNostrum 3 HPC infrastructure with Leaf-Spine architecture. Compared with Leaf Spine architecture, results show that Firefly performs 62.4%, 54%, 68.6%, and 71.8% less latency for the applications Conjugate Gradient (CG), Multi-Grid (MG), Multiple Instruction Lattice Computation (MILC), and Miniature Molecular Dynamics (MINI_MD), respectively. Moreover, Firefly can save 56.4% cost and 65.7% power consumption, respectively, with respect to Leaf-Spine when both support around 10,000 blades.}

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing is a new computing paradigm that offers cloud computation capabilities at the edge of the mobile network. Due to the proximity to Mobile Users (MUs), the edge cloud can be accessed with low latency by resource-limited mobile devices with the aim of extending their capabilities through computation offloading. Despite its unique features, the efficiency of offloading is highly influenced by the purchasing power of MUs as well as the competition arisen to access both limited communication and computation resources. However, since the MUs’ demands for these resources change dynamically, the pricing approaches should be capable of adapting in real-world scenarios. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a game-based distributed scheme to jointly and dynamically allocate and price resources required for proper offloading in a two-tier NOMA-based mobile system. To this end, we consider the incentives of both the edge provider and MUs as well as conflicts arising from their interactions. Under the proposed scheme, MUs should pay not only based on the given resources but also based on their transmission power level as a punishment for their produced interference. We formulate the interactions among the monopolist edge provider and MUs using the Stackelberg game. Further, the power allocation in NOMA and the competition of MUs over computation resources are modeled using game theory and shown admitting the potential and the weakly coupled constraint game, respectively. Furthermore, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of both corresponding games and calculate it for both the edge provider and MUs. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of the utility of MUs and the edge provider, average allocated communication and computation resources, optimal pricing, and the number of rejected MUs under different purchasing power.}

	abstract = {With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, millimeter-wave (mm wave) bands are a favorable technology to support high data rate communication. The IEEE 802.15.3c standard is an attractive candidate for millimeter-wave carrier frequencies for short-range indoor applications. Providing a detailed analytical model of the medium access control (MAC) layer gives prominent information to improve network performance. In this paper, a novel comprehensive analytical model based on the two-dimensional Markov chain for hybrid MAC of IEEE 802.15.3c standard has been proposed. The M/G/1 and M/D/1 queue have been considered for the unsaturated region of the Channel Time Allocation Period (CTAP) and Regular Contention Access Period (RCAP)area. One of the main contributions of this paper is extracting mathematical equations from the novel model. Extracting mathematical equations provides a methodology for analyzing the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of the IEEE802.15.3c MAC standard. The most essential analytical parameters are queue size, waiting time, queue saturation boundary and system instability, as considered clearly in this paper. In addition, the throughput calculation is put forth for the RCAP and CTAP areas. OPNET simulation validates our represented analytical model. In this paper, our proposed model is shown much more accurately than other articles.}

	abstract = {Limited battery and computing resources of mobile devices (MDs) induce performance limitations in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Computational offloading has the capability to provide computing and storage resources to MDs for resource-intensive tasks execution. Therefore, to minimize energy consumption and service delay, MDs offload the resource-intensive tasks to nearby mobile edge server (MES) for execution . However, due to time varying network conditions and limited computing resources at MES also, the offloading decision taken by MDs may not achieve the lowest cost. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient and faster deep learning based offloading technique (EFDOT) to minimize the overall cost of MDs. We formulate a cost function which considers the energy consumption and service delay of MDs, radio resources, energy consumption and delay due to task partitioning, and computing resources of the MDs and MESs. Due to high computational overhead of this comprehensive cost function, we generate a training dataset to train a deep neural network (DNN) in order to make the decision making process faster. The proposed work finds the optimal number of components, task partitioning, and fine-grained offloading policy simultaneously. We formulate the fine-grained offloading decision problem in MEC as multi-label classification problem and propose EFDOT to minimize the computation and offloading overhead. The simulation results show high accuracy of the DNN and high performance of EFDOT in terms of energy consumption, service delay, and battery life.}

After the convenient anonymization, aggregation, and agreement, the set of websites users visit may result in exploitable data for ISPs. Uses cover from assessing the scope of advertising campaigns to reinforcing user fidelity among other marketing approaches, as well as security issues. However, sniffers based on HTTP, DNS, TLS or flow features do not suffice for this task. Modern websites are designed for preloading and prefetching some contents in addition to embedding banners, social networks’ links, images, and scripts from other websites. This self-triggered traffic makes it confusing to assess which websites users visited on purpose. Moreover, DNS caches prevent some queries of actively visited websites to be even sent. On this limited input, we propose to handle such domains as words and the sequences of domains as documents. This way, it is possible to identify the visited websites by translating this problem to a text classification context and applying the most promising techniques of the natural language processing and neural networks fields. After applying different representation methods such as TF–IDF, Word2vec, Doc2vec, and custom neural networks in diverse scenarios and with several datasets, we can state websites visited on purpose with accuracy figures over 90%, with peaks close to 100%, being processes that are fully automated and free of any human parametrization.}

	abstract = {Through placing computation, storage, and communications facilities near the data source, Edge Computing (EC) is anticipated to extend the intelligence from the central cloud to the network edge. The Quality of Experience (QoE) of user and energy efficiency of mobile device could be significantly improved through offloading their computation-intensive tasks to the network edge. With the increasing popularity of intelligent devices, tasks offloaded to the edge are becoming more complex, consisting of multiple sub-tasks with data dependency, which are typically modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The scheduling of DAG tasks is more complex, which has been proved to be NP-hard. Traditional DAG scheduling algorithms developed in non-edge computing scenarios could not be directly applied due to their neglect of: (1) the competition of communication resources; and (2) the rescheduling requirement in case of edge server failure in dynamic edge network environment. In this backdrop, this paper presents a failure-resilient DAG task scheduling algorithm to minimize the response delay experienced by the tasks. After formulating the DAG task scheduling problem, a context-aware greedy task scheduling (CaGTS) algorithm is proposed. Then, to cope with the failure event of edge server, a dependency-aware task rescheduling (DaTR) algorithm is designed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, extensive experiments have been conducted on a simulator developed using Python. Experimental results with diverse parameter settings have shown that CaGTS could reduce at least 10.47% average completion time than benchmarks, and DaTR can effectively avoid task scheduling interruption caused by server failure events.}

	abstract = {Software Defined Network is an emerging paradigm in computer networks. The separation of the control plane from the forwarding plane in this arrangement has different aspects. This splitting provides many advantages like easy manageability and configuration. Along with benefits, various issues specific to this paradigm also arise. Routing management in such a paradigm deals with diverse concerns, objectives, and parameters before selecting the best route. Reinforcement Learning has already proven its strength in distinct fields like business, industry automation, gaming, algorithms, etc. Even routing in a network can also be made efficient using concepts defined in reinforcement learning. In this paper, routing within a controller's area is modeled, keeping scalability in mind; and an optimal solution is provided using learning. Both proactive and reactive approaches are used for flow installation, and the link load is utilized optimally. The area under a particular controller is efficiently routed, and it tweaks the network. Q-learning model helps to learn the optimal path and provide the best route in case of a failure. Once the learning completes, the model works on it. Preliminary evaluation depicts that improvement of 78%, 58%, and 47 % is achieved for the number of messages generation when compared with other already exiting solutions for routing in Software Defined Networks.}

	abstract = {Since faults unavoidably occur in communication networks, it is important to quickly and accurately localize the faults to ensure the stability, consistency and reliability of communication networks. Most existing works are focused on probe selection for fault diagnosis in the deterministic environment (DE). However, the information about communication networks in real applications is not deterministic due to disturbance, noise and so on, especially large scale networks. Therefore, it is urgent to solve the problem of localizing faults for communication networks in the non-deterministic environment (NDE). In this paper, we propose a probabilistic probe selection (PRPS) algorithm for network fault diagnosis in the NDE. Combining the probability language and node coverage, we use the probabilistic greedy probe selection approach to select the probes for fault detection with less probing cost to cover all network nodes in the NDE. When one or more faults are detected in the network, the probabilistic min search probe selection approach will be triggered to localize the faults. This approach uses min search method to select probes that pass through the minimum number of suspicious nodes and the maximum sum of coverage of suspicious nodes. In order to improve the ability to resist the uncertain factors, this approach updates the node state sets for multiple iterations according to the states of identified nodes. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to compare our PRPS algorithm with the existing works and evaluate the performance on various network topologies with different parameters. The simulation results show that PRPS algorithm has satisfactory fault localization accuracy, low probing cost and strong adaptability to resist the uncertain factors in the NDE.}

	abstract = {The development of the space–air–ground integration has put higher demands on satellite network. It needs to support high-bandwidth, large-capacity and various quality of service guarantees. However, the satellite onboard switching is facing the problem of resource constraints and special requirements of hardware complexity and scheduling efficiency. For this, this paper proposes a novel memory architecture for high-bandwidth onboard switching fabric. To reduce hardware complexity, multiplexer is used in the input side to merge\nk\ninput ports into one internal bus, while the output demultiplexer splits an internal bus into\nk\noutput links. Shared memory architecture is adopted in the input module to improve the memory efficiency, and a buffered crossbar is used to interconnect the input modules to the output modules. A discrete-time queuing model is formulated, and an iterative approach is used to quantitatively analyze the performance of the proposed architecture. The throughput and delay are calculated under different switch size, input load, and buffer capacity. The numerical results can serve as a guidance on deciding the required buffer size and appropriate speedup ratio. This work is validated by both simulations and FPGA implementations. Synthesize result show that using the state-of-the-art Xilinx VU13P FPGA, a switching fabric with 48 ports can be implemented and the peak throughput of the proposed architecture can reach 480 Gbps. Compared with existing combined input-crosspoint queuing, the proposed architecture can significantly reduce the packet delay and the memory resource cost.}

	abstract = {The distributed Software-Defined Networking (SDN) approach has been adopted to address the scalability issue linked to the use of a single SDN controller, particularly in large-scale networks. However, this method gives rise to a new challenge of uneven load balance on the distributed SDN controller. Several studies tried to solve this issue but they have focused only on balancing the load when an overload occurs and have not achieved the load balance continuously. In this paper, we propose the multiple threshold load balance (MTLB) switch migration scheme to achieve continuous load balancing among the controllers. This approach classifies the load into several gradual levels that represents the basis for the switch migration when the load of a controller differs from others, which lead the threshold value to be dynamically adjusted. Moreover, our scheme reduces the overhead of unwanted update operations among the controllers by adopting the controller load status as an indicator for disseminating the load information. We implement our scheme using the Floodlight controller and Mininet emulator. The experimental results show that our scheme has better comprehensive performance than the other schemes in terms of response time, control overhead, and throughput rate.}

	abstract = {5G technology is called to support the next generation of wireless communications and realize the “Internet of Everything” through its mMTC (massive Machine-Type-Communications) service. The recently standardized 5G-AKA protocol is intended to deal with security and privacy issues detected in earlier generations. Nevertheless, several 5G-AKA shortcomings have been reported, including a possibly excessive computational complexity for many IoT devices. To address these, a promising lightweight 2-pass authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol for 5G mobile communications has recently been proposed by Braeken. Compared to the 5G-AKA protocol, this does not require the use of public key encryption. This paper analyzes the security claims of Braeken’s protocol and shows that it does not provide full unlinkability, but only session unlinkability, and is (still) subject to Linkability of AKA Failure Messages (LFM) attacks. We propose solutions to such problems and prove that symmetric-key based protocols cannot offer higher privacy protection levels without compromising availability. We then describe an enhanced version of this protocol that addresses these vulnerabilities and supports forward secrecy, which is a desirable feature for low-cost IoT devices.}

	abstract = {Group authentication enables a set of users to mutually authenticate each other without the help of a coordinating manager, which has proven effective for the new framework of cloud-to-things computing. Recently many group authentication schemes have been proposed using threshold secret sharing technique. In this article we review these schemes and show that some of group authentication schemes based on secret sharing are insecure. Specifically we develop an impersonation attack against such schemes. This attack allows an outsider with no credential to successfully authenticate herself to a group of users. The idea behind our attack is quite simple: in the threshold setting, when the size of the group is larger than the threshold an outsider can compute a linear combination of honest users’ tokens which validates her identity though she is actually not a registered member in the group. Finally we propose three types of security enhancement to fix the vulnerability. Our improved group authentication schemes avoid the above attack by breaking the linearity of threshold secret sharing, using the technique of signature, splitting communication and commitment scheme.}

	abstract = {The high density of solar energy makes outdoor application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) possible. In recent years, some advanced technologies have emerged in solar WSNs. However, there are still some problems: (1) existing energy prediction algorithms are difficult to deploy in scenarios with many small nodes in different locations; (2) how and when to adjust network topology. To solve the two problems, this paper proposes a solar WSN adaptation framework (SWAF). SWAF includes the proposed shadow judgment method (SJM) based on geographic and geometric theories and the solar-aware routing strategy (SAR) based on integer programming. SJM is a key adaptation algorithm that facilitates the integration of existing prediction techniques and enables the solar WSN to be deployed in practice. SAR is modeled with the goal of reducing node mortality. The AKS-based algorithm is introduced to cope with the expansion of network scales. Experimental results show that SJM can improve the accuracy by 20%-50%. The further introduction of SAR can prolong network lifetime by 12%-35%.}

	abstract = {The widespread deployment of 5G wireless networks has brought about a radical change in the nature of mobile data consumption. It requires the deployment of Long Term Evolution to the unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) to alleviate the shortage of available licensed spectrum while Wi-Fi is the most dominant radio access technology in the unlicensed spectrum. This has led to suggestions concerning the coexistence of multi radio access technologies such as Wi-Fi and LTE-U. Clearly, Software Defined Networks (SDN) can utilize the LTE-U radio bandwidth efficiently. The SDN paradigm decouples the network’s control logic from the underlying routers and switches, which promotes centralization of network control. The controller placement problem is crucial to SouthBound interface optimization and involves the location of the controllers, their number and the assignment function of switches to controllers. In this paper, a novel strategy is presented to address the wireless controller placement problem, which improves the throughput, link failure probability and the transparency on the SouthBound interface in cases where hybrid providers choose either LTE-U or Wi-Fi as link layer technologies. The problem of determining the placement of LTE-U and Wi-Fi based controllers is modeled and two heuristic solutions are proposed. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms provide a fast and efficient solution.}

One very promising use of mmWave communication is in wireless backhaul, which has also been investigated by 3GPP as part of an integrated access and backhaul study. Unfortunately, the network performance is hard to predict due to the sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockages, which can result in frequent communication outages. In this paper, we consider wireless backhaul links deployed along the side of a road, which have been widely proposed both in urban environments and on highways. We first investigate the inherent robustness of an interference-free topology for roadside mmWave backhaul. Based on a novel four-type blockage model, we apply stochastic geometry to derive blockage probabilities as a function of the topology parameters and obstacle density, which yields insights that lead to a more robust topology. We then present mechanisms to tolerate any blockages that do occur through reconfiguration. Through extensive simulations, the performance of our proposed algorithms are evaluated for different road scenarios and network topologies. Results show that our algorithms not only achieve high throughputs close to the no-blockage case for mmWave backhaul, but also provide high blockage tolerance rates even in the presence of multiple obstacles along the road.}

	abstract = {Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) introduce ad-hoc networking into the context of flying nodes, allowing real-time communication between these nodes and ground control stations. Due to the nature of this kind of node, the structure of a FANET is dynamic, changing very often. Since it has applications in military scenarios and other mission-critical systems, an agile and reliable network is essential with robust and efficient routing protocols. Nonetheless, maintaining an acceptable network delay generated by the selection of routes remains a considerable challenge, owing to the nodes’ high mobility. This article addresses this problem by proposing a routing scheme based on an improved Q-Learning algorithm to reduce network delay in scenarios with high-mobility, called Q-FANET. This proposal has its performance evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art methods using the WSNET simulator. The experiments provide evidence that the Q-FANET presents lower delay, a minor increase in packet delivery ratio, and significant lower jitter compared with other reinforcement learning-based routing protocols.}

	abstract = {With the assistance of global view in software-defined networks (SDNs), some switch nodes can be selected for traffic monitoring, which ensures the security of SDNs with a minimum cost. However, identifying the flow-based smallest subset of switches with the maximum coverage for node selection is always an NP-hard problem. To address this challenge, a two-stage parameter-rectifying-based selection (TSPRS) scheme is presented for efficient traffic monitoring in SDNs. In this novel scheme, a multi-timescale and multi-centrality layered virtual network (MMLVN) model is first built according to the different network structures over various time periods. By virtue of the MMLVN model, a tensor-based eigenvector multi-centrality computing (TEMC) method is employed at the first-stage selection to identify the smallest subset of switches with the maximum coverage for obtaining the subset of primary core nodes. To obtain more accurate parameters of real-time flows, a modified MMLVN model is further built by combining the results of a bandwidth cost-effective polling (BCeP) algorithm and the first-stage selection. Then, based on the modified MMLVN model, the TEMC method is reused to obtain the final optimization subset of the core nodes for efficient traffic monitoring at the second-stage selection. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a desirable tradeoff between the monitoring overhead and accuracy, and also reduce the communication bandwidth cost, which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {With the development of cloud computing, more and more enterprises and institutes have deployed important computing tasks and data into virtualization environments. Virtualization security has become very important for cloud computing. When an attacker controls a victim’s virtual machine, he (or she) may launch malware for malicious purpose in that virtual machine. To defend against malware attacks in the cloud, many virtualization-based approaches are proposed. However, the existing methods suffer from limitations in terms of transparency and performance cost. To address these issues, we propose MDCHD, a novel malware detection solution for virtualization environments. This method first utilizes the Intel Processor Trace (IPT) mechanism to collect the run-time control flow information of the target program. Then, it converts the control flow information into color images. By doing so, we can utilize a CNN-based deep learning method to identify malware from the images. To improve the performance of our detection mechanism, we leverage Lamport’s ring buffer algorithm. In this way, the control flow information collector and security checker can work concurrently. The evaluation shows that our approach can achieve acceptable detection accuracy with a minimal performance cost.}

Unlike previous works studying 5G in early deployments, we focus on fully deployed 5G networks that already serve massive numbers of users, and in particular, we perform controlled experiments to analyze TCP and multipath TCP (MPTCP) performances and behaviors over 5G. Our results show that 5G faces a dilemma in maintaining in-network buffer for TCP traffic: on one hand, TCP packets are less likely to accumulate within the network, thanks to the high data rate of 5G radio; but on the other hand, with TCP performance highly sensitive to signal quality, when signal becomes poor abruptly in mobile environment, the in-network buffer easily overflows, leading to packet loss bursts. We also confirm that employing MPTCP can aggregate capacities on 5G and 4G paths, but under the current deployment model where 5G and 4G base stations co-locate and share the same core network, MPTCP does not necessarily enhance communication reliability. In addition to active measurement experiments, we leverage a speedtest service to evaluate commercial 5G from a nationwide perspective. By exploiting over\n13\nk\ncrowdsourced speedtest results reported from 197 cities in China, we find that there exist considerable regional differences on 5G performances across the nation, and with the 4G co-locating deployment model, the 5G networks in some populous metropolitan areas have inferior performances.

	abstract = {The graph stream has recently arisen in many interactive scenarios. Characterizing with large volume and high dynamic, graph streams are known to be difficult for high-speed summary and analysis, especially provided with limited resource availability. Existing solutions mainly use sketch-based methods to estimate the weight of items (e.g., Count-Min Sketch) and preserve the underlying graph structure information (e.g., TCM). Unfortunately, these solutions neither support complex graph-based queries nor achieve efficient real-time queries. In view of these limitations, we design DMatrix, a novel 3-dimensional graph sketch to facilitate fast and accurate queries in graph stream. Both structural query and weight-based estimation are supported with DMatrix. Through the integration of representative key reservation and majority voting, DMatrix can effectively narrow the error bounds of queries with real-time response efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that our solution is superior in accuracy and efficiency comparing with the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {There are several key challenges in performing cache-based attacks on ARM-based devices. Lipp et al. introduced various techniques to tackle these challenges and applied successfully different cache-based attacks on ARM-based mobile devices. In the cache-based attacks proposed by Lipp et al. it is assumed that the attacker has access to the mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses through/proc/self/pagemap which is an important limiting factor in Linux and newer versions of Android operating systems. To access this mapping, the attacker must know the root of the operating system. In this paper, we introduce an Evict+Reload attack on the T-table-based implementation of AES which applies to ARM-based devices in which root access is required to use the mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses. The attack consists of two phases. The profiling is a preprocessing phase to profile all the timing characteristics when AES is executed with a known key. In this phase, the attacker can identify specific bits of the physical addresses of the AES T-table elements without having root access. In the exploitation phase, full key bytes are retrieved by a conventional Evict+Reload attack. To verify the theoretical model of our technique, we implemented the described attack on AES.}

	abstract = {Side channel attacks exploit physical information that leaks from a cryptographic device, for example power, to extract secret information, such as secret keys. While such attacks are effective for small keys with 8 or 16 bits, they are not viable in practice, however, where keys are much larger, such as 128 bits in AES 128 or more. In order to scale these attacks, some form of divide-and-conquer strategy is typically used, where the attacker divides the key into subkeys and attempts to recover the subkeys separately and then combines them to form the key. In this paper we address two problems that render divide-and-conquer based attacks largely ineffective in practice: First, the power leakage models are inaccurate because of the noise caused by computation involving the remaining portion of the key. We show how better leakage models can improve the accuracy of the resulting leakage models. Second, naïvely combining the recovered subkeys during the attack phase is ineffective, as errors in the subkey recoveries compound. We show how leakage models from other stages of the cryptographic computation can be leveraged to validate (we call this “reinforce”) the choice of recovered subkeys. Experiments using AES 128 leakage data show that (1) leakage models that use the entire key are far superior over subkey-based models, (2) that reinforcement of subkey selection through validation with leakage in a single additional round of the encryption process is both efficient and highly effective (performance improvements up to 240% in key recovery rate in some cases), and (3) the benefits of using more than one additional round are negligible. This work is paving the way towards the study of data-driven system identification techniques to be applied in side-channel attacks.}

	abstract = {Convergence of multiple access technologies is one of the key enablers in providing diverse set of services to the Fifth Generation (5G) users. Though 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5G standard defines a common core supporting multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs), Radio Access Network (RAN) level decisions are taken separately across individual RATs as the existing 5G architecture lacks a unified control and management framework for a multi-RAT network. A unified access network is likely to utilize RAN resources more efficiently and provide an improved performance. In order to achieve a unified Multi-RAT RAN, we supplement the existing 3GPP 5G RAN architecture with OpenFlow. We refer to the proposed architecture as 5G-Flow. The proposed architecture can be viewed as a step towards further evolution of mobile networks beyond 5G. With minimal changes in the 3GPP 5G RAN and none in the core network, we are able to realize a unified and integrated multi-access 5G-Flow RAN. We simplify the existing 5G RAN by replacing RAN nodes with OpenFlow switches and a software-defined controller. The proposed architecture also allows us to completely decouple User Equipment’s (UE’s) communication with Core Network (CN) from its communication with RAN enabling a UE to use any RAT to connect to any CN (say, use 5G New Radio access to connect to 4G CN, which is not possible in the 3GPP architecture) or to directly connect to Internet from RAN without going via the CN. We have developed an evaluation platform to compare the performance of our proposal with the standard 3GPP architecture. Results demonstrate significant gains in the network performance of 5G-Flow RAN over the existing 3GPP 5G network.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in many application domains like battlefield surveillance, wildlife monitoring, disaster response, medical care, transportation, industry, smart home, smart cities, etc. However, this network is susceptible to various types of attacks due to its special features like sensing, intelligence, large scale, self-configuring, connectivity, heterogeneity, open and dynamic environment. It is significant to ensure security in the IoT network. In the scalable and dynamic IoT environment, conventional security mechanisms such as cryptography techniques, key management, intrusion detection system, anomaly detection, etc cannot be applicable, because it consumes more energy. Therefore, the IoT network requires a lightweight security mechanism for reliable and secure data transmission. A trust-based security solution solves many security-related problems. The proposed RFTrust model provides a trust-based lightweight solution for ensuring security in the IoT network. It is primarily designed to address the sinkhole attack in Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy networks (RPL) based IoT environments. It enhances the trusted routing in the IoT environment by finding and removing sinkhole nodes in the network. The proposed model uses Random Forest (RF) and Subjective Logic (SL) to improve the network performance by identifying sinkhole attack. The mathematical analysis shows the applicability of the proposed model. The merits of the proposed work are highlighted by comparing performance with the existing similar protocols in terms of delivery ratio, throughput, average delay, energy consumption, false-positive rate, false-negative rate, and detection accuracy.}

	abstract = {In this study, we consider the point coverage problem and aim to locate heterogeneous sensor networks under target uncertainty. Target location uncertainty phenomenon is commonly seen in some fields such as military and security, where only probabilistic information regarding target location is usually available via intelligence, historical data, and expert opinions. In these circumstances, possible scenarios are usually generated and several courses of action are developed to address these scenarios. Taking into account this real-life phenomenon as well as the realistic constraints associated with it, we firstly develop an integer nonlinear program for locating a heterogeneous sensor network with hub-spoke topology for a given target scenario. In this topology, wireless sensors constitute the lower level network, while the hubs constitute the upper level by collecting data from the sensors and fusioning the transmitted detection data. Secondly, we propose a linear approximation for the nonlinear model which provides computational efficiency for solving large size problem instances. Then, utilizing the p-robustness concept, we develop a robust counterpart of the deterministic formulation which accounts for multiple scenarios simultaneously and generates a compromise solution that ensures a predefined threshold for regret percentages of individual scenarios. For the first time in the point coverage literature, we define the heterogeneous sensor network location problem within target location uncertainty concept and propose an efficient robust optimization approach for solving it. Finally, we present an illustrative case study to show the applicability of the proposed robust solution approach.}

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems have been widely used for the inventory management and asset tracking in hospital industry. Although the total cost of an RFID system relies mostly on the number of readers, existing RFID network planning (RNP) techniques focused on single-port readers. This paper introduces a swarm intelligence RFID network planning model with multi-antenna readers (named RNP-MAR) to efficiently track medical assets in hospital environments. Our motivation is to utilize multi-port RFID readers, in order to minimize the total cost of the RFID network, and simultaneously maximizing the network coverage. To achieve this purpose, we consider three reader types with one, two, and four antenna ports. Moreover, different antenna models with different coverage characteristics are utilized to be allocated on the different ports of RFID readers. The aim of the RNP-MAR is not only to determine the optimal placements of the RFID readers in the hospital plan, but also to design the multi-antenna readers and their antennas. To efficiently solve the RNP-MAR model, a combined global-local linear-nonlinear metaheuristic based on whale optimization algorithm and simulated annealing (named WOA-SA) is presented. The multi-objective function of the WOA-SA is to maximize the network coverage, while minimizing the total cost, interference, collision, and power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides 39.57% saving (on average) in the total cost of the RFID network through efficiently utilizing multi-antenna RFID readers.}
