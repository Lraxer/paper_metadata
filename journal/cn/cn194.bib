	abstract = {The Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) has been recently funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF)’s Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program. The AERPAW platform will enable experiments with programmable radios and programmable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conducted in a safe and repeatable manner. Several architectural components are crucial for enabling the envisioned capabilities of the testbed. In this paper, after providing a high level overview of AERPAW, we first present the emulation design of AERPAW vehicles. Subsequently, we describe various different options for wireless channel emulation in AERPAW. We start with a generalized model for wireless emulation, and expand that model to packet-level emulation, I-Q level emulation, and radio-frequency (RF)-level emulation. A discussion on the trade-offs among these various different emulation possibilities is also provided.}

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks is seen as a key enabler to support the introduction of digital technologies in multiple sectors, empowering different verticals and enabling new business models. Thanks to native capabilities of 5G networks, especially network slicing, edge computing and multi-tenancy, highly integrated telecom infrastructures with end-to-end flexibility will be realized to lower the barriers for creating 5G-ready applications that are able to satisfy business and user necessities. In this context, the MATILDA Project has established a holistic framework that unifies the development, deployment and operation for this new kind of applications. Since Edge Computing is not natively supported by 4G, in order to anticipate the technological improvements foreseen with the advent of 5G, as well as to smoothen the transition to the new technology, this paper describes the design of the end-point between the mobile and edge environments that has been integrated in the MATILDA telecom layer platform. Such end-point, designed in a Virtual Network Function (VNF), allows intercepting and forwarding data and control traffic towards external Data Networks. Instances of this VNF can be horizontally scaled according to a decision policy, which determines the minimum number of instances required for the current load. Results show that the latency ascribable to the VNF processing is sufficiently low to satisfy the delay budget for all 5G use-cases up to 10 ms and that a QCI-based decision policy allows scaling with the traffic load, while still fulfilling the performance requirements of each application.}

	abstract = {The goal of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is to build agile and service-aware networks by building a new paradigm of provisioning network services where physical network functions are deployed as Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). Due to the advantages of NFV, 5G networks have adopted NFV as one of its key enabling technologies. One of the most important challenges for realizing NFV-enable 5G Networks is VNF placing and routing. However, most existing studies neglected flow rate fluctuation of service requests, which could cause service migration and fluctuation of queues (buffers) in the networks. In this paper, we study the cost-minimizing problem of VNF placing and routing in this dynamic environment while considering service migration and queue backlog stability. We first formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem. Then we propose an online algorithm, named MACRO, to solve the problem. In order to bound the worst-case delay encountered by requests we propose WEB-MACRO. MACRO and WEB-MACRO base on Lyapunov optimization and make decisions without knowing future information. The theoretical analysis suggests that MACRO and WEB-MACRO achieve an optimality gap of\nO\n(\n1\nV\n)\n, where\nV\nis a tunable parameter that controls the tradeoff between cost and backlogs. In addition, the queue backlogs maintained by MACRO are bounded by\nO\n(\nV\n)\nand the queue backlogs maintained by WEB-MACRO are upper bounded which accordingly bounds the worst-case delay encountered by service requests. The experiment results suggest that MACRO and WEB-MACRO achieve queue stability and reduce the total cost by 36.49% when\nV\n=\n2\nand 45.84% when\nV\n=\n6\n, compared with the state-of-the-art method.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection system (IDS) protects the target network from the threats of data breaches and the insecurity of people’s privacy. However, most of existing researches on network intrusion detection cannot fulfil effectively the protection of targets, especially, depending heavily on the statistical features that are manually designed with domain experts’ knowledge and experiences, and failing to address the few sample data problem. Network traffic has a hierarchical structure, i.e., byte-packet-flow, which is similar to phrase-sentence-article in an article. This paper proposes a hierarchical packet byte-based CNN, called PBCNN, where the first level extracts abstract features automatically from bytes in a packet in raw Pcap files, and then the second level further constructs the representation from packets in a flow or session, instead of using feature-ready CSV files, to make full use of original data information. Multiple convolution-pooling modules are cascaded with byte-friendly sizes of multiple filters, and one-layer TextCNN to obtain the representation of traffic flow, feeding the representation to 3 layers of fully connected networks for intrusion classification. PBCNN-based few shot learning is applied to improve the detection reliability of network attack categories with the few sample problem. Several experiments are performed and the results show that the evaluation metrics are superior to the existing researches in regard to CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets.}

Furthermore, they can also increase task performance and/or robustness. However, organizing a multi-UAV flight is not easy, involving challenges in terms of (i) swarm formation definition, (ii) takeoff procedure, (iii) in-flight coordination, (iv) communication between the swarm elements, (v) swarm layout reconfiguration, (vi) handling the loss of swarms elements, and (vii) controlled landing.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interconnected heterogeneous smart devices communicating without human intervention. A significant portion of existing IoT networks is under the umbrella of ad-hoc and quasi ad-hoc networks. Ad-hoc based IoT networks suffer from the lack of resource-rich network infrastructures that are able to perform heavyweight network management tasks using, e.g. machine learning-based Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) techniques. Designing light-weight NTMA techniques that do not need to be (re-) trained has received much attention due to the time complexity of the training phase. In this study, a novel pattern recognition method, called Trend-based Online Network Traffic Analysis (TONTA), is proposed for ad-hoc IoT networks to monitor network performance. The proposed method uses a statistical light-weight Trend Change Detection (TCD) method in an online manner. TONTA discovers predominant trends and recognizes abrupt or gradual time-series dataset changes to analyze the IoT network traffic. TONTA is then compared with RuLSIF as an offline benchmark TCD technique. The results show that TONTA detects approximately 60% less false positive alarms than RuLSIF.}

	abstract = {As the Intenert of Things (IoT) continues to evolve in our daily personal lives and in future industrial systems (industry 4.0), one of the most significant issues is security. IoT systems must overcome a number of challenges, including deficiency of resources, low power consumption, and the need to protect devices against cyber-attacks. Regrettably, issues about energy use and the lack of computing resources limit the cryptographic methods that can be implemented on these devices. Moreover, the conventional use of non-volatile memory for storing secret keys are vulnerable to a number of attacks like reverse-engineering, cold-boot, side channel, device tampering, etc. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are one of the categories for enhancing physical device security and solving issues involving with the use of traditional cryptographic algorithms. PUFs are associated as lightweight one-way functions used to extract a unique identity for each end-device, based on physical factors introduced during manufacturing which are unforeseeable and unclonable. PUFs are promising hardware security primitive and have seen a lot of attention in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a survey of a large range of PUF schemes proposed in the literature. Our comparison analysis of the surveyed schemes ends with a number of observations. Then we propose a new scheme of Arbiter PUF to create an identity for each IoT device. The proposed scheme is resistant to Machine Learning (ML) attacks. It is proven to avoid the shortcoming of several previously proposed related PUF-based authentication protocols.}

	abstract = {SDN improves the flexibility and programmability of the network. However, malicious attacks caused by potential vulnerabilities and backdoors can easily lead to data and rule tampering in the network. To address this problem, this paper proposes an endogenous secure SDN network framework based on multipath resilient routing (MRR). MRR includes multipath comparing forwarding, multipath weighted forwarding, and multipath random forwarding. The framework ensures the correctness of flow rules and data content by dynamically comparing the consistency of multi-heterogeneous path data within a certain period, and multipath can also achieve load balance by weighted forwarding. In the MRR framework, we also present an intermediate information feedback mechanism based on encryption authentication and give a mathematical model to evaluate it. This mechanism can accurately identify and dynamically repair malicious switches. Simulation evaluation and prototype system test show that this framework can achieve high accuracy of flow transmission and high availability of system. At the same time, multipath comparing forwarding will bring some performance costs such as delay, bandwidth, and jitter at initial and attacking time. However, when the appropriate forwarding mode and reasonable period T are selected, the proportion of delay introduced by comparing and ruling can be less than 10%, and the average bandwidth of mixed forwarding is almost the same as traditional multipaths', such as we can guarantee 25% multipath comparing forwarding when the bandwidth requirement is 250 M in prototype system.}

We first address the feasibility and practicality of IMSI Catchers using off-the-shelf Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) platforms and two open source frameworks — OpenAirInterface and srsLTE. Second, we evaluate the behavior of different mobile phone brands/modems, when they are under attack. Specifically, we performed experiments on 26 4G devices and four more recent ones also supporting 5G. In each experiment we performed two different attack types, and we tested the attacks when using/not using a radio-frequency jammer specifically designed for our purposes. Our tests show that the sheer majority of the devices under test (also the last ones 3GPP Release 15 compliant) surrender even without any jamming. Finally, we have verified that network deployments have no impact – we repeated tests on four different operator’s networks – and we also developed a portable IMSI Catcher using a Raspberry Pi4 so as to test the attacks over early 5G Non Stand-Alone deployments we could find in our cities.}

With this SFC framework, customer based dynamically applicable value added services can be provided without the need for manual operation that would require vast effort. In order to show the performance and scalability of the proposed framework, the solution is tested in a live telecom lab with varying number of subscribers and thread counts. The test results show that the proposed solution can successfully manage subscribers dynamically without packet loss for 2 million simultaneous subscribers’ traffic flows when the system is overloaded, regardless of hardware or vendor. In addition, it has been observed that the service chain rules can be applied in a very short period such as 2.9 s for 10,000 simultaneous subscriber SFC requests even in the loaded traffic flows, while the CPU consumption of virtual machines remained between 23.5% and 28.5%. These results have proved that the proposed solution can be used in large-scale telecom networks.}

	abstract = {Edge computing is projected to become the dominant form of cloud computing in the future because of the significant advantages it brings to both users (less latency, higher throughput) and telecom operators (less Internet traffic, more local management). However, to fully unlock its potential at scale, system designers and automated optimization systems alike will have to monitor closely the dynamics of both processing and communication facilities. Especially the latter is often neglected in current systems since network performance in cloud computing plays only a minor role. In this paper, we propose the architecture of MECPerf, which is a solution to collect network measurements in a live edge computing domain, to be collected for offline provisioning analysis and simulations, or to be provided in real-time for on-line system optimization. MECPerf has been validated in a realistic testbed funded by the European Commission (Fed4Fire+), and we describe here a summary of the results, which are fully available as open data and through a Python library to expedite their utilization. This is demonstrated via a use case involving the optimization of a system parameter for migrating clients in a federated edge computing system adopting the GSMA platform operator concept.}

	abstract = {Protection to optical network units (ONUs) against failure of their distribution fibers (DFs) in a long-reach passive optical network (LR-PON) is highly desirable to provide uninterrupted internet services to the users. In practical network scenarios, DFs form shared-risk link groups (SRLGs). The existing SRLG-aware protection schemes depend on residual bandwidth of ONUs. Therefore, they are cost-inefficient and also fail to satisfy high reliability requirements (RRs). We for the first time propose a nonresidual bandwidth based partial protection scheme and related architecture to provide partial protection to ONUs against a single SRLG failure. Following the proposed scheme, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP)-based optimization problem to provision backup DFs and network components for providing protection with the minimum protection cost. To meet the strict delay requirement for real-time applications, the proposed ILP model restricts the length of backup DFs to be employed to restore the traffic transmission. As the proposed ILP model becomes computationally intractable for large networks, we also propose a heuristic scheme that provides fairly close results to that of the ILP model. We assess the performance of the proposed partial protection scheme in terms of protection cost and total length of backup DFs (TLBDF). Through exhaustive simulation study we show that the proposed partial protection scheme not only satisfies high RRs but also requires much lower protection cost and TLBDF as compared to the existing SRLG-aware protection schemes.}

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are infrastructureless networks of tiny sensor motes which can sense from the environment and can transmit the sensed data through wireless communication. Generally, the transmission ranges of sensor nodes are limited and obstacles are present in the sensing area, so multi-hop communication by utilizing routing protocols is of utmost importance. Since the wireless transmission is prone to vulnerabilities such as eavesdropping and spoofing, monitoring the network traffic by secure points is a critical mission. In this paper, we propose breadth-first search tree (BFST) based vertex cover (VC) algorithms for routing and link monitoring in WSNs. BFST provides a shortest hop routing tree for WSNs and VC is a set of nodes for covering edges (communication links) of the network where it perfectly fits for network traffic monitoring. Unlike most existing algorithms which find minimal VC in a separate procedure, the proposed algorithms construct VC during the BFST establishment phase which leads to lower energy consumption for routing and link monitoring operations. We analyze the correctness proof of the algorithms along with the time, message, space, and bit complexities. We implement the proposed algorithms with their counterparts on a testbed of IRIS motes to evaluate their performances. We find through extensive evaluations from the IRIS testbed experiments and TinyOS simulations that the proposed algorithms find smaller VC sets with up to 3.1 times lower energy consumption than the existing distributed algorithms.}

	abstract = {Edge Computing (EC) is a promising concept to overcome some obstacles of traditional cloud data centers to support Internet of Things (IoT) applications, especially time-sensitive applications. However, EC faces some challenges, including the resource allocation for heterogeneous applications at a network edge composed of distributed and resource-restricted nodes. A relevant issue that needs to be addressed by a resource manager is the service placement problem, which is the decision-making process of determining where to place different services (or applications). A related issue of service placement is how to distribute workloads of an application placed on multiple locations. Hence, we jointly investigate the load distribution and placement of IoT applications to minimize Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations due to the limitations of EC resources and other conflicting objectives. In order to handle the computational complexity of the formulated problem, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm with the initial population based on random and heuristic solutions to obtain near-optimal solutions. Evaluation results show that our proposal outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of response deadline violation, as well as terms of other conflicting objectives, such as operational cost and service availability.}

	abstract = {Network failures can significantly degrade the network performance in several ways, ranging from experiencing unacceptable delays (e.g., in video conference applications) to leading to significant drops in sales for companies (e.g., airlines tickets purchases). In this paper, we focus on network failures caused by links that are prone to fail due to their advanced stage of lifetime. In particular, the formalization of the Hardware Deterioration Failure Mode (HDFM) for network line cards is provided to evaluate the penalty for network operators of handling HDFM failing links using classical methods based on Bidirectional Forwarding Detection and Fast Re-Route mechanisms. An algorithm, named Hardware Deterioration Detection (HDD), is proposed to detect if links are experiencing failures as well as to provide an estimation of their remaining lifetime. The performance evaluation over data generated by our provided network failure simulator shows that HDD is able to correctly classify links as failing or not failing, regardless of the type of failure considered. Moreover, overall descriptions for failure models in which HDD is able to produce high quality estimations of the remaining lifetime have been identified, with a trade-off between the hardware deterioration time dependence and the relationship between lifetime and packet loss probability.}

	abstract = {Despite the recency of their conception, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) constitute an extensively-researched machine learning sub-field for the creation of synthetic data through deep generative modeling. GANs have consequently been applied in a number of domains, most notably computer vision, in which they are typically used to generate or transform synthetic images. Given their relative ease of use, it is therefore natural that researchers in the field of networking (which has seen extensive application of deep learning methods) should take an interest in GAN-based approaches. The need for a comprehensive survey of such activity is therefore urgent. In this paper, we demonstrate how this branch of machine learning can benefit multiple aspects of computer and communication networks, including mobile networks, network analysis, internet of things, physical layer, and cybersecurity. In doing so, we shall provide a novel evaluation framework for comparing the performance of different models in non-image applications, applying this to a number of reference network datasets.}

	abstract = {Accurate measurement of network traffic is an essential part of current network management tasks. Traditional measurement methods based on counter and sketch respectively focus on the large flow detection and all flows queries, and the measurement accuracy is limited by the uncertainty in the large flow detection algorithm. Therefore, we design an asymmetric measurement architecture named DAP-Sketch. By using different data structures to measure large and small flows separately, DAP-Sketch provides the ability to query the approximate sizes of small flows while ensuring large flow detection. We propose a Deterministic Admission Policy (DAP) to dynamically distinguish the large and small flows, which effectively improves the accuracy of large flow detection and reduces the demand for storage resources. To improve the usability and universality of DAP, we put forward a d-Length DAP which applies local optimality instead of global optimality and makes our algorithm easy to implement. Furthermore, two optimization strategies with adaptive parameter adjustment are also designed in terms of the changes in memory space and traffic characteristics. Experimental results show that DAP-Sketch can outperform the best of the five typical measurement methods up to 59.3 times, decrease the requirements of network equipment resources, and achieve highly-precise and low-overhead network traffic measurement.}

	abstract = {Web is a primary and essential service to share information among users and organizations at present all over the world. Despite the current significance of such a kind of traffic on the Internet, the so-called Surface Web traffic has been estimated in just about 5% of the total. The rest of the volume of this type of traffic corresponds to the portion of the Web known as Deep Web. These contents are not accessible by usual search engines because they are authentication protected contents or pages only reachable through technologies denoted as darknets. To browse through darknet websites, special authorization or specific software and configurations are needed. TOR is one of the most used darknet nowadays, but there are several other alternatives such as I2P or Freenet, which offer different features for end users. In this work, we perform a connectivity analysis of the websites in the I2P network (named eepsites) aimed to discover if different patterns and relationships from those used in legacy webs are followed in I2P, as well as to get insights about the dimension and structure of this darknet. For that, a novel tool is specifically developed by the authors and deployed on a distributed scenario. Main results conclude the decentralized nature of the I2P network, where there is a structural part of interconnected eepsites while other several nodes are isolated probably due to their intermittent presence in the network.}

	abstract = {To satisfy various network requirements in the Internet of Things (IoT), software-defined networking (SDN) is viewed as an indispensable technology. Given the flow table resources in switches are limited, we proposed the periodic subflow-based proactive flow installation mechanism (PSPFIM) in our previous work. By separating subflows, PSPFIM can accurately detect the transmission periods and preinstall flow entry into switches before the transmissions arrive to reduce flow table occupancy. PSPFIM, however, is dysfunctional if transmission periods are at the millisecond level or subflows cannot be separated. In this paper, we propose the dynamic adjustment for PFIM (DAPFIM). DAPFIM is more widely applicable because the enhanced detection algorithm is less affected by noises and can detect transmission periods at the millisecond level. Besides, the adjustment algorithm can correct the error between an expected transmission period and a real transmission period. Through simulations, DAPFIM can detect transmission periods that cannot be detected by PSPFIM and other related work. Besides, DAPFIM averagely reduces up to 78% flow entry duration compared to other related work by changing the unit of the idle timeout from seconds to milliseconds, which saves much more flow table resources in switches.}

	abstract = {Multi-user concurrent communication has become an increasingly important issue in mobile computing. Emerging vibration-based communication provides a new multi-to-single (M2S) data communication model for face-to-face tasks as opposed to most existing device-to-device (D2D) communication technologies. However, the transmission of multiple concurrent vibration signals often results in a highly coupled received signal, which makes it very difficult to reconstruct the source signals. This paper proposes ViCom, a vibration-based communication system that performs parallel decoding to achieve M2S transmission between mobile devices. The core of ViCom is a Decomposition Transformation Diagonal Algorithm (DTDA) that decomposes the received signal and constructs an estimated set of source signals, which are first decoupled by an autocorrelation function and then diagonalized to further improve the signal reconstruction accuracy. We implement ViCom using vibration motors and accelerometers embedded in existing smart phones and wearable devices, and evaluate its performance over different distances through disparate transmission media. Experimental results show that ViCom achieves effective data transmission of eight users with an accuracy of 98.6% and exhibits a superior overall performance over existing methods.}
