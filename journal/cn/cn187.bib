	abstract = {Mobile users demand more and more data traffic, yet network resources are limited. This creates a challenge for network resource management. One way of addressing this challenge is by understanding the data usage patterns of mobile users so that resources can be optimally allocated based on user traffic demand and data usage behavior. However, understanding and characterizing the data usage patterns of mobile users is a complex task. In this work, we investigate and characterize users’ data usage patterns and behavior in mobile networks. We leverage a dataset (\n∼\n113 million records) collected through a crowd-based mobile network measurement platform – Netradar – across five countries. Data usage behavior of users over a cellular network is primarily driven by user mobility, the type of subscription plan marketed by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), network congestion, and network coverage. We apply an unsupervised machine learning approach to cluster mobile user types by considering different factors such as data consumption, network access type, the number of sessions created per user, throughput, and mobility. By defining data usage pattern of mobile users, we develop a user clustering model and identify three different mobile user groups (clusters). Our clustering model shows that the data usage patterns are unevenly distributed across the five countries studied, characterized by a small number of heavy users consuming the highest volume of data. We show how the types of applications installed by users correlate with data consumption patterns in some countries. Heavy users tend to install more traffic-demanding apps than users from the other two groups — regular and light users. Finally, we trained a classification model using the labeled dataset produced by our aforementioned user clustering method. The model helps classifying mobile users according to their usage patterns (i.e., heavy, regular, and light) with an accuracy of\n∼\n80% in the test dataset.}

	abstract = {Wireless communication is a key technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to its open nature, the physical layer of wireless systems is a high-priority target for an adversary whose goal is to disrupt the normal behavior of the system. In particular, jamming attacks are one of the most straightforward and effective types of attacks: information flow of the system is stopped or severely disturbed. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the jamming resilience of IoT systems based on Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum (DSSS) techniques. Our proposal is inspired by the Moving Target Defense (MTD) paradigm. MTD strategies randomize components of a system, increasing the effort an attacker needs to compromise the system. We use state-of-the-art Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators outputs as spreading sequences for DSSS. The sequences of the proposed system are generated in an ad-hoc, independent, and distributed way. We show probabilistically that the generated sequences have robust cross-correlation properties. We define a multi-user system model to evaluate the Bit-Error-Rate of our proposal in the presence of two types of jammers: a classical band-limited Gaussian noise jammer, and an insider smart jammer with knowledge of one spreading sequence used in the system. Our proposal proactively mitigates the insider jammer attack. We quantify the insider smart jammer resilience of a system implementing our proposal, as a function of the length of the spreading sequences and the jammer power.}

	abstract = {Physical layer impairment-aware control plane techniques are studied for dynamic networking of elastic optical networks (EONs). To this end, performance of three control plane architectures, the generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS), the GMPLS method with a path computation element unit, and the software-defined networking (SDN), are analyzed considering nonlinear interference (NLI) noise (consisting of self-phase and cross-phase modulation effects) and amplified spontaneous emission noise. Signal-to-noise ratio estimation of all the control plane architectures is performed by means of the well established gaussian noise model. To reduce the blocking probability caused by the NLI noise in EONs, an impairment-aware routing and spectrum assignment algorithm is proposed to ensure a required quality of transmission for requested light-paths. Moreover, transmit launch power influence on blocking probability is investigated exploiting extensive numerical simulations based on stochastic traffic modeling for the investigated control plane architectures in Pan-European and national science foundation network (NSFNET) topologies. The numerical results show nearly 50% improvement in blocking probability of the SDN control plane by applying an impairment aware scheme at traffics around 200 Erlang. Furthermore, the results indicate that the lowest blocking probability is observed at a transmit power of 0 dBm for all the control plane techniques.}

	abstract = {In general, price is the key element in shipping, and half of the costs are tied up in last-mile deliveries. The biggest expense here is the human element, so companies, which can cut down on staff costs, will be able to out-price their competitors. Therefore, we expect sooner, or later robotic delivery systems will become the norm. However, ensuring security in such a system will be a challenge. In this article, we propose a secure shipping infrastructure using robot. In this regard, we first design a cooperative user authentication system for delivering parcel using crypto primitives such as one-way hash function, asymmetric encryption and QR code. Next, we design a non-cooperative user identification scheme using Siamese Network for Person Reidentification, where the client is not ready to cooperate during the authentication process. Therefore, the robot carrier needs to automatically recognize and go towards the client to deliver the parcel in a secure way. Finally, we implement the proof-of-concept system through a cooperative user authentication process using TurtleBot3 robot platform and analyse the security of the proposed scheme using ProVerif. Analysis and experiment results show that our proposed system can complete the delivery mission and resist a variety of security attacks.}

	abstract = {Most of softwareized WiFi networks rely on dedicated softwares for realizing novel wireless functionalities. However, such an approach is not flexible enough, and introduces management complexity. On the other hand, the programmable forwarding pipeline, which models packet processing as multiple stages of forwarding rules, exhibits great flexibility in facilitating network innovations, and has been recognized as a consensus for abstracting SDN data plane. In this paper, we present Po-Fi, an architecture for software-defined WiFi networks. Based on Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF), Po-Fi follows the SDN consensus by abstracting WiFi AP as a programmable forwarding pipeline, and provides a rich and unified programmability to enable user to realize novel wireless functionalities with forwarding rules. Comparing with previous approaches, Po-Fi is highly flexible in facilitating WiFi innovations. To show this, we realize a wide range of use cases with Po-Fi, including per-client virtual AP (VAP), seamless mobility, multi-AP MPTCP data transmission, smooth remote AP switching for wireless backhaul, and TDMA MAC scheduling. We implement a Po-Fi prototype with commodity hardware, and evaluate the use cases with real-world experiments. The results show that the Po-Fi facilitated innovations can effectively improve the WiFi network services.}

When a decentralized microservice composition wants to reach consensus among its participants at runtime, missing a coordinator makes it to adopt a feasible mechanism to coordinate service components. This work studies the issue. It begins with analyzing data dependences among composite microservices, and then summaries basic structural patterns in the compositions according to the dependences. Based on the Saga method, this paper proposes coordination mechanisms for the composite microservices, and conducts two different experiments to evaluate the mechanisms. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can prompt composite microservices to reach consensus at runtime, and the corresponding implementations can work effectively.}

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a cornerstone of next-generation networks and has already led to numerous advantages for data-center networks and wide-area networks. However, SDN is not widely adopted in constrained networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), due to excessive control overhead, lossy medium, and in-band control channels. Therefore, a key challenge to enable Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SD-WSN) is to reduce the number of control messages required to configure the data plane. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based flow control approach in hybrid SDNs. Our approach is hybrid in the sense that it takes advantage of distributed legacy routing and centralized SDN routing. In addition, it makes a trade-off between the granularity of flow control and the communication overhead induced by the SDN controller. The approach partitions a network into clusters with minimum number of border nodes. Instead of handling the individual flows of each node, the SDN controller only manages incoming and outgoing traffic flows of clusters through border nodes, while the flows inside each cluster are controlled by a distributed legacy WSN routing algorithm. Our proof-of-concept implementations in both software and hardware show that our approach is efficient with respect to reducing the number of nodes that must be managed and the number of control messages. In comparison to benchmark solutions with and without clustering, our solution reduces communication costs for flow configuration in an SD-WSN at least by 27% and at most by 88% respectively, without degrading packet delay nor delivery rate.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology at the beginning of the 21st century, the traditional transportation system is rapidly transforming to Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Meanwhile, as a powerful optimization tool for the applications’ performance under the framework of ITS, the traffic prediction model has gained much attention. The traffic prediction model belongs to the traditional time series prediction model, widely used in industry for business analysis, abnormalities detection, etc. There are two main categories of traffic prediction models — the parametric model and the non-parametric model. The non-parametric model develops rapidly in recent years due to the machine learning theory’s maturing and increment in computing power. Compared to the parametric model, the non-parametric model is more accurate and requires less advanced analysis of traffic patterns’ correlation, and can better handle a large amount of historical data. However, the non-parametric model also requires more powerful devices for training and implementation. The traffic prediction system’s implementation environment, built by on-road resources and off-road infrastructures, is relatively limited compared to the traditional data center. This paper uses several well-known state-of-the-art non-parametric models and their Deep Learning structures for traffic prediction, and evaluates the models’ performance on both freeway and urban-road dataset. Focusing on the model’s accuracy and training cost while deploying prediction models in a large-scale traffic network, this paper provides a novel optimized training strategy called CTS to reduce the implementation cost of a complex inner structure model. This approach could be further used to reduce the deployment cost, especially the training time, for the big data intelligent system using machine learning.}

Indeed, SFC combined with other promising technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) as well as Network Slicing form the basis for enabling the 5G network services and fulfilling their requirements. Many contributions have been made to support and enforce SFC, from chain composition to its deployment and life-cycle management. However, few research works study SFC orchestration, and even fewer consider the multi-domain context, which remains an open issue with many challenges that need to be tackled in order to provide end-to-end services. In this paper, we contribute to filling this gap by introducing a novel architecture for orchestrating and enforcing multi-domain SFCs. The proposed architecture leverages on the ETSI MANO standard, as well as SDN and the hierarchical SFC principles, and is agnostic to the packet forwarding technology used by each administrative domain. We also implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) that employs different SFC encapsulation types to evaluate the architecture, where the obtained results prove our architecture’s efficiency, we are also able to draw conclusions related to the encapsulation methods to implement. Finally, we discuss open research issues.}

	abstract = {Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is based on a recently proposed family of protocols in which contents are identified through names. ICN decouples the content to be retrieved from the specification of its location. It naturally supports the use of multiple paths; however, with multiple consumers and producers, coordination among the nodes is required to efficiently use the network resources. Network coding (NC) is a promising tool to address this issue. The challenge when using NC with ICN is to be able to get independent coded content in response to multiple parallel interests (i.e., requests) by one or several consumers. In this work, we propose a novel construction called MILIC (Multiple Interests for Linearly Independent Contents) that imposes constraints on how the replies to clients are network coded, intending to get linearly independent contents in response to multiple interests. Several protocol variants, called MICN (MILIC-ICN), built on top of NDN (Named Data Networking), are proposed to integrate these interest constraints and NC of data packets. Numerical analysis and simulations illustrate that MILIC performs well and that the MICN protocols reach close to optimal throughputs on some scenarios. MICN protocols compare favorably to existing protocols and show significant benefits when considering the total number of transmitted packets in the network, also in the case of high link loss rate.}

	abstract = {The current advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is revolutionizing conventional farming operations into precision agriculture. The agricultural UAVs combined with IoT use an open channel i.e., the Internet to assist cultivators with data collection, processing, monitoring, and making correct decisions on the farm. However, the use of the Internet opens up a wide range of challenges such as security (e.g., performing cyber-attacks), risk of data privacy (e.g., data poisoning and inference attacks), etc. The usage of current conventional centralized security measures has limitations in terms of a single point of failure, verifiability, traceability, and scalability. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural UAVs. The proposed SP2F framework has two main engines, a two-level privacy engine, and a deep learning-based anomaly detection engine. In the two-level privacy engine, a blockchain, and smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) is designed for data authentication, and to mitigate data poisoning attacks. A Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) is applied for transforming data into a new encoded format for preventing inference attacks. In the anomaly detection engine, a Stacked Long-Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) is used to train and evaluate the results of the proposed two-level privacy engine using two publicly accessible IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet. Finally, based on thorough analysis, and comparison, we identify that the SP2F framework outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both non-blockchain and blockchain frameworks.}

We then address two important practical issues arising in production networks, namely that (i) many client devices are non-rooted mobile handsets/tablets and (ii) the bottleneck may lie in the backhaul rather than the WLAN, or indeed vary between the two over time. We show that both these issues can be resolved by use of simple and robust machine learning techniques. We present a prototype transport layer implementation of our low delay rate allocation approach and use this to evaluate performance under real radio conditions.}

Such edge caching solutions not only increase the content availability, but also result in higher download rates and lower latency. Different from the classical eviction-based algorithms, the present work formulates the content placement problem from an optimization perspective and puts forth an online algorithm for the same. In contrast to the existing optimization-based solutions, the proposed algorithm is incremental and incurs very low computation cost, while yielding storage allocations that are provably near-optimal. The proposed algorithm can handle time-varying content popularity, thereby obviating the need for periodically estimating demand distribution. Using synthetic and real IPTV data, we show that the proposed policies outperform the traditional eviction based techniques in terms of various metrics.}

	abstract = {The installation of new equipment (Base Stations, BSs) during the planning phase of a cellular network (including 5G BSs) is governed by exposure limits in terms of allowable ElectroMagnetic Field (EMF) levels. The exposure limits can be either defined by (i) international bodies (e.g., ICNIRP) or (ii) national regulations imposing limits stricter than (i). In this work, we compare the impact of ICNIRP vs. stricter-than-ICNIRP exposure regulations on the Quality of Service (QoS) and EMF. To this aim, we perform a large-scale measurement campaign in one scenario in Spain subject to ICNIRP regulations and another one in Italy subject to EMF limits stricter than ICNIRP ones. Both the scenarios are characterized by similar exposure conditions, comparable user density, and common 4G performance targets by the operators. Results, obtained by measuring QoS and EMF at selected locations, reveal that the QoS in the scenario subject to strict EMF limits is heavily worsened compared to the one in which ICNIRP-based limits are enforced. Clearly, the scenario with strict EMF limits presents a lower level exposure over the territory compared to the one imposing ICNIRP limits.}

	abstract = {High availability in network services is a crucial requirement for quality of experience. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distribute Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are under contemplation by many researchers across the globe because these attacks directly target services availability. For this reason, cloud providers use the auto-scaling feature in Cloud Computing Environments (CCE), in which cloud resources scale dynamically on demand. DoS/DDoS attacks on CCE, using auto-scaling, do not deny services but cause high resource usage and substantial financial damages that become an Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDOS) attack. One of the DoS/DDoS attacks, resulting EDOS attack is the Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) flooding attack. In this paper, a novel technique, ICMP detection and mitigation model (EDOS-IDM) is proposed that can detect and mitigate Volumetric and Normal Behavioral ICMP traffic attacks. The results from the proposed technique are compared with the Normal Behavioral ICMP traffic attack because it causes least resource usage among all the mitigation techniques. According to our study, there is no such technique that can handle normal behavioral ICMP traffic attack. The technique is practically tested and evaluated on OpenStack production Cloud Environment test bed. According to the results, the technique is proved to save extra resource consumption and customer's bills in a cloud computing environment.}

	abstract = {Industrial automation and management designed using the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm leverage the functional and reliable operations of the production industry. Different network slices for independent and collaborative functioning connect the internal operations between different industrial IoT (IIoT) layers. This article proposes an independently-tailored network-slicing architecture for improving the mutual operations of different layers of IIoT functions. The proposed architecture helps improve the processing of scheduled jobs in different layers in an associated manner. The association process between the scheduled processes is independently analyzed for improving the swiftness in IIoT production outcomes. The scheduling and network-slicing features are recommended based on the processing and production outcomes of the analyzed industry using regression learning, which helps to assign associated processes in a queue depending on the time and production unit availability. Therefore, the architecture's network-slicing feature is modified based on the recommendations from the learning in providing seamless processing and interconnection support for IIoT production enhancements. The proposed architecture's performance is assessed using the metrics production responses, processing rate, processing time, process lag, and resource allocations. The proposed architecture achieves 10.35%, 15.32%, and 9.05% high response ratio, processing rate, and resource allocation. It reduces processing time and lag factor by 9.25% and 9.19% respectively. This observation is with respect to the processing units.}

	abstract = {The concurrent use of a few transmission channels offered by the multipath version of the TCP protocol (MPTCP) becomes a widely accepted remedy for the quality of service and reliability issues. However, the common approaches to the multipath transfer organization do not give sufficient attention to the energy aspects, which are crucial for the resource-constrained devices in the Internet of Things domain. In this paper, a systematic tuning methodology of the MPTCP architectural modules – targeting the energy expenditure – is developed. By adopting a formal optimization approach, a new Scheduler, and a new Path Manager that promote conservative energy usage are designed. The proposed ‘green’ modules versions do not augment the protocol complexity. Next, explicit guidelines for the selection of the TCP variant to be used at the individual paths are provided. As confirmed by experiments involving physical devices and real networks, the established framework reduces the amount of dissipated energy by several percent (up to 50%) with respect to the default one. As a beneficial side-effect, the transmission throughput is increased and the protocol delay shortened in the uncertain networking conditions typical of industrial settings.}

	abstract = {Due to the lack of fully considering dynamic traffic information, in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), existing routing schemes are easily stuck in local optimum, path redundancy, and congestion problems. By combining Software Defined Network (SDN) with VANET, the emerging Software Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) can provide a global perspective of the traffic network to bridge the gap. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent fuzzy-based routing scheme for urban SDVN. First, a large urban area is divided into multiple sub-areas, in which each area is centered on an intersection. Second, the central controller maintains a routing table that records the priorities of packets be forwarded from an area to another, and all values in the routing table are initialized using Fuzzy Logic. Finally, we propose a hierarchical greedy routing with link stability (GLS) to calculate the routing path with the highest link stability according to the routing table. Meanwhile, considering the dynamic nature of vehicles in an area, Reinforcement Learning is employed to update the routing table during the routing process. Simulation results show that the proposed routing scheme achieved a significant improvement in performance over its counterparts.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the secure beamforming design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) en-abled Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where a controller transmits confidential messages to multiple actuators and a cooperative controller acts as a jammer to prevent a potential eavesdropper from wiretapping the information. Our goal is to maximize achievable secrecy sum rate subject to the successful successive interference cancellation constraint and transmit power constraints of the controller and jammer. When channel state information (CSI) is perfect, we design the secure beamforming by developing an iterative optimization algorithm based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. When perfect CSI is not available, we model the channel errors as deterministically-bounded, and propose a robust secure beamforming design algorithm based on weighted MMSE and cutting-set method. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified by the simulation results.}
