	abstract = {In the recent years, the growth of technology and the resulting transformation is happening at a rapid pace. In this junction, IoT has provided a great platform and bridge between these technologies. A lot of research regarding the application of IoT Systems has been done in the recent years but one area that lacks research is security issues in Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT).It is noticed that security and Privacy in NB-IoT system is a challenging task for researchers and academia. Application of NB-IoT in Defense security opened a new way for the researchers but at the same time security threat can lead to drastic loss. Nowadays, MEMS-NB-IoT device (Bug)/ BOT are being used for carrying out any malicious security attack. This can be a serious area of concern in the case of defense security. These MEMS device are very dangerous and it can spoof data from any type of network. The size of this device is very small, it can travel to any location for monitoring the enemy movement, and it is very difficult to identify these types of bugs. These BOT device very sensitive at Perception and Network Layered. In this paper, we have provided detail analysis of IoT/NB-IoT Layered architecture. A novel proposal depicting security attack in a Smart home system with IoT and NB-IoT enabled devices is presented. The Secrecy Rate (SR), the Secrecy Outage Probability (SOP) is being calculated, and performance analysis of IoT system in the presence of Bugs for a smart home system is carried out. Simulations have been performed and the performance analysis done is based on Security non-outage probability vs security rate with real time analysis.}

	abstract = {Mobile data offloading is a key solution to mitigate heavy traffic load through cellular networks to the WiFi networks. To motivate the mobile users to transmit data over the cellular/WiFi networks under the control of the operator smartly, many incentive pricing frameworks have been proposed with the execution of dynamic bandwidth reallocation schemes to improve network efficiency. In this paper, a Satisfaction-based Dynamic Bandwidth Reallocation (SDBR) scheme is proposed to improve user satisfaction in term of the blocking probability and the user payment in data offloading environments. In SDBR, the operator can efficiently reallocate the bandwidth to accommodate more potential users; the overall operator revenue therefore increases as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SDBR scheme, we first assess the blocking probability with and without serving users having WiFi connections and discuss the benefits of the dynamic bandwidth allocation. Then, we elaborate a satisfaction-based pricing scheme for data downloading to motivate both mobile operator and users to work with SDBR, which brings the increment of operator overall revenue and reduction of individual user payment. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed SDBR scheme outperforms the four existing bandwidth allocation schemes in both time-based and volume-based data transmission.}

	abstract = {Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology is a new solution for communication among aircraft and ground controller stations. In this new surveillance technology, critical messages (e.g., the location of aircraft) are achieved by navigation satellites, and then an on-board equipment multicasts the unencrypted messages twice per second to the others. The former ADS-B protocols suffer from weak authentication protocols with a few security vulnerabilities and privacy issues including key-escrow problem, user profiling, time consuming verification processes, and difficulties with certificate management. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical authentication protocol used Certificateless Public Key Cryptography (CL-PKC) technique to avoid using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate management and solve the key-escrow concern in Identity-based Public Key Cryptography (ID-PKC). Further, unlike many of certificateless schemes, our proposed scheme is secure against malicious-but-passive Key Generation Center (KGC). We prove that our scheme preserves conditional privacy, which means that distinct identities map to varied pseudonyms. The security and privacy features of our scheme are provably modeled under the widely-accepted random oracle model by computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption against adaptive chosen-message attack. Finally, we show that the time needed to aggregate verification of 50 messages reduced by 84% and 48% compared to those of Yang et al.’s and He et al.’s schemes respectively.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has become a significant part of 5G or beyond 5G (B5G) paradigm, and is used in various scenarios, including cargo delivery, agricultural application, event surveillance, etc. Although plenty of studies have been proposed on UAV-based data aggregation, how to ensure security and energy-efficiency of the data aggregation process in 5G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) is an open problem. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent UAV-based Data Aggregation Algorithm, named IDAA for 5G-Enabled IoT. Specifically, IDAA applies v-Support Vector Regression (v-svr) to predict the data collection rate. Then, a security level based task decomposition mechanism is designed that allows UAVs to accept the tasks of corresponding security levels. Finally, energy efficient routes for UAV are planned utilizing a deep reinforcement learning method to achieve the trade-off between the sinking ratio and the energy cost. The theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that (i) IDAA improves the security of data aggregation; and (ii) IDAA enables UAVs to collect more data and consume less energy compared with baseline strategies.}

	abstract = {Today’s blockchain system provides two incentives for participants: block reward and transaction fee. However, these incentives benefit block miners more than ordinary participants. Besides, the message propagation relies on the volunteer work of these participants. We consider that there could be a third incentive to reward the relay process in the blockchain network. Nodes should be paid for corresponding relay work and incentives to expedite message propagation. We take advantage of the payment nature of blockchain and the characteristics of the UTXO Model, and propose a relay payment scheme to tackle the relay incentive issue. UTXO (unspent transaction output) is an abstract ownership of cryptocurrency and it represents a chain of payment relations between transactions. Any legal transaction should have valid UTXO(s) and generate new UTXO(s) to accomplish payment process. Native token in blockchain provides a straight and favorable payment method, and the UTXO model binds the interest of relay nodes and message originator. Then we model a cooperative, competitive relay game based on our scheme. We analyze the equilibrium results and run massive simulations on different datasets. This incentive scheme is free-rider resilient and could further expand to meet diverse relay requirement via transaction scripts in UTXO model. Our discussion and results help explore the relay incentives in the blockchain network and draw an example for the design of new blockchain systems.}

	abstract = {Demand for video streaming content and multimedia services have increased dramatically. Delivering high throughput and low delay video data are real challenges to provide and sustain high quality mobile video streaming services. One type of solution to provide quality of experience is to exploit multipath strategies by taking advantage of the multiple network interfaces that are currently available in most wireless devices. Our work aims at delivering contributions by exploring the advantages of multipath video streaming using the MPEG Media Transport protocol. MPEG Media Transport is a multimedia application layer protocol with the capability of hybrid media delivery. In this article, we propose a Content-Aware and Path-Aware (CAPA) scheduling strategy for this protocol, considering both video features and path condition. The performance of our CAPA proposal is evaluated using ns-3 DCE with different realistic multipath network scenarios. We evaluate the performance of CAPA over heterogeneous wireless networks under congested network and wireless lossy network conditions, which are common network situations with significant adverse effects on video quality. Our approach yields considerable video quality improvement in both scenarios compared to Path-Aware strategy and a simple scheduling strategy, called Evenly Splitting. For congested network scenario, CAPA could increase PSNR, respectively, by up to 4.25 dB (12.97%), and 7.22 dB (20.58%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies. It could also improve SSIM, respectively, by up to 0.033 (3.78%), and 0.102 (12.54%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies. For wireless lossy network scenario, CAPA increases PSNR, respectively, by up to 6.84 dB (20.30%), and 9.43 dB (30.32%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies. The proposed strategy also provides improvements in terms of SSIM, by up to 0.100 (12.72%), and 0.113 (14.23%) compared to Path-Aware and Evenly Splitting strategies, respectively. We also evaluate how proposed CAPA handles the streaming of different video bitrates under congested network conditions to provide sufficient video quality. Finally, we provide an initial validation of fairness of CAPA to confirm fair access to the resources available across all paths.}

Our method includes a feature selection and fusion module, which extracts the most important features from redundancy traffic features and fuses the selected features, a multi-scale decomposition module, and a multi-channel Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) detection module, for anomaly detection and decision-making. The advantage of our method is that, first, it only considers the selected features and reduces the amount of computation. Second, compared with traditional anomaly detection methods that usually work on each scale independently thus mainly focused on temporally correlated traffic, our method fully explores the internal frequency–time correlations within multiple scales. It can be verified with experiments that this method performs better than other traditional methods, thus gives a new sight on the anomaly detection with different types of traffic data.}

	abstract = {Maintaining seamless quality of service (QoS) requirements for ongoing delay sensitive applications during handover processes for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication over heterogeneous networks is a challenging task. The situation becomes even more challenging to deal with for multi-tier heterogeneous networks with various network sizes. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a multicriteria-based handover algorithm for V2I communications (V2I-MHA) to be used in multi-tier heterogeneous network environments. V2I-MHA selects the most appropriate underlying target network for handover based on QoS profiles of the ongoing applications and services. Moreover, our proposed algorithm filters out the inappropriate candidate networks using a multi-criteria decision-making technique based on Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) approach. However, our approach ensures that the most appropriate candidate network for handover processes is selected not only based on QoS requirements of the ongoing applications, but also on the knowledge of candidate network parameters (e.g. bandwidth, packet latency, packet losses, and service pricing). A multi-mode vehicle On-Board Unit (OBU) containing Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) and Wi-Fi network interface cards is developed in the Riverbed (previously OPNET) simulator for system performance evaluation. The simulation results show that the proposed V2I-MHA outperforms (in terms of handover failure rate and packet losses) the existing handover methods.}

	abstract = {Trucks form a platoon, where they align in a lane on freeways, in order to save fuel. The trucks positioned behind the first truck in the platoon can save fuel because their air drag reduces. In a truck platoon, various technologies such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication protocol are exploited to control the trucks in the platoon effectively. The camera sensors measure distance between contiguous trucks in the platoon and these sensor measurements are provided to the ACC system. By using these sensor measurement, the ACC system controls the truck speed via in-vehicle network protocols such as the controller area network, which does not encrypt data or authenticate messages. Also, the V2V communication protocol is vulnerable to cyber attacks that disable the wireless channels among the trucks in the platoon. As a result, the ACC system and V2V communication protocol may introduce attack surfaces in a truck platoon. In this survey, we analyze the attack surfaces of a truck platoon under different perspectives. Then, we summarize the defense systems corresponding to the discussed attacks in terms of detection mechanisms, response countermeasures, and proactive defenses. Finally, we provide the research issues that need to be addressed in future.}

This paper addresses intra- and inter-cluster link scheduling problem in multi-channel ad hoc networks employing CUPS architecture. We first describe the CUPS architecture. Then, we present a novel intra- and inter-cluster link scheduling mechanism over the CUPS architecture. We propose a link scheduling strategy that is responsive to instant communication demands and available resources as a non-linear optimization problem, which is then reduced to a linear form by eliminating non-linearities in order to simplify the problem definition and enhance optimizer performance. The results of the optimizer show that the run time cost of the optimization function drastically increases by the parameter size growth. Therefore, we propose an iterative solution to decrease the running time. The adaptation of the iterative history-based approach makes the solution feasible and ensures near-optimal satisfaction and efficiency.}

Thus, it is essential to manage and schedule the physical resources efficiently in 5G era. Virtualization technologies are seen as the most potential enabling approaches towards 5G networks. The known key issue is the virtual resource allocation, called as virtual network embedding (VNE). However, previous researchers simply focus on allocating resources in an inflexible way. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communication plays an important role in 5G, we need to add UAVs into the 5G networks in order to expand the coverage and agility of services. In this paper, we investigate the issue of intelligent virtual resource allocation in UAVs-assisted 5G networks. Especially, we propose one intelligent virtual resource allocation algorithm, labeled as Intell-UAV-5G. When receiving one network service, our Intell-UAV-5G implements the network service in an intelligent manner. Though virtualized UAV moves, our Intell-UAV-5G is able to predict all possible connecting access nodes and continue the network service intelligently. Meanwhile, our Intell-UAV-5G can minimize the time of service interruption. Thus guaranteeing the service quality. We also conduct the experiment to highlight the Intell-UAV-5G efficiency. The mostly-similar algorithms are derived for performance comparison. Performance metrics are carefully recorded and discussed.}

In this paper, we design a flow-level and efficient TE scheme based on the conventional hop-by-hop routing protocol, i.e., OSPF. Motivated by the analysis and modeling on the real Internet traffic, we propose to detect and schedule a few large flows in real-time. The rerouting paths for large flows are computed in a centralized server and are distributed through extended OSPF. A few ACL entries are used for flow-level forwarding. We formalize the link weight assignment-based large flow scheduling problem and prove the problem is NP-hard. We propose to precompute several candidate paths to reduce decision computation overhead and path stretch. We develop an algorithm with performance bounds to allocate large flows to paths, and two algorithms to reduce extra LSA number for different system designs. Experiment results show our scheme can reroute large flows within 0.5 s. Simulation results show our scheme gets congestion metric values (i.e., performance ratios) 10% worse than the optimal for source and destination addresses-based flows. Our optimization mechanisms reduce the extra LSA number and computation time by 87% and 83% respectively for our scheme with pre-computed paths.}

Owing to the disparity in transmit power of macro base stations (MBSs) and small BSs (SBSs), the SBSs located in the close proximity of MBSs have negligible coverage areas that not only overburden the macro tier but also cause excessive interference. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose to mute the SBSs that are located in the near-vicinity of MBSs to introduce a partial-correlation between the locations of the BS tiers. Meanwhile, to further enhance the coverage performance of these coverage-centric cellular networks, the traditional load balancing mechanism along with interference abating strategy is also employed in this paper. Nonetheless, it is also well-known in the literature that the usage of single-slope path loss model (PLM) leads to significant inaccuracies in evaluating the performance of dense cellular networks. Therefore, a more accurate PLM based on the dual-slope is adopted in this paper. Analytical expressions for the tier association and coverage probability are derived for a randomly chosen user using the tools from stochastic geometry and validated through simulations. The numerical results testify the improvement in network coverage due to the non-uniform deployment of SBSs and the joint consideration of load balancing and interference mitigation mechanisms.}

	abstract = {Recently, many efforts have been made by researchers, standardization organizations, telecommunication industries and energy providers, in order to realize robust and efficient communication in Smart Grids. To meet these requirements, a new generation of Narrow-Band Power Line Communication (NB-PLC) protocols have been proposed. The main advantage of PLC systems is that they require no additional costs in terms of deployment and wiring since the existing power cables can be used to transmit power and data, simultaneously. The PLC technology has many applications within Smart Grids such as advanced metering infrastructure, distributed automation, street light control, and public charging. One popular PLC standard is the Power-line Related Intelligent Metering Evolution (PRIME). This technology enables different types of Smart Grid services over electricity distribution networks. In PRIME, the security is implemented at the data link layer and it targets data confidentiality and message authentication, but not data availability. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust security solution to guard against availability and confidentiality attacks. The main goal of the proposed solution is to enhance the security and reliability of PLC communication among end nodes with minimum overhead in terms of resources, complexity and latency. The solution is based on the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) and the physical characteristics of PLC channels. In particular, end nodes benefit from a shared working key and the random channel parameters to derive the cryptographic primitives that are used in the proposed scheme. The security and performance tests showed that the proposed solution introduces a low overhead while offering a high degree of availability and reinforcing confidentiality.}

	abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are becoming increasingly susceptible to the sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks which are typically carried out by exploiting the vulnerabilities of industrial control devices or protocols. However, most of the existing network intrusion detection methods only focus on detecting and characterizing cyber attacks against the SCADA system, but cannot fully describe their real impact on the system. In this paper, we propose a cyber-physical model for the SCADA system to detect intrusions from the SCADA network and evaluate their risk levels against the industrial process. The model aims at characterizing the network structure and industrial process of the SCADA system through extracting and correlating the communication patterns and states of ICS devices. And any violation of the model is considered abnormal behavior, which can be caused by false operation or network attacks. Through associating network intrusions with the status of the SCADA system, a risk assessment method is proposed to estimate the potential damage degree of the attack on the system, which provides network administrators with richer information about network attacks. Moreover, the comprehensive performance evaluation conducted on public SCADA network data sets shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in detecting and analyzing various cyber attacks against the SCADA system.}

	abstract = {With the growth of data generation speed and its huge volume, the cloud-based infrastructure alone does not meet the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT), thereby leading to inefficiency. By combining fog and cloud computing on the IoT, some processing occurs near the data generation location with a higher speed and without needing a large bandwidth. Cloud and fog computing requires proper management in scheduling, increasing resource efficiency, and reducing consumption costs. In this article, a two-phase scheduling algorithm is presented based on deep learning methods in the field of IoT. The first phase is to decide on the location of the task execution using the clustering method. The second phase involves scheduling the task according to the execution location. In the clustering section, three ideas based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering method have been proposed. In the first and second ideas, the SOM and hierarchical SOM are used to cluster the features of the tasks received from the IoT layer. In the third idea, the feature is extracted, and its dimensions are reduced using the Autoencoder, which is one of the deep learning methods, after which clustering is done. After scheduling each cluster's tasks, comparing the methods presented in the article, it is shown that the feature extraction using deep learning can improve clustering in such a way to reduce the missed rate of tasks in the cloud and fog, as well as their costs.}

	abstract = {As network systems become widespread in emerging time-sensitive domains, latency becomes an important performance factor. Thus, there is a new demand for ultra-low latency (ULL), which requires an extra-ordinarily low latency even in a deterministic manner. To support the ULL requirement, it is mandatory that each network device strictly guarantees this latency. As a result, there is an increasing demand for a precise latency measurement tool that achieves two conflicting goals: high time precision and flexible traffic control. To support these goals, this paper proposes a novel measurement tool, named Formullar, which has a hybrid architecture composed of hardware (Formullar FPGA) and software (Formullar controller) layers. Formullar generates packets in an accurate timing, according to the various traffic patterns. The packet generation is controlled in a fully programmable manner that makes the testing fully automated and flexible. Then, latency is measured based on packet generation and reception timing; the measurement is done by the hardware layer, providing highly precise measurement results. Using this carefully constructed system, a Formullar prototype was implemented on top of the commodity FPGA board NetFPGA-SUME. The evaluation indicates that Formullar provides highly precise measurements with nanoseconds precision at a bandwidth of 10\u202fGbps.}

However, due to the vulnerability of DNS to various threats, its security and functionality have been continuously challenged over the course of time. Although, researchers have addressed various aspects of the DNS in the literature, there are still many challenges yet to be addressed. In order to comprehensively understand the root causes of the vulnerabilities of DNS, it is mandatory to review the various activities in the research community on DNS landscape. To this end, this paper surveys more than 170 peer reviewed papers, which are published in both top conferences and journals in last ten years, and summarizes vulnerabilities in DNS and corresponding countermeasures. This paper not only focuses on the DNS threat landscape and existing challenges, but also discusses the utilized data analysis methods, which are frequently used to address DNS threat vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we looked into the DNS threat landscape from the view point of the involved entities in the DNS infrastructure in an attempt to point out more vulnerable entities in the system.}

	abstract = {Data generated by sensors are inherently apt to spatial and temporal redundancy owing to the proximity of sensors that could sense the same environment or react to the same event. The massively generated data leads to reducing the life span of the sensors in particular, and the network in general. To minimize the effect of such generated data, we develop an approach to reducing the spatial and temporal data redundancy while maintaining the life of the sensor that results in prolonging the lifetime of the network with balancing data reliability. The proposed approach relies on two levels. The first level represents the end node, and it is responsible for reducing the temporal data redundancy and minimizing the data transmission using the Kalman filter for data estimation. The second level represents the sink or base station, which works in synchronization with the end nodes. This level is responsible for minimizing the spatial data redundancy based on two algorithms, namely Sink Level Grouping Algorithm (SLGA) and Sink Level Aggregation Algorithm (SLAA). The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperformed Prefix Frequency Filtering (PFF) and Redundancy Elimination Data Aggregation (REDA) algorithms in terms of spatial and temporal data redundancy and accuracy with acceptable results of energy consumption.}

In this paper we design, implement and evaluate a programmable data plane solution for Linux routers called HIKE (HybrId Kernel/eBPF forwarding), integrated in an HSDN/SRv6 architecture. HIKE integrates the conventional Linux kernel packet forwarding with custom designed eBPF/XDP (extended Berkeley Packet Filter/eXtreme Data Path) bypass to speed up performance of SRv6 software routers. Thus, in addition to the hybrid IP/SDN forwarding, we foster an additional hybrid approach inside a Linux forwarding engine combining eBPF/XDP and kernel based forwarding, taking the best from both worlds. Therefore, considering the two different conceptual levels of hybridization, we call our overall solution Hybrid squared or\nH\nˆ\n2\n.}

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the network is required to guarantee the differential Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the various data flows of various IoT services. Software-defined network (SDN) is envisioned as a promising technique to guarantee the QoS requirements of different services, through separating the control logic from data planes of networks. In order to guarantee the QoS requirements of data flows in SDNs, in this paper we investigate the problem of intelligent routing in SDNs, by leveraging a novel data flow classification method. Combining a variety of machine learning algorithms, a data flow classification method called MACCA2-RF&RF is proposed, in order to identify the data flow category and obtain the QoS requirements. The link parameter is newly designed considering multiple QoS requirements. According to the link parameter, the QoS-guaranteed path selection algorithm is then proposed, which can select QoS guaranteed routing path for different data flows with different QoS requirements. Aiming at the situation that the link is congested, local routing change algorithm is then proposed which only adjusts the links before and after the congested link instead of the entire path. Based on the above, a QoS-guaranteed intelligent routing mechanism called QI-RM in SDN is finally proposed in this paper to achieve QoS guarantee for data flows. The simulation results show that the MACCA2-RF&RF can classify data flows efficiently with an identification accuracy of 99.73%, and the QI-RM can guarantee the QoS requirements of data flows before and after link congestion.}

The novel networking architecture Named Data Networking (NDN) inherently supports network-level multicast and packet-level security and thereby introduces promising features for online games. In this paper, we propose an NDN-based approach to synchronize game state in a server cluster, a task necessary to allow multiple players in large numbers to play in the same game world. The proposed Quadtree Synchronization Protocol applies NDN’s data-centric nature to decouple the game world from the game servers hosting it. This means that requesting changes of a specific game world region becomes possible without knowing which game server is responsible for the requested region. We use a hierarchic game world structure when requesting data that allows the network to forward requests to the responsible game server without directly addressing it. This region-based naming scheme decouples world regions from servers which eases the management of the game server cluster and allows easier recovery after server failures. In addition, this decoupling allows exchanging information about a geographical region, such as a game world, without knowledge of the other participants changing the world. Such a region-based synchronization mode is not possible to implement with existing protocols. However, it allows building distributed systems that do not require a central server to work. Besides architectural benefits, network emulations show that our protocol increases the efficiency of data transport by utilizing network-level multicast. Our proposed approach can keep up with current protocols which can be used for inter-server game state synchronization.}

Instead of being built on dedicated hardware (network appliances), network functions are now implemented as software components that run on top of general purpose hardware through virtualisation, namely virtualised network functions (VNFs). From this paradigm-shifting technology arise two problems: (i) how to place VNFs in an NFV-enabled network; and (ii) how to chain these VNFs. These problems are jointly referred to as the VNF forwarding graph embedding (VNF-FGE) problem. Having efficient solutions to the VNF-FGE problem is key to the success of NFV because placing and chaining VNFs automatically and efficiently reduces network and computing resources, thus reducing capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). In this work, we systematically review the literature on the VNF-FGE problem. We present a novel taxonomy for the classification and study of proposed solutions to this problem. Research challenges that remain unaddressed are also discussed, providing recommendations for future work.}

It is a common approach to employ multiple SDN controllers to form a physically distributed SDN to achieve better fault tolerance, boost scalability, and enhance performance. Despite physical distribution, since the notion behind SDN is to logically centralize network management, it is essential to provide a consistent view of the network’s state for all controllers. Deploying multiple controllers result in higher synchronization and deployment cost. Since network performance and inter-controller synchronization cost seem to be contradicting objectives, it is a research challenge to choose the best placement of SDN controllers to optimize both the performance and synchronization cost of an SDN-enabled WSN simultaneously.}

In this paper, we review research studies in literature about the design of radio frequency (RF) based wireless data center networks.

We analyzed and identified that the SAKA-FC suffers from some severe vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we presented an improved scheme to mitigate these problems while retaining its strengths. The formal security analysis of the proposed scheme is validated through BAN logic. At the same time, the AVISPA tool is employed for automated formal security verification. Informal security analysis is conducted to attest that the proposal can confront the known attacks. Using computation and communication costs as the metrics, the proposed scheme is also compared with some state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed scheme achieves the same communication cost as of SAKA-FC, whereas the difference in computation cost is 24%. This increase in computation cost is justifiable as the proposal is resistant to clogging attacks and provides better security than the prior schemes.}

	abstract = {As the large-scale application of software-defined networking (SDN), one major research challenge for the SDN is to place multi-controllers reasonably. The researchers have proposed a lot of good solutions to the controller placement problem (CPP). However, they usually chose the same type of controllers (called homogeneous controllers) and ignored the common-mode fault caused. To fill this gap, considering the heterogeneity of controllers and QoS, this paper first focuses on different types of controllers (heterogeneous controllers) and proposes a Heterogeneous Controller Placement Problem (HeCPP) to minimize network delay, balance heterogeneous controller utilization, and lower control plane fault rate. We introduce a Secure-aware and QoS-guaranteed Heterogeneous Controller Placement (SQHCP) approach to solve HeCPP effectively. Specifically, SQHCP consists of two steps. In step 1, the types and the number of heterogeneous controllers are determined based on dynamic planning to enhance the security of the control plane. After that, with the inspiration of the "divide and conquer" strategy, in step 2, the network is partitioned into several subnets based on the K-means clustering, and the genetic algorithm is improved to place the heterogeneous controller for each subnet to guarantee QoS. The theoretical analysis has proven the feasibility of SQHCP. Simulation shows that SQHCP not only degrades the control plane fault rate but also outperforms the existing approaches in terms of delays and load balancing.}

	abstract = {5G heterogeneous networks have become a promising platform to connect a growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and accommodate a wide variety of vertical services. IoT has not been limited to traditional sensing systems since the introduction of 5G, but also includes a range of autonomous moving platforms, e.g., autonomous flying vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous surface vehicles as well as autonomous land vehicles. These platforms can be used as an effective means to connect air, space, ground, and sea mobile networks for providing a wider diversity of Internet services. Deep learning has been widely used to extract useful information from network big data for enhancing network quality-of-service and user quality-of-experience. Privacy preservation for user and network data is a burning concern in 5G heterogeneous networks due to various attacks in this environment. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation on how deep learning can cope with privacy preservation issues in 5G heterogeneous networks, in terms of heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs), beyond-RAN networks, and end-to-end network slices, followed by a set of key research challenges and open issues that aim to guide future research.}

	abstract = {The management of multilayer networks is often a complex task, since each layer is typically independently operated and maintained, and there is a lack of shared network resource knowledge between layers. In this work, we have illustrated that Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms can be a suitable solution for coordinated management of disjoint IP and optical layers with limited or no visibility between the control planes of each layer. ACO algorithms are used to achieve fully-distributed multilayer routing policies in IP-over-optical networks. Simulations have demonstrated that ACO-based policies can achieve lower levels of blocking probability and higher levels of restorability for IP connections compared to fixed-alternate routing policies in almost all cases. This better performance is achieved with only small increases in the connection setup and restoration times, and without requiring a significant amount of communication overhead.}
