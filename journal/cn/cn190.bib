	abstract = {Anomaly detection is a classic problem on complex networks. An anomaly detection method based on network projection is proposed in this study on networks with fundamental bipartite connection relationships and repeated interactions, such as the Internet and computer networks. First of all, two network partition algorithms are advanced to discover the bipartite structure of the network. Then, put forward a similarity metric based on the cosine similarity function to construct the projection network. Finally, the metrics of vertices in the projection network are used as input of the one-class SVM algorithm to detect anomalies. Experiments on simulation datasets and real datasets illustrate that our method achieves higher precision in identifying anomalous addresses than traditional approaches for large-scale Internet and computer networks with the bipartite structure.}

	abstract = {Wireless video surveillance has become increasingly prevalent due to the rapid development of cellular communication technology and the low deployment cost of cellular surveillance cameras. However, it is still a challenging task to deliver high-quality low-latency surveillance videos in resource-limited cellular networks due to the fluctuating characteristics of wireless channels. In this paper, we consider a wireless video surveillance system consisting of one base station and multiple cellular surveillance cameras, which upload their videos to the base station. To optimize the long-term system performance in terms of surveillance video quality and latency, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem that jointly considers video rate control and uplink resource allocation. The formulation captures the tradeoff between video quality and delivery latency while considering the different time scales of video rate control and channel resource allocation. With the application of Lyapunov optimization, we transform the problem into a sequence of per-slot deterministic problems, and propose an online joint rate control and resource allocation algorithm to solve these per-slot problems. Specifically, the proposed algorithm decomposes each of the per-slot problems into two independent subproblems, namely, the rate control subproblem at large time scale and the uplink resource allocation subproblem at small time scale. We derive the closed-form solution for the rate control subproblem, and design a fast-convergent iterative algorithm to solve the uplink resource allocation subproblem optimally. We prove the asymptotical optimality of our proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can well balance the surveillance video quality and delivery latency.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the mobile edge computing (MEC) resource allocation problem from the view of operating systems (OSs). To be more specific, we consider a multi-OS MEC resource allocation problem, where end users (EUs)/fog nodes (FNs) have different OSs. The main obstacle of the problem is the heterogeneity. First, for EUs, according to their OSs’ properties, EUs can be mainly categorized into soft real-time EUs and hard real-time EUs. Second, there exists different OSs for FNs. Thus, a unified FNs’ qualification constraint may be in need to develop. This constraint should be applicable for diverse FNs. Third, although the conventional proportional fairness is a universal fairness criterion for the service provider (SP) to allocate resources for different EUs, the specified proportions which guarantee the service quality are seemed hard to be developed. Therefore, a user satisfaction mechanism (USM) is proposed to first denote the different requirements between soft real-time and hard real-time applications of EUs, and second test whether FNs are qualified for the MEC service. In addition, a novel p-fairness is designed for the differentiated and quality-guaranteed services provided by SPs. Then, the USM and p-fairness driven MEC resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, where we propose a variable-substitution convexity transformation (VSCT) scheme to tackle it. In VSCT, we first utilize the variable substitution to transform the integer variables’ quadric constraints to linear constraints. Then, we relax several constraints and the problem is transformed as a convex optimization problem which is solved iteratively. Finally, we analyze the upper and lower bounds of the proposed VSCT. In the simulation, we discuss the performances of USM and p-fairness (i.e., user satisfaction). Moreover, we compare VSCT with the existing optimization method (i.e., branch & bound). Finally, we demonstrate some interesting properties of our proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to promote the idea that including semantic and goal-oriented aspects in future 6G networks can produce a significant leap forward in terms of system effectiveness and sustainability. Semantic communication goes beyond the common Shannon paradigm of guaranteeing the correct reception of each single transmitted bit, irrespective of the meaning conveyed by the transmitted bits. The idea is that, whenever communication occurs to convey meaning or to accomplish a goal, what really matters is the impact that the received bits have on the interpretation of the meaning intended by the transmitter or on the accomplishment of a common goal. Focusing on semantic and goal-oriented aspects, and possibly combining them, helps to identify the relevant information, i.e. the information strictly necessary to recover the meaning intended by the transmitter or to accomplish a goal. Combining knowledge representation and reasoning tools with machine learning algorithms paves the way to build semantic learning strategies enabling current machine learning algorithms to achieve better interpretation capabilities and contrast adversarial attacks. 6G semantic networks can bring semantic learning mechanisms at the edge of the network and, at the same time, semantic learning can help 6G networks to improve their efficiency and sustainability.}

	abstract = {The main objective of Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) is to steer traffic exiting one Autonomous System (AS) to another in the most cost-effective way by assigning network traffic flows of different destinations to internal routes specific to every AS. The traffic assignment process is carried out to satisfy network operators’ objectives ,which include optimizing resource utilization, minimizing monetary costs and avoiding overloading the peer links. Due to network traffic dynamicity and unpredictability, traffic assignments should be constantly updated so that the aforementioned objectives are satisfied. Each of these updates results in traffic assignment changes that transition the network to a more optimized state. Executing these changes all at once is detrimental to the internal network infrastructure. To tackle this issue, this work targets finding execution plans involving several intermediate steps whereby each step includes a subset of traffic assignment changes. While executing these steps, the network operator’s objectives need to be guaranteed. To that end, an oracle algorithm that generates all the possible balanced subsets of traffic changes as execution plans is formulated. This algorithm is compared to two heuristics that are designed based on an analytical study of the problem itself. To effectively evaluate these algorithms, evaluation criteria are devised that encompass several technical and design quality metrics of the desired execution plan. These three approaches are evaluated on network configurations of small size networks, and the results obtained show that one of the heuristics outperforms the oracle implementation in terms of execution time while producing comparable results based on the evaluation criteria. For big networks, the best performing heuristic satisfies the quality metrics and generates its best execution plan in a short period of time.}

	abstract = {Due to the aging of current water infrastructure and the increased demand for water resources, water distribution systems encounter several problems such as pipes leaks and bursts, water contamination or pollution, and water optimization issues. To cope with these issues, access to water-related data and information related to the water grid is fundamental in order to build sophisticated strategies for water management. Integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the current water infrastructure is one viable solution to access to water-related data. This new infrastructure that integrates ICT into the water distribution system is called Smart Water Grid (SWG). The information layer of the SWG requires well-suited communication networks. This paper reviews wireless communication technologies that can be exploited for the implementation of SWG applications. The paper mainly focuses on the exploration of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) that promise to overcome problems confronted by communication technologies used currently in SWG applications. Some of the wireless technologies used in SWG applications suffer from high power consumption issues while others are limited in terms of communication range. For future SWG applications, in this work we recommend LPWAN technologies due to their low power consumption, long communication range and excellent radio penetration. A range of challenges and research directions regarding the recommended LPWANs is also discussed.}

	abstract = {The ability to locate a radio transmitter can be useful in many contexts, and a range of localization methods have been proposed. In the context of cellular networks, the position of the base station is known to the operator and regulator, but often this knowledge is not publicly available. For the problem of base station localization, several approaches have been examined in the literature, and several public services exists which estimate the position of cellular infrastructure based on measurement data collected from cellular users. In this work we present sector fitting, a new approach for locating sectorized transmitters based only on observations of the positions and sector identifiers as reported by the cellular UEs. Sector fitting defines a sectorization model which is applied over a search grid to obtain a cost matrix, which is then merged over multiple frequencies to arrive at the best base station location estimate. An extensive evaluation of sector fitting is carried out, using a large data set of observations from train-mounted LTE modems. The results show that sector fitting outperforms the other applicable localization methods. Furthermore, an iterative grid search approach is examined and demonstrated to achieve the same localization accuracy as a full search while drastically reducing the computational cost. Finally, three downsampling methods are evaluated with the results showing that a trade-off can be made to further reduce computational cost, but with slightly worse localization accuracy in most cases.}

During communication, path losses are mostly experienced because of base station distances and walls separating the communicating devices, which ultimately affects coverage and quality of service adversely.  This study proposes an efficient channel allocation scheme (ECA) and compared with light channel (LCA), stern channel (SCA) and open channel allocation (OCA) schemes to ascertain the most optimal. These schemes assign frequencies such that interference is diminished significantly after femtocells, femto-users, and macro-users have been deployed randomly within the macro-cell coverage area. Results show higher capacities for macro-femto edge users (105 Mbps) compared to macro-femto center users (11 Mbps) with the proposed algorithm (ECA) emerging as the most optimal in both cases. Deployment of 30 macro-femto edge users records a failure probability of 0.11 for the proposed scheme, 0.17 for OCA, 0.19 for LCA, and 0.29 for SCA which is much lower compared to center users. It was observed that 50% of the edge users recorded downlink interference of 0.8 dBm for proposed, 1.3 dBm for OCA, 1.6 dBm for LCA, and 1.7 dBm for SCA which is much reduced compared to center users.}

	abstract = {The 5G technology includes innovative network services that allow vertical players to boost their service portfolio in critical application areas currently not suitably addressed by 4G systems. However, these improvements in both flexibility and performance have some consequences in terms of complexity. Indeed, 5G networks are quite complex systems, and require specific skills on network virtualization and cloud services for taking full advantage of their potential. This may represent a hard entrance barrier for vertical stakeholders willing to deploy new services on 5G networks. Thus, it becomes necessary to introduce some simplified approaches for implementing and deploying services in 5G edge clouds. We propose a solution based on the usage of simple yet flexible service templates, named blueprints. Such templates can be easily filled by vertical players by specifying just the main entities of their service. Each template allows specifying not only the raw structure of a service running in a virtualized infrastructure, but also how to test it in a variety of realistic network conditions. Our proposed tool processes blueprints and translates them into detailed network configuration. This way, verticals are unaware of the underlying operations, saving a significant amount of programming effort. In order to show the effectiveness of our solution and to ease the understanding of technical details, we make use of a vertical service related to the area of pedestrian traffic monitoring in smart cities as a running example. We express the effort saving by means of the well-known COCOMO model, which shows a reduction of about 70% or even more of the programming effort from the vertical.}

	abstract = {Power Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (PD-NOMA) is a potential technology for the next generation of cellular networks. Compared to classical orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, PD-NOMA leverages the distinct channel gains of users for multiplexing different signals in a single resource block (time, frequency, code) in power domain. This results in higher spectral efficiency, improved user fairness, better cell-edge throughput, increased reliability and connectivity and low-latency. The flexible combination of PD-NOMA with existing and emerging technologies such as heterogeneous networks (HetNets), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive MIMO, cooperative communication, cognitive radios (CRs), millimeter wave communication, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), visible light communication (VLC), mobile edge computing (MEC), intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), underwater communication etc., is expected to cause further enhancements in performance. Existing survey papers on NOMA mainly focus on its concept, comparison, issues and analysis without any categorization of different techniques to solve the issues related to it. This survey paper highlights the main issues and constraints of resource allocation, signaling, practical implementation and security aspects of NOMA and its integration with 5G and upcoming wireless technologies. Various solutions have been proposed in the literature that involve optimization, analytical, game theory, matching theory, graph theory and machine learning (ML) techniques. We present an in-depth analysis and comparison of these solutions with key insights emphasizing the feasibility and applicability for a qualitative analysis. We finally identify promising future research directions and challenges in the context of PD-NOMA’s application to the existing 5G and next generation wireless networks.}

	abstract = {With the advance of the ubiquity of GPS-equipped smartphones, mobile advertising has become more prevalent and location-aware. In mobile advertising systems, vendors have limited budget, and mobile users have limited capacity to receive ads. Existing systems simply send users the ads with largest utility scores. Unfortunately, the major limitation of this approach is that, the ads received by a particular user may belong to the same category (e.g., Chinese Food, Shopping Mall). We argue that diversity is a very important feature for location-based advertising, since it helps users discover new places and activities. In this paper, we propose D-AdFeed, a diversity-aware mobile advertising framework that maximizes the overall utility of assigning ads to each user under the constraints that the ads received by a particular user should belong to different categories. We formulate the problem as a generalized multi-constraint multi-choice knapsack problem. and propose a genetic approach as well as a greedy algorithm to solve it. Moreover, we consider the online scenario of the problem and propose a dynamic hybrid mutation genetic algorithm for it. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform the brute-force optimal algorithm by at least an order of magnitude in terms of the running time while the relative error of the utility score is acceptable. In general, D-AdFeed improves the utility, diversity and efficiency of recommending the ads to mobile users.}

	abstract = {The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables the interconnection of machines, devices, resources, and computing technologies to improve the reliability of manufacturing services. The role of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are exploited in the IIoT environment to ensure effective management and computing resource utilization. Based on the SDN and NFV paradigms, this article introduces a novel elastic computing resource virtualization (ECRV) method to improve the flexibility of resource management in the IIoT. The need for virtualization is obtained by identifying the control and process platforms used in industrial task management. Support vector machine-based classification learning is used to achieve balanced identification, and prevents unnecessary distribution of limited resources, Support vector machine helps to retain flexibility in task control processes that use available industrial resources. By separating the process and control platforms, service dissemination is improved and backlogs in task processing are decreased. The proposed method could provide flexible virtualization and reduces the service response time and task failure.}

	abstract = {With the development of data processing technologies, efficiency of information processing in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is greatly improved. In this situation solving the following security problems of the IIoT is the top priority. In IIoT based smart grid, through Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology various types of text data such as the equipment status and historical records can be better utilized. While bringing great help to the extraction of useful information, NLP technology also raises security concerns. In this paper, we present how text adversarial attacks can cause security problems in IIoT based smart grid, which may lead to serious consequences in some scenarios. Specifically, we develop the Important Sentences Perturbed and Encoder/Decoder (ISPED), a novel text adversarial attack algorithm for natural language classification models on the sentence-level. We select sentences that have more influence on the results to disturb while keeping the semantics basically unchanged to reduce smart grid workers’ perception of the attack. Experiments on different datasets and models show that our attacking method can effectively reduce the classification accuracy. Meanwhile, by comparing the original examples with the adversarial examples, we demonstrate that the semantics of the examples remain basically the same.}

	abstract = {The adoption of Software Defined Networking (SDN) has encountered resistance mainly due to its disruptive nature for current deployed networks. In order to allow a smoother transition of SDN into production networks and take advantage of SDN’s characteristics, a mix of SDN with traditional networks, or Hybrid SDN Networks, can be deployed, paving the path to fully SDN-capable networks. The introduction of SDN allows for new and more efficient network optimization methods. This paper presents a Hybrid SDN Mobile Core Network for 4G and Non-Standalone 5G, which integrates support for Wi-Fi access, traffic offloading capabilities from 3GPP to non-3GPP Access and dynamic non-3GPP network slice instantiation, while still being flexible enough to be used in Standalone 5G. Results showed that the virtualization of the Mobile Core Network and the introduction of SDN in its architecture (making it a hybrid SDN solution) presented no significant impact in latency, attachment time and throughput in the mobile network when compared with a traditional deployment, coupling it with all the flexibility that SDN provides. Furthermore, benefits of traffic offloading for both the end user and the network operator are also shown.}

	abstract = {Job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) is used to determine the processing order of the jobs and is a typical scheduling problem in smart manufacturing. Considering the dynamics and the uncertainties such as machine breakdown and job rework of the job-shop environment, it is essential to flexibly adjust the scheduling strategy according to the current state. Traditional methods can only obtain the optimal solution at the current time and need to rework if the state changes, which leads to high time complexity. To address the issue, this paper proposes a dynamic scheduling method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the proposed method, we adopt the proximal policy optimization (PPO) to find the optimal policy of the scheduling to deal with the dimension disaster of the state and action space caused by the increase of the problem scale. Compared with the traditional scheduling methods, the experimental results show that the proposed method can not only obtain comparative results but also can realize adaptive and real-time production scheduling.}

	abstract = {Industrial production performance relies on the efficiency of the machines and the effective management of the allocated jobs. Job allocation and workflow management are significant tasks in the industrial environment. This paper introduces a novel job processing framework for the industrial environment aided by Network-in-Box (NIB). The process control layer of the industry environment and NIB architecture is coupled to manage job allocation and process handling. Considering the functional machines' completion time, Q-learning based efficiency assessment is performed for different states of the operating machines. By pre-determining the forms of the machines, the efficiency and job allocation of the machines are determined. This prediction based job processing framework is reliable in offloading allocated jobs to the machines with high efficiency as per the NIB architecture's decision-controls. This prediction is sent as a control to the process layer to give the jobs or handle sequential jobs in the industrial environment. The active machines' fault tolerance is observed and assessed using their physical attributes and output of the previous session.Knowing the states of the machines is useful in predicting the efficiency of the machines and hence, the machines will be able to complete the allocated and offloaded jobs in time.In the experimental analysis, the machines' processing rate is 1 log per hour, and the efficiency of the machines is monitored over 24 hours of operation in 2 days.}

	abstract = {In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in the 5G era, the growth of smart devices will generate a large amount of data traffic, bringing a huge challenge of network traffic classification, which is the prerequisite of IIoT traffic engineering, quality of service (QoS), cyberspace security, etc. It is difficult for current traffic classification methods to distinguish encrypted dataflow and design effective handcraft features. In this paper, a novel identification scheme of encrypted traffic, TSCRNN, is proposed to automatically extract features for efficient traffic classification, which is based on spatiotemporal features. TSCRNN includes the preprocessing phase and the classification phase. In the preprocessing phase, raw traffic data are processed with flow segmentation, sampling, and vectorization, etc. To solve the classification problem of long time flow, sampling strategies are used to collect samples from the middle of the long-lived flow. In the classification phase, TSCRNN extracts abstract spatial features by CNN and then introduces stack bidirectional LSTM to learn the temporal characteristics. The experiments were performed on the dataset ISCXTor2016. The experimental results show that TSCRNN outperforms other typical methods in all scenarios, which achieves the accuracy up to 99.4% and 95.0% respectively in Tor/nonTor binary classification tasks and sixteen classification tasks. Furthermore, TSCRNN is applied to other real network datasets obtained the satisfactory performance, which validates its feasibility and universality. It means that TSCRNN can effectively identify encrypted and anonymous traffic, provide a fine-grained traffic characterization mechanism, which will support the development of core technologies in the Industrial Internet of Things.}

	abstract = {Mobile Health (mHealth) technology facilitates patients’ care and decreases healthcare costs by remotely monitoring healthcare processes and medical data management. Nonetheless, there are many concerns regarding the security, privacy, and anonymity of the mHealth transactions. Conventionally, privacy includes anonymity, untraceability, unlinkability, unforgeability, and confidentiality. Transactions’ confidentiality can be easily protected using confidential transaction techniques. However, anonymity, untraceability, unlinkability, and unforgeability properties are quite challenging issues in healthcare transactions. This paper proposes a UDP-based anonymous protocol for mHealth transactions to protect the security of data and privacy of clients’ identities. In this work, we aim to investigate utilizing one of the best anonymity solutions, onion structure (onion encryption, onion routing, and onion network), with blockchain smart contracts upon the UDP platform to make a protocol for transferring data in IoT-based mHealth applications. In the proposed protocol, every malicious client who sends false data can be easily detected using an identity disclosure process. In this way, mHealth clients, without exchanging sensitive identities, can establish an authorized connection and be protected against different kinds of attacks. According to our experimental results and security/privacy proofs, the proposed protocol has an acceptable computational cost and security protections for IoT-based mHealth transactions.}
