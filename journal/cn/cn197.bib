	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the widespread adoption of Cloud Computing (CC) across automotive industries for a myriad of vehicular applications. A vehicular network that solely relies on CC, however, is susceptible to end-to-end latency due to the round-trip between data sources and cloud servers. Alternatively, the computing capability has been considered at the edge of vehicular network to achieve real-time analytics. Despite that, such consideration poses new questions on how data is offloaded and cached among the edge nodes and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in the environment of Vehicular Edge Network (VEN). In this paper, we outlined the aspects of VEN, particularly Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), together with its architecture, layers, communications, and applications that are involved in the computation offloading (ComOf) and content caching and delivery (CachDel) scenarios. We extensively reviewed the existing approaches in solving ComOf and CachDel problems for the respective VEC architecture. The security aspect in ComOf and CachDel were critically discussed as well in the paper. Finally, we highlighted some key challenges, open issues, and future works of ComOf and CachDel in VEC.}

	abstract = {Energy efficiency is a key challenging task while designing routing model in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Various energy efficiency routing approaches are designed to transfer the data packets in a secure path through cluster head (CH), but to increase the lifespan of network and to maintain high scalability poses a complex task in WSN environment. Hence, an energy efficient and trust based routing model is designed using proposed Exponentially-Ant Lion Whale Optimization (E-ALWO) algorithm to route the data packets to receiver. However, the E-ALWO algorithm is derived by the integration of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) concept with Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) and Whale Optimization algorithm (WOA), respectively. However, the proposed model performs the routing process through CH such that the selection of CH is made using ALWO algorithm based on the constraints, namely energy and delay. The optimal and the secure route used for the data transferring process is computed using proposed E-ALWO algorithm based on the fitness measure. The fitness function considers the factors, namely energy, trust, delay, and distance. Moreover, the path with maximal fitness value is accepted as the routing path, by which the data is forwarded to sink node through CH. The average performance measure achieved by the proposed method by considering without attack scenario in terms of delay, residual energy, throughput, and trust is 0.1484sec, 0.4998J, 42984kbps, and 0.5885.}

	abstract = {Future wireless networks will be facing unprecedented difficulties arising from mobile traffic growth, network densification, as well as diversification of applications and services. Indeed, future user devices are expected to integrate diverse radio interfaces such as 5G, WBAN or IoT, enabling each user to be served a wide range of applications at any time. This poses significant challenges in terms of wireless resource sharing and interference management, as more and more stringent Quality of Service (QoS) constraints should be jointly satisfied in dense interfering environments. Furthermore, future networks are expected to be highly autonomous and decentralized. To meet these challenges, this work proposes distributed user-to-multiple Access Points (AP) association methods, where the objective is to maximize the long-term sum-rate subject to application QoS constraints, as well as to AP load constraints. Our distributed methods enable each user to leverage their Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) capabilities, in particular Deep Q-Learning (DQL), to self-optimize their APs’ selection solely based on their local network state knowledge, so as to best satisfy their diverse requirements. Numerical results show that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed methods enable global throughput enhancements while reducing user QoS outage probabilities, even in large and dense networks.}

	abstract = {Flow routing is one of the most important issues in a software defined network (SDN), and faces various challenges. For example, each link may not be reliable all the time (or with a failure probability), and the flow-table size on each switch is limited. Existing solutions about reliable flow routing may result in a longer failure recovery delay, a large number of flow entries or massive control overhead. To this end, we propose to achieve throughput optimization with the constraint that the forwarding reliability probability of each switch pair should exceed a threshold (e.g., 99.9%). We formally define the reliable flow routing (RLFR) problem with flow-table size constraint. We present a rounding-based algorithm and analyze its approximation performance. We further extend our algorithm to preserve the throughput of each switch pair even with link failures. We implement our proposed algorithms on the SDN platform. The experimental results and large-scale network simulation results show that our algorithms can improve the network throughput by about 48.0% and reduce the maximum number of required flow entries by about 53.1%, compared with the existing solutions under the reliability requirement.}

	abstract = {While proceeding towards the age of Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is going to play an indispensable role in the overall networking architecture. Applications like health care, smart-city etc. are extensively using WSN frameworks to collect and analyse real-time data along with taking necessary actions based on the application’s requirements. While designing the routing protocol for WSN, the uniqueness and requirements of the application have the potential to play a dominant role. Generalizing the networking framework while ignoring application-specific requirements would lead towards designing an inefficient routing protocol. Considering these scenarios, we have proposed an application-specific routing protocol for the health care which would ensure the increase in network lifetime while maintaining the maximum throughput in data transmission. The proposed routing protocol has shown an improved performance in terms of metrics like throughput, network lifetime, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio and packet loss while comparing with some of the traditional routing protocols e.g. Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks and Collection Tree Protocol.}

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) connects a large number of industrial objects to the Internet that requires a higher level of control in terms of reliability, low power, and delay. IEEE 802.15.4e is the standard of the IIoT and includes time-synchronized channel hopping mechanisms to allow multiple communications. It controls the medium access operations using a time–frequency schedule. However, TSCH (Time Slotted Channel Hopping) specification does not specify how to build an optimized schedule. In this paper, we propose a distributed channel hopping scheme by providing an analytical model for the exploitation of Latin rectangles to avoid interference and collisions. Indeed, Latin rectangles are used to perform the scheduling process, where rows present the channel offsets and columns for slot offsets. Thus, the frequency of communication is derived using Latin rectangles, which prevents the scheduling function of nodes from considering channels already allocated in their neighborhood. Consequently, interference and multi-path fading are mitigated with more reliability and robustness. Markov chain model for the queue on every node is introduced and takes the bulk arrivals and the slot distribution into account. We analyze the efficiency of this algorithm by analytical techniques and extensive simulations for three bulk arrivals: Poisson, Bernoulli, and Geometric.}

However, the error propagation problem in NC resulting from the encoding on the Network layer makes the error-correcting process performed classically on the Physical layer very expensive in terms of computational resources, especially when the rank of the errors is relatively high. In this paper we define Error Correction Network Coding (ECNC), a new approach to error correction for the Network layer in NC based schemes which introduces redundancy in the time domain instead of the space domain as it is the case for error-correcting solutions proposed for NC. We describe the encoding and decoding algorithms and give examples of both linear and non-linear ECNCs, then we discuss their error detection and correcting capacities. Furthermore, we show that ECNCs can be used jointly with the space domain error-correcting codes proposed for NC.}

	abstract = {Emerging technological innovation toward e-Health transition is a worldwide priority for ensuring people’s quality of life. Hence, secure exchange and analysis of medical data amongst diverse organizations would increase the efficiency of e-Health systems toward elevating medical phenomena such as outbreaks and acute patients’ disorders. However, medical data exchange is challenging since issues, such as privacy, security, and latency may arise. Thus, this paper introduces Healthchain-RL, an adaptive, intelligent, consortium, and secure Blockchain-powered health system employing artificial intelligence, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Blockchain and DRL technologies show their robust performance in different fields, including healthcare systems. The proposed Healthchain-RL framework aggregates heterogeneous healthcare organizations with different requirements using the power of Blockchain while maintaining an optimized framework via an online intelligent decision-making RL algorithm. Hence, an intelligent Blockchain Manager (BM) was proposed based on the DRL, mainly Deep Q-Learning and it is variations, to optimizes the Blockchain network’s behavior in real-time while considering medical data requirements, such as urgency and security levels. The proposed BM works toward intelligently changing the blockchain configuration while optimizing the trade-off between security, latency, and cost. The optimization model is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved effectively using three RL-based techniques. These three techniques are Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN), and Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN). Finally, a comprehensive comparison is conducted between the proposed techniques and two heuristic approaches. The proposed strategies converge in real-time adaptivity to the system status while maintaining maximum security and minimum latency and cost.}

	abstract = {Due to the huge amount of traffic passing in an Elastic Optical Network (EON), an unpredictable failure may lead to loss of huge amount of data. It is important to have an efficient strategy to recover the affected connections within the smallest possible time and restoring the whole requested bandwidth. In this paper, a proactive restoration mechanism with low re-provisioning (PR-LR) time is proposed that can fast the recovery process of the disrupted connections by precomputing some parts of the recovery phase. In addition, the PR-LR mechanism requires fewer redundant resources than dedicated-based algorithms and provides low computing load. The PR-LR algorithm decreases the computing load by computing the backup paths of delay-sensitive connections before failure on the best-effort resources, but it does not reserve these backup paths until a failure occurs. The simulation results demonstrate that the PR-LR mechanism can reduce the computing load almost 86% at high traffic loads and 96% at low traffic loads in comparison to the FR-TP algorithm proposed in [1].}

	abstract = {Routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem, in elastic optical networks, searches for a route and a sufficient spectrum range to fit each network request. Solving these two problems simultaneously is a complex work. Therefore, they are usually assumed separately by either solving the routing firstly and then the spectrum assignment for this selected route or prioritizing some spectral ranges and then searching for a route that meets such spectrum requirements. The former strategy prioritizes the reduction on the network occupation by using short routes first, while the latter emphasizes load distribution and a more efficient spectrum organization. According to some aspects, such as network topology, number of alternative routes, traffic intensity and number of available slots, emphasizing either set of benefits results in superior advantage. This paper presents a comprehensive study about RSA ordering strategies and proposes a hybrid resource-allocation ordering approach to decide between either strategy. RSA ordering means performing spectrum assignment in function of routing or performing routing in function of some candidate spectrum ranges pre-computed by some SA algorithm criteria An efficient metaheuristic based on genetic algorithm is proposed to implement this strategy, named hybrid routing and spectrum assignment (HRSA). The proposed algorithm returns the most suitable RSA ordering choice for each source–destination pair, which provides near-lowest path-request blocking probability. Simulation results show that the RSA ordering returned by the proposed HRSA reduces the path-request blocking probability up to 35% in comparison to the classical RSA orderings.}

This drives towards a complex 5G ecosystem enabled by Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and promoted by multiple business collaborations which draw new threats and vulnerabilities that are yet to be explored. Thus, we explore in this survey the complexity of the 5G ecosystem and derive a 5G telecommunication business model driven by 5G enabling technologies. We use this business model to identify new attack surface and security threats introduced by multiple business collaborations supported by NFV which we overview. Further, we delineate a three dimensional threat taxonomy for NFV-based 5G networks that leverages NFV architecture and deployment use cases in light of different 5G business collaboration scenarios. Finally, we shed light on insightful future research directions towards providing enhanced security in NFV-based 5G networks.}

In this paper, we consider the problem of beamforming and user clustering (user-to-Remote Radio Head (RRH) association) in the downlink of a H-CRAN where users have heterogeneous mobility profiles. Given the rapidly time-varying nature of the mobile wireless environment, it is challenging to offer an optimal beamforming and user association performance during a long-term allocation process without incurring large Channel State Information (CSI) and signaling overheads. For that purpose, we proposed in Ha et al. (2019) an Adaptive Beamforming and User Clustering (ABUC) algorithm which resolves the joint beamforming and user clustering problem when considering CSI cost and imperfectness under user mobility assumptions. In this paper, we design a deep reinforcement-learning framework which enables the proposed ABUC algorithm to select on-the-fly its best feedback scheduling parameters}

	abstract = {The Internet has evolved from a hierarchical and multi-tiered interconnection network to a meshed network, where autonomous systems (ASes) are interconnected with a dense topology and more and more potential paths can be used to reach a destination. However, routing policies are the key to enable these potential paths and to allow the selection of these paths. While the Gao–Rexford guidelines provide routing policies that derive a safe routing system, those potential paths are not enabled by the Gao–Rexford guidelines. A survey on deployed routing policies has shown that a significant portion of networks or ASes do not follow the Gao–Rexford guidelines completely. In this paper, we propose to broaden routing policies that enable the availability of diverse paths and provide flexibility in selecting these paths. We systematically bring out more and more flexible routing policies to implement various routing requirements. More specifically, we propose FlexibleRC, PeerBoost and hierarchical sibling routing policies and derive sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the routing system derived by these routing policies to be safe. The sufficient conditions can be verified through coordination among neighboring ASes. Thus, local coordination guarantees the routing system to be safe.}

	abstract = {The routing in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) has become a challenging issue due to several problems. First, in UASN, the distance between the nodes changes due to their mobility with the water current, thus increasing the network’s energy consumption. Second problem in UASNs is the occurrence of the void hole, which affects the network’s performance. Because nodes are unable to deliver data towards the destination due to the absence of forwarder nodes (FNs) in the network. Thus, the objective of routing in UASNs is to overcome the issues mentioned earlier to prolong the network’s lifetime. Therefore, a Q-learning based energy-efficient and balanced data gathering (QL-EEBDG) routing protocol is proposed in this paper. In QL-EEBDG, the FNs are selected according to their residual energy and grouped according to their neighboring nodes’ energies. Using energy as the main selection parameter assures efficient energy consumption in the network. Moreover, efficient selection of the FNs increases the lifetime of the network. However, the void node recovery process fails when the topology of the network is changed. Therefore, to avoid void holes in QL-EEBDG, a QL-EEBDG adjacent node (QL-EEBDG-ADN) scheme is proposed. It finds alternate neighbor routes for packet transmission and ensures continuous communication in the network. Extensive simulations are carried out for the performance evaluation of the proposed technique with existing baseline protocols, namely efficient balanced energy consumption based data gathering (EBDG), enhanced EBDG (EEBDG) and QELAR. The performance parameters used in the simulations are network lifetime, energy tax, network stability period and packet delivery ratio (PDR). The simulation results depict that the proposed QL-EEBDG-ADN outperforms the baseline protocols by approximately 11% better PDR and 25% better energy tax.}

Owing to the ready evasion of the DNS traffic to bypass the network security mechanism, DNS tunnelling can cause severe damage. Thus, an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the various detection technologies is of considerable importance when facing this type of threat. However, most of the existing reviews focus on a single aspect of the DNS tunnel detection technologies, such as methods based on machine learning, traffic, and payload analysis. In addition, few studies have conducted comprehensive investigation that includes a sequentially integrated range of literature in this researchfield, or have analysed the latest literature on DNS tunnels. This paper reviews these detection technologies from a novel perspective of rule-based and model-based methods with descriptions and analyses of the DNS-based tools and their corresponding features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively discuss and analyse DNS tunnel detection in a novel and specific classification fashion from various aspects in detail, covering almost all the detection methods developed from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of detection methods and several suggestions for future research directions are presented.}

	abstract = {As a novel network paradigm, software-defined networking (SDN) is capable of simplifying network management and offering flexible support to various user services. In order to meet the rapidly increasing transmission demands of SDN switches, the controller deployment strategy in an SDN scenario should be designed. In this paper, we investigate the capacitated controller deployment problem for SDN. Consider the signaling transmission and processing performance of switches and address the worst-case performance, we define network response time (NRT) as the maximum control plane response time of switches. Then aiming to achieve the tradeoff between NRT and the cost of controllers, we introduce the concept of network cost which is defined as the weighted sum of NRT and controller cost. The capacitated controller deployment problem is formulated as a constrained network cost minimization problem. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a two-stage heuristic algorithm, which first tackles the controller deployment subproblem under the unlimited capacity constraint, and then solves controller-type matching subproblem. Specifically, during the first stage, a minimum eccentricity-based controller deployment algorithm is designed to determine the number and location of controllers as well as the association strategy between controllers and switches. During the second stage, a greedy method-based controller-type matching strategy is proposed to determine the types of deployed controllers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results certify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

However, data providers usually suffer from the privacy leakage caused by direct data sharing. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a Federated Learning based Secure data Sharing mechanism for IoT, named FL2S. Specifically, to accomplish efficient and secure data sharing, a hierarchical asynchronous federated learning (FL) framework is developed based on the sensitive task decomposition. In addition, to improve data sharing quality, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is utilized to select participants of sufficient computational capabilities and high quality datasets. By integrating task decomposition and participant selection, reliable data sharing is realized by sharing local data models instead of the source data with data privacy preserved. Experiment results show that the proposed FL2S achieves high accuracy in secure data sharing for various IoT applications.}

In today’s risky network environment, the ability to accurately detect anomalous data is an important task for intrusion detection. In an intrusion detection system, each piece of data contains multiple features. However, not every feature will determine the nature of the data, on the contrary, too many features will affect the model’s judgment. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection model of a deep capsule network based on an attention mechanism. The model uses a deep capsule network to enhance the extraction of features, and the attention mechanism is carried out to make the model focus on the features with large influences. The features are captured in multiple directions by a double routing algorithm and two strategies are adopted to stabilize the dynamic routing process. Finally, experiments are conducted on the intrusion detection dataset with good results.}

	abstract = {Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) has been widely employed in production datacenter networks (DCNs) to deliver high throughput and low latency communications. Despite being successful, the drawback of ECN-based transports is that they always mark the packets in the tail of the queue. We call this ECN marking scheme as TM-ECN (tail mark ECN). TM-ECN leads to long ECN feedback delay, significant queue oscillation, and poor short-flow friendliness. In this paper, we reveal these problems by leveraging extensive simulations to explore the intrinsic drawback of TM-ECN. Using the guidelines learned from the exploration, we design FM-ECN (front mark ECN) and RM-ECN (random mark ECN), two simple yet effective ECN marking schemes to mitigate the drawbacks. We theoretically analyze the TM-ECN, FM-ECN, and RM-ECN in the ECN feedback delay, queue stability, and short-flow friendliness. Finally, the conclusions from the analysis inspire us to propose a mixed mark ECN (MM-ECN) marking scheme. With the advantages of FM-ECN and RM-ECN, MM-ECN can maximize the effect of ECN. We further implement these ECN marking schemes in Linux kernel and ns-3 to evaluate them through testbed experiments and large-scale simulations. Our experimental results show that DCTCP with an appropriate ECN marking scheme achieves up to 55% higher concurrency tolerance of incast, and achieves up to 16% (25%) lower average (99th percentile) flow completion time (FCT) of short flows while delivering similar FCT for mid/large flows under production workloads.}

The vast amount of data generated by these devices must be controlled totally securely. The centralized solutions are not capable of responding to these concerns due to security challenges and scalability problems. Thus, blockchain technology is an effective solution, and the “distributed” method has been employed to overcome these concerns to allow for entirely secure communication between devices. The present paper proposes a technique consisting of two steps. The first step deals with the authentication of each node using the identity-based signature to secure communication between devices on a blockchain platform. In the second step, blocks are sent by hashing. For this purpose, the identities of the devices have been used as public keys. The theory analysis and simulation results indicated the superiority of the proposed method in terms of average detection rate, throughput, scalability, time spent on block authentication, and consumption energy compared to S-LoRaWAN and DLBA-IoT. Also, the simulation results show how the proposed approach can significantly increase the security of each thing and network security.}

	abstract = {The increasingly ubiquitous applications of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) require innovative solutions that can only be achieved through a flexible communication system such as the The Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR). Though a number of Grant-Free (GF) and Grant-based (GB) transmission schemes have been proposed to meet URLLC requirements there is a lack of work on the design of these systems. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that enables optimization of the performance of the URLLC systems with heterogeneous traffic. We consider uplink communications and assume that multiple copies of the same packet will be transmitted, utilizing both dedicated and shared resources. The network considered in this study consists of users with both periodic and sporadic traffic. Users in the network are grouped into classes according to their packet generation probabilities. While all users access shared resources through GF transmission, access to dedicated resources is done in two different ways depending on the user's packet generation rate, namely, Periodic Scheduling (PS) and GB scheduling. Although recent studies were disinclined towards the GB scheme due to its high latency, we show that the exploitation of 5G NR's new scalable numerology results in significant reductions to GB's latency, making it suitable for the URLLC use case. Following this latency examination, we present probabilistic expressions representing the reliability of our proposed solution. Then, we formulate an optimization problem in terms of minimizing the required bandwidth or maximizing the traffic capacity while satisfying reliability requirements. The performance of the system is maximized through optimal allocation of the resources among the transmission schemes and classification of the user classes as PS or GB based.}

	abstract = {In this paper, secure beamforming design in cooperative cognitive radio networks for Internet of Things (IoT) is investigated, where we maximize the secrecy sum rate for the IoT devices (IoDs) to protect their communication and employ the nonorthogonal multiple access scheme at the cognitive access point (AP) to serve the cognitive users. The formulated secure beamforming optimization problem is a non-convex problem and its global optimal solution is very hard to find. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an iterative algorithm based on semidefinite programming and monotonic optimization method to obtain the global optimal solution, which has high computational complexity and is suitable for the case that the cognitive AP has a powerful computing ability. For some application scenarios in which the cognitive AP has a lower computing ability, we propose suboptimal solutions based on zero-forcing scheme, which have much lower computational complexity. Furthermore, we derive the limit value of the secrecy sum rate for the IoDs when the transmit power of the cognitive AP goes to infinity, which can serve as an upper bound for our proposed solutions. Numerical results are also provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solutions.}

	abstract = {World is living an overwhelming explosion of smart devices: electronic gadgets, appliances, meters, cars, sensors, camera and even traffic lights, that are connected to the Internet to extend their capabilities, constituting what is known as Internet of Things (IoT). In these environments, the application layer is decisive for the quality of the connection, which has dependencies to the transport layer, mainly when secure communications are used. This paper analyses the performance offered by these two most popular protocols for the application layer: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). This analysis aims to examine the features and capabilities of the two protocols and to determine their feasibility to operate under constrained devices taking into account security support and diverse network conditions, unlike the previous works. Since IoT devices typically show battery constraints, the analysis is focused on bandwidth and CPU use, using realistic network scenarios, since this use translates to power consumption.}

	abstract = {The low transaction throughput, high transaction latency, and unfriendly micropayment are the main obstacles hindering Bitcoin use in time-sensitive environments. To mitigate these problems, various solutions have been proposed. The lightning network (\nLN\n) is considered one of the most promising ones, and it has been widely deployed in different versions. However, the\nLN\nitself is subject to a scalability problem due to the used channel state revocation technique. It especially requires\nO\n(\nn\n̄\n)\nstorage cost to store the private keys, where\nn\n̄\nis the number of transactions that happened in the channel and expected to be infinite. Though there are some techniques to resolve this problem, none of them is compatible with the current Bitcoin system. Aiming at solving this dilemma, in this paper, we propose two space-efficient Bitcoin-compatible key management schemes for the\nLN\n, based on the hash function and trapdoor one-way function, respectively. Both schemes reduce the storage complexity from\nO\n(\nn\n̄\n)\nto\nO\n(\n1\n)\n. The detailed security analysis shows that our schemes hold the security level of the original\nLN\nor its variants. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are efficient and feasible, with a significant reduction in storage overhead.}

	abstract = {Mobile data offloading is one of the most effective approaches for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of mobile users. Through this method, the mobile data traffic load over a cellular network is mitigated by offloading some of the traffic to an alternative path; usually a WiFi network. Most previous studies on WiFi offloading have assumed that the data traffic is offloaded to a path with constant bandwidth. However, in real-world applications, it is generally impossible to perform data transmission at a constant rate through WiFi over the entire offloading process, Hence, one of the most challenging issues in analyzing the performance of mobile data offloading is that of evaluating the effects of bandwidth uncertainty on the actual transmission rate. Accordingly, the present study proposes an analytical model for predicting the performance of multipath data offloading over WiFi network with bandwidth uncertainty. The theoretical results are validated by means of numerical simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is then further investigated by comparing the QoS metrics of the data offloading process with those obtained in a previous study on mobile data offloading under the assumption of a constant bandwidth. Overall, as the WiFi connection times are highly larger than the WiFi disconnection times, our model removes estimated errors in the baseline model by 8.7% and 6.7% in deadline miss ratio, by 23.2% and 14.9% in average offloading volume, when we consider two and three varying WiFi bandwidth respectively. The results show that the proposed method provides mobile operators with an effective framework for maintaining the QoS level of mobile data offloading in real-world networks characterized by WiFi bandwidth uncertainty.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a systematic methodology for continuous surveying and analysis of 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) abundance and security, based on the passive wireless network scanning technique called wardriving. The objective is to provide an efficient, scalable, and easily accessible methodology for collecting, analysing and storing WLAN survey data. To adhere to these set requirements, the presented survey and analysis processes can be carried out with freely available open-source software and common off-the-shelf hardware. While extensive literature has been produced on wardriving and numerous WLAN survey studies have been documented in previous works, to our knowledge, no similar comprehensive methodology for systematic WLAN surveying and analysis has been previously presented. To further rationalise the need for surveying and analysing WLAN networks, an investigation on the related literature and the current state of the WLAN networking landscape has been conducted. Furthermore, as surveying WLAN networks via the wardriving technique undoubtedly raises legal and moral concerns, the legitimacy and ethics of wardriving have been examined. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a primary test and calibration WLAN survey was conducted in three separate locations within a middle-sized city located in Southwest Finland. Based on the survey results, WLAN security in Finland is in a relatively good state. During the test survey, we successfully collected and analysed data from 720 WLAN networks, proving the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. From the 720 detected WLAN networks, 6% used insecure encryption protocols, 12.8% were unencrypted and a clear majority of 81.3% used the WPA2 encryption protocol. Results also show that wireless network device owners in the surveyed areas are not inclined to alter the factory-set default settings of their wireless networks. It was noted that roughly 40% of the surveyed networks used easily identifiable factory-set SSIDs and only 5.4% of the networks had a cloaked SSID. Furthermore, the survey data shows that WLAN devices from 38 different manufacturers were detected. Three of the most popular manufacturers in the surveyed area were Cisco with 28.3%, Huawei with 15.7% and Ruckus Networks with 9.7%.}

	abstract = {The purpose is to explore the application effects and limitations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in 5G/B5G (Beyond 5G) mobile and wireless communication. Based on 5Gcommunication, the deep learning (DL) algorithm is introduced to construct the UAV Digital Twins (DTs) communication channel model based on DL. The Coordinated Multi-point Transmission (COMP) technology is adopted to study the interference suppression of UAVs. The key algorithm in the physical layer security is employed to ensure information communication security. Finally, the model constructed is simulated and analyzed. The transmission error rates and transmission estimation accuracy of several algorithms, including the proposed algorithm and ordinary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are compared under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Results find that the convergence speed and convergence effect of the proposed algorithm has prominent advantages, presenting strong robustness; the proposed algorithm's estimation accuracy is about 150 times higher than the traditional algorithms. Further analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm's accuracy reaches 82.39%, which increases by at least 3.2% than other classic machine algorithms. The indicators of Precision, Recall, and F1 are compared as well. Apparently, the Precision, Recall, and F1 values of the proposed algorithm are the highest, while the transmission delay is the smallest. Therefore, the constructed UAV DTs wireless communication channel model has strong robustness and further reduces UAV limitations, providing a reference for improving UAV system performance in the later stage.}
