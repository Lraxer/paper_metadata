	abstract = {The Internet is poised to support new classes of industrial applications driven by large numbers of sensors and actuators generating and consuming sensor data streams. While the publish–subscribe (PubSub) architecture is well-suited for such large-scale data dissemination, existing over-the-top PubSub systems are not only vulnerable to network-induced performance degradation, but also unable to orchestrate the underlying network for better usage. This paper proposes a network-assisted PubSub architecture called SNAPS which enables seamless control of distributed PubSub brokers at the edge, as well as the networks that interconnect them. SNAPS leverages SRv6-based network programmability to build and maintain network-efficient, shareable data distribution trees across one or more administrative domains. The architecture is independent of broker implementation, making it suitable for “bringing your own brokers” at available edge locations. We describe how the networks interconnecting the brokers can be programmed for efficient, shareable data distribution via SRv6. Through simulation and prototype evaluation, we show the efficacy of SNAPS in providing better service for PubSub data delivery and better usage of the network resources.}

	abstract = {The Tactile Internet of Things (TIoT) represents a special class of the Internet of Things (IoT) that has opened the door for a new generation of agile, highly dynamic, intelligent, and bandwidth-hungry applications in many vital domains such as medical, military, robotics, and entertainment. However, the TIoT’s high level of physical requirements constitute a challenge that hinders the technology’s full potential. The application of machine learning (ML) methods has become of high importance to facilitate the prolific deployment of TIoT devices and applications. Along with advances in 6G and networking-enabling technologies, federated learning (FL) can bridge this gap by boosting TIoT services due to its inherent and redundant distributed nature. To the best of our knowledge, no other work in the literature covers applications of FL in the TIoT. In this work, we identify the prospective approach with a final aim of finding an appropriate architecture for the TIoT based on FL as we survey, compare, and analyze recent literature. We conducted a comprehensive and in-depth study of FL design aspects relevant to the deployment of the TIoT and suggested categorization of these aspects into process, infrastructure, data, enabler, and defense classes. On the other hand, as we are seeking to define a role for FL in the TIoT, we identified services of ML in the IoT domain as a general case of the FL/TIoT special case. Moreover, the shortcomings of traditional ML in regard to the general IoT are highlighted. We find that FL can be replaced, especially in the case of the TIoT, to meet the high level of design constraints. Eventually, we draw conclusions and future directions of common challenges relevant to applying FL in the domain of the TIoT.}

	abstract = {Among several link-layer protocols, Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), defined in the IEEE 802.15.4e standard, offer a good performance improving reliability and throughput for wireless sensor network using in the best way two parameters: time and frequency. Many works in the current literature present scheduling schemes for the protocol. In this scenario, our work is among a small group that aims to explore the improvements of the protocol by exploiting different techniques over the transport layer of the network protocol. Channels with wider bandwidth can improve network performance by increasing the throughput and improving packet delivery. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheduling algorithm to dynamically allocate channels with variable bandwidth to improve the overall throughput and packet delivery. The scheduling and channel allocation happen using the conflict mapping method to identify links in congestion and schedule them. This work proposes a procedure for allocating channels with bandwidth proportional to the demand for packets per link. We implemented the algorithm in the Contiki-NG platform and evaluated the result through simulations. Results show improved time slot allocation, packet delivery ratio, and throughput. Our experiments show that VariBan achieves a throughput of over 99% and improves Packet Delivery Ratio by over 50% in all three scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm.}

	abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as one of the key technologies to process massive amount of data at the edge of the network for upcoming 6G networks. In the paradigm of MEC, users can offload the computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks to the edge servers, since the capabilities of User Equipment (UE) cannot be not sufficient to meet different quality of service (QoS) requirements. However, due to the limited coverage of edge servers, users can move between multiple edge servers. In such cases, service migration is complicated which arises the challenge of where and when to migrate the service dynamically to maintain acceptable QoS. In addition, high uncertainty of the user mobility and different QoS requirements of the services are challenging. Instead of assigning each user to the nearest edge server, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted service migration approach to minimize the task completion time. The contributions in this paper are threefold: First, a DT edge network architecture is presented that uses the real-time and historical data to determine service migration strategy. Second, the DT classifies the computing tasks as delay-sensitive task and delay-insensitive tasks to meet the QoS requirements. Third, the DT predicts the mobility of users in the future based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and studies the impact of reducing the cost of service migration. Thus, we propose an optimization algorithm to find optimal resource allocation at each edge server. The simulation results shows that our DT-assisted service migration model can achieve less delay and service migration rate compared with the traditional methods.}

	abstract = {As an emerging computing paradigm, edge computing can assist user equipments (UEs) in executing computation-intensive deep neural network (DNN) inference tasks, thereby satisfying the stringent QoS requirement and relieving the burden of UEs. Due to the customizability of DNN models and limited capacity of the edge server, it is more realistic to upload DNN models on demand during end-to-edge co-inference, instead of deploying all DNN models at the edge server in advance. Existing works adopt the serial model uploading manner that uploads subsequent DNN layers only after antecedent DNN layers finish execution, inevitably prolonging the DNN execution latency. To this end, we innovatively design a parallel-efficient model uploading mechanism that allows subsequent DNN layers to be uploaded simultaneously when executing antecedent DNN layers, so as to efficiently mitigate the performance drop caused by model uploading. On this basis, we propose a Multi-UE Joint Optimization Algorithm based on Model Uploading (MJOA-MU) to optimize DNN partitioning and resource allocation for heterogeneous UEs. Specifically, MJOA-MU includes a Pruned Binary Tree based DNN Partitioning (PBT-DP) sub-algorithm to efficiently make the near-optimal partitioning decision for chain and non-chain models based on the long-term influence between DNN layers, and an Asynchronous Resource Allocation (ARA) sub-algorithm to allocate computation and communication resources for UEs by quantifying the inner- and inter-association, so as to match with individual demand and resource budget. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that MJOA-MU outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of the DNN execution latency, and specifically achieves up to 64.5% reduction.}

	abstract = {SYN flood attack is one of the common ways in which attackers take the advantage of TCP’s three-way handshake connection establishment to overwhelm target systems. With the emergence of programmable networks, many promising security functions have been implemented at the network layer. SYN authentication and cookie-based SYN proxy are two significant approaches recommended on programmable switches against SYN flood attacks. However, while the implementation of a cookie-based SYN proxy causes additional delays and packet drops, the SYN authentication approach increases the number of packets required to establish a TCP connection. In this study, two novel functions are implemented on programmable switches using the P4 language, and a new security solution against SYN flood attacks is proposed by combining both functions. The first function is the high-accuracy updatable Bloom filters implemented to track the state of network flows for TCP connection establishment. As the proposed data structure uses a salted input, it is more resistant to target-set coverage attacks. The second is the connection pooling function on programmable switches for requests to the backend servers. In this regard, the TCP three-way handshake is offloaded from the target systems to network switches. Upon the verification of a connection request, dynamic resource allocation is carried out from the connection pool on the P4 switch, enabling the client to connect to the server seamlessly and transparently without the need for additional packets. We implement these functions and demonstrate their feasibility as an effective defense against SYN flood.}

	abstract = {This paper aims at designing high-data-rate swarm UAV networks with distributed beamforming capabilities. The primary challenge is that the beamforming gain in swarm UAV networks is highly affected by the UAVs’ flight altitude, their movements and the resulting intermittent link blockages, as well as the availability of channel state information (CSI) at individual UAVs. To address this challenge, we propose FlyBeam, a learning-based framework for joint flight and beamforming control in swarm UAV networks. We first present a mathematical formulation of the control problem with the objective of maximizing the throughput of swarm UAV networks by jointly controlling the flight and distributed beamforming of UAVs. Then, a distributed solution algorithm is designed based on a combination of Echo State Network (ESN) learning and online reinforcement learning. The former is adopted to approximate the utility function for individual UAVs based on online measurements, by jointly considering the unknown blockage dynamics and other factors that affect the beamforming gain. The latter is used to guide the exploitation and exploration in FlyBeam. We further design a scheme referred to as AutoESN to automate the training of the ESN model. AutoESN can update the configurable ESN parameters automatically using a combination of loss function and step size. The effectiveness of FlyBeam is evaluated through an extensive simulation campaign on UBSim, a Python-based Universal Broadband Simulator for integrated aerial and ground wireless networking. The performance of FlyBeam is compared with two benchmark schemes, one designed based on traditional optimization techniques and the other based on learning with utility function approximation through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In the performance evaluation, we consider both Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Maximum Ratio Transfer (MRT) for beamforming with sequential and simultaneous channel state estimation. It is shown that significant (up to 450%) beamforming gain can be achieved by FlyBeam. We also investigate the effects of blockages and UAV flight altitude on the beamforming gain. It is found that, somewhat surprisingly, higher (rather than lower) beamforming gain can be achieved by FlyBeam with denser blockages in swarm UAV networks.}

	abstract = {The IEEE 802.1Qbv standard schedules time-triggered (TT) flows (i.e., period flows) in a fixed TT Window each period. However,period flows generated by non-deterministic end systems exhibit significant jitter, whichleads to a mismatch between the generation times and the scheduled TT Windows. In the worst case scenario, this mismatch can cause an additional send delay of approximately one period in the flow. In this study,we model the send delay issue due to the maximum send delay requirement for all frames in a period flow not being satisfied simultaneously, and measure the jitter of period flows in a typical non-deterministic end system. Moreover, we propose an access mechanism for jittered period flows to schedule multiple conflict-free TT Windows in each period of flows at the source end system and control the send delay within the required delay tolerance. This mechanism enables deterministic access to jittered period flows, providing a prerequisite for reliable end-to-end transmission in the network. Moreover, this mechanism adopts a multi-objective integer linear programming (MILP) solver to optimize the TT Windows schedule. Furthermore, we establish the constraints and objective functions for the MILP solver and evaluate the mechanism with actual sampled frames in a real non-deterministic end system. Compared with the conventional fixed single TT Window and worst-case delay analysis mechanisms, the proposed mechanism satisfies the send delay requirements and considerably reduces the buffer usage at the source end system.}

	abstract = {Adversaries may exploit a range of vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These vulnerabilities are typically exploited to carry out attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, either against the IoT devices themselves, or using the devices to perform the attacks. These attacks are often successful due to the nature of the protocols used in the IoT. One popular protocol used for machine-to-machine IoT communications is the Message Queueing Telemetry Protocol (MQTT). Countermeasures for attacks against MQTT include testing defenses with existing datasets. However, there is a lack of real-world test datasets in this area. For this reason, this paper introduces a DoS/DDoS-MQTT-IoT dataset—that contains various DoS/DDoS attack scenarios using MQTT traffic—to help develop and test countermeasures against such attacks. To this end, a physical IoT testbed was constructed and a large volume of IoT data was generated that included standard MQTT traffic as well as 10 DoS scenarios. The usability of the dataset has been evaluated via machine learning.}

We first formulate a non-convex optimization problem to maximize the total normalized spectral efficiency (NSE) of all ground terminals (GTs). Then, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework, termed as intelligent flying-beamformer, to solve the formulated non-convex optimization, which contains of two sequential phases: 3D UAV trajectory design, and joint optimization of beamwidth and power allocation. In particular, the off-policy deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and the on-policy proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms are used to process the complex data in the two phases, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent flying-beamformer in improving system capacity. Specifically, numerical results show that the optimization of the beamwidth can indeed significantly improve the spectral efficiency of mmWave UAV network.}

	abstract = {Tor is an anonymity protocol that utilizes multi-layers onion encryption to protect the privacy and anonymity of clients during crawling websites. However, Tor is vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks in that the adversary analyzes the transferred traffic patterns passively and detects visited websites without decryption. The core of fingerprinting attacks depends on flow-based network information such as packet direction information that cannot be concealed using encryption. In the real world, the packet streams observed during a website fetch may be affected by network events like changes in download rate, queuing, retransmission, and packet loss. In this paper, we propose a correlation-based website fingerprinting attack based on only the packet direction information as a set of observations of random variables with an unknown probability distribution. In the proposed attack, instead of the whole of the traffic instances for each website, only the first fraction of transmitted packets are used for fingerprinting. The main focus of the proposed attack is on the preprocessing and classification parts and aims to evaluate the importance of direction information in website detection and mitigate the adverse effects of unpredicted network noises in attack performance. The preprocessing phase preprocesses background noises and unpredicted network events that a real-world adversary may confront. The CorrClassifier model is designed as a prototype of a classifier tailored to the attack conditions to calculate the similarity distance of observed traffic patterns to detect visited websites and reduce the complexity of the attack using a low-dimension correlation method. Preprocessing the noises before feeding them to the classifier helps the accuracy keep up more robustly while the polarity of the target website grows gradually because of the unexpected network conditions. Experiments in a closed-world setting indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting the targeted websites with 95% accuracy using only the first fraction of direction information.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become popular carriers of aerial Base Stations (BSs) to cover temporal hotspots and off-load the transmission requirements of mobile users. Although the UAV-BSs can ignore the terrestrial obstacles, using them to fast deploy for off-loading still faces the time-efficiency problem of jointly optimizing multi-objectives: such as the amount of UAV-BS swarm, 3D deployment locations, and allocating users. This work transforms the above joint optimization problem into a combinatorial problem and proposes data-driven heuristic solutions with both time efficiency and robustness. To alleviate the pressure of collecting data, this paper offers a generative neural network-based framework. Results show that the proposed data-aware method can well address the above problem with less computation iterations compared with benchmark methods.}

	abstract = {The application areas of multi-hop wireless networks are expected to experience sustained growth in the next years. This growth will be further supported by the current possibility of providing low-cost communication capabilities to any device. One of the main issues to consider with this type of networks is congestion control, that is, avoiding an excessive volume of data traffic that could lead to a loss of performance. In this work, a distributed congestion control mechanism is proposed for generic multi-hop networks. Different categories of data traffic are taken into account, each of them with different quality of service requirements. The mechanism is based on machine learning techniques, specifically, the CatBoost algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision trees. The obtained decision trees are used to predict whether the packets to be transmitted over the network will reach their destination on time or not. This prediction will be made based on the network load state, which will be quantified by means of two parameters: the utilization factor of the different transmission channels, and the occupancy of the buffers of the network nodes. To make the values of these parameters available to all nodes in the network, an appropriate dissemination protocol has also been designed. Besides, a method to assign different transmission priorities to each traffic category, based on the estimation of the network resources required at any time, has also been included. The complete system has been implemented and evaluated through simulations, which show the correct functionality and the improvements obtained in terms of packet delivery ratio, network transit time, and traffic differentiation.}

	abstract = {The increased demand for high-quality Internet connectivity resulting from the growing number of connected devices and advanced services has put significant strain on telecommunication networks. In response, cutting-edge technologies such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) have been introduced to transform network infrastructure. These innovative solutions offer dynamic, efficient, and easily manageable networks that surpass traditional approaches. To fully realize the benefits of NFV and maintain the performance level of specialized equipment, it is critical to assess the behavior of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and the impact of virtualization overhead. This paper delves into understanding how various factors such as resource allocation, consumption, and traffic load impact the performance of VNFs. We aim to provide a detailed analysis of these factors and develop analytical functions to accurately describe their impact. By testing VNFs on different testbeds, we identify the key parameters and trends, and develop models to generalize VNF behavior. Our results highlight the negative impact of resource saturation on performance and identify the CPU as the main bottleneck. We also propose a VNF profiling procedure as a solution to model the observed trends and test more complex VNFs deployment scenarios to evaluate the impact of interconnection, co-location, and NFV infrastructure on performance.}

	abstract = {The Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs) is considered as a reliable and agile next-generation communication network scheme, because it is flexible to deploy and robust to disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions). The routing and resource allocation directly affect the power consumption of satellites in the STINs. However, most of existing research works study these two issues separately, and neglect the impact of path selection on the satellite power consumption. This paper investigates the joint optimization problem of routing, bandwidth allocation, user association, channel allocation, and power allocation of the STINs. We aim at minimizing satellites’ power consumption while satisfying user's Quality of Service (QoS). Because the power consumption of satellites for routing in the space segment is involved with the data rate through satellite gateways in the user segment, this optimization problem is a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem. To this end, we convert the MOO problem to a Single-Objective Optimization (SOO) problem by linear weighted method. Considering that the SOO problem is a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, we decompose it into the resource allocation sub-problem in the user segment and the routing optimization sub-problem in the space segment. And we solve these two sub-problems iteratively. Specifically, we convert the first sub-problem into a convex optimization problem and obtain the current user association and channel allocation. Then we formulate the second sub-problem into a multi-commodity flow problem and solve it based on the obtained user association and channel allocation. The SOO problem is solved by iteratively optimizing these two sub-problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to get an approximate optimal solution quickly and effectively reduce the power consumption of satellites compared with benchmark algorithms in the STINs.}

	abstract = {Spectrum Sensing as a Service (SSaS) is emerging as the enabling business model for efficient spectrum sharing in many recent applications. In such model, sensing infrastructure provides dynamic spectrum access networks, also known as cognitive radio networks, with information about availability or unavailability of given spectrum bands. In return for such information, the service provider imposes money costs on the users of the dynamic spectrum access network or its operator. In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum allocation along a route in multi-interface dynamic spectrum access networks under the SSaS model. The objective is to allocate spectrum channels to interfaces of nodes along the route so that the total sensing cost imposed by SSaS provider is minimized and the quality of links meet a predetermined QoS requirement, specifically a data rate requirement. The problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to obtain the optimal solution. Given the intractable complexity of ILPs, a sub-optimal algorithm is proposed. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is validated via extensive experimentation.}

	abstract = {Port scanning is a commonly used technique to discover the vulnerabilities of network systems. Since many existing methods can detect fast port scans effectively, some advanced attackers perform slow port scans to avoid suspicion. Highly covert slow scans can last for tens of days, which poses a great challenge to current intrusion detection methods. In addition, the existing port scanning detection methods are all based on full traffic. They are difficult to apply to high-speed networks due to the huge consumption of computing and storage resources. This paper proposes PD-CPS, which is a Practical scheme for Detecting Covert Port Scans in high-speed networks. Based on the protocol characteristics and the connection mode of port scanning, we construct a traffic feature set that can not only distinguish the specific scan types but also remain valid for the sampled traffic. Furthermore, we customize a data structure Scan Detection Sketch (SDS) for rapid feature extraction. Experimental results using real-world traces demonstrate the feasibility of PD-CPS in detection accuracy and resource consumption. And the proposed method still works well for slow port scans that last for over 60 days.}

	abstract = {Modern network services and functions, such as firewalls, load balancers, and network address translators, are virtualized to virtual network functions (VNFs) and run in virtual machines and containers. This paper proposes a robust VNF placement model against uncertain recovery time with satisfying an expected recovery time guarantee in a cost-efficient manner. We consider that each node fails with a workload-dependent failure probability, which is a non-decreasing function that reveals the empirical relationship between the workload and the failure probability. The preventively deployed backup resources can recover an unavailable function hosted by a failed node in a period of time, which is related to the backup strategies and protection types. Multiple functions protected by a node can share the backup resources to reduce the number of active nodes to save cost, which also affects the recovery time if the number of unavailable functions is so large that the remaining capacity cannot recover them and causes a waiting procedure of an unavailable function before being recovered. We introduce an uncertainty set that considers the upper and lower bounds of the recovery time of a function protected by each node and the upper bound of the average recovery time among nodes. We consider the expected remaining capacity of a node and the expected number of unavailable functions hosted by the node to approximate the waiting time in the shared protection. The robust optimization technique is applied to obtain the worst-case expected recovery time under an uncertain recovery time set. With this technique, the model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. To solve the problem in a practical time, a heuristic algorithm is developed. It reduces the number of active nodes while decreasing the worst-case expected recovery time within the uncertainty set by converting the linear programming problem to a graph problem. The numerical results reveal the superiority of the proposed model by considering the recovery time guarantee, uncertainty set, and shared protection; we investigate the dependency on the bounds of recovery time.}

	abstract = {Integrating the terrestrial network with non-terrestrial networks to provide radio access as anticipated in the beyond 5G networks calls for efficient user association and resource allocation strategies. In this work, a weighted sum single objective optimization problem that maximizes the total network data rate while minimizing the mobility-induced handoffs and prioritizing service provisioning of mission-critical users in the integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network is formulated. The problem’s complexity is reduced by solving the defined problem in two phases; the user association followed by the resource distribution phase. Several proposed approaches to the user association sub-problem utilize a central node that requires nearly-complete information, which may not be available in real time. On the contrary, this paper proposes a centralized training and distributed execution multi-agent dueling double deep Q network (MA3DQN) solution. Each user collects the channel state and access node loading information in this approach and makes an association decision that considers its quality of service requirements. The algorithm’s performance is validated through comparison with the genetic algorithm (GA), the integer linear programming (ILP), a heuristic approximation-based solution, the greedy approach, and the random user association (RUA) algorithm. Moreover, the paper simulates the multi-agent deep Q network solution as an additional benchmark algorithm. Simulation results reveal that as the number of users in the network increases, the acquired data rate of the MA3DQN is within 0.48% and 0.4% of that achieved by the GA and ILP, respectively, and outperforms all other algorithms. Notably, the proposed MA3DQN algorithm presents the best running time, attaining a gain of 99.9% over the GA algorithm, which performs the poorest among the algorithms characterized by polynomial worst-case time complexity. Besides, the MA3DQN approach maintains a handoff probability of zero, unlike the ILP, the approximation-based, greedy, and RUA solutions.}

	abstract = {Incentive-based applications enable users to obtain rewards after they complete a task, but how to balance the privacy and accountability is one of the most serious concerns currently. Publicly accountable anonymous authentication provides an excellent way verifying a user’s identity in a privacy-preserving way while ensuring public accountability in case of dispute. Although different kinds of these schemes have been proposed, they all assume that there is a single centralized certificate authority issuing a certificate to users, and are not suitable for an actual scenario which always involves multiple authorities. Therefore, a new primitive called multi-authority linkable and traceable anonymous authentication is proposed to address this issue, enabling privacy protection while holding public accountability under a multi-authority setting. We formally define a security model for this new notion and simultaneously design a generic construction while giving the security proof. Additionally, we implement the proposed scheme to show its efficiency.}

Our goal is to minimize the total traffic cost of content transmission by jointly distributing content and allocating storage in RRHs and BBUs of C-RANs. The problem is formulated as a mix-integer linear programming (MIP). Then, an algorithm with a bounded approximation ratio is proposed to obtain the feasible solution of the MIP. The simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm outperforms two very recent heuristic algorithms in the metric of traffic cost. They also demonstrate that the difference between the solution obtained by the algorithm and the optimal solution of the MIP is very small. In addition, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible in C-RANs. Further, another algorithm is proposed for exchanging contents between neighbor RRHs in content provision.}
