	abstract = {We survey analytical methods and evaluation results for the performance assessment of caching strategies. Knapsack solutions are derived, which provide static caching bounds for independent requests and general bounds for dynamic caching under arbitrary request pattern. We summarize Markov and time-to-live-based solutions, which assume specific stochastic processes for capturing web request streams and timing. We compare the performance of caching strategies with different knowledge about the properties of data objects regarding a broad set of caching demands. The efficiency of web caching must regard benefits for network wide traffic load, energy consumption and quality-of-service aspects in a tradeoff with costs for updating and storage overheads.}

	abstract = {The Long-Term Evolution (LTE)/5G network connects much of the world’s population to provide subscriber’s voice calls and mobile data delivery, with security provided by the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) defined by 3GPP, which makes the LTE/5G network more secure than all its predecessors. Primarily due to the access limitations of LTE systems, the vulnerabilities of AKA protocol and potential attacks have not received much investigation, which is essential to LTE users with a tremendous amount of cellular services. In this study, we focus on two questions: (i) what are the vulnerabilities that can be exploited to carry out attacks in practice? and (ii) how to design an enhanced AKA protocol against such attacks? We examine the detailed procedures of Evolved Packet System (EPS)-AKA protocol by 3GPP, and have identified three types of attacks with respect to catching, location tracking, and jamming. We have designed and implemented attacks with commercial equipment to evaluate their threats in practice. In addition, we propose an enhanced AKA protocol that essentially relies on asymmetric encryption rather than symmetric in the AKA protocol and additional digital signatures to countermeasure these attacks. Finally, we verified our solution through formal verification to prove that our solution can mitigate the newly found vulnerabilities.}

While 3GPP Release 16 aims to improve the reliability of a single service based on CMT, replication-based reliability causes high resource and signaling overhead, and asymmetric bandwidth and latency lead to excessive latency. RCMEN addresses these issues by distributing data across multiple PDU sessions and using a queue-aware variable-block-length Raptor encoder to optimize resource utilization under random arrivals. We analyze RCMEN’s delay-reliability performance using the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), reliability is guaranteed by the reliability function, which takes the amount of data sent as a parameter. Through Linear Programming, we obtain the optimal delay-reliability trade-off and optimize delay metrics for two classical RCMEN. Experiments show that both classical RCMEN optimize the long-tail distribution of latency while ensuring reliability, with the entire system being compatible with the current 5G network infrastructure.}

How to achieve the user's security and credibility and ensure the trust of the edge service nodes is a serious challenge facing the security of edge computing. Therefore, the research target of this paper is to establish the mutual trust relationship between users and edge service nodes and to formulate dynamic access control strategies. While realizing user security and trustworthiness in the edge environment, it also ensures the trustworthiness of service nodes. The research content of this paper is the access control model of mutual trust between nodes and users in the edge computing environment. This model closely combines trust management with the RBAC (Role Based Access Control) model. Given the multi-domain characteristics of the edge computing environment, the intra-domain access control and cross-domain access control strategies based on mutual trust are implemented, which realizes the improvement and expansion of the RBAC model in the edge computing environment. The performance of EUSMTM is compared and analyzed through simulation experiments, and the validity of the trust model between users and edge servers is verified. Then through the comparative experiment of two-way trust and one-way trust between edge users and edge servers, the advantages of access control based on two-way trust in the EUSMTM model are analyzed.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly utilized in daily life and industrial production, particularly in critical infrastructures. IoT cybersecurity has an effect on people’s safety, national security, and economic growth. However, the traditional cloud-based centralized intrusion detection methods cannot satisfy the demands for data privacy, network load, and timely response. In this article, we proposed an efficient intrusion detection method based on cloud–edge collaboration. The approach can reduce computational workload to speed up model training, prevent data privacy leakage, enrich training data, and detect attacks unknown to local edge devices. Specifically, stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is first utilized for data dimensionality reduction to overcome the bottleneck of resource constraints on edge devices. Second, considering the long-term serial characteristics of IoT traffic data, the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model is employed to detect attack; Finally, the cloud–edge collaboration architecture based on federated learning is used to coordinate multi-party training intrusion detection models. It fills the gap of missed detection by intrusion detection models due to data silos. Experiments show that our method reduced the training time, storage and memory required for the model training process by more than 50%, respectively, but the detection accuracy is close to centralized trained models. The model trained based on cloud–edge collaboration can identify attacks unknown to local edge devices.}

Infected systems connect to a command and control (C&C) server to receive commands and attack. Thus, detecting infected hosts makes it possible to protect the network’s resources and prevent them from illicit activities toward third parties. This research elaborates on the design, implementation, and results of a bot infection detection system based on Domain Name System (DNS) traffic events for a network corporation. An infection detection feasibility analysis is performed by creating fingerprints. The traces are generated from a numerical analysis of 13 attributes. These attributes are obtained from the DNS logs of a DNS server. It looks for fingerprint anomalies using Isolation Forest to label a host as infected or not. In addition, on the traces cataloged as anomalous, a search will be carried out for queries to domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA). Then, Random Forest generates a model that detects future bot infections on hosts. The devised system integrates the ELK stack and Python. This integration facilitates the management, transformation, and storage of events, generation of fingerprints, machine learning application, and analysis of fingerprint classification results with a precision greater than 99%.}

	abstract = {Mobile-app identification over encrypted network traffic plays a vital role in network management, cyberspace security, and advertising analysis. Combining machine learning algorithms and traffic features is the mainstream approach, which assumes the training and test traffic is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). However, the distribution of test flows could drift due to the updating app, diverse mobile platforms, and regions, resulting in low accuracy. Existing methods relabel the non-i.i.d traffic manually and retrain the model from scratch, which takes lots of human effort and thus limits deployment. In this paper, we propose a Flow Domain Adaptation Neural Network (FDAN) to improve the accuracy in identifying mobile apps over non-i.i.d traffic under zero-relabelling. FDAN transforms the drifted test flows into approximate i.i.d samples by reducing the differences between traffic distributions in a trainable feature space. Specifically, we adopt two domain discriminators and a feature generator to strengthen the feature’s invariance under an adversarial loss. An app predictor is used to enhance the discrimination with supervised data from the source domain. We conduct extensive experiments on public and private datasets, including changing app versions, platforms, and regions. With theoretical guarantees, our FDAN achieves a remarkable improvement (7.8%\n∼\n47\n%\n↑\nin\nF\n1\n) with zero-relabelling and outperforms other comparisons.}

	abstract = {Incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods within the 5G wireless standard promises autonomous network behavior and ultra-low-latency reconfiguration. However, the effort so far has purely focused on learning from radio frequency (RF) signals. Future standards and next-generation (nextG) networks beyond 5G will have two significant evolution over the state-of-the-art 5G implementations: (i) massive number of antenna elements, scaling up to hundreds-to-thousands in number, and (ii) inclusion of AI/ML in the critical path of the network reconfiguration process that can access sensor feeds from a variety of RF and non-RF sources. While the former allows unprecedented flexibility in ‘beamforming’, where signals combine constructively at a target receiver, the latter enables the network with enhanced situation awareness not captured by a single and isolated data modality. This survey presents a thorough analysis of the different approaches used for beamforming today, focusing on mmWave bands, and then proceeds to make a compelling case for considering non-RF sensor data from multiple modalities, such as LiDAR, Radar, and GPS for increasing beamforming directional accuracy and reducing processing time. This so called idea of multimodal beamforming will require deep learning based fusion techniques, which will serve to augment the current RF-only and classical signal processing methods that do not scale well for massive antenna arrays. The survey describes relevant deep learning architectures for multimodal beamforming, identifies computational challenges and the role of edge computing in this process, dataset generation tools, and finally, lists open research challenges that the community should tackle to realize this transformative vision of the future of beamforming.}

Computer networks breakdown can strongly impact everything in our life such as personal data, industrials, banks, oil pipelines, hospitals, nuclear reactors, military platforms, etc. Assessing their security is a necessity to reduce the risk of compromise by an attacker. Nevertheless, the actual solutions are rarely adapted to the high complexity of modern computer systems. They often rely on too much human work and the used algorithms do not scale well. Furthermore, the evolution of the system over time is rarely modeled and is therefore not considered in the evaluation of its security. This paper proposes a dynamic attack graph generation method allowing to model attack paths by considering the evolution of the system over time. We compute the probabilities of compromise of the system components by simulating several cyberattacks from the previously constructed dynamic attack graph. We tested our solution on a use case of several thousand of machines. The measured results demonstrate its ability to assess the threat in complex systems caused by combining exploitation of successive vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {Encrypted traffic classification requires identifying the services and programs running behind the content-invisible traffic data for improving quality of service and providing security assurance. Mainstream solutions achieve reliable performance by training on large-scale datasets. However, with the continuous emergence and development of encryption services, collecting and labeling sufficient amounts of encrypted traffic becomes impractical. Therefore, it is critical to utilize the few labeled data for accurate encrypted traffic classification. In this paper, we propose a Multi-task Representation Enhanced Meta-learning model (MetaMRE) for few-shot encrypted traffic classification. Specifically, we design a flow discrepancy enhancement module that combines supervised learning and clustering-based unsupervised learning to boost the discrepancy of encrypted traffic representations from a few labeled data. Moreover, MetaMRE introduces a multi-task collaborative meta-learning module that makes full use of non-target task data to learn the optimal initialization parameters suitable for the encrypted traffic classification, and then only a small amount of labeled encrypted traffic is required to adapt to the target classification task. Extensive evaluations on various real-world datasets show that the MetaMRE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and copes well with version updates and cross-domain problems in encrypted traffic classification.}

	abstract = {More devices are being introduced to the cellular network every day, and it is time to think about how the next generation will deal with them. The 6G will bring new ways to think about how to share information and will not rely just on communication with a fixed Base Station (BS). A post-disaster scenario may damage the network infrastructure; the devices need to create an ad-hoc network to communicate in this situation. The ad-hoc network must achieve some of the 6G’s requirements, such as communication frequency, data rate, and latency, to communicate with the 6G networks when available. The increase in the frequency used to achieve such data rate has the downside of decreasing the signal range, i.e., for two nodes to communicate, they must be closer to each other. Academia is developing alternatives to increase the network coverage area, allowing devices to further the ad-hoc Access Point (AP) to overcome this drawback. Thus, with this work, we propose CAIN, an 6G routing protocol that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to increase the network coverage area. Depending on the node’s connectivity to an AP, i.e., if the node is connected to an AP or not, CAIN uses different messages to make nodes further the AP to communicate with it, increasing the network coverage area. Hence, if there is no connected node to an AP, it chooses a neighbor with a connection to one to forward the message. Also, if there is no connected neighbor to an AP, the node chooses a neighbor to flood the message until it reaches an AP. To improve its performance, we enhance CAIN with AI techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), Federated Learning (FL), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). These techniques allow the node to make a better neighbor choice and increase the network coverage area even more. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes a routing protocol for the 6G scenario that uses RL techniques with FL and DNN to increase the network coverage. With these characteristics, CAIN makes devices further the APs to communicate with it using less energy and storage resources, producing less delay compared to other protocols.}

	abstract = {Devices and edges of the Internet of Things (IoT) are working together to broaden the sensing capability of the IoT. The protection of personal sensory information privacy in the smart home has gotten more attention. To enable secure data sharing under the scenario of the smart home, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been applied widely. As a general rule, the sophisticated calculation of ABE is difficult under resource-constrained devices. The appearance of edge computing alleviates this dilemma, where an edge server (ES) is responsible for computing all heavy cryptographic operations and uploading massive device data to a cloud. Nevertheless, the ES and the cloud may be attacked artificially in reality. Accordingly, to check the correctness of the ES data and the integrity of the cloud data, we design a lightweight dual auditing scheme, where the first adopts the aggregation of data blocks and signatures to check the integrity of the cloud data, and the second constructs an efficient Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof to verify the correctness of the ES data in a lightweight way. To prevent collusion attacks, the legitimacy of the data user is authenticated by a smart contract. The simulation experiment shows that our multiple auditing scheme is relatively efficient.}

	abstract = {Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) provides the means to rapidly identify and investigate attacks such that the security risks can be addressed. However, few studies have assessed the consistency between the CTI and the observations in the real-world environment (i.e., sightings). Accordingly, this study proposes an approach for assessing such consistency. The assessment process involves finding both false positives (i.e., attacks reported in the CTI, but not observed in the sightings) and false negatives (i.e., attacks observed in the sightings, but not reported in the CTI). The latter are then used to augment the CTI. Several strategies are proposed for assessment and augmentation with a large number of flows in the sightings. For assessment, we first list the characteristic rules for various attacks, and see whether the characteristics of the malicious flows labeled with the attack tags by the CTI match the corresponding rules. We also divide the reported malicious flows into clusters for easier observation. For augmentation, a machine learning framework is employed to identify flows in the sighting with a behavior similar to that of known malicious flows. The attack type and severity of these flows are predicted and used to update the CTI accordingly. The experimental results reveal that among the sightings, over 50% of the flows do not exhibit the behaviors expected from the characteristic rules, but nevertheless appear to be probing or scanning. The proportion of such flows is greater than 90% in the largest cluster for each attack type. When the learning framework is employed, the number of high-severity malicious sources identified in the sighting increases by 156% compared to that reported in the original blacklist. In addition, around 53% of these sources are also considered as potentially malicious by other intelligence sources, and are thus regarded as valid candidates for CTI augmentation.}

	abstract = {The incessant growth of network virtualization determined the proliferation of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), software programs that can run on general-purpose servers and that can also integrate security controls for protection from cyber-attacks. However, a high availability of VNFs may be counterproductive for the network administrators who have to select the most suitable ones to establish the security configuration of their network. On the one hand, the vendor-dependent technicalities of each VNF may cloud the security controls it can actually perform. On the other hand, VNF selection traditionally occurs before the synthesis of the virtual network graph, so it does not employ any network information and it may outcome unoptimized results. In light of these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel security configuration workflow, based on new abstractions that we call projections. They represent the security-related operations that VNFs should perform to enforce a security policy. Thanks to these abstractions, the actual selection of the VNFs can be postponed to the moment their deployment in the physical network is actually required. In fact, projections are enough for the synthesis of the virtual security graph. This paper also proposes a two-step algorithm for computing projection chains as candidate solutions for graph synthesis. The proposed approach has been implemented as a Java framework and a set of tests have validated its applicability to real-world VNFs, correctness, scalability and optimization. These tests showed that the new security configuration workflow can achieve a significant reduction for the number of selected VNFs and their deployment cost. Specifically, in the analyzed scenario, the improvement percentages for these two parameters are 79% and 90% with respect to the worst-case strategy, while 68% and 77% with respect to a traditional more optimized configuration strategy.}

IoT testbeds commonly consist of low-power IoT devices augmented with observer nodes providing control, debugging, logging, and often also power-profiling capabilities. Today, the research community operates numerous testbeds, sometimes with hundreds of IoT nodes, to allow for detailed and large-scale evaluation. Most testbeds, however, lack opportunities for tracing distributed program execution with high accuracy in time, for example, via minimally invasive, distributed GPIO tracing. And the ones that do, like Flocklab, are built from custom hardware, which is often too complex, inflexible, or expensive to use for other research groups.}

	abstract = {The physical assets within a critical infrastructure system are pivotal to its efficient performance and protection and that of other dependent systems. This is particularly the case for communication systems where network protection strategies usually involve asset redundancy. Although such redundancy is well-modelled in the literature, there is a gap in knowledge from a network science perspective in terms of its implications for network modelling and performance assessment. This paper presents a multilayer complex network framework that takes into account the heterogeneity of the redundant infrastructure for realistic network modelling and further analysis, a step change from using a single network model. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for communication networks (i.e., latency and jitter, bandwidth and throughput, queue depth and packet drops) are redefined to evaluate key important features of a long-haul backbone network such as network capacity and average use. In addition, these KPIs are adapted to deal with the aforementioned redundancy and so inform network managers with values defined over a model closer to the real system. The paper analyses the use case of a nationwide core and metro network infrastructure of one of the main UK internet service providers. The results of the analysis of KPIs showcase the advantage of the proposed multilayer complex network framework over the traditional single network model. Critical network elements within different dimensions of a communication network are identified based on their performance for prioritising network management measures.}

	abstract = {Data stream processing plays a critical role in providing fundamental statistics for various applications, such as anomaly detection. Still, the unbalanced distribution of data streams severely affects the performance of related algorithms, which motivates the recent studies on filter structure design to enhance the existing algorithms for a more precise estimation result. However, these filters are mainly designed for frequency-based filtration, while none of them can conduct universal filtration; apparently, frequency is not the only targeted metric in practical processing tasks, metrics like cardinality and persistence are of equal importance. To cope with the issue, we propose a novel filter framework to implement universal, lightweight, and accurate filtration. The filter framework is called Coupon Filter due to the interpretation of its flow-level filtration as a coupon collection process. We prove the filtration efficiency of our filter design and formally analyze its recording process. We deploy our filter on the three typical metrics (frequency, cardinality, and persistence) to illustrate its advantages. The experimental results on real Internet traces demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in enhancing existing stream processing approaches in terms of accuracy and throughput.

This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink scenario where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) users partially offload their data to a MEC server. The objective of this study is to minimize the total energy consumption during local computing, task offloading, and MEC computing. To this end, the base station optimizes power allocation vectors and task assignment coefficients under time and power constraints. The generalized singular value decomposition-based linear beamforming method integrates NOMA, MIMO, and MEC technologies. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, a successive convex optimization (SCA) and alternation optimization (AO) based low-complex solution is proposed. The impact of the delay tolerance, the size of the offloaded task, and the distance of the users are investigated concerning energy consumption. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better energy performance than the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes. More importantly, the performance gap increases when the data size is large, and the delay requirement is stringent, as 6G networks require.}

	abstract = {A flying ad hoc network (FANET) is formed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an ad hoc manner in which UAVs can cooperate more effectively to complete complex tasks. In this paper, we mainly investigate the topology construction and topology adjustment for FANETs in which relay UAVs are used for relay transmission between mission UAVs and a ground control station (GCS), so that each mission UAV can communicate with the GCS through a multi-hop communication connection. Firstly, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to optimize the routing paths and the positions of relay UAVs alternately, so as to construct a feasible FANET topology using the minimal number of relay UAVs. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm to deploy new relay UAVs to the FANET topology constructed by the alternating optimization algorithm, so as to construct a high-performance FANET topology using the given number of relay UAVs. Both the alternating optimization algorithm and the greedy algorithm need to be executed in a centralized manner, so these two algorithms can only be used for FANET topology construction. Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm to adjust the existing FANET topology when the positions of mission UAVs change, so as to improve the FANET network performance. This distributed algorithm can be executed in a distributed manner, so this algorithm can be used for FANET topology adjustment. The simulation results show that the algorithms proposed in this paper are superior to other baselines.}

	abstract = {This paper examines the performance of a wireless system where two reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are combined to aid multiple ground users adopting nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. Specifically, the UAV acts as an aerial relay station, the first and the second RISs are respectively used to aid ground-to-air (G2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) communications. Besides the reflected link from the RISs, the direct link between a ground base station (S) and the UAV, the UAV and ground users are exploited to increase the received power at UAV and ground users. We successfully derive the theoretical formulas of outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) of RIS-aided G2A/A2G-NOMA system over Nakagami-\nm\nfading channel. The derived formulas are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, and the impacts of system parameters on the OP and EC are fully evaluated to achieve useful insights into the system behaviors. Numerical results clarify that by using two RISs where every RIS is equipped with 100 reflecting elements (REs), the OP of RIS-aided G2A/A2G-NOMA system is greatly lower than the OP of the G2A/A2G-NOMA system without RISs, in which there are only S-UAV and UAV-ground users direct links. In the case of EC, the benefit of using RISs focuses on a low transmit power regime. It is because the EC of the RIS-aided G2A/A2G-NOMA system is only higher than the EC of the system without RISs in the low transmit power region. For the high transmit power regions, the ECs with and without RISs are similar.}

	abstract = {In network function virtualization(NFV)-enabled software defined networks, the controller needs to frequently update the flow forwarding rules in the data plane to adapt to dynamic changes in network topologies or service requests. However, inconsistent rule updates may lead to blackholes, loops, transient congestion or policy violations (e.g., packets do not traverse designated network functions in a specific order), resulting in service interruption and throughput degradation. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective rule consistent update mechanism to avoid the above four problems simultaneously, while improving network throughput and satisfying user requests. Specifically, we first build three effective models to avoid blackholes, loops, and policy violations. Then, considering that network function nodes may change the sizes of their processed flows, we build a congestion avoidance model based on traffic changes to avoid congestion, which can reduce unnecessary rule update delays and packet loss. Subsequently, we prove that the consistent update problem constructed above is NP-hard, and then design an effective heuristic rule consistent update algorithm to obtain the rule update sequence that can simultaneously avoid blackholes, loops, congestion, and policy violations. Extensive trace-driven simulation results show that compared with the existing update methods, our proposed method can improve the success rate by up to 20.6% and reduce the maximum link utilization by up to 7.5%.}

	abstract = {The transaction processing mode of the permissionless blockchain with the PoW protocol is to generate transaction block through network-wide competition and perform transaction verification by all the nodes jointly, resulting in wasted computing power resources and low throughput as bottlenecks for its application in industrial fields with high-frequency transactions. In order to enhance the transaction processing performance of the blockchain system and meet the actual security requirements, we propose a scalable and fault-tolerant selection method of verification and accounting nodes. Firstly, combined with the advantages of PoW, we apply the computationally difficult problem in the selection method of the verification set, which can fully utilize computing resources and ensure the efficiency of transaction verification. Afterwards, a fault-tolerant selection method of accounting node is designed by constructing the verifiable random number using threshold signature, which can ensure the robust operation of the system in the presence of malicious nodes. The newly developed method has the following advantages: it has fault-tolerant characteristics; the method can be applied to systems with Byzantine or non-Byzantine errors, and is appropriate for practical application scenarios. It has compatibility, the method can be seamlessly integrated into Byzantine fault tolerance, crash tolerance, threshold voting and other consensus protocols to improve the performance of the protocol. It has versatility, the method can be applied to both single blockchains and sharding blockchains to demonstrate its versatility and flexibility. Finally, the results of the security analysis and experiment show the method is of superiority and effectiveness.}
