	abstract = {Service function chaining (SFC) is a trending paradigm and it has attracted considerable attention from both the industry and academia because of its potential to improve dynamicity and flexibility in service chain provisioning significantly. SFC makes it easier and more convenient to compose on-demand service chains customized for application-specific requirements. In addition to SFC, network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) are two other technology enablers that drive software-based service chain solutions. SFC leverages NFV for flexible deployment and for the placement of virtual resources and virtual network functions (VNFs); further, it employs SDN to provide traffic steering and network connectivity between the deployed VNF instances to form an application-specific service chain. Although SFC introduces many promising advantages, security is a major concern and a potential barrier for the widespread adoption of SFC technology. The integration of these technologies introduces a wide variety of security risks in the different levels of SFC stacks because SFC relies on NFV and SDN, and this results in a greater attack surface. Therefore, this survey aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of SFC from a security perspective. To this end, we examine the SFC architecture in detail, including the design principles and relationships between other functional components, to obtain a clear understanding of SFC. The significant enhancements achieved by adopting SFC are highlighted. Further, we exemplify its deployment in several realistic use cases. Based on the SFC layering model, we analyze security threats to identify all possible risk exposures and establish a layer-specific threat taxonomy. We then systematically analyze the existing defensive solutions and propose a set of security recommendations to secure an SFC-enabled domain. Our goal is to help network operators deploy cost-effective security hardening based on their specific requirements. Finally, several open research challenges and future directions of SFC are also discussed.}

	abstract = {User-to-network relaying via Device-to-Device (D2D) communications is a promising technique for improving the performance of cellular networks. Since in practice the users serving as relays are mobile, a dynamic relay selection scheme is required to meet the requirements of communications and optimize the system performance In this paper, we propose a dynamic relay selection policy that maximizes the performance of cellular networks (e.g. throughput, reliability, coverage) under cost constraints (e.g. transmission power). We represent the relays’ dynamics as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and, to limit the signaling overhead, we assume that only the locations of selected relays are observable. Therefore, the dynamic relay selection process is modeled as a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CPOMDP). Since finding the exact solution of such a framework is intractable, we develop a point-based value iteration solution and evaluate its performance. Furthermore, with the aim to reduce the complexity of the solution we prove the submodularity property of the reward and cost value functions and deduce a greedy solution that is scalable with the number of discovered relays. For the multi-user scenario, a distributed approach is introduced in order to reduce further the complexity and overhead of the proposed solution. We provide simulation results of a scenario where throughput is maximized under energy constraint and show the gain achieved by the proposed relay selection policy with respect to traditional cellular networks.}

	abstract = {In wireless sensor network (WSN) routing model design, energy efficiency is a key to WSN performance. Existing energy efficiency routing approaches transmit fused data packets through cluster head (CH) to save energy. However, some of these approaches do not make full use of WSNs’ energy because some sensor node transmitting paths are opposite to their transmission destination in these WSNs. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach named maximum cooperative equilibrium WSN (MCEN) to improve WSN energy utilization based on greedy policies and nodes energy consumption prediction. MCEN reconstructs the cluster structure to help nodes minimize their transmitting paths on which signals travel in the opposite direction to their destination. The energy-consumption prediction strategy in MCEN is to find the best cooperative partner for a node by predicting the energy consumption of the cooperative data transmission between the node and base station. CHs are voted to form clusters based on the maximum energy consumption prediction results. The approach can be embedded in other WSN clustering approaches, thereby further extending the overall lifetime of those WSNs. The simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly extend the lifetime of the entire network by more than 50%.}

Our proposed dataset not only inherits previous datasets' results but also has got own advantages. First, our new dataset includes only domain records and no other raw network traffic, helping to address the DGA botnet problem. Second, we removed duplicated botnet DGA families and added new botnet families for a total of 76 DGA botnet families presented. Third, we propose a valuable set of attributes as input for classification algorithms. Our experiments using the proposed features with several machine learning algorithms have had good results. It shows that our proposed attributes are firmly suitable for the input of the DGA botnet solution. Finally, we carefully compiled the dataset and attribute description documents to make it easy for researchers to use. The UTL_DGA22 dataset can serve as a database for researchers to develop their algorithms while objectively evaluating different solutions.}

	abstract = {Many internet applications in the emerging 5G/6G networks require ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) services. To deliver URLLC services flexibly and efficiently, network function virtualization (NFV) is employed to enable network slicing. NFV deploys service function chains (SFCs) consisting of service functions (SFs) and service function forwarders (SFFs) to deliver services. It is possible for SFFs in an SFC to fail when forwarding traffic to specified SF instances. Protecting SFF failures in NFV is challenging since multiple SF instances may fail simultaneously as a result of a single SFF failure. This work investigates how to protect the SF instances against the SFF failures while minimizing the cost of backup computing resources. We formulate a new problem called SFF-driven multi-instance failures and protection (SMFP), and prove its NP-hardness. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, namely, SFF-centralized resource optimization (FCRO), which is based on the proposed techniques of backup auxiliary transferring, backup cost-effectiveness selection, and adaptive fit backup. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FCRO is effective and significantly outperforms the schemes directly extended from the existing work.}

	abstract = {Fog computing arises as a complement to cloud computing where computing and storage are provided in a decentralized way rather than the centralized approach of the cloud paradigm. In addition, blockchain provides a decentralized and immutable ledger which can provide support for running arbitrary logic thanks to smart contracts. These facts can lead to harness smart contracts on blockchain as the basis for a decentralized, autonomous, and resilient orchestrator for the resources in the fog. However, the potentially vast amount of geographically distributed fog nodes may threaten the feasibility of the orchestration. On the other hand, fog nodes can exhibit highly dynamic workloads which may result in the orchestrator redistributing the services among them. Thus, there is also a need to dynamically support the network connections to those services independently of their location. Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be integrated within the orchestrator to carry out a seamless service management. To tackle both aforementioned issues, the S-HIDRA architecture is proposed. It integrates SDN support within a blockchain-based orchestrator of container-based services for fog environments, in order to provide low network latency and high service availability. Also, a domain-based architecture is outlined as potential scenario to address the geographic distributed nature of fog environments. Results obtained from a proof-of-concept implementation assess the required functionality for S-HIDRA.}

	abstract = {Obstacle detection is a tool adopted in vehicular safety applications, aiming to detect a moving obstacle in an area of interest with the highest accuracy. Different sensors are used for this aim, such as LiDAR devices mounted on board of a vehicle that capture images of the surrounding environment. Extending the number of LiDAR sensors can be useful to improve the obstacle detection accuracy, since multiple images are captured from different distances and directions, and this represents an interesting approach, specially in case of dense networks with cooperative nodes. In this paper we present MuSLi technique, aiming to (i) provide an accurate obstacle detection and (ii) forward alert messages to other cars in the network, in case of correct detection of a pedestrian crossing the street. MuSLi relies on the connected content islands scenario, where each vehicle defined as a content island subscribes to a service in order to receive and share published messages. Specifically, the road safety service allows the detection of an obstacle through multiple LiDAR sensors from neighboring cars. Furthermore, we investigate the fastest transmission mode among those defined in the C-V2X releases to alert the presence of a pedestrian to the other approaching cars. The proposed technique provides the distances by the crossroad in which is better to use V2V, V2I or V2N according to the environment, the scheduling technique and the measured interference.}

	abstract = {Spectrum scarcity has been a major concern for achieving the desired quality of experience (QoE) in next-generation (5G/6G and beyond) networks supporting a massive volume of mobile and IoT devices with low-latency and seamless connectivity. Hence, spectrum sharing systems have been considered as a major enabler for next-generation wireless networks in meeting QoE demands. Specifically, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) has standardized coexistence of 4G LTE License Assisted Access (LAA) network with WiFi in the unlicensed 5 GHz bands, and the 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) with WiFi 6/6E in 6 GHz bands. While most current coexistence solutions and standards focus on performance improvement and QoE optimization, the emerging security challenges of such network environments have been ignored in the literature. The security framework of standalone networks (either 5G or WiFi) assumes the ownership of entire network resources from spectrum to core functions. Hence, all accesses to the network shall be authenticated and authorized within the intra-network security system and is deemed illegal otherwise. However, coexistence network environments can lead to unprecedented security vulnerabilities and breaches as the standalone networks shall tolerate unknown and out-of-network accesses, specifically in the medium access. In this paper, for the first time in literature, we review some of the critical and emerging security vulnerabilities in the 5G/WiFi coexistence network environment which have not been observed previously in standalone networks. Specifically, independent medium access control (MAC) protocols and the resulting hidden node issues can result in exploitation such as service blocking, deployment of rogue base-stations, and eavesdropping attacks. We study potential vulnerabilities in the perspective of physical layer authentication, network access security, and cross-layer authentication mechanisms. This study opens a new direction of research in the analysis and design of a security framework that can address the unique challenges of coexistence networks.}

To obtain optimal TCFS scheduling results, we design the scheduling constraints and propose an offline algorithm to efficiently schedule chain flows in the multi-level topology. Based on offline scheduling results, we further propose a heuristic method that includes time-tabling and sequencing algorithms to improve the dynamic scheduling performance. Experimental results show that the TCFS approach efficiently improves the schedulability for chain flows, as compared with benchmarks.}

	abstract = {A fundamental issue for federated learning (FL) is how to achieve efficient training performance under complex dynamic communication environments. This issue can be alleviated by the fact that modern edge devices usually can connect to the edge server via multiple communication channels (e.g., 4G, LTE, and 5G) because multi-channel communication can increase the communication bandwidth and has lower communication costs and energy consumption than a single high-speed communication channel. However, if the communication data cannot be properly allocated to multiple channels in a complex dynamic communication network, multi-channel communication will still waste resources (e.g., bandwidth, battery life, and monetary cost). In this paper, we propose an efficient FL framework called, which consists of two parts, the layered gradient compression (LGC), and a learning-driven control algorithm. Specifically, with LGC, local gradients from a device are coded into several layers, and each layer is sent to the server along a different channel. The FL server aggregates the received layers of local gradients from devices to update the global model and sends the result back to the devices. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of LGC and formally define the problem of resource-efficient with LGC. We then propose a learning-driven algorithm for each device to dynamically adjust its local computation (i.e., the number of local stochastic descent) and communication decisions (i.e., the compression level of different layers and the layer-to-channel mapping) in each iteration. Results from extensive experiments show that significantly reduces the training time and improves the resource utilization (energy consumption and money cost) while achieving a similar test accuracy compared with well-known FL baselines.}

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the workforce to switch to working from home, which has put significant burdens on the management of broadband networks and called for intelligent service-by-service resource optimization at the network edge. In this context, network traffic prediction is crucial for operators to provide reliable connectivity across large geographic regions. Although recent advances in neural network design have demonstrated potential to effectively tackle forecasting, in this work we reveal based on real-world measurements that network traffic across different regions differs widely. As a result, models trained on historical traffic data observed in one region can hardly serve in making accurate predictions in other areas. Training bespoke models for different regions is tempting, but that approach bears significant measurement overhead, is computationally expensive, and does not scale. Therefore, in this paper we propose TransMUSE (Transferable Traffic Prediction in MUlti-Service Edge Networks), a novel deep learning framework that clusters similar services, groups edge-nodes into cohorts by traffic feature similarity, and employs a Transformer-based Multi-service Traffic Prediction Network (TMTPN), which can be directly transferred within a cohort without any customization. We demonstrate that TransMUSE exhibits imperceptible performance degradation in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) when forecasting traffic, compared with settings where a model is trained for each individual edge node. Moreover, our proposed TMTPN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 43.21% lower MAE in the multi-service traffic prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly employs model transfer and multi-service traffic prediction to reduce measurement overhead, while providing fine-grained accurate demand forecasts for edge services provisioning.}

This means that data can be processed in local intelligent devices without being sent to the cloud for execution, bringing great convenience to end-users. Fog computing is a semi-virtualised service computing architecture model between cloud computing and personal computing. However, its virtualized environment is vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APT). In this paper, we propose an APT defense scheme based on MFC’s Double Q-learning (DQL) algorithm. First, we apply prospect theory (PT) to build a static subjective game model between APT attackers and legitimate users. In addition, a dynamic game scheme based on DQL is proposed against APT attacks. Finally, we compare our proposed method with the existing methods, i.e., the Q-learning algorithm, Sarsa algorithm and Greedy algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the attack motivation of APT attackers, improve the utility of legitimate users, and protect the security of the fog computing environment.}

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) enables network providers to provide functions of network services as virtual machines. Software-defined network (SDN) enables the network providers to control a network quickly and flexibly in a centralized manner. Service chaining is realized by utilizing NFV and SDN. Service chaining concatenates virtual network functions (VNFs) in the network to automatically process packets in an appropriate order. Routes of service function chains (SFCs) need to be updated to achieve users’ requirements, such as keeping the VNFs up-to-date, suppressing packet losses and processing delays, and continuing to provide services in case of VNF failure. States of VNF instances that make up the SFC need to be kept consistent when updating the SFC routes; otherwise, the accuracy of the processing in the VNF instance after the update can be reduced. Multiple SFCs need to be updated at the same time in some situations, such as security updates of VNFs. Existing models update SFCs one by one. If these models are adopted to the update of multiple SFCs, the total time required to update all SFCs can be long; problems such as leaving VNFs out-of-date can occur. This paper proposes a model that determines the update schedule of multiple SFCs guaranteeing state consistency. SFCs to be updated and where to update them are given in this model. The proposed model is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The objective function is minimizing the total time required to update all SFCs. The decision problem of the proposed model is proved to be NP-complete. We develop a heuristic algorithm since the optimal solution may not be obtained in a practical time when the number of requests increases. Numerical results show that the total time required to update all SFCs can be shortened by updating multiple SFCs at the same time. The numerical results also show that the total time can be shortened by dividing a large buffer into an adequate number of small buffers. The heuristic algorithm can reduce the computation time compared to the ILP approach with suppressing the total update time.}

	abstract = {LoRaWAN is now a leading technology in IoT developments due to its low power consumption and simple deployment features. Despite being termed a long-distance technology, its coverage is often hampered by the harsh propagation environment. In such cases, a very cost-effective solution is to use mobile gateways for both data collection and delivery at specific places of the edge, avoiding the need for cellular communication modules. This article addresses the optimization problem of deciding how mobile gateways should move, and which edge devices should be visited (and when) for collected data to be fed into the edge distributed storage, while ensuring data usefulness. This optimization problem of gateway mobility with edge storage is formulated mathematically, and a deep reinforcement learning framework is proposed to solve it. Results show that the proposed framework can achieve near optimal results, in particular for large-dense deployments and not very strict time windows. The proposed deep reinforcement learning solution is able to capture underlying patterns, like device coverage and traffic, without prior knowledge of such information.}

	abstract = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC), as a prospective computing paradigm, can significantly enhance computation capability and save energy of smart mobile device (SMD) by offloading computation-intensive tasks from resource-constrained SMDs onto the resource-rich central cloud. Compared to central cloud, edge cloud can provide services to nearby SMDs with lower latency. However, the edge cloud may be mobile and its resources are limited to multiple nearby users. Therefore, how to obtain an optimal offloading policy under the constraints of mobility and limited resource remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we aim to minimize the total execution cost of multiple devices by offloading the computations from SMDs onto edge clouds in edge cloud computing (ECC) system. By considering the mobility of SMDs and edge clouds, we first formulate the total cost minimization problem under the constraints of application completion deadline and connection time between SMDs and edge clouds as well as the limited computation resource of both edge clouds and SMDs. Then, by solving the minimization problem, we propose an optimal offloading selection strategy based on game model, and an edge cloud payoff competition algorithm to optimally allocate edge cloud resource to SMDs to achieve the minimum total execution cost. Experimental results show that our offloading strategy can effectively reduce energy consumption and application completion time compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

In this paper, we contribute to the capacity planning of the workforce in charge. To this end, we have extensively analyzed, with real-world data, behavioral changes in a large server population in a data center. Our findings allow classifying such behavioral changes, which may be indicative of potential trouble, into relevance regions using a ranking mechanism. Then, the proposed methodology allows, together with an estimation of the time to analyze, assessing the workforce necessary to proactively tackle the behavioral changes observed. We conclude with a case study from a working data center, including a hands-on implementation of a traffic analysis solution to detect such behavioral changes and an estimation of the needed workforce to analyze them. Our results show that between 4 and 5 network managers are an adequate number for handling behavioral-changes analysis in a large enterprise data center.}

	abstract = {The problem of finding a lightpath to provision a connection request in space-division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs) involves routing, modulation, spectrum and core assignment (RMSCA). Aiming at maximizing spectrum efficiency, the lightpath is always established with the modulation format that gives the highest data rate within the transmission reach and crosstalk (XT) threshold. For SDM-EONs based on multi-core fibers (MCFs), highest rate modulation format leads to lowest XT tolerance/threshold, or more spectrum fragments in adjacent cores. We call this problem XT-fragmentation. XT-fragmentation has been ignored by all existing RMSCA algorithms. In this paper, we first propose a way to measure the potential spectrum loss due to more fragments. Then a new modulation format selection (MFS) algorithm is designed with XF-fragmentation in mind. Simulation results show that RMSCA algorithms with MFS achieves lower request blocking probability than that without MFS.}

	abstract = {The recent proliferation of the Industrial Internet of Things has revealed the potential of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks as a complementary solution to cellular technologies. In this context, the LoRaWAN standard has already been consolidated as one of the most extended technologies in academia and industry for lightweight machine-type communications under negligible energy and cost. As LoRaWAN’s Aloha-like nature is known to hinder its reliability, especially under high-traffic and large-scale deployments, numerous time-slotted approaches have been presented as a means to schedule LoRa transmissions accordingly. However, the online allocation of resources based on application constraints has received scant attention in the literature, despite having proved to be significant in real-world deployments. To shed light on this question, this paper proposes a multi-agent approach to efficient resource allocation in multi-SF LoRaWAN networks, addressing architecture design, logic implementation and scalability-oriented evaluation. The integration of agents in the system resulted in network-size improvements of up to 21.6% and 66.7% (for nearby or scatter node distributions within the gateway, respectively). The work provides a set of learned lessons regarding slot-length computation and end-node allocation strategies enabling large-scale collision-free channel access in LoRaWAN networks.}

	abstract = {In recent decades, most internet-connected devices were personal computers. However, everything is connecting to the Internet over time. Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding rapidly, including everything from clothing to agricultural equipment. The Internet of Everything (IoE) is very complex and heterogeneous due to the independent development of its various sections. Hence, the coordination and management of its different equipment are challenging, and the energy consumption efficiency is very low, which is the bottleneck of battery-operated IoT equipment. So far, various methods have been proposed to reduce energy consumption in IoT devices. However, these methods are used independently and individually on a single IoT node, and none of them consider all objects in the IoT hierarchy together. Whereas the IoT network arises when various objects interact with each other. Therefore, focusing on energy consumption in a single node should be transformed into energy management at the whole network administrative level. In this paper, considering the IoT network features and the data exchange all over the network, a data manipulation method is proposed to reduce energy consumption and network traffic by decreasing the amount of data exchanged. Furthermore, we take advantage of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enhance the efficiency of this method by adapting our energy management decisions to the environmental conditions’ dynamicity. Simulation results using real data workloads demonstrate that the proposed method decreases energy consumption by up to 38.1% without an SDN. This reduction is significantly improved by up to 80.0% when utilizing SDN. We also experimentally evaluate the proposed method by its hardware implementation in the real environment and illustrate that a maximum of only 1.3% difference is observed between the simulation results and the experiments, which indicates the consistency of the results.}

	abstract = {Unattended wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), in which mobile sinks (MSs) are responsible for the data collection, and which are vulnerable to multiple attacks. For example, the adversaries can initiate MS replication attack after compromising a large number of sensor nodes (SNs). To resist such attacks, some scholars have proposed some schemes. In these schemes, it is assumed that MSs are equipped with tamper resistance hardware, so they are pre-distributed most of keys of a key pool for achieving authentication with SNs. However, in outdoor and even sensitive areas, tamper-resistant hardware is not always absolutely safe. Once MSs are compromised, networks become insecure. In this paper, we propose a secure model. The model contains three types of nodes, namely SNs, MSs, and a base station (BS). MSs are responsible for collecting the data encrypted by SNs and forwarding it to BS; BS is responsible for decrypting and analyzing the collected data. During the data collection process, an MS can collect an SN's data only after being authenticated by the SN using the pre-distribution key information. But it cannot decrypt the collected data. In this model, the adversaries can induce a new type of false data injection attack. In the attack, the replicated MSs impersonate uncompromised SNs to send false data to BS by using the compromised key information. If BS accepts a large amount of false data, it will make a wrong judgment. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed model has excellent resistance against MS replication attacks and false data injection attacks by setting appropriate parameter values.}

	abstract = {Web-based services have nowadays aggregated the majority of applications, ranging from multimedia delivery to instant messaging, embracing requirements from different classes of users (i.e., gamers, streamers, professionals, etc.). The common factor is the need for connectivity everywhere and every time at high performance and quality, while the services traffic profiles and the users’ behaviour can be drastically different. This need is fully satisfied by the recent 5G mobile networks, where the coexistence of heterogeneous applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) levels is possible, defining new vertical markets and cutting-edge applications. In this context, we propose a Flexible Web Traffic Generator (FWTG) tool to model the dynamics of recent applications and user interactions in a realistic way, allowing the generation of real-time HTTP traffic and the possibility to inject it into real networks. FTWG represents a valid in-laboratory solution for the rapid configuration and applications performance evaluation of network slices in the context of 5G Non-Public Networks (NPN), pursuing an effective emulation approach. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the evaluation of real traffic response to different network configurations (and vice-versa), using components, equipment and network functions of the target network under test. After the description of the rationale and the methodology for defining FWTG models and their implementation, we defined a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) generated by the tool (e.g., number of requested objects and size, request rate, throughput, etc.). Then, we present initial validation tests on a Linux-based testbed representing the 5G-based scenarios of interest, emulating also a satellite backhaul as representative of a use-case requiring cost-effective dimensioning. Numerical outcomes of running FWTG in different configurations are then provided, considering a variation of the number of users sharing the same resources, their composition and traffic type, showing with concrete examples the usefulness and flexibility of FWTG in supporting 5G network configuration optimizations. Definitively, the tool is released as Open Source software on Gitlab.}

It deals with Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement (MAKA) between Mobile User (MU) and Foreign Agent (FA). It replaces the traditional Elliptic Curve Computational Diffie–Hellman Problem (ECCDHP) by Elliptic Curve Factorization Problem (ECFP) to reduce the computational overhead of the authentication system while keeping the system security unaltered. It can preserve user anonymity and conditional privacy using session-wise unique anonymous identities of MU, where each anonymous identity hides the real identity in such a way so that only Home Agent (HA) can recompute it. Besides, our protocol also concentrates on the anonymity and conditional privacy of FA. It also provides a simplified revocation strategy which minimizes the revocation and re-registration costs of the authentication system. We validate the security features through informal and formal security analysis. Finally, we present a performance comparison, and discuss the efficiency of the proposed protocol.}
