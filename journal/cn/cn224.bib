	abstract = {Sixth generation (6G) internet of things (IoT) networks will modernize the applications and satisfy user demands through implementing smart and automated systems. Intelligence-based infrastructure, also called reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have been introduced as a potential technology striving to improve system performance in terms of data rate, latency, reliability, availability, and connectivity. A huge amount of cost-effective passive components are included in RISs to interact with the impinging electromagnetic waves in a smart way. However, there are still some challenges in RIS system, such as finding the optimal configurations for a large number of RIS components. In this paper, we first provide a complete outline of the advancement of RISs along with machine learning (ML) algorithms and overview the working regulations as well as spectrum allocation in intelligent IoT systems. Also, we discuss the integration of different ML techniques in the context of RIS, including deep reinforcement learning (DRL), federated learning (FL), and FL-deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DDPG) techniques which are utilized to design the radio propagation atmosphere without using pilot signals or channel state information (CSI). Additionally, in dynamic intelligent IoT networks, the application of existing integrated ML solutions to technical issues like user movement and random variations of wireless channels are surveyed. Finally, we present the main challenges and future directions in integrating RISs and other prominent methods to be applied in upcoming IoT networks.}

	abstract = {Next-Generation Networks (NGNs) provide efficient services to improve the overall network performance, especially in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, service placement requires a significant cost in terms of multi-resource chaining guarantees. Therefore, the balance between improving network performance and optimizing resources orchestration is still a fundamental issue to assure the benefits of NGNs with optimal resources’ utilization. In this paper, we present new approaches for Service Function Chain (SFC) orchestration in Virtual Mobile Edge Computing (VMEC) environments, where IoT devices are used as on-demand virtual edge servers. We propose Optimal SFC Placement in VMEC over AI-IoT (OSPV) algorithm to select the optimal virtual mobile edge (VME) according to heterogeneous computing resources constraints. Moreover, to deal with OSPV complexity issues in dense IoT networks, we propose an Efficient SFC Placement in VMEC over AI-IoT (ESPV) algorithm that selects sufficient VME nodes for services operations and deployments. Furthermore, recent Deep Learning (DL) techniques such LSTM and GRU are implied to predict mobility and energy consumption sequences of IoT devices. These instances introduce feasible sets of IoT nodes, where the optimization algorithms should operate. Results show the efficiency of the DL instances and prove that the prediction awareness prevents the selected VME from failure and disconnection during the communication. Moreover, the proposed optimization algorithms are implemented and evaluated under different computing scenarios. Then, they are compared according to total allocated servers and SFC placement time. Optimization results show that both algorithms are efficient in terms of predetermined key performance indicators compared to the state of the art.}

We aim to maximize the residual energy of all energy harvesting based EUs while ensuring that EUs can complete their tasks, by jointly optimizing EUs’ task processing mode (local computing mode or edge computing mode), task offloading mode, and system resource-allocation. For the task offloading mode, each EU can select the bistatic backscatter (BB) communication mode or the harvest-then-transmit (HTT) mode to directly offload its task to the MEC server co-located with the H-AP. Also, each EU can select the ambient backscatter (AB)＋BB communication mode or the AB＋HTT communication mode to backscatter its data to nearby EUs through AB communication and then offload data to the MEC server with the help of nearby EUs through HTT or BB communication. First, we formulate a residual energy maximization problem for the considered system. Since the formulated optimization problem is non-convex with multiple coupled variables, we adopt the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to decompose it into several subproblems. Then, we utilize the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) to transform the non-convex subproblems into convex subproblems, and propose the distributed joint task processing/offloading mode selection and system resource-allocation schemes. Finally, we verify and evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme through numerical analyses, which show that our proposed scheme outperforms the other benchmark schemes in terms of the residual energy and the task completion rate of EUs by jointly selecting the task processing mode and the task offloading mode for each EU.}

	abstract = {Epidemics, such as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), have serious consequences globally, of which the most effective way to control the infection is contact tracing. Nowadays, research related to privacy-preserving epidemic infection control has been conducted, nevertheless, current researchers do not regard the authenticity of records and infection facts as well as poor traceability. Moreover, with the emergence of quantum computing, there is a bottleneck in upholding privacy, security and efficiency. Our paper proposes a privacy-preserving epidemic infection control scheme through lattice-based linkable ring signature in blockchain, called AQRS. Firstly, our scheme adopts a blockchain with three ledgers to store information in a distributed manner, which offers transparency and immunity from the Single Point of Failure (SPoF) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Moreover, we design a lattice-based linkable ring signature scheme to secure privacy-preserving of epidemic infection control. Significantly, we are the first to introduce the lattice-based linkable ring signature into privacy preserving in epidemic control scenario. Security analysis indicates that our scheme ensures unconditional users anonymity, record unforgeability, signature linkability, link non-slanderability and contact traceability. Finally, the comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that our scheme has an efficient time-consuming, storage consumption and system communication overhead and is practical for epidemic and future pandemic privacy-preserving.}

In this paper, we analyze the Ukrainian Internet during the first months of war after the Russian invasion occurred in February 2022. The analysis is carried out from two points of view: routing and latency. In terms of routing, there is a substantial increase in BGP announcements and withdrawals which can be due to both the physical unavailability of facilities and cyberattacks. Latency also increased significantly compared to the pre-conflict period, especially when considering paths going from Ukraine to Russia. The increase in latency appears to be due to a partial shift from peering to transit.}

In light of this, the orthogonal time–frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is explored for meeting the high-Doppler communication requirements. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the critical application technologies and state-of-art approaches to OTFS modulation. First, we summarize the input–output expression relation under the different domains and the interference analysis under different waveforms, which is significant for the follow-up research. Secondly, the comparison between the existing modulation methods and OTFS modulation is discussed, which provides a reference for the improvement of the OTFS system. Next, detailed and exhaustive reviews of current OTFS-based hotpots are provided, including channel estimation, signal detection, etc. Further, the OTFS technologies are applied to specific application scenarios and the corresponding advantages are analyzed. Based on the above research status, we present our vision on the research trends and open issues, highlighting the opportunity for OTFS to be a promising next-generation candidate in future communication.}

	abstract = {The development of Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Wearable Health Monitoring Systems (WHMS) play a key role in healthcare monitoring. WBAN includes medical sensors that monitor vital signs of patients, collect data and usually transmit them to medical servers via wireless channels. Therefore, the patient’s sensitive information sent over the channel can be vulnerable to various attacks. Hence, designing lightweight authentication security protocols for these systems with the lowest computational and communication costs has become a major challenge. Recently, Sowjanya et al. (2020) presented a lightweight authentication scheme for WHMS based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which provides optimal security features and low storage, communication and computational costs. In this paper, the security of their scheme is evaluated and passive insider secret disclosure and replay attacks against their scheme are presented. It is obvious that other attacks such as desynchronization attack and impersonation attack can be applied to this protocol by obtaining the secret value of network manager. The complexity of our proposed attacks is just one run of the protocol and their success probability equals to one. Finally, by remedying the Sowjanya et al. (2020) ’s protocol, a lightweight ECC-based authentication scheme called ECCPWS is proposed. Moreover, the proposed protocol’s security proof is performed via informal methods and also formally through Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, BAN logic, Scyther and AVISPA tools. The security verification results of ECCPWS show that the ECCPWS has complete security against various security vulnerabilities and attacks.}

The concept of Digital-care is based on providing a permanent connection between the patient and the medical department (medical staff), and the ability to analyze the patient's data automatically. With the existence of modern wireless networks, which support, for example, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, virtual reality, virtual machine, and low-power wireless networks it is possible to achieve this permanent connection while maintaining confidentiality and privacy of patient data. Digital-care applications rely on essential features, such as ensuring availability, almost zero delays, adequate storage capacity, and data protection.

This paper presents a comprehensive concept of Digital-care applications, the wireless network infrastructure required by those applications, the role of current and future wireless networks in their prospects, and the challenges they face.

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of sensor-rich mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing (SC) has emerged as a new crowdsourcing paradigm harnessing the crowd to perform location-dependent tasks. To appropriately select workers that are near the tasks, SC systems need to perform location-based task assignment, which requires collecting worker locations and task locations. Such practice, however, may easily compromise the location privacy of workers. In light of this, in this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate PPTA, a new system framework for location privacy-preserving task assignment in SC with strong security guarantees. PPTA takes advantage of only lightweight cryptography (such as additive secret sharing, function secret sharing, and secure shuffle), and provides a suite of tailored secure components required by practical location-based task assignment processes. Specifically, aiming for practical usability, PPTA is designed to flexibly support two realistic task assignment settings: (i) the online setting where tasks arrive and get processed at the SC platform one by one, and (ii) the batch-based setting where tasks arrive and get processed in a batch. Extensive experiments over a real-world dataset demonstrate that while providing strong security guarantees, PPTA supports task assignment with efficacy comparable to plaintext baselines and with promising performance.}

Based on a publish/subscribe pattern, it relies on a single broker to exchange messages among clients according to topics of interest. However, such a centralized approach does not scale well and is prone to single point of failure risks, calling for solutions where multiple brokers cooperate together in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we present a complete solution for a distributed MQTT broker systems. We target several functional primitives which are key in such a scenario: broker discovery and failure recovery, overlay tree network creation and message routing. Moreover, we also focus on the case where multiple topics are present in the system. In such a scenario, a single tree-based overlay network connecting the different brokers may not be the most efficient solution. To cope with this issue, we propose a topic-based routing scheme for MQTT distributed brokers. The proposed solution creates multiple overlay networks in the distributed system, each one linking together only the brokers whose connected clients have interest in the same topics. We implement the complete system as an extension of the popular HiveMQ MQTT broker and perform several experiments to test its performance in scenarios characterized by a different publishers/subscribers configurations as well as number of topics existing in the system.}

Traditional encrypted traffic classification techniques can only handle a fixed number of traffic classes and require all traffic data to be available at the same time, which consume a huge amount of memory to save the traffic data. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning method for encrypted traffic classification, called ILETC, to achieve continuous learning of encrypted traffic. ILETC can learn new encrypted traffic classes while avoiding forgetting knowledge of old encrypted traffic, with limited memory resources. It uses WGAN-GP to model the data distribution of encrypted traffic and design an exemplar set to select and store representative real traffic data. When learning from a new class of encrypted traffic, ILETC replays the knowledge of the old classes with the generated samples and exemplars to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset and self-collected dataset are used to test the performance of ILETC. The results show that ILETC is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of over 98% on the ISCX dataset and over 94% in the two datasets together.}

Fog-enabled IoT architecture has evolved to accomplish these tasks at the fog layer. However, fog computing devices have limited power supply and computation resources compared to cloud devices. In delay-sensitive applications of fog-enabled IoT architecture, executing tasks with stringent deadlines while reducing the service latency and energy usage of fog resources is a difficult challenge. This paper presents an effective task scheduling strategy to allocate fog computing resources for IoT requests to meet the deadline of the requests and resource availability. Initially, the scheduling problem is formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to reduce the energy consumption of the fog resources and service time of the tasks subject to the deadline and resource availability constraints. To address the high dimensionality issue of the tasks in a dynamic environment, a fuzzy-based reinforcement learning (FRL) mechanism is employed to reduce the service delay of the tasks and energy usage of the fog nodes. Initially, the tasks are prioritized using fuzzy logic. Then the prioritized tasks are scheduled using the on-policy reinforcement learning technique, which enhances the long-term reward compared to the\nQ\n-learning approach. Further, the evaluation outcomes reflect that the proposed task scheduling technique outperforms the existing algorithms with an improvement of up to 23% and 18% regarding service latency and energy consumption, respectively.}

	abstract = {Recently, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing has become an important weapon for cyber defenders to mitigate the increasing number of cyber attacks in a proactive and collaborative manner. However, with the dramatic increase in the deployment of shared communications between organizations, data has been a major priority to detect threats in the CTI sharing platform. In the modern environment, a valuable asset is the user’s threat data. Privacy policies are necessary to ensure the security of user data in the threat intelligence sharing community. Federated learning acts as a special machine learning technique for privacy preservation and offers to contextualize data in a CTI sharing platform. Therefore, this article proposes a new approach to threat intelligence sharing called BFLS (Blockchain and Federated Learning for sharing threat detection models as Cyber Threat Intelligence), where blockchain-based CTI sharing platforms are used for security and privacy. Federated learning technology is adopted for scalable machine learning applications, such as threat detection. Furthermore, users can obtain a well-trained threat detection model without sending personal data to the central server. Experimental results on the ISCX-IDS-2012 and CIC-DDoS-2019 datasets showed that BFLS can securely share CTI and has high accuracy in threat detection. The accuracies of BFLS are 98.92% and 98.56% on the two datasets, respectively.}

	abstract = {Sybil attacks in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) conduct malicious behavior by falsifying and faking messages between vehicles. It poses a significant threat to the safety of vehicle movement. Meanwhile, because Sybil attacks often hide the real identity of the attacker with the help of a legitimate pseudonym, making it very difficult to detect them. Most existing detection schemes use a single data source, which is not enough to describe the specific characteristics of the attack behavior accurately, while their detection performance is also affected by real scenario factors such as traffic flow and attacker density. Therefore, we propose a multi-source data fusion detection framework for Sybil attacks based on the study of the behavior characteristics of Sybil attacks and the impact of the attacks on the traffic flow state. We get basic safety messages data, map data and sensor data and then obtain multi-dimensional data fusion features from four aspects: spatio-temporal location relationship, traffic flow state change, vehicle behavior characteristics and sensor data verification, and finally use machine learning classification model to complete the detection of attack behavior. Experimental results show that our proposed attack detection framework is able to locate the specific road section where the attack occurred in a realistic and complex traffic scenario containing different road types without using trusted vehicles as observation nodes, and has good generalization capability. the average detection accuracy of the MDFD framework for four types of compound attacks is as high as 97.69%.}

	abstract = {Growing Internet usage on mobile devices in cellular networks makes it increasingly important to assure good performance for web traffic, which often consists of many short-lived TCP flows. For TCP, and in the future likely also for QUIC, CUBIC is the most widely deployed congestion control algorithm. With Linux, HyStart is used as default Slow Start algorithm. In this paper we investigate performance impairments occurring when the combination of CUBIC and HyStart is used in low-delay cellular networks. To explain the problem in detail, we present measurements of characteristic per-packet round-trip times caused by uplink scheduling in mobile networks. Inherent round-trip time variations often trigger an early exit of Slow Start, causing CUBIC to underutilize the available capacity. In addition, we extend earlier throughput models for TCP CUBIC to accurately estimate the throughput for short-lived flows as a function of the congestion window size at the Slow Start exit point. We validate the model by measurement results. Further, we propose two HyStart improvements enhancing TCP CUBIC’s performance significantly. In our LTE testbed the mean throughput of a 5 MB data transfer increases by 10.5%. Given the nature of web traffic, these fixes can improve the web experience of users noticeably. This shows the importance of measurements, testing, and subsequent optimizations when designing and evaluating transport and congestion control mechanisms for mobile networks.}

	abstract = {In multi-provider 5G/6G networks, service delegation enables administrative domains to federate in provisioning NFV network services. Admission control in selecting the appropriate domain for service deployment, without prior knowledge of service requests’ statistical distributions, is fundamental to maximize average profit. This paper analyzes a general federation contract model for service delegation in various ways. First, under the assumption of known system dynamics, we obtain the theoretically optimal performance bound by formulating the admission control problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and solving it through dynamic programming, which is used as a benchmark to evaluate practical solutions. Second, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to practically tackle the problem when the arrival and departure rates are not known. For the first time in this context, we analyze the performance of the widely used Q-Learning algorithm, and prove as it maximizes the discounted rewards, it is not an efficient solution due to its sensitivity to the discount factor. Then, we propose the average reward reinforcement learning approach (named “R-Learning”) to find the policy that directly maximizes the average profit. Finally, we evaluate different solutions through extensive simulations and experimentally using the 5Growth management and orchestration platform. Results confirm that the proposed R-Learning solution always outperforms Q-Learning and the greedy policies. Furthermore, while there is at most a 9% optimality gap in the ideal simulation environment, it competes with the MDP solution in the experimental assessment.}

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can be employed in various applications, including traffic control, and delivery application. However, these services are susceptible to various security attacks because sensitive data are exchanged through an open channel. Thus, a secure authentication scheme is essential for UAV. UAV has limited storage resources and computing capabilities. To overcome these problems, cloud computing is considered as a promising solution. Cloud computing provides various properties such as storage availability and scalability. Unfortunately, the cloud server’s database can be a major target for an adversary because it is a centralized system. If an adversary intrudes on the cloud server’s database, he/she may attempt to intercept or learn the stored data. To mitigate these issues, we design a secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme for cloud-assisted UAV using blockchain in flying ad-hoc networks, called LAKA-UAV. LAKA-UAV utilizes blockchain technology to ensure access control and data integrity using log transactions and the cloud server securely manages collected data from UAV. We prove the security of LAKA-UAV based on informal security analysis and formal security verification implementation. Based on testbed experiments using MIRACL, LAKA-UAV provides about 2.13 times more efficient performance on average compared with related schemes in terms of computation. We present the blockchain implementation using Hyperledger Sawtooth platform.}

	abstract = {The sharp increase in encrypted traffic brings a huge challenge to traditional traffic classification methods. Combining deep learning with time series analysis techniques is a recent trend in solving this problem. Most of these approaches only capture the temporal correlation within a flow. The accuracy and robustness are unsatisfactory, especially in an unstable network environment with high packet loss and reordering. How to learn a representation with a strong generalization ability for each encrypted traffic flow remains a key challenge. Our detailed analysis indicates that there is a graph with particular local structures corresponding to each type of encrypted traffic flow. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel deep learning framework called EC-GCN to classify encrypted traffic flows based on multi-scale graph convolutional neural networks. We first provide a novel lightweight layer that only relies on the metadata and encodes each encrypted traffic flow into graph representations. So that our framework can be independent of different encryption protocols. Then we design a novel graph pooling and structure learning layer to dynamically extract the multi-graph representations and improve the capabilities to adapt to complex network environments. EC-GCN is an end-to-end classification model that learns representative spatial–temporal traffic features hidden in a traffic time series and then classifies them in a unified framework. Our comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets indicate that EC-GCN can achieve up to 5%–20% accuracy improvement and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}

Various neural network models have been created to increase the accuracy of distinguishing between ciphertext and random sequences. However, few studies have focused on differential analysis at the design stage of cryptographic algorithms. This paper presents an appropriate model for differential analysis of block ciphers. The model is similar to multilayer perceptron (MLP) models in simplicity and clarity. It also introduces a shortcut connection that enables one to learn more information about the differential analysis dataset. The model is used to predict the minimum number of active S-boxes (AS), linking differential analysis results to algorithm features. This model and two classical neural network models are compared under fair experimental conditions. The findings indicate that our model predicts the AS values with an accuracy of 97%. It can effectively predict the results of differential analysis. In addition, the differential analysis dataset is constructed for SPN structure cryptographic algorithms.

Reconfigurable air-to-ground channels enable aerial stations to enhance users’ access links by means of seeking good line-of-sight connectivity while hovering in the air. In this article, we propose an analytical framework for the 3D placement of a fleet of coordinated drone relays. This framework optimizes network performance in terms of user throughput fairness, expressed through the\nα\n-fairness metric. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex program, which is intractable. Hence, we propose an extremal-optimization-based algorithm, Parallelized Alpha-fair Drone Deployment (PADD), which solves the problem online, in low-degree polynomial time. We evaluate our proposal by means of numerical simulations over the real topology of a dense city. We discuss the advantages of integrating drone relay stations in current networks and test several resource scheduling approaches in both static and dynamic scenarios, including with progressively larger and denser crowds.}

	abstract = {The traditional method of saving energy in Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) is based on consolidating more virtual machines (VMs) in fewer servers and putting the rest in sleep mode, which may lead to the overheating of servers resulting in performance degradation and cooling cost. The lack of an accurate and computationally efficient model to describe the thermal condition of the data center environment makes it challenging to develop an effective and adaptive VMP mechanism. Although recently, data-driven approaches have acted successfully in model construction, the shortage of clean, adequate, and sufficient amounts of data put limits their generalizability. Moreover, any change in the data center configuration during operation, makes these models prone to error and forces them to repeat the learning process. Thus, researchers turn to applying model-free paradigms such as reinforcement learning. Due to the vast action-state space of real-world applications, scalability is one of the significant challenges in this area. In addition, the delayed feedback of environmental variables such as temperature give rise to exploration costs. In this paper, we present a decentralized implementation of reinforcement learning along with a novel state-action representation to perform the VMP in the data centers to optimize energy consumption and keep the host temperature as low as possible while satisfying Service Level Agreements (SLA). Our experimental results show more than 17% improvement in energy consumption and 12% in CPU temperature reduction compared to baseline algorithms. We also succeeded in accelerating optimal policy convergence after the occurrence of a configuration change.}

They provide enhanced efficiency, more flexibility, and important cost savings for patients, healthcare providers, and medical professionals in home, as well as hospital settings. Mutual authentication with anonymity and session unlinkability belongs to an important class of authentication schemes for WBANs. Among the security schemes of this class, the scheme presented in Li et al. (2017) is seen as the lightest in terms of resource consumption. However, several recent papers reported that the scheme exhibits some problems with session unlinkability and forward secrecy of session keys. In this paper, we first present a security analysis of the Li et al. scheme and then propose a new security enhancement that ensures both session unlinkability and forward secrecy. Through a deep analysis, we show that the proposed scheme exhibits high robustness against well-known security attacks and prove its safety using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool while assuring mutual authentication with BAN-logic. In terms of complexity, the proposed scheme exhibits a lower XOR and random number generation costs observed in Li et al. and other proposed schemes. Consequently, we have considered such costs in the proposed scheme and we shifted the costly random number generation function from the sensor node to the hub in order to enhance computation performance, energy consumption, and communication. Finally, we evaluated the proposed scheme using Castalia framework and demonstrated its high efficiency.}

	abstract = {In the 21st century, the industry of drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has witnessed a rapid increase with its large number of airspace users. The tremendous benefits of this technology in civilian applications such as hostage rescue and parcel delivery will integrate smart cities in the future. Nowadays, the affordability of commercial drones expands their usage on a large scale. However, the development of drone technology is associated with vulnerabilities and threats due to the lack of efficient security implementations. Moreover, the complexity of UAVs in software and hardware triggers potential security and privacy issues. Thus, posing significant challenges for the industry, academia, and governments.}

	abstract = {Network Slicing (NS) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) are recognized as a promising paradigm for mobile Content Delivery Network (CDN) by instantiating Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on MEC platforms. Mobile network exhibits intrinsic dynamics, where user requests patterns vary in time and space due to human behaviors. The requirements and distribution of users are arbitrary spatio-temporal stochastic variables, which makes the deployment and reconfiguration of a CDN slice a challenging task. In this work, by adopting a periodical reconfiguration strategy, we consider a CDN slice system which operates in discrete time intervals. Within each time interval, we formalize the CDN-MEC-VNFs Planning (CMVP) problem based on uncertain programming to tackle the dynamic and uncertain mobile network environment, where user requests are treated as random variables with arbitrary pattern. Then, we propose a data-driven and learning-based algorithm which integrates Stochastic Simulation (SS), Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and meta-heuristic algorithm to determine the provisioning of the CDN slice from historical user requests information. The practicability of the proposed mechanism in offline training and online running are also discussed. Finally, we conducted intensive real-trace driven simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on planning CDN slice with higher QoS under dynamic system environment and arbitrary user requests by comparing towards several baselines.}

	abstract = {In cognitive radio (CR), dynamic spectrum access (DSA) can be used for secondary user (SU) to improve its spectrum efficiency under the limited spectrum resources. However, the SU has to consume more energy to sense the state of primary user (PU) before spectrum access. Therefore, high spectrum efficiency and lower energy consumption have become the requirements of CR. In this paper, we propose a sustainable green CR network combining DSA and energy harvesting, which can perform intelligent spectrum sensing, spectrum access and energy harvesting by a reward mechanism of deep Q-learning multiple networks (DQMN). The DQMN model consisting of multiple neural networks is designed to learn multiple learning objectives, including spectrum sensing, channel selection, communication power and access mode in DSA. A sleep mechanism is introduced to optimize the spectrum access mode and further reduce the energy consumption. The simulation results show that the DQMN-based DSA model can autonomously sense the channel state, harvest the energy, and then select the appropriate access strategy. Due to the energy harvesting and sleep mechanism, the proposed system model shows lower energy consumption and higher average effective throughput than the traditional models.}

	abstract = {In order to improve the spectrum efficiency and communication robustness, we propose a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme in large-scale cellular networks with Device-to-Device (D2D) communication and opportunistic relaying. The distribution of base stations (BSs) is assumed to follow homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). Each BS communicates to both a near-user (CU\n1\n) and a far-user (CU\n2\n) in its coverage area. A collaborative region is defined between each BS and CU\n2\n, wherein there are multiple D2D transmitters (DTs) uniformly distributed and intending to communicate with a common D2D receiver (DR). Among all the DTs that has correctly decoded the data of CU\n2\n, one is selected to perform the single-hop decode-and-forward relaying. The selected DT superimposes its own data onto CU\n2\n’s data, and broadcasts the composite signal. If there is no DT available to forward the cellular data, the DT with the best channel quality towards DR will be selected to transmit the pure D2D data. Through properly modeling the aggregate interference, we analyze the throughput of each terminal. Numerical results show that with specific parameter settings, the NOMA scheme with optimal relay selection can greatly outperform random relay selection in terms of the far-user’s throughput and the system throughput. With optimal relay selection, the proposed NOMA scheme can achieve much higher throughput than the orthogonal multiple access scheme.}

	abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive computing devices surrounding us operate and interact with each other to provide several significant services in industries, medical as well as in daily life activities at home, office, education sectors, and so on. The participating devices in an IoT network usually have resource constraints and the devices are prone to different cyber attacks, leading to the loopholes in the security and authentication. As a revolutionized and innovated technology, blockchain, that is applied in cryptocurrency, market prediction, etc., uses a distributed ledger that records transactions securely and efficiently. To utilize the great potential of blockchain, both industries and academia have paid a significant attention to integrate it with the IoT, as reported by several existing literature. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is able to embed intelligence in a system, and thus the AI can be integrated with IoT devices in order to automatically cope with different environments according to the demands. Furthermore, both blockchain and AI can be integrated with the IoT to design an automated secure and robust IoT model, as mentioned by numerous existing works. In this survey, we present a discussion on the IoT, blockchain, and AI, along with the descriptions of several research works that apply blockchain and AI in the IoT. In this direction, we point out strengths and limitations of the related existing researches. We also discuss different open challenges to exploit the full capacities of blockchain and AI in designing an IoT-based model. Therefore, the highlighted challenging issues can open the door for the development of future IoT models which will be intelligent and secure based on the integration of blockchain and AI with the IoT.}

	abstract = {The current network security defense decision method is based on the principle of attack–defense confrontation and generally uses a random network model to project the real network. Most of the existing complex network defense decision methods consider a single defender while ignoring the confrontation and dependence between network attack and defense behaviors. In addition, the pertinence and dynamics of the defense effect are also insufficient. This article comprehensively considers the structure of a scale-free network and characteristics of network attack and defense behavior and combines a complex network with differential game theory to study the real-time defense decision problem. First, a propagation model based on a scale-free network is designed to realize the real-time fluctuation analysis of a network security state. Then, the attack and defense strategy are described, and the calculation method of revenue based on the confrontation analysis of the attack and defense behavior and a change in the security state of the network nodes based on the saddle point equilibrium strategy are introduced. Finally, based on the average connection degree of the real word Internet, a simulated network is constructed to conduct experiments. By comparison with random defense strategies and several typical complex network defense decision methods, the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed method are verified.}

	abstract = {Network slicing has been attracting attention as a technology for providing flexible services while satisfying a wide variety of service requirements. On the network slice, individual services are virtually embedded in the form of service function chain (SFC). The embedded SFCs lose the efficiency of their placement due to traffic fluctuations, so they need to be reconfigured to the placement that allows for low-cost network operation at the right time. There are several works that take a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address such reconfiguration problems. However, these approaches have a fixed number of SFCs to be reconfigured at a time, and do not assume a situation where the number of SFCs varies due to service arrival or termination. This paper proposes Deep reinforcement learning model for Network Slice Reconfiguration with Dummy and Partial greedy exploration (DNSR-DP), an online learning model that addresses the problem of SFC reconfiguration on a specific network slice under the situation where the number of SFCs varies. By introducing dummy state/action, DNSR-DP keeps the state/action representation. Therefore, DNSR-DP can continue to learn one model regardless of the variation of the number of SFCs in the middle of operation. In addition, we introduce an exploration policy for online learning, the partial-\nϵ\n-greedy policy, which enables DNSR-DP to avoid unnecessary exploration and reduce the cost of exploration. Numerical results show that dummy state/action and the partial-\nϵ\n-greedy policy work effectively, and that DNSR-DP can continue stable learning under the situation where the number of SFCs varies, keeping the total cost of reconfiguration low.}

	abstract = {A large number of IoT devices geographically distributed in urban areas makes it attractive to collect massive data in a crowdsourced manner. To fully exploit the value of crowdsourced data, there has been a significant growth in demand for data trading recently. However, trading data exposes data owners to privacy violations. Existing studies based on centralized differential privacy are impractical due to the assumption of a trustworthy data collector, the high risk of privacy leakage, and extensive communication costs, let alone the data owners’ personalized requirements on privacy protection. To this end, we propose a contract theory-based personalized privacy-aware data trading approach that provides a set of optimal contracts specifying different privacy-preserving levels and data trading prices to selfish data owners who upload perturbed data according to the negotiated privacy-preserving level, and finally aggregates the data using a group-weighted maximum likelihood estimation method. The proposed private data trading approach not only achieves desirable data utility in terms of accuracy but also satisfies budget feasibility, individual rationality, and incentive compatibility through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.}

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are getting common in the market nowadays and being used in numerous real-time applications because they are lightweight, cost-effective, easy to control. With the growth of emerging UAV technology, it also needs to improve the security in many applications that are using this technology for solving multipurpose use cases. However, the malicious use of UAVs threatens privacy and security, so there is an immense need to secure critical information by preventing the UAVs from being tampered with denial of service (DoS) attacks, impersonation attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To fulfill such a goal, in this paper, we design a new blockchain-envisioned authenticated key agreement mechanism in a UAV network. We prove the security of our proposed protocol using the random oracle model and also with the AVISPA tool under the given adversarial model. We also provide the informal security analysis that shows the protocol is secure against various attacks such as man-in-the-middle attack, denial of service attack and impersonation attack. Furthermore, to realize the performance of our proposed protocol, we perform comparative analysis in terms of security features, communication, and computation costs. We show that the proposed protocol performs better than Kaur et al. by 10.45%. Finally, the comparative analysis shows that the proposed protocol offers better communication and computation performance and added security features as compared to the state-of-the-art authentication protocols.}

Although the OFDMA MU communications enable multiple users to be served at the same time in both DL (Down-Link) and UL (Up-Link) directions, several challenges remain to be met in order to design a MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol that fairly allocates and effectively utilizes the RUs. The challenges addressed are: (1) define when and how using 802.11ax control frames, (2) establish a fair sending policy of UL needs, (3) adopt a strategy to select a channel structure, and (4) avoid loss in spectral efficiency and timeout BA (Block Acknowledgment). In this paper, we proposed the FAEU-RUs protocol (Fair Allocation and Effective Utilization of RUs) by meeting each of the challenges of OFMDA MU communications. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the FAEU-RUs protocol significantly enhances the overall performance of the network but also the individual performance of each type of traffic (DL and UL) and each category of station.}
