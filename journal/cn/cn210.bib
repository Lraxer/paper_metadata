	abstract = {UAV-based mobile relay communication systems have an important position in future wireless networks, such as Beyond 5G and 6G, which provide ubiquitous network services. Along this line, UAV-based single-hop relay systems have numerous applications in emergency situations, such as data ferry and assisting post-disaster areas. Although there have been numerous works on optimizing trajectories and other communication resources on such systems, there are few studies on delay performance at the granular packet level. In addition to having homogeneous traffic, such a system can be equipped with diverse traffic with different QoS requirements, owing to the emergence of various applications in today’s communication networks. Based on the traffic requirements, packets with high-priority traffic should be served ahead of those with low-priority ones. To this end, we aim to analytically study the average end-to-end packet delay and buffer overflow performance of such a system at the granular packet level. However, packet-level queuing analysis of heterogeneous traffic is not as straightforward as that of homogeneous traffic. While considering different traffic requirements, we establish a priority queuing model for the source and the UAV nodes based on the stochastic process. Then, on the basis of the established queuing model, the average end-to-end packet delay and buffer overflow probability of the system under different trajectories are studied. Through extensive numerical simulations, we verified the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed analytical model. The results show that the average packet delay and packet drop probability of high-priority packets under all trajectories are significantly better compared to low-priority packets. UAV trajectory has a great impact on network performance, and an appropriate mobile trajectory that takes full use of channel capacity is superior to a static one.}

	abstract = {This paper introduces an architecture – B2H – to enable a delay-tolerant public blockchain network (PBCN) in healthcare systems for Society 5.0. Healthcare systems in Society 5.0 envision an abstract paradigm that provides beyond health monitoring services to all the citizens of the society. These services include healthcare medical supply chain, clinical trial, and hospital management. To provide these services, the existing healthcare systems upload their important information, such as users’ health parameters, medicinal details, and clinical trial information into the cloud using PBCN (Ioppolo et al., 2020). Additionally, PBCN provides end-to-end security in uploading of such healthcare information in healthcare systems by decentralizing and distributing the information validation among multiple end-user devices. The existing PBCN-based healthcare systems enable its users to validate information before the transaction of healthcare information. Enabling such a facility in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0 increases the validation latency of PBCN in healthcare systems, considering the presence of a huge number of citizens in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the existing PBCN-based healthcare systems are unable to detect malicious end-users, which may degrade the efficiency of the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. We introduce B2H to address the issues of increasing validation latency and detecting malicious end-users in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. The architecture of B2H utilizes the features of PBCN. B2H introduce a layer of validation service providers (VSPs) in a PBCN that collects information from the end-user, distributes it among multiple validation devices. VSP in B2H reduces the validation time by distributing the information among a specific set of validation devices (VDs). B2H also allows the end-user to optimally select a VSP and a VSP to select a set of validation devices optimally. Through extensive experiments, we observe that B2H performs better than the existing schemes by reducing 94%–95% average network delay, 88%–94% average energy consumption, and 94%–96% average cost.}

	abstract = {Locating the nodes of outdoor wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using (tri)lateration with a low-cost ranging technique, such as the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), often results in inaccurate location estimates. This can mostly be explained by the combined effect of distance estimate errors and localization geometry, both of which are subject to the reference nodes used. To develop techniques for reducing localization error, the distance estimate errors and localization geometry must be analyzed and taken into account. To address these challenges, this paper aims to seek ways to improve the quality of range-based trilateration localization for WSN nodes in varying outdoor conditions. Based on simulations, we analyze the effects of ranging error and localization geometry on localization error. For that purpose, we introduce a simple measure to evaluate the geometry of reference triangle (GRT). To improve localization accuracy and precision, we propose an adaptive range-based localization (ARBL) algorithm that is based on trilateration and reference node selection. In ARBL, the GRT values are calculated for each 3-combination of a preselected reference node set, based on which the combinations are selected. The algorithm exploits these reference node 3-combinations aiming to find the best ones at a given time using a selection criteria that is based on ranging error and localization geometry. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces localization error considerably. This shows that it is possible to achieve sufficient localization accuracy using range-based trilateration localization, even based on the RSSI in challenging outdoor conditions, by employing applicable techniques and information.}

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are important threats to network services and applications. Studies in literature have proposed various approaches including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) based on the application of machine learning and deep learning, but their computational cost can be significant. For this reason, other studies have proposed efficient IDS algorithms based on the online real-time analysis of the network traffic with a sliding window and entropy or other statistical measures. This paper proposes an online algorithm based on a sliding window with the novel application of the Morphological Fractal Dimension (MFD) to this problem. The results presented in this study show that the application of MFD to the recent CICIDS2017 public data set can obtain a significant improvement in the detection of the DDoS attack in comparison to entropy based approaches. In addition, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for the automatic definition of the sliding window size. This paper reports the impact of the different hyper-parameters, including the parameters present in the definition of MFD and the evaluation of the distance measures, where the Chebyschev distance provides the optimal detection accuracy. The results show a detection accuracy of 99.30%, which performs better than similar approaches on the same data set.}

	abstract = {The maximum network lifetime problem (MLP) in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks under connectivity and coverage constraints is addressed in this paper. Two main variants of the studied problem are considered. The first variant is\nα\n-coverage where a portion ((1 -\nα\n) percent) of the targets are allowed to be left uncovered. The second one is called\nβ\n-coverage or\nβ\n-constraint where each target has a minimum coverage rate\nβ\nduring the network’s lifetime service. When the two variants are considered at the same time, the problem is called\nα\nβ\n−\nConnected Maximum Lifetime Problem (\nα\nβ\n−\nCMLP) where we consider both global (whole targets) resp. local (individual target) monitoring level thresholds to improve the coverage quality of the deployed WSN. Unlike earlier works devoted to only\nα\ncoverage, we deal with both local (\nα\n) and global (\nβ\n) coverage leveling thresholds under network connectivity constraint. One approach to optimize the network’s lifetime is to divide the sensor nodes into Non-Disjoint subsets of sensors, or cover sets, and to schedule these covers with variable activation time periods, so that the global time lifespan of the network is optimized. To this end, we provide both exact and heuristic approaches in this study. First, a novel mathematical Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is presented to solve the\nα\nβ\n-coverage with network connectivity requirement to optimality. Unfortunately, due to the NP-Completeness of the addressed problem, the MILP’s resolution becomes impracticable for large optimization problems. To remedy this and to cope with large instances, we propose a new exact approach based on column generation able to achieve optimal solutions in reasonable time. In addition, since the CG’s subproblem resolution is also an NP-Hard problem, a new dedicated Heuristic (DH) is designed to solve the CG’s subproblem in polynomial time complexity. Moreover, we propose an exact ILP formulation for the CG’s subproblem if the DH heuristic fails to compute an attractive solution in each iteration of the CG computation process. Finally, several experiments are performed to evaluate the performances of our proposals.}

Recent experiments have demonstrated near-perfect self-interference suppression techniques in the PHY layer to aid the possibility of FD communication. This paper presents a Synchronized Mode Full-Duplex (SM-FD) wireless LAN MAC protocol with appropriate modification of the IEEE 802.11 standard. The proposed SM-FD MAC protocol maintains synchronization between nodes and Access Point (AP) to increase efficiency. SM-FD MAC protocol supports WLAN having both FD and HD capable nodes by establishing both symmetrical links (Node1\n↔\nAP) and asymmetrical links (Node1\n→\nAP\n→\nNode2). To this end, we have utilized the packet-alignment-based capture effect in an efficient way. The proposed SM-FD MAC protocol has been analyzed using a Markov chain model. The analytical results for RTS and data collision probability, saturated throughput, delay, and energy spent per packet transmission have been derived and validated against simulation.}

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of mobile devices, more and more time sensitive tasks are emerging. This kind of task often has strict requirements on delay. Edge computing solves this problem to a great extent. However, the computing resources of the edge server are limited. When the number of tasks is too large, some tasks may not be completed within the specified time. In this paper, we aim to maximize the task completion rate. We propose a priority task scheduling scheme based on coherent beamforming(CB) technique and successive interference cancellation(SIC) technique. CB technique enables edge devices to transmit to distant edge servers, and SIC technique ensures that multiple tasks can be received simultaneously by edge servers. We first build the system model, and show that the model is a NP-hard problem. For solving the problem, in our algorithm, we first determine the transmission tasks in each time slot, and select a suitable server for each task. After tasks arrive at servers, we insert them into task queues according to their priorities. In simulations, we compare our schemes with other four schemes. Simulation results show that our scheme can improve the task completion rate and reduce completion delay.}

	abstract = {Data Center Network (DCN) plays a crucial role in orchestrating the physical or virtual resources in data centers to meet the requirements of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. The energy efficiency should be seriously considered for DCNs with large-scale switch devices which support numerous realtime network flow demands, especially for enormous flow demands from IoT devices. Typically, the network energy conservation can be achieved by optimizing routing and flow scheduling with energy awareness, targeting at powering off as many idle and low-loaded network devices as possible. For energy efficiency objective, in this paper we address a combinatorial optimization problem, named Multi-Commodity Flow (MCF) problem which optimizes the bandwidth allocation and routing to reduce the energy consumption. We propose a framework which has the lookahead ability of predicting flow demands in DCNs to dynamically feed the MCF problem as inputs. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is exploited for flow demand prediction in DCNs and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is tailored for solving the MCF problem. In experiments, we evaluate the predicted flow demands which simulate real flow demands and conduct a comparison between our DRL scheme with the baseline and optimizer to show the advantage of the DRL solution in optimality and efficiency.}

	abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D)-aided fog network has proven to be a viable means to improve the performance of fog computing technology. To exploit the full potentials of the D2D-supported fog computing architecture, it is imperative to protect the information transmitted among collaborating fog nodes against unauthorized access as failure to do so may have catastrophic consequences. However, this critical issue has not been investigated in most of the existing works. Therefore, this paper proposes a secure and privacy-aware trust-based communication strategy for fog-to-fog collaborative services. An elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based two-party authentication and key agreement protocol is designed to allow two collaborating fog nodes generate a unique shared secret session key. A multi-colony head selection strategy is proposed using a multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM), where multiple fog nodes are selected as colony head. A new efficient group key distribution and updating mechanism is designed for ensuring secured group communication. Consequently, ECC-based message dissemination approaches are designed for intra- and inter-colony trustworthy communications, where the generated secret session and group keys are used for data encryption. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees data confidentiality and unforgeability against both Type I and Type II adversaries in the random oracle model (ROM) based on the intractability of the Computational Diffie–Hellman Problem (CDHP) and Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), respectively. An extensive performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is very efficient and suitable for practical deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme reports an improvement of about 33.15%–93.88%, 18.87%–67.91% , and 38.5%–93.8% in computation cost, communication overhead, and energy consumption, respectively, over the state-of-the-art related schemes.}

To demonstrate the potentials of this framework, in this work we focus on D2D Transmission Mode Selection in 5G.

To set a benchmark and allow for a fairer comparison we also enhance the Distributed Sum Rate (DSR), a distributed algorithmic approach that focuses on maximising the aggregated data rate of all the links established in the network, with similar functionality as DAIS. Furthermore, an extensive comparative evaluation of the enhanced DAIS and DSR with a number of unsupervised ML clustering approaches adapted for D2D Communication(i.e., GMEANS, Fuzzy ART, MEC, and DBSCAN) is provided. Specifically, for each approach the following have been collected and compared: QoE and QoS Fairness, SE and PC achieved, efficiency of clusters created, signalling overhead caused (i.e., volume of messages exchanged), time execution delay, D2D Effectiveness, D2D Stability and D2D Productivity. Based on the insight gained into the performance of the enhanced DAIS, DSR and the unsupervised ML techniques, we discuss performance gain trade-offs in terms of SE and PC versus signalling overhead and control delay in responding to changes.}

	abstract = {Serverless computing is an emerging proposition in the cloud offering landscape that promotes a higher level of abstraction, further decoupling software operations from the underlying hardware. Often recognized as an economically driven computational approach, the serverless model relies on the execution of short-lived stateless functions, enabling a fine-grained accounting and control of resources. In this context, function composition represents an appealing feature, allowing the composition of two or more functions to create tailored processing pipelines, incentivizing modularity and reusability of functions, while paving the way to application-specific run-time optimizations. This work presents DIFFUSE: a DIstributed and decentralized platForm enabling Function composition in Serverless Environments. DIFFUSE embodies an innovative infrastructural support, enabling the efficient and transparent composition of functions by relying on pluggable middleware support, serving as a conveyor of messages among the platform components. Broadening the deployment spectrum of our proposal, we assess different middleware solutions, each presenting distinct delivery profiles, evidencing the tradeoffs that emerge.}
