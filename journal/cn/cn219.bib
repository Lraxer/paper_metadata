	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technology for next-generation AI systems that allows a number of workers, i.e., edge devices, collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping their data locally to prevent privacy leakage. Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks can democratize AI and make it accessible in a cost-effective manner. However, the noisy bandwidth-limited multi-hop wireless connections can lead to delayed and nomadic model updates, which significantly slows down the FL convergence speed. To address such challenges, this paper aims to accelerate FL convergence over wireless edge by optimizing the multi-hop federated networking performance. In particular, the FL convergence optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). To solve such MDP, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MA-RL) algorithms along with domain-specific action space refining schemes are developed, which online learn the delay-minimum forwarding paths to minimize the model exchange latency between the edge devices (i.e., workers) and the remote server. To validate the proposed solutions, EdgeML is developed and implemented, which is the first experimental framework in the literature for FL over multi-hop wireless edge computing networks. EdgeML allows us to fast prototype, deploy, and evaluate novel FL algorithms along with RL-based system optimization methods in real wireless devices. Moreover, a physical experimental testbed is implemented by customizing the widely adopted Linux wireless routers and ML computing nodes. Such testbed can provide valuable insights into the practical performance of FL in the field. Finally, our experimentation results on the testbed show that the proposed network-accelerated FL system can practically and significantly improve FL convergence speed, compared to the FL system empowered by the production-grade commercially-available wireless networking protocol, BATMAN-Adv.}

	abstract = {Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today’s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.}

Therefore, it is critical for the controller to present features that improve the overall network performance while ensuring continuity of service despite failures. OpenDayLight (ODL) and Open Network Operating System (ONOS) are two important open-source distributed controllers. The objective of this study is to evaluate how ODL and ONOS deal with different failure scenarios in both their data and control planes. In the data plane, the evaluation analyzes both link and switch failures and recovers, different flows in reactive and proactive modes. In the distributed control plane throughput and latency are considered when the number of switches and controllers increase, the time to synchronize the network operations among the controllers, the time for a master to recover from failure, and whether network operations are reinstalled after the failure of a master controller. Our evaluation shows that ONOS achieves better results than ODL in the data plane, and ODL surpasses ONOS in the experiments performed in the control plane.}

	abstract = {Wireless access networks are ever-changing their setup, topologies and provisions of coverage. Forthcoming deployment trends include densification of cells and convergence of the ‘native IP’ with cellular access networks with more than best-effort expectations. Greater meshing in networks due to practical deployment requirements is inevitable and needed. This paper proposes a routing protocol to address the “randomness” of topology interconnections, routing paths and sizes in emerging IP access networks. Termed as Minimum Set Cover (MSC) approach, it is a generalization of the NP and NP complete mathematical problem. The offline component of the MSC multiplies intra-domain routing installations, called Routing Planes (RPs) modelled as graphs, to suitably cover the whole routing topology prior to the traffic injections in the online component. We introduce novel offline optimization features using a dynamic cost function that plans availability of capacities and correlation of routing paths via the chosen set of RPs. Our simulations verify effective path diversity using MSC with its modest protocol overhead and a heuristic used for RPs selection. For randomly constructed access network topologies with 7, 18 and 33 routers and various meshing levels, our results show convincing suitability and key performances gains compared with rival routing solutions.}

	abstract = {Asynchronous or partially synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols can tolerate up to one-third Byzantine faults, while synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols can tolerate up to one-half Byzantine faults. The existing synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols are leader-based protocols, which may lead to unbalanced load between nodes, and constitute a bottleneck that influences the performance of the whole system. In addition, the synchronous BFT protocols rely on a strong assumption: every message sent by an honest node will arrive at its destination within a known bounded time. In this work, in order to obtain better fairness and allow some degree of asynchrony while tolerating one-half faults, we designed LWSBFT, a leaderless BFT protocol in a weakly synchronous model where the synchronous assumption does not have to hold for all nodes all the time. The leaderless BFT protocol is comprised of the weakly synchronous Byzantine reliable broadcast (RBC) protocol and the weakly synchronous binary Byzantine agreement (BA) protocol, both of which can tolerate one-half faults. The weakly synchronous RBC protocol is used by each node to propose its input, and the weakly synchronous binary BA protocol is used to make a decision for each proposed value. The proposed leaderless BFT protocol can ensure both safety and liveness in a weakly synchronous model. We implement our consensus mechanism in Go, and evaluate the proposed consensus mechanism’s performance in terms of throughput and latency.}

Its three key elements – the cubic splinelet based adaptive search space, the objective function (combining two measures of approximation errors), and the two-phase search space reduction technique (combining segment length based pruning and surrogate based pruning) – are presented in detail. The output quality is measured in terms of the signal approximation accuracy and the corresponding compression ratio. The numerical results show that the new algorithm outperforms both reference algorithms for all test streams, in some cases—significantly (up to 32% smaller approximation errors and up to 41% higher compression ratios). Due to the effective search space auto-adaptation and special pruning techniques, in typical cases, this is obtained with significantly lower computational cost. The proposed algorithm can be applied to various domains including online compression and smoothing of streaming data coming from IoT devices, sensor networks, and sensors located in autonomous vehicles (cars, drones) and robots. The possible application areas also include real-time IoT analytics and embedded time-series databases.}

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising networking paradigm that brings central management and network programmability to improve existing networking systems. However, SDN has several security threats due to its untrusted control and data planes. Blockchain (BC) technology has recently provided a fault-tolerant, decentralized, and immutable ledger among untrusted parties. While the integration between SDN and BC enhances the security, it suffers from performance degradation when applied to SDN’s data plane. In traditional BC-SDN approaches, such as our previous work DPSEC (Latah and Kalkan, 2020), every switch has to wait for the final commitment of each submitted transaction, which significantly decreases the performance of the BC-SDN model. In this work, we enhance the performance of BC-SDN data plane approaches by separating switch-related and host-related transactions and propose a different waiting strategy for each type of data plane transaction. We also propose a batching technique to enhance the average latency for high-load scenarios. In addition, SDN switches and controllers utilize lattice-based signatures and Key Encapsulation Methods (KEMs) to protect against quantum adversaries. We compare the performance of CWT-DPA with existing solutions such as SSL/TLSv1.3, DPSEC (Latah and Kalkan, 2020), and AuthFlow (Mattos and Duarte, 2016).}

	abstract = {Tracking back stealthy attackers is still a great challenge in face of complicated Internet environments and increased attacker capabilities. As a possible solution, network flow watermarking has been developed to embed attack labels actively in data flows, trying to identify the attack source accurately in time. However, due to the influences of uncertain network noises, the robustness of watermarking cannot be ensured efficiently in case of non-cooperative network scenarios currently. Meanwhile, it is difficult to enhance robustness and covertness simultaneously when suffering from severe network noises. Thus, a robust network flow watermarking based on Heterogeneous Time Channels (HeteroTiC) is proposed, for which packet order, packet timing and packet size constitute heterogeneous time channels to carry watermarks. The beginning positions are located by packet order to support accurate synchronization, the long watermark sequences are carried by inter-packet delays to improve capabilities against packet dropping and time jitter, the mapping relationships for the watermark sequences on heterogeneous time channels are mixed by packet size of the flow itself to enhance covertness. With multiple layers design of watermarking, HeteroTiC is designed to accomplish fast detection and accurate extraction on watermarks. By experiments, the average detection accuracy reaches 100% and the average extraction accuracy is validated with 94.2%. Furthermore, the same mapping pattern on multiple flows only accounts for 8.11%, which validates the covertness against multiple flow similarities. The extraction accuracy exceeds\n9\n.\n76\n%\n∼\n18\n.\n1\n%\nin comparison with classical watermarking methods, which validates the robustness under network noises in Internet.}

	abstract = {As the number of subscribers in wireless communication systems grows rapidly, it has become important to design efficient medium access control (MAC) protocols to realize resources sharing among multiple users. When designing a MAC, effective management of co-channel interference (CCI) among multiple concurrent transmissions is critical to enhancing system’s spectral efficiency (SE). Although MACs based on existing signal processing can suppress/mitigate CCI among multiple concurrent transmissions, they either consume communication resources or attenuate the desired signals’ transmission, hence incurring loss of transmission performance. To remedy this deficiency, we propose a Framed Fidelity MAC (F\n2\nMAC) to losslessly pack multi-user data transmissions into a virtual point-to-point (p2p) framework. Under F\n2\nMAC, the common receiver (Rx) selects a virtual framed-channel (a.k.a. framework) and broadcasts it to all mobile terminals. The latter calculate their precoding vectors based on the received virtual framework and their respective communication channels with respect to (w.r.t.) the Rx. Then, the pre-processed signals of multiple users are sent to the Rx via different eigenmodes of the framed-channel. By applying a receive filter to the received mixed signal, Rx can recover users’ desired data without interference. Since F\n2\nMAC can decouple the channel quality information (CQI) from channel direction information (CDI) related to the user’s signal transmission, — i.e., CQI is exclusively determined by the user’s communication channel while CDI depends on the unified framework, it can avoid the transmission performance loss incurred by existing signal processing based MAC which adjusts both CQI and CDI simultaneously. Moreover, we propose a Flexible Framed Fidelity MAC (F\n3\nMAC) to further improve the system’s SE. By dynamically re-constructing the virtual framed-channel at each mobile user, the user’s transmission can be realized with the principal eigenmode’s gain of his/her communication channel. Our in-depth analysis and simulation results have shown the proposed MAC methods to significantly improve the SE of multi-user communication systems.}

However, the uplink OFDMA-based random access (UORA) mechanism provides poor quality of service (QoS), and restricts channel utilization efficiency, especially in the dynamic network environment. To solve these issues, in this study, the transmission period is decoupled into a contention stage and a transmission stage, and an intelligent media access control (MAC) algorithm with QoS-guaranteed for next-generation wireless local area networks (WLANs) is presented. Specifically, we consider stochastic and various traffic in time-varying wireless communication conditions and propose two contention window (CW) optimization mechanisms based on Q-learning (QL) and a deep Q-network (DQN) (referred to as QL-MAC and DQN-MAC) for static and dynamic network scenarios, respectively. Meanwhile, the access point (AP) acts as the reinforcement learning (RL) agent and centrally optimizes the CW for all stations to eventually maximize the system throughput. Furthermore, we provide the QoS-guaranteed channel access mechanism for different priority data traffic, in which high-priority traffic can obtain more channel access opportunities in the uplink contention stage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the network performance in terms of convergence, throughput, delay, and fairness compared to the adaptive grouping-based two-stage mechanism (BTM) and double random access QoS-oriented OFDMA MAC (DRA-OFDMA) algorithm in various scenarios.}

	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of many small, low cost and less computational power sensor nodes. These nodes are uniformly or randomly deployed for gathering vital information from the environment. It is crucial to identify the exact and accurate position of the sensor node as it helps in efficient communication between unknown and known (beacon) nodes. Localization has many applications, such as rescue, traffic controlling and monitoring, underwater cultivation, surveillance, and target tracking. It is also used in day-to-day life in the form of GPS to guide people in their travel. Hence, to avail of the accurate service from localization, the exact position of the sensor is needed. In this work, an ensemble approach is proposed using both DV-Hop and a weighted amorphous algorithm to enhance localization accuracy. Two distance measurements are calculated to obtain the distance from an unknown node to the beacon node by considering hop value and size. Finally, the probabilistic distance estimation is applied to the obtained distances to get the actual distance. Proposed approach is compared with the traditional amorphous and three other improved amorphous algorithms and provides higher accuracy in terms of MAE, MSE, and RMSE.}

	abstract = {The advance of mobile network technologies and components heavily relies on data-driven techniques. This is especially true for fifth generation (5G) and the upcoming sixth generation (6G) networks, as the optimization of network components and protocols is expected to be fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions. When using real-world radio access measurement traces, the identity of individual users is not directly accessible because at runtime operation Base Stations (BSs) assign Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTIs) to users. RNTIs are not bound to a user but are reused upon expiration of an inactivity timer, whose duration is operator dependent. This implies that, over time, multiple users are mapped to the same RNTI. In fact, the allocation of RNTIs to users is implemented in diverse and proprietary ways by operators and equipment vendors. Distinguishing individual users within the RNTI space is a non-trivial task and key to analyze traffic traces properly. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) we propose and validate two complementary methodologies to identify the RNTI inactivity threshold, and we characterize (ii) the RNTI allocation process of network operators, and (iii) the user traffic patterns given the specific RNTI allocation process. Our study is based on a large dataset we collected from production BSs of several mobile network operators across five different countries. We find that there exist heterogeneous strategies for RNTI allocation that BSs dynamically use depending on the traffic load and daytime. We further observe that the RNTI expiration threshold is in the order of minutes, and demonstrate how using thresholds around 10 s, as in the vast majority of the literature, can bias subsequent analyses.

	abstract = {The growing popularity of online social networks (OSNs) in recent years has generated a lot of concern on personal privacy. One approach of protecting privacy in OSNs is to intervene in the flow of privacy information, making the study of the dynamics of privacy information propagation necessary for the design of effective privacy protection mechanisms. Although previous work on information propagation has produced some models, these models are not adequate for privacy information since they do not reflect the main characteristics of privacy information. In this paper, we propose a model for privacy information propagation. We first analyze the structural characteristics of privacy information and then design the model by incorporating these characteristics. A unique feature of the model is that it infers the privacy attitudes of the information recipients to the privacy concerning subject implicated in the privacy information to determine the forwarding decisions of the recipients. Thus, by mapping the heterogeneous tendency of information forwarding by the recipients to a limited number of privacy attitudes, the model can predict the decisions on forwarding privacy information and thus describe the macroscopic process of privacy information propagation. Results of the experiment based on real OSN datasets show that the proposed model can be used to learn both the scope and the trend of privacy information propagation in OSNs, demonstrating the importance of the privacy attitudes of recipients on privacy information propagation. The properties of the model are also studied through experiment to examine the impact of various factors on privacy information propagation in OSNs.}

	abstract = {Edge computing has become popular in the last decade and will advance in future to support real-time actionable analytics at the devices. One of the fundamental problems for future edge computing is to make distributed resource scheduling (DRS) decisions both at the end devices and edge devices to support requirements including autonomous computation, scalability, low-latency, etc. Several surveys in the literature on edge computing have considered some aspects related to DRS, such as challenges and solution approaches, particularly for computation offloading and data management. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey on DRS in edge computing. This paper surveys the challenging issues, motivations, and existing works for enabling DRS in edge computing. We define and identify the unique issues for DRS in edge computing compared to traditional works on parallel and distributed systems. The motivations for DRS in edge computing have been described by pointing out the benefits and emerging application scenarios. This paper also provides a taxonomy to classify the existing works from three perspectives, i.e., systems, problems, and solution approaches. Finally, we have outlined several future directions that can help researchers to advance the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {Dual Connectivity (DC) is an important lower-layer feature accelerating the transition from 4G to 5G that also is expected to play an important role in standalone 5G radio networks. However, even though the packet reordering introduced by DC can significantly impact the performance of upper-layer protocols, no prior work has studied the impact of DC on QUIC. In this paper, we present the first such performance study. Using a series of throughput and fairness experiments, we show how QUIC is affected by different DC parameters, network conditions, and whether the DC implementation aims to improve throughput or reliability. Results for two QUIC implementations (aioquic, ngtcp2) and two congestion control algorithms (NewReno, CUBIC) are presented under both static and highly time-varying network conditions Our findings provide network operators with insights and understanding into the impacts of splitting QUIC traffic in a DC environment. With reasonably selected DC parameters and increased UDP receive buffers, QUIC over DC performs similarly to TCP over DC and achieves optimal fairness under symmetric link conditions when DC is not used for packet duplication. The insights can help network operators provide modern users with better end-to-end service when deploying DC.}

In this work, we leverage ML algorithms to judiciously orchestrate the placement of delay-constrained computing tasks in a softwarized edge domain. A set of popular supervised learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree (DT), Bagged Trees (BTs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), have been leveraged to this purpose. They are trained off-line through the results of an optimization problem targeting the minimization of the edge network resource usage while respecting the tasks’ delay constraints. Extensive simulation results are reported to showcase the performance of the considered techniques in terms of model accuracy, complexity and network-related metrics, e.g., amount of exchanged data in the edge domain. Among the compared techniques, DT and MLP are shown to be the most efficient solutions in terms of algorithm execution time, by achieving almost the same performance.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Internet usage has become prevalent, primarily because of high-quality heterogeneous multimedia content expectations from the subscriber (consumer), which puts tremendous pressure on the publisher (producer) in the networks. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a future internet architecture that optimizes data resources through content-based forwarding and caching, making it well-suited for multimedia content and video streaming (VS) scenarios. However, real-time data delivery is challenging in the current ICN-based publish–subscribe (pub-sub) mechanism, which pushes the existing pub-sub studies to prioritize more on the forwarding information base (FIB) rather than the pending interest table (PIT). This leads to issues such as inefficient caching and forwarding mechanisms, high overhead, and communication costs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel forwarding and caching solution named VS-ICSDN, integrating the combined principles of ICN-based pub-sub scheme and software-defined networking (SDN) in order to utilize the network resources more efficiently. We design a clean-slate caching strategy and name-based forwarding method to support both on-path and off-path caching on ICN nodes to coordinate flow entries among the SDN controller and clean-slate ICN nodes to maximize PIT utilization. In addition, the framework allows the content to be stored and searched in chunks with a single request to access the desired content, reducing the communication overhead and significantly improving overall performance. A simulation-based testbed and experimental result analysis validate our proposed work’s effectiveness in ensuring efficient network resource usage with low communication overhead and computational cost compared to other baseline methods.}

	abstract = {Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new paradigm to digital identity management that is built on decentralized technologies and can exist without centralized third-parties for managing the identity data. Within the SSI model, a digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a secure and trusted manner. At present, the existing SSI solutions rely on the Internet connection for carrying out the necessary operations such as messaging and credential verification. However, there are many places the Internet may not be accessible and other means for communication is needed. The objective of this paper is to design a proof-of-concept that would allow for secure, trustworthy, and decentralized peer-to-peer communication without the need for any external networking infrastructure. For this, we investigate a particular case involving DIDComm and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We identify requirements for the architecture and propose an architectural framework that allows two entities to securely communicate and exchange verifiable credentials. Furthermore, we look at a specific use case, namely, how offline access control can be enabled within SSI between two mobile devices. We present and evaluate the implementation of offline access control system based on the proposed architecture. Through this research, and experimentation we can conclude that this approach has the potential to enable a wide range of interesting use cases and can be integrated into existing digital identity wallet solutions to extend the capabilities of offline messaging in a secure and decentralized manner that goes beyond the current models that rely on the Internet connectivity.}

Motivated by SRRS (social reinforcement rumor spreading), we propose a blockchain fast propagation protocol named SRRS protocol based on a non-Markovian process, where the verification and transmission of a block depend on its propagation history. The simulated experimental results show that our protocol can significantly accelerate the propagation of blocks. Compared with existing major solutions, our protocol does not change the main procedure of Bitcoin and the block data structure, which is a huge advantage for practical applications. Moreover, employing the theories of complex networks and percolation, we develop a method of theoretical analysis, which can find the optimal setting of our protocol.}

This move is problematic for various reasons, such as the networks’ size and the providers’ inability to control users’ activity. Additionally, research into these networks is handicapped by the lack of information stemming from the confidentiality of these complex networks. To that end, we have created SDNSandbox — an SDN-based provider network simulator prototype. SDNSandbox is an open-source, easy-to-use, provider-network in-a-laptop simulator. It aims to facilitate the creation of reproducible experiments and large-scale synthetic datasets. In its current prototype form, it uses a basic traffic generator module alongside real-world provider topologies. SDNSandbox allows users to simulate provider networks, enabling them to conduct research in the field and examine practical applications. To demonstrate SDNSandbox, we use the prototype to simulate basic traffic conditions over several topologies. We then feed the generated datasets to DCRNN, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) traffic patterns prediction module. We adapt DCRNN to accept SDNSandbox output and show that it can predict traffic conditions at various points within the network tens of seconds into the future. We further compare its performance with other baseline algorithms. Our results demonstrate that SDNSandbox can also be used as a testbed for a digital twin, creating datasets that are hard to replicate in production networks. It also serves as a demonstration of the framework’s power and versatility as a modular research tool.}

The goal of this paper is to propose a two-layer Hierarchical Horizontal-Offload ManagEment (H-HOME) framework for horizontal offload among the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) of the same FANET, in order to minimize processing delay and jitter. The framework exploits Federated Reinforcement Learning in order to take advantage of knowledge sharing without incurring into problems of privacy and network overloading. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is also defined to optimize decisions of the FANET Orchestrator (FO). Simulation results, obtained from two different analyses, demonstrate that H-HOME outperforms the traditional local training approach, based on simple recursive learning, and it can be effectively used to reduce power consumption and increase FANETs flight autonomy.}

IoT device identification in open environments is the key to its application in real environments, where IoT and non-IoT device identification is the first and critical step.

This paper presents EvoIoT, an IoT and non-IoT identification model designed to apply in open environments with high scalability and the ability to run sustainably and effectively. EvoIoT achieves high scalability by applying a unified model for all devices. To mine discriminative features from encrypted traffic, EvoIoT extracts original features from packet headers and judges feature importance in the entire model update process. For sustainability, EvoIoT proposes a representative device choosing method and model update method to address the concept drift caused by new types of devices. EvoIoT is the first high-performance model that systematically addresses the IoT and non-IoT device classification problem. We evaluate EvoIoT on two public datasets and a private dataset collected from a laboratory setting.

The deployment of SCs including placement of VNF instances and virtual links connecting these functions, onto the substrate physical network is a critical issue which significantly affects the performance of the offered network services. Due to the unpredictable traffic and network state variations, as well as diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements, an online SCs deployment approach is needed to cope with different service requests and real-time network traffics. In this paper, we employ edge intelligence using a distributed deep reinforcement learning approach to deploy SCs in order to jointly balance the load on the physical nodes and links in the edge environments. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of minimizing the drop rate of the incoming service chain requests. In addition, the proposed approach is able to rapidly deploy service flows even in the large real-world network typologies.}

	abstract = {The recent evolution of the traditional cloud computing vision towards the so-called edge computing has stimulated the emergence of new network paradigms, such as drone-assisted mobile networks. Here, drones acting as mobile edge servers provide storage and processing services so as to offload data and support ubiquitous connectivity. In such a scenario, inter-user interference represents a critical feature, as it can heavily hinder the network performance, due to the massive user densification of modern 5G-and-beyond networks. This work deals with the interference problem and the resulting network dynamics under a theoretical perspective by presenting a fully-distributed game-theoretical framework. More in detail, the interactions between users and servers are modeled as a marketplace scenario, where servers (i.e., drones), behaving as sellers, offer network functions, while users buy the offered services and, accordingly, interact with servers. The mathematical characterization of the marketplace interactions is achieved by employing a two-stage Stackelberg game in which a unique equilibrium and convergence point can be identified. Moreover, we show that the use of a reinforcement learning algorithm allows to achieve this equilibrium in a practical setting. Our numerical evaluation investigates the dynamics of multiple 5G use cases (namely eMBB, URLLC and a hybrid tradeoff case), each characterized by heterogeneous requirements and diverse KPIs which lead to very dissimilar behavior in terms of requested bandwidth and user distribution at the equilibrium. The results show how our game theoretical framework achieves a reduction of up to 60% in the network interference in a fully-distributed fashion, where each actor in the network can act in an autonomous and independent way to reach the convergence point.}

	abstract = {Designing 5G networks and related applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cellular and autonomous vehicular networks (AVNET) is a challenge. Indeed, these networks are subjected to a number of constraints that play a crucial role in the network’s quality of service (QoS). Among these constraints, we have the management of computing, storage, bandwidth resources and low latency requirements. If in the past cloud computing has been used to avoid networks being affected by some of the previous constraints, that technology negatively affects the low latency requirements required by AVNETs for example. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a palliative solution to cloud computing. MEC aims to bring computing and storage resources from Cloud Data Center to Edge Data Center nearer to the User Equipment (UEs) in order to reduce the UEs’ requests latency for an improvement of the network’s QoS. Many MEC architectures have been proposed for AVNET. These solutions make use of Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Service Function Chaining (SFC) or Network Slicing (NS) technologies. Some of these techniques combine partially these technologies while others do not. But to the best of our knowledge, none of them combines all these technologies to obtain a better QoS. In this paper, we combine the SDN, NFV, SFC and NS technologies to efficiently manage the MEC server resources for guaranteeing the QoS requirements in AVNETs. The QoS parameters we consider are latency, computing, storage and bandwidth resources. In that way, we first present a MEC server mathematical resource management model, then, we propose a new MEC architecture adapted to AVNETs that uses the aforementioned technologies also as the mathematical model we first present to manage the bandwidth, computing, and storage resources. The simulation results show that these resources are well managed, resulting to a low end to end latency for autonomous vehicles (AVs) requests executing on edge/cloud servers when the direct communication of AVs with cloud server takes long end to end delays, ensuring a better QoS for the AVNET.}

Along with the spectrum crunch and throughput challenges, such a massive scale of wireless devices exposes unprecedented threat surfaces. RF fingerprinting is heralded as a candidate technology that can be combined with cryptographic and zero-trust security measures to ensure data privacy, confidentiality, and integrity in wireless networks. Motivated by the relevance of this subject in the future communication networks, in this work, we present a comprehensive survey of RF fingerprinting approaches ranging from a traditional view to the most recent deep learning (DL)-based algorithms. Existing surveys have mostly focused on a constrained presentation of the wireless fingerprinting approaches, however, many aspects remain untold. In this work, however, we mitigate this by addressing every aspect – background on signal intelligence (SIGINT), applications, relevant DL algorithms, systematic literature review of RF fingerprinting techniques spanning the past two decades, discussion on datasets, and potential research avenues – necessary to elucidate this topic to the reader in an encyclopedic manner.}

In IBN systems, conflict detection and policy resolution modules are crucial to intent activation to enforce correct network configurations. To this end, in this study, we propose an extensible intent model, complemented with a conflict detection algorithm. We also propose a policy resolution algorithm that is based on a two-dimensional analysis of intent endpoints and time spans. To better showcase the efficiency of our algorithm, we also developed an enterprise-based IBN intent management web application for network users and administrators.

	abstract = {With the goal of making the networks more agile, flexible and cost efficient, network function virtualization (NFV) is one of the latest and most promising technologies introduced. This technology is the key block of future internet and plays a critical role in modern networks. Using this paradigm, different network functions can be independently deployed on general purpose hardware instead of residing on dedicated hardware (network appliances in traditional networks). NFV enables faster development and lower costs. As any other new technology, NFV has some emerging challenges along with its benefits. The main research challenge of NFV is the necessity of optimally placing the virtual network functions (VNFs) in an NFV-enabled network. This problem is mainly known as the VNF placement (VNFP) problem in the literature. Due to the nature of network applications, this placement should be scalable for large network sizes. In this paper, the VNFP problem is addressed and a new metaheuristic algorithm is proposed based on the behavior of droplets on a surface, named the Drops on Surface Optimization (DSO) Algorithm. In order to enhance the proposed algorithm by dynamic selection strategy, a reinforcement learning approach (Q learning) is adopted. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out using standard networks, compared with several methods. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of total end-to-end propagation delay of the placed service chain, cost of placement, number of active servers involved in the placement and scalability.}

LEDBAT++ is a less-than-best-effort congestion control mechanism and BBR is model-based congestion control algorithm that aims to implement a best-effort traffic class. Naturally, the expectation is that LEDBAT++ yields in front of BBR. While we observe that this is the case in networks with moderate size buffer and when the base RTT is larger than 60 ms, we find that in other common conditions (base RTT smaller than 60 ms and moderate size network buffers), the interaction between LEDBAT++ and BBR is not as expected, as LEDBAT++ fails to yield in front of BBR. The observed behavior is different for the two existent versions of BBR. Specifically, LEDBAT++ competes in equal grounds against BBRv1, and BBRv2 yields in front of LEDBAT++. The BBRv2/LEDBAT++ interaction is exactly the opposite to the desired outcome. We present a number of experiments in diverse conditions that support our conclusions.}

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks can infer the specific websites from Tor encrypted traffic. However, most existing WF attacks require a large number of training samples (e.g., hundreds) per website to achieve the desirable accuracy. To lessen the training data scale, the low-data WF (LDWF) attacks are proposed. Whereas existing LDWF attacks generally require gathering an auxiliary dataset, which increases the bootstrap time to launch a WF attack. To address this limitation, we present the cross-domain LDWF attack problem and put forward the first cross-domain LDWF attack, namely WFBDC (WF with Brownian Distance Covariance), which can use a historical gathered dataset to be the auxiliary dataset. The primary advantage of WFBDC is the introduction of the BDC metric to measure the similarity between two samples. The key to BDC lies in that it defines the similarity by measuring the discrepancy between joint characteristic functions of embedded features and the product of the marginals. To mitigate the domain deviation, the transfer learning and multi-similarity loss techniques are also adopted. We conduct 10 experiments based on 15 datasets to evaluate the performance and efficiency of WFBDC. Evaluation results show that WFBDC can improve the performance of the state-of-the art LDWF attacks by up to 9% and 19% in the closed-world and open-world scenarios, respectively. Meanwhile, WFBDC can significantly reduce the pre-training time of existing LDWF attacks.}

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated superhuman capabilities in solving a significant number of tasks, leading to widespread industrial adoption. For in-field network-management application, AI-based solutions, however, have often risen skepticism among practitioners as their internal reasoning is not exposed and their decisions cannot be easily explained, preventing humans from trusting and even understanding them. To address this shortcoming, a new area in AI, called Explainable AI (XAI), is attracting the attention of both academic and industrial researchers. XAI is concerned with explaining and interpreting the internal reasoning and the outcome of AI-based models to achieve more trustable and practical deployment. In this work, we investigate the application of XAI for network management, focusing on the problem of automated failure-cause identification in microwave networks. We first introduce the concept of XAI, highlighting its advantages in the context of network management, and we discuss in detail the concept behind Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), the XAI framework considered in our analysis. Then, we propose a framework for a XAI-assisted ML-based automated failure-cause identification in microwave networks, spanning model’s development and deployment phases. For the development phase, we show how to exploit SHAP for feature selection and how to leverage SHAP to inspect misclassified instances during model’s development process, and how to describe model’s global behavior based on SHAP’s global explanations. For the deployment phase, we propose a framework based on predictions uncertainty to detect possibly wrong predictions that will be inspected through XAI.}
