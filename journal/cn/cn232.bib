	abstract = {The advent of visible light communication (VLC) towards\n5\nG and beyond (\n5\nGB) networks opened new doors to unveil the mysteries of unguided mediums such as ocean. The varying physicochemical properties of water introduces the underwater optical turbulence (UOT). The UOT of UVLC link is modelled as unified Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution fading under moderate-to-strong turbulence channel conditions as well as the misalignment of transceivers following exponential fading are included and studied. This study also contains the effect of UOT which is characterized by multiple water layers within the Monte Carlo simulation framework. The end-to-end (E2E) performances of a Single-Input and Multi-Output (SIMO) underwater VLC (UVLC) system is in consideration of Intensity-Modulation/Direct-Detection (IM/DD) technique which is obtained to fulfill the current communication requirements in hostile aqueous channels. More specifically, the probability distribution function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) are derived to obtain the E2E performance metrics of the SIMO-UVLC system in terms of Meijer-G function. Consequently, novel closed-form expressions for average bit-error-rate (ABER) and outage probability of the system are formulated. Finally, the numerical and simulation results are obtained based on the experimental data in mixed water layers of the oceanic environments, and analytically verified through the Monte Carlo simulation approach in harsh channel conditions.}

	abstract = {This study proposes mainly 2 different backscatter medium access control (MAC) protocols. Both proposed protocols work for half-duplex and full-duplex transmission modes in a bistatic backscatter system. The first one, namely express backscatter MAC (XBM), allows higher transmission rates in a bistatic backscatter network, aiming to increase network capacity. It takes advantage of carrier signals for faster transmissions whenever they are generated. The second protocol, reliable backscatter MAC (RBM), provides more reliability to the backscatter transmission, especially when hidden nodes exist. It brings more reliability by introducing a two-step CTS_to_Self mechanism to separate backscatter communication from Wi-Fi communication and avoid hidden node problem. In addition, our MAC protocols enable simultaneous backscatter transmissions at the MAC level by letting several tags carry their data on the same carrier signal. We evaluated and compared our proposals through numerical analyses that highlighted agreeable performance levels.}

	abstract = {Offloading tasks and data is an important use case for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that benefits a wide variety of mobile applications on different platforms, including autonomous vehicles and smartphones. A moving vehicle may pass through multiple Roadside Units (RSUs) and the MEC servers located within them as it travels. On-board applications generate structured tasks and can offload them to observable servers. However, since the mobile node cannot determine the information of the global server, choosing the best server becomes a key issue. In this paper, we address the problem of the offloading threshold in traditional Optimal Stopping Theory (OST) based decision models that cannot adapt to the environment. We use Deep Q-Network (DQN) to provide the model with the optimal offloading threshold for adaptive environments and propose a DQN-based Adaptive Threshold Multi-task Offloading approach (DQN-ATMOO). This method uses the principle of OST to solve the offloading order decision problem, divides structured tasks into sub-tasks, and executes offloading in sequence, with the goal of maximizing the probability of offloading to the best server and minimizing the total offloading delay. We experimentally compare and evaluate the proposed model using simulated and real datasets. The results show that the proposed model can be effectively implemented on mobile nodes and significantly reduces the total expected processing time.}

	abstract = {Ubiquitous artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the key services in 6G systems. AI services typically rely on deep neural network (DNN) requiring heavy computation. Hence, in order to support ubiquitous AI, it is crucial to provide a solution for offloading or distributing computational burden due to DNN, especially at end devices with limited resources. We develop an optimization framework for assigning the tasks of DNN layer computations to computing resources in the network, so as to reduce the inference latency. To this end, we propose a layered graph model with which simple conventional routing jointly solves the problem of selecting nodes for computation and paths for data transfer between nodes. We show that using our model, the existing approaches to splitting DNN layer computations can be equivalently reformulated as a routing problem that possesses better numerical properties. We also apply the proposed framework to derive algorithms for minimizing the end-to-end inference latency. We show through numerical evaluations that our new formulation can find a solution for DNN inference job distribution much faster than the existing formulation, and that our algorithms can select computing nodes and data paths adaptively to the computational attributes of given DNN inference jobs.}

	abstract = {The inevitable workload fluctuations in large-scale IoT applications make it difficult to ensure the QoS of data distribution services. Usually, this problem can be solved by dynamically adjusting resource supply. However, deploying more resources not only takes time, it is also difficult to achieve cost-effective results. In this paper, we propose an elastic event matching (EEM) framework and we explore the idea of endowing matching algorithms with adaptability in performance. The strategy is to enable seamless switching between exact matching and approximate matching, achieving a trade-off between matching precision and matching speed. First, we establish a predicate skipping adjustment (PSA) mechanism which quantifies the relationship between false positives and the number of skipped predicates. In addition, we design a performance adjustment decision (PAD) algorithm according to fluctuating workloads. We implemented an EEM prototype based an Kafka, which uses an existing matching algorithm enhanced by PSA as the engine. The prototype is evaluated through a series of experiments based on both synthetic data and real-world stock traces. Experiment results show that adjusting the performance of matching algorithm at the price of a small false positive rate of less than 0.1% can shorten event latency by up to 14.34 times, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the EEM framework.}

	abstract = {Dynamic time division duplexing (D-TDD) is widely used in 5G to support various services and short-latency communications, where uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) traffic may be highly asymmetric and fast-varying. In particular, D-TDD allows each cell to arrange subframes in terms of selecting link directions, which betters the utilization of spectrum resources based on instantaneous traffic demand. However, the inter-cell subframe misalignment, which is caused by different link directions on the same frequency band in neighboring cells, leads to notable cross-link interference (CLI). Especially, CLI has a negative impact on UL performance. Hence, this paper proposes a cluster-based radio frame coordination using codebooks (CRCC) framework to mitigate CLI efficiently. CRCC first clusters cells and formulates a codebook of radio frame configuration for each cluster, where cells pick their configuration of subframes. Then, the cluster is divided into subclusters, where the cells in each subcluster adjust subframes to reduce misalignments. Finally, CRCC combines subclusters by deciding the subframes of those cells located on the boundaries between subclusters. Simulation results reveal that CRCC greatly increases UL throughput and keeps high DL throughput, thereby improving the performance of a 5G D-TDD system.}

	abstract = {A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is comprised of a number of sensor nodes (SNs) that are randomly placed in an open, harsh environment for many applications. Due to the resource-constrained nature of SNs and hostile deployment environments, energy efficiency and security are considered two key factors in designing WSN routing protocols. This paper proposes an Energy Efficient Secure Multipath (EESM) routing protocol to securely construct efficient routes and transmit data packets between SNs and the base station (BS). EESM achieves energy efficiency through minimal task allocation among SNs whereas all computation-intensive tasks such as network information collection, routing table generation, and network maintenance are performed by the BS. The proposed protocol incorporates lightweight security mechanisms including a one-way hash chain, message authentication code, encryption, and clique-based coordinator selection and monitoring schemes to defend against numerous security attacks. Simulation results show that EESM can successfully detect and protect the network against various security attacks such as replay attacks, sybil attacks, sinkhole attacks, spoofing attacks, compromised node attacks, and so on. In terms of energy efficiency, the proposed protocol achieves an up to 37% increase in network lifetime and a 6% increase in throughput over Secure and Energy Efficient Multipath (SEEM) routing, Secure and Reliable Multipath Routing (SRMR), and Reliable and Multipath Encounter Routing (RMER) protocols. The paper implements the protocol in a real environment using Arduino motes to analyze security overheads and network setup time.}

	abstract = {Blockchain, as a decentralized database, provides natural anonymity and tamper-resistance, safeguarding the identity of both parties in covert communication and preventing malicious third parties from tampering with secret messages. Compared to traditional covert communication over a network, blockchain offers a more reliable communication carrier. However, the strict order between special transactions in blockchain covert communication increases the time consumption of communication. This paper proposes a label-tree-based covert communication model, named LTCC, which uses dynamic labels with tree-like relationships to maintain the connections between special transactions. LTCC allows senders to upload transactions containing secret messages in a single pass, free from the high latency of blockchains. Even in the event of a failed transaction submission, it is possible to regenerate the transaction containing a specific label to be submitted to the blockchain, avoiding the reuse of addresses. The experimental results indicate that LTCC possesses excellent qualities such as concealment, reliability, robustness, and communication efficiency. Therefore, it can be feasibly implemented in the present-day, mainstream blockchain systems.}

	abstract = {Fog computing is considered an important development in cloud computing, with shorter response times, less data transfer load and a more secure distributed service architecture that can be accessed by a wide range of end devices. As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources; these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead, and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data in fog computing environments.}

	abstract = {Directional antennas can increase the received power in specific directions while reducing it in other directions. Utilizing this unique feature, we configure directional antennas at legitimate users to obtain twofold benefits for secure multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks (AHWNs), i.e., enhancing the secure connectivity among legitimate users and lowering the hop count of the multi-hop paths. For the quantitative evaluation of these benefits, we first use a stochastic geometry graph to model the multi-hop AHWNs under the coexistence of eavesdroppers. Then, we introduce a simulation-based analysis method comprised of two algorithms: (a) the first algorithm provides the connectivity and the hop count of the shortest path between random source–destination pairs; (b) the second algorithm utilizes the results of the first one to return the average path connectivity, the probability mass function (pmf) of the hop count distribution, and the average hop count. This simulation-based analysis method helps to exhaustively study the behaviors of connectivity, hop count distribution, average hop count, and their mutual relationship in different scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research work that studies the effects of directional antennas equipped at legitimate users on both secure connectivity and hop count of secure AHWNs in four combinations of two types of practical directional antennas, i.e., uniform circular array (UCA) antenna and uniform linear array (ULA) antennas, and two beamforming schemes, i.e., centralized and randomized beamforming. Moreover, comparisons with the case of using omnidirectional antennas are also provided. From the obtained simulation results, we demonstrate that using directional antennas does not always benefit the secure connectivity and hop count of secure AHWNs, i.e., only UCA-random gives higher secure connectivity and lower hop count than the omnidirectional antenna among four combinations of antenna type — beamforming scheme. Moreover, in the cases of high-density legitimate users and low-density eavesdroppers, lowering the average hop count is more remarkable than improving secure connectivity. The critical findings in this paper are valuable for deploying secure multi-hop AHWNs with directional antennas in practice.}

Consequently, the replacement of encryption-based strategies for security must be done at the physical layer. The proposed method uses an enhanced Aquila optimization algorithm (EAO) to replace encryption methods to select the best joint relay and power allocation (PA). The method undergoes two stages to deliver the message to the secondary users (Ss). The first stage is the message transmitted from the secondary base station (BS) to the relay, and the second stage is relaying the message to the secondary users. Best joint relays are selected based on two objective functions to maximize throughput and the secrecy sum rate (SSR) with two factors delay and secrecy rate of CR-NOMA. To enhance the exploration and exploitation stages of the proposed algorithm, representative-based hunting (RH) is employed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is analyzed with other existing baselines on various performance metrics. The results showed that the proposed method performs well due to the inclusion of the NOMA strategy and maximizes the throughput and SSR of the network.}

However, since bandwidth and on-board processing capacity are valuable resources, strategies to appropriately routing the information and deciding on which node it has to be processed shall be defined. In this work, we formalize and solve an optimal bandwidth and computing resource allocation problem in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation for EO applications. In order to deal with the complexity of the proposed optimization problem, we also present two heuristics requiring different computational effort. In the proposed problem formalization, processing can happen on any node of the network (i.e., either on the data source satellite, on any other satellite of the constellation or on ground station). After having validated the proposed heuristics by comparing their results to the optimization problem ones, we apply them to a real orbital scenario, showing their ability to reduce both total cost and data delivery delay to ground with respect to state-of-the-art solutions.}

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is becoming a native networking model for next generation networks. However, with its decoupled architecture, SDN is susceptible to reconnaissance through time inference attacks. Attackers can use probing based measurements and gather information such as network type and flow table size. In this paper, an automated attacker tool called RAFA is proposed to infer network type (SDN or traditional) and flow rule timeout values (hard and idle). Moreover, a lightweight defense mechanism to randomize rule timeouts with respect to network status is described. A comprehensive simulation setup with different network conditions shows that the proposed methods achieve superior success rate in diverse settings.}

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of human interaction with the underground space, the observation of underground environment (e.g. soil moisture) and underground infrastructure (e.g. underground pipelines), as well as the monitoring and prevention of geological disasters (e.g., landslide and urban sinkholes) has attracted increasing attention and become a research focus. However, most of the traditional observation technologies are still facing difficulties in dynamic and continuous in-situ observations/monitoring within the complex underground environment. To solve this problem, this study adopts LoRaWAN-based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNS) to monitor the underground environment or infrastructure. Furthermore, the feasibility of LoRaWAN-based WUSNs for underground monitoring is systematically demonstrated and presented in this article. Based on our recent validation of LoRa-based underground point-to-point channel model, we evaluate its network-level performance in this paper. We firstly develop a network simulator of LoRaWAN-based WUSNs to provide the feasibility analysis and experimental guidance for underground monitoring. Using this simulator, we numerically demonstrate that the LoRaWAN-based WUSNs technology is capable of underground monitoring over a large area and at great depths. We further certify that an appropriate selection of the physical layer parameters in various underground conditions is beneficial for underground observation. Finally, the balance between data receiver rate and network energy consumption can be implemented using different physical layer parameters for various underground monitoring applications. These results successfully demonstrate the efficient protocol development of LoRaWAN-based WUSNs and their applicability for underground monitoring applications.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose the analytical propagation model for diffusive molecular communication in an one-dimensional bounded environment, and determine the available data rate for a given limit of interference. Molecular communication is a promising solution for applications when the typical electromagnetic communication is not available. However, due to the randomness of the molecule movement, it is challenging to analyze the channel in molecular communication. Taking into account the impact of an absorbing boundary to the one-dimensional vessel-like channel, we model the time-varying distribution of the releasing molecules. Accordingly, we derive the hitting probabilities for an information molecule to separately reach the receiver or the boundary, and present the impulse response of the channel at a given time\nt\n. Moreover, under the same environment, we consider the time duration between transmissions of a binary modulation system for a given level of inter-symbol interference. Our analysis shows that, for a certain degree of interference, the available data rate of the system can be expressed as\n2\nD\nα\nt\nh\n2\nS\n2\n, where\nS\nis the distance between the receiver and the boundary, and\nD\nis the diffusion coefficient of the channel, and\nα\nt\nh\n2\nis the corresponding index to the interference degree. The authenticity of our analysis are verified via simulations.}

	abstract = {Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communications has attracted much research attention. However, most applications of UAVs for wireless communication provisioning are not feasible as researchers fail to consider some vital aspects of their deployment, especially the energy requirements of both the UAV and communication system. The considerable energy consumption overhead involved in flying or hovering UAVs makes them less appealing for green wireless communications. Therefore, in this work, we examine the feasibility of an alternative energy-efficient deployment scheme where UAVs can be made to land-on designated locations, also known as landing stations (LSs). The idea of LS makes the UAV-based wireless communication more durable and advantageous, since the total energy consumption is reduced by minimizing the flying/hovering energy consumption, which, in turn, enables diverse set of applications including emergency and pop-up networking. We evaluate the impact of the separation distance between these LSs and the Optimal Hovering Position (OHP) on the network performance. Specifically, we develop mathematical frameworks to model the relationship between UAV power consumption, coverage probability, throughput, and separation distance. Numerical results reveal that a significant energy reduction can be achieved when the LS concept is exploited with a slight compromise in coverage probability and throughput. However, the choice of a suitable LS location depends on the users’ service requirements, transmit power, and frequency band utilized.}

	abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) has been employed in recent years across multiple disciplines in the Fifth Generation (5G) era. The low power consumption of the devices allows long battery lifetimes with increasing wireless coverage ranges. This paper presents a comprehensive power consumption model for battery lifetime estimation in narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), which is based on the user equipment (UE) state diagram and considers the extended discontinuous reception (eDRX) and power saving mode (PSM) mechanisms. This model has been used to simulate the effect of varying NB-IoT link parameters, covering a range of values defined in the specification, corresponding to a wide range of applications. Indeed, this study focuses on mathematical analysis of UE power consumption, mainly for NB-IoT communication applications. Repetitions, as defined in the standard, have also been considered in the analysis. Extensive simulations have been carried out to show the power of the proposed model, which provides accurate results for a wide variety of network parameters and let the network designer to select the most appropriated setup. They also show that the value of link parameters must be carefully selected to achieve a battery lifetime of more than a decade with a standard battery of 5 Wh capacity.}
