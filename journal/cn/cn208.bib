	abstract = {This paper analyzes and evaluates the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques as an alternative to heuristic methods to identify UEs in Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) networks that are being affected by collisions from hidden nodes sources. The paper analyzes different models based on supervised ML methods to classify UEs into two possible classes: UEs affected by collisions and UEs free of collisions. To implement them, we employ a set of typical parameters of the LTE standard, e.g., Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) and number of Physical Resource Blocks (PRB). These parameters are fed into different supervised ML models which, once optimized, obtain the best models to predict when an UE is facing interference from hidden nodes in a dynamic channel environment. Results show that classification methods based on ML techniques are capable of predicting with a high level of accuracy when a UE is affected by collisions and, consequently, if this node is located in a hidden area. Nevertheless, and despite the growing interest in applying ML techniques in an increasing number of fields, we can conclude that, in this case, the performance of the ML approach is not necessarily better than heuristic methods. For instance, it does not outperform the Dynamic Collision Detection (DCD) previously presented by the authors. In addition, the ML algorithms exhibit a higher prediction time and computational complexity, with respect to those obtained with DCD algorithm. This should be considered a drawback in some LTE-Advanced and 5G wireless network scenarios that prioritize lower latencies.}

	abstract = {The dynamicity of today’s networks has created uncertainties for security administrators about the defense options to deploy. In this paper, we consider the administrator’s challenge of selecting and deploying the best set of heterogeneous security hardening solutions for dynamic networks given multiple constraints (such as fixed budget, availability of hardening measures, performance degradation, non-patchable vulnerabilities, etc). The current state of the art does not focus on the dynamic characteristic of modern networks, where the effectiveness of defenses is affected by changes in the networks. Hence, we approach this challenge by developing an integrated method to effectively compute optimal defense solutions for dynamic networks given multiple objectives and constraints. The proposed approach works in the following five phases: (1) input/data collection, (2) model construction (using temporal-graph-based security model and Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets), (3) defense evaluator (based on security metrics), (4) Pareto optimal set evaluator (using Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm), and (5) optimal solution evaluator (based on Weighted Sum Model). To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we use a real-world case study while taking into account both the vulnerabilities that are patchable and non-patchable. We investigated the sensitivity of the model parameters based on the dynamic network, and the result showed a good result for values from 0.1–0.4 for the mutation probability while the crossover did not change for all the values. Furthermore, we compared the dynamic network optimization results to a static network and the evaluation shows that our proposed approach could aid a security administrator in selecting the best defense options to deploy for modern networks that are dynamic, with at least 75% and 62.50% of the defense Pareto points appearing in consecutive and in all network states, respectively. Moreover, it also provides an insight into the benefit of each defense option before the deployment.}

	abstract = {By decoupling the software function on hardware devices, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides a new service architecture named Service Function Chain (SFC), which combines multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a specific order. In order to improve the reliability and Quality of Service (QoS) of network services, VNF migration provides an effective solution for this requirement. However, traditional migration methods lack an appropriate VNF selection mechanism and consider a single network state. Moreover, how to determine the accurate migration location dynamically with machine learning is challenging. This paper proposed a novel PAVM algorithm for reliable and optimal VNF migration, which distinguishes two kinds of VNF migration schemes for network congestion and node failure states respectively, and a node and VNF priority-awareness mechanism is designed, which can select appropriate VNF on suitable node to migrate. Moreover, PAVM utilizes deep reinforcement learning algorithm to choose target node location of VNF migration, which jointly utilizes delay, load balancing of network as feedback factors to optimize the QoS. The experimental results indicate that compared with other three benchmark algorithms, PAVM can effectively reduce the transmission delay and improve node and link load balancing after the VNF migration.}

	abstract = {The dramatic growth of smart devices catering content-centric data traffic has fueled the need for group communication services in cellular networks, among which multicasting is of particular interest. The unique potential of multicasting to fulfill the vision of a hyper-connected society in 5G networks is underlined by its ability to manage resources efficiently, while supporting concurrent transmission of common data to a large number of users. The bandwidth intensive communication requirements of multimedia multicast applications demand optimal usage of the spectral resources. Moreover, massive capacity, connectivity and ultra low latency requirements of the content centric applications have triggered the urge to get the content nearer to the users and employ short range communication, thus leading to densification of cellular networks. However, the limited availability of radio resources coupled with elevated levels of interference pose a major hindrance towards enabling spectrum reuse in dense networks. Cognitive radio (CR) is a viable technology to enhance the spectral efficiency, by allowing low priority unlicensed users to share the spectrum of high priority licensed users. The ability of CR to adapt its transmission parameters according to the application demands makes it a promising candidate for efficient spectrum management and interference mitigation in 5G cellular networks. This paper presents a survey on the state-of-the art techniques proposed for catering multicast services in CR networks. The study provides a detailed analysis on the utility of various spectrum sharing models of CR networks in fulfilling the end-to-end communication goals of multicast services. We particularly emphasize on the nature of multicast traffic, the key enabling techniques and methodologies employed for enhancing the efficacy of such services and approaches for mitigating interference experienced by the licensed users. By carefully analyzing the existing works, we provide possible design guidelines for multicast services in future 5G networks. Finally, we identify few open issues and discuss the future research directions.}

	abstract = {As the channel conditions experienced by vehicular users in cellular networks vary as they move, we investigate to what extent the quality of channel allocation could be improved by exploiting predictions on future data rates in non-stationary environments. Assuming mean future rates can be computed from Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) maps, we propose an algorithm which predicts future throughputs over a short-term horizon at regular time intervals, and then uses this extra-knowledge for improved online channel allocation. The prediction of future throughputs is obtained by solving a relaxed version of the problem using a projected gradient algorithm. When the transmit powers of the base stations can be varied over time, a straightforward extension of our algorithm can be used for the joint optimization of channel allocation and transmit power control under average and maximum power constraints. Using event-driven simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithms against those of other channel allocation algorithms, including the Proportional Fair (PF) scheduler, which is known to be optimal in stationary environments, and the (PF)\n2\nS scheduler, which was devised for mobiles nodes in non-stationary environments. The simulated scenarios, which cover the cases with and without power control, include scenarios with multiple base stations and are based on realistic mobility traces generated using the road traffic simulator SUMO. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the other algorithms and that exploiting the knowledge of future radio conditions allows a significantly better channel allocation.}

	abstract = {It is challenging to enforce and evaluate cyber-defenses for large networks. The current state-of-the-art approaches on defense enforcement and evaluations are manually performed by a security expert and they are executed separately without using a defined workflow. Moreover, the cyber defense generation, enforcement, and evaluation require costs, time, and effort of the security experts to effectively identify attacks and the best set of defenses to deploy. To effectively address these challenges, we propose a novel defense automation framework named CD-GEE (Cyber Defense Generation, Enforcement and Evaluation). CD-GEE can perform automated Cyber defense generation, defense enforcement and security evaluation without human intervention. CD-GEE works in the following five phases: (1) host/network data collection, (2) graphical security models construction, (3) cyber defense generation & selection, (4) defense deployment, and (5) defense evaluation and report. To show the usability and applicability of CD-GEE, we perform experiments on different networks including Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud. Besides, we also evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the defenses deployed via our proposed framework and tool. We show that the CD-GEE measures the security posture of the network before and after defense deployment and evaluation. We also showed that our proposed framework performed better than without the framework in enhancing the security of networks on both the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and simulation network environment.}

However, the management queue can be manipulated easily by jamming attacks. In this paper, we discover such a vulnerability and analyze possible attack models, including continuous, periodic, and reactive jamming that can effectively exploit the vulnerability. To analyze the impact of jamming, we propose mathematical models to study the association process under jamming. Our finding is that jamming attacks can fail the association process and disable the connectivity of the network, which causes IoT applications such as security surveillance and critical event reporting unavailable. To defense the problem, we also propose methods to address different types of jamming attacks. Experiment results show that our proposals can defend against jamming attacks effectively.}

To shed light on the ecosystem of open proxies and characterize the behaviors of open proxies, we conduct a large-scale, comprehensive study on over 436 thousand identified proxies, including 104 thousand responsive proxies in nine months. We characterize open proxies based on active and passive measurements and examine their network and geographic distributions, performance, and deployment. In particular, to obtain a more in-depth and broader understanding of open proxies, we analyze two particular groups of open proxies — cloud-based proxies and long-term proxies. To process and analyze the enormous amount of responses, we design a lightweight method that classifies and labels the proxies based on DOM structure which defines the logical structure of Web documents. We identify that 7.17% of responsive proxies modify the page content, and 76.42% of those proxies perform malicious actions. Furthermore, we parse the contents to extract information to identify the owners of proxies and track their activities for deploying malicious proxies. To this end, we reveal that some owners regularly change the proxy deployment to avoid being blocked and deploy more proxies to expand their malicious attacks.}

	abstract = {Network failures are common in all kinds of networks, from data centers to wide-area networks. The current network mainly adopts reactive and proactive failure recovery schemes. The reactive scheme needs to contact to the controller to implement failure recovery after detecting a link failure, which will cause a large recovery delay. Whereas, the proactive scheme pre-calculates and installs backup paths in the switch to accelerate failure recovery, which consumes a lot of switch storage. Programmable data plane creates a possibility to solve network failure problem. To realize an efficient failure recovery while keeping switch storage overhead low, we present P4Resilience, a hybrid multi-failure recovery system combining SDN and programmable data plane. Firstly, P4Resilience encapsulates the backup path information into the packet header to perform failure recovery, which can greatly reduce the switch storage overhead. Secondly, P4Resilience implements loop-free backup path algorithm to calculate backup paths for each link to realize strong resilience to multi-link failure. Finally, we develop an optimization traffic balancing algorithm to reallocate bandwidth resources for flows to avoid potential congestion after failure recovery. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional failure recovery mechanisms, P4Resilience significantly reduces switch storage overhead for backup baths. Meanwhile, P4Resilience effectively relieves link congestion caused by failure recovery and guarantees the protection performance with a higher failure recovery rate and less packet loss rate.}

	abstract = {Nowadays, Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) is one of the solutions proposed to increase the capacity and optimal allocation of resources in Elastic Optical Networks (EON). The issue of allocating resources in these networks involves the optimal allocation of route, space and spectrum for the establishment of traffic requests. The quality of service (QoS) provided for establishing traffic requests must vary according to their importance and priority, so that high quality requests require guaranteed bandwidth and higher levels of service than low quality requests. Hence, reducing the blocking probability of high-quality data traffic is one of the most important goals in networks. In this paper, three new QoS-aware algorithms are proposed for route, space and spectrum assignment of dynamic traffic in SDM-EONs that reduce the blocking probability of high-quality requests as follows: Reservation without Common Core (RwoC), Reservation with One Common Core (RwC), and Reservation and Recoring with One Common Core (RRwC). The results of utilizing these algorithms and also adding distance adaptive modulation format show that the blocking rate of high-quality requests is decreased and the general spectrum utilization is increased specially in RRwC algorithm. Of course, this decrease causes a slight increase in the blocking rate of low-quality requests. Another advantage of using the RRwC algorithm is that using the slots with the same index in the recoring method reduces costs because in this case there is no need to change the frequency of transceivers. Since, this algorithm is more cost-effective. In the first proposed algorithm, dedicated cores are designed to create high quality traffic. In the second algorithm, in addition to dedicated cores, a common core is also used between high and low-quality traffic. Finally, the recoring method has been used for high quality traffic to further reduce their blocking rates.}
