	abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is rapidly becoming the de-facto standard for short-range wireless communications among resource-constrained wireless devices. Securing this technology and its networking capabilities is paramount, as their widespread use by Internet of Things (IoT) applications demands protection from malicious users. While its security features have remarkably improved over the years, the BLE technology is still prone to severe threats, creating a gap between the standard theoretical design and its implementation. Particularly, the BLE Mesh Profile (Bluetooth Mesh), which enables many-to-many communication, prompts an overall analysis of its security, to ensure that its use preserves the integrity and privacy of end users. This work surveys the state-of-the-art of the security of BLE with an emphasis on Bluetooth Mesh, highlighting the threats that can still hinder their usage. We review the latest specifications in terms of link set up and authentication and describe attacks to both point-to-point and multicast networking. Our work also discusses solutions to mitigate and prevent attacks to the current standard, such as Intrusion Detection Systems, thus improving the general level of security of BLE systems.}

	abstract = {Traffic jams are an essential and continuous challenge in our cities, responsible for socioeconomic and environmental concerns and an ambitious traffic jams management agenda is urgent. The distributed solutions in the literature for Traffic Management Systems (TMS) are heavily based on beacon messages or proactive communication protocols to share vehicular traffic information among vehicles. Thus, these solutions are not scalable when the number of vehicles increases in the network — when there are traffic jams. To overcome these problems, we propose a new VANET-based traffic management system named CoNeCT: Predictive Congestion Control based on Collaborative Information Sharing for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks. CoNeCT’s primary goal is to support vehicles’ collaboration in analyzing, predicting, and managing congestion. The proposed system was designed to decrease the number of messages by using a novel road segment load assessment that improves traffic flow classification. Vehicles aware of traffic conditions share it with their neighbors, and they can also request traffic views whenever necessary. Additionally, vehicles can detect significant traffic variations and predict future traffic conditions to improve roads’ overall traffic conditions, mitigating the congestion before it arises. Results obtained from an extensive performance analysis show CoNeCT’s ability to reduce traffic congestion with a low impact on the wireless communication medium, outperforming the state-of-art systems.}

	abstract = {Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is attracting a lot of attention lately due to their ability to provide bounded latency and zero packet loss for time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we formulate the routing and scheduling problem for 1+1 protected DetNet flows based on Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF). The solution to this problem selects two paths between the two endpoints of each service request and schedules packet transmission on these paths meanwhile maximizing the accepted traffic. We have modelled the problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We also propose two heuristic approaches: greedy and Tabu-search (TS) that can perform 1+1 routing and scheduling for a large number of requests in a reasonable time. Eventually, the performance of the ILP approach and heuristics is evaluated by performing simulation experiments. The results highlight the scalability of the two heuristics as compared to the ILP and superior performance of TS over greedy. The trade-off of cycle time on traffic acceptance and end-to-end delay is also presented.}

The game-theoretic solution determines the favorable parameters (strategies), predicts the player’s behavior, and suggests the best settings for minimizing the attack’s effect. To this end, our paper attempts to study the usefulness of game-theoretic applications for the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on a drone by deriving the information from conventional game solutions and augmenting that with the bounded rationality concept called Quantal response equilibrium (QRE). In this process, we identify feasible strategies for each player through simulations and formulate five non-cooperative game scenarios for two variants of DDoS attacks. In these games, the traditional game-theoretic solution or Nash Equilibrium (NashE) provides information about the drone’s recommended settings, the hacker’s preferred strategy, and the game-theoretic threshold assuming that all participants are highly intelligent. We augment this information by considering the participant’s tendency to make errors and the evolution in their behavioral pattern from zero to high-values of rationality using QRE. The information coupled from NashE and QRE provides better clarity to a drone operator, thus improving the drone’s security by two levels and allowing the drone operator to take timely precautions. Inspired by this multilevel process, we propose an equivalent real-world framework for protecting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) nodes against a DDoS attack.}

Leaks are particularly hard to detect because they most frequently involve routes with legitimate origin announced through legitimate paths that are propagated beyond their legitimate scope. In this paper we present ASIRIA, a mechanism for detecting and avoiding leaked routes and protecting against leakage events that uses AS relationship information inferred from the Internet Routing Registries. By relying on existing information, ASIRIA provides immediate benefits to early adopters. In particular, we consider the deployment of ASIRIA to detect leaks caused by over 300 ASes and we show that it can detect over 99% of the leakage events generated by a customer or a peer solely using currently available information in 90% of the cases.}

	abstract = {Multicast device-to-device (D2D) communication is an important technique to overcome the problem of spectrum shortage. Due to the channel gain difference between users in different locations, receivers in the same multicast D2D group still suffer from the problem of different quality of service (QoS) levels. This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multicast D2D communication system to enhance the QoS of users, in which RIS solves the problem of different QoS between users through intelligent resource optimization. To maximize the achievable sum rate of all multicast D2D users, we formulate a joint optimization problem. This problem combines channel assignment, power allocation, and reflection matrix design by considering the QoS fairness among different D2D users. To solve this problem, we propose a novel joint optimization algorithm, which has three steps. First, we propose a matching algorithm based on swap operations to solve the channel assignment problem. Then, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve the power allocation problem. Finally, we present the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients with mathematical analysis. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the QoS of users in the multicast D2D group. With the aid of RIS, the proposed algorithm decreases the service disparities between users in different locations. Furthermore, it reveals that it is helpful to deploy the RIS closer to the receivers or the transmitters.}

	abstract = {Large public congregation of short period such as Kumbh Mela, Hajj, open fairs, outdoor musical concerts etc. require temporary to semi-permanent communication and computation infrastructure to provide IoT based smart services. For these use cases, wireless mesh networks (WMN) present themselves as an elegant underlying communication substrate for designing IoT-based smart infrastructures where the wired network is not a cost-effective solution. Further, the mesh network devices such as wireless routers, access points, and gateways can also be utilized to support in-network computing for installation and execution of microservices dynamically. This paper presents the design and implementation of a software-defined wireless fog infrastructure for IoT-based semi-permanent smart infrastructure. Our proposed controller ”SDFog-Mesh” can be deployed quickly to support in-network computing over wireless network devices. Further, this controller also assists in choosing the fog nodes which are best suited for executing the desired microservice. However, the interesting challenge is to create an execution environment on fog nodes and to redirect the IoT traffic towards the deployed micro-services on-the-fly. The “SDFog-Mesh” architecture utilizes P4 language to insert/delete flow rules dynamically on the fog nodes for different classes of IoT traffic such as IoT to Fog (IF), Fog to Fog (FF), Fog to Cloud (FC) and IoT to Cloud (IC). We have considered MQTT-based IoT application as a demonstrative example to enable IF, FF, FC, and IC communication within a fog environment. The microservices of various QoS classes are deployed over our implemented testbed to evaluate our approach. Our proposed architecture has also been emulated with more devices using Mininet-Wifi for the same microservices classes for evaluating the scalability. We have considered parameters like setup time, flow creation time in data path devices, microservice service time, QoS constraints, and maintenance overhead for evaluation. The gathered results establish the applicability of our proposed solution.}

	abstract = {Inspired by the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches in 5G and 6G networks, in this paper we propose a novel ML based Distributed AI (DAI) framework able to attain the ambitious goals set for emerging 5G/6G networks. The novelty of the DAI framework is that it is implemented in an autonomous, dynamic and flexible fashion, utilising Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agents, extended with ML capabilities, which reside on the mobile devices (User Equipment). We refer to these as BDIx agents. This provides a component-based framework (likened to LEGO-based building blocks), which can build on and utilise execution plans, by composing and arranging ML techniques in flexible ways within the framework, in order to achieve the desired goals. More specifically, we form a modular BDIx agent at a multi-agent system (MAS), integrated with Fuzzy Logic for the perception/cognitive part of the agents. By exploiting the capabilities of the BDIx agents in our DAI framework, we allow mobile devices to intercommunicate and cooperate in an autonomous manner, thus offering a number of attractive features, including improved performance in terms of network control execution time and message exchange, fast response in handling dynamic aspects in the network, self-organising network functionalities, and a framework that can act as the glue platform in employing one or more intelligent approaches to tackle the diverse 5G/6G technical requirements. To demonstrate the potential of the DAI framework we focus on Device to Device (D2D) communication and illustrate its flexibility in addressing diverse D2D challenges. Through example Plan Libraries and enhanced metrics, we outline DAI implementation specifics to achieve a number of identified 5G/6G D2D requirements. To embed the concept further, the specific problem of D2D transmission mode selection is expanded upon, from problem description to solution approach (DAIS) and implementation specifics, and hence comparatively evaluate over other approaches (i.e., Unsupervised learning ML techniques, centralised control techniques, random techniques). The results demonstrated that DAIS provides, among other performance metrics, improved mobile network Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Power Consumption (PC), better and more efficient cluster formation and reduced control decision delay.}

	abstract = {The advancements in peer-to-peer wireless power transfer (P2P-WPT) have empowered the portable and mobile devices to wirelessly replenish their battery by directly interacting with other nearby devices. The existing works unrealistically assume the users to exchange energy with any of the users and at every such opportunity. However, due to the users’ mobility, the inter-node meetings in such opportunistic mobile networks vary, and P2P energy exchange in such scenarios remains uncertain. Additionally, the social interests and interactions of the users influence their mobility as well as the energy exchange between them. The existing P2P-WPT methods did not consider the joint problem for energy exchange due to user’s inevitable mobility, and the influence of sociality on the latter. As a result of computing with imprecise information, the energy balance achieved by these works at a slower rate as well as impaired by energy loss for the crowd. Motivated by this problem scenario, in this work, we present a wireless crowd charging method, namely MoSaBa, which leverages mobility prediction and social information for improved energy balancing. MoSaBa incorporates two dimensions of social information, namely social context and social relationships, as additional features for predicting contact opportunities. In this method, we explore the different pairs of peers such that the energy balancing is achieved at a faster rate as well as the energy balance quality improves in terms of maintaining low energy loss for the crowd. We justify the peer selection method in MoSaBa by detailed performance evaluation. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art, the proposed method achieves better performance trade-offs between energy-efficiency, energy balance quality and convergence time.}

The scheme has dynamically adjusting authorization set without updating private key. In the encryption stage, since part of the operation is outsourced to a trusted third party to relieve the computational burden of the broadcaster, the scheme achieves lightweight broadcast encryption, which is suitable for resource-constrained devices in wireless sensor networks. The partial key is hidden in the secret value sequence to disguise the recipient’s identity and enhance the security of ciphertext. Lastly, we make the comparisons of the proposed work with the existing works in terms of functions and computational cost. In addition, performance evaluation shows that the scheme has higher efficiency in the signcryption and unsigncryption phase and is more suitable for practical broadcast service applications.}

This article exploits smart contracts in the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain platforms. In particular, we explore Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu, BFT blockchain platforms, and apply them to a decentralized e-prescription case study to evaluate their effectiveness. We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet. Our article empirically evaluates the performance of smart contracts in Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu using a decentralized medical prescription case study and compares their results with Ethereum, a PoW blockchain. Our results demonstrate that BFT blockchain platforms are efficient for multi-stakeholder applications such as e-prescription and supply chains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms, such as Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu.}

It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.}

	abstract = {The combination of mobile edge computing and network function virtualization has led to the emergence of Virtualized Network Function (VNF) in a broader range of application scenarios. These latency-sensitive and highly dynamic services can be provided by combining multiple VNFs into Service Function Chains (SFCs). However, existing work has conspicuously neglected that online placing SFC with instance reuse can significantly improve resource utilization and save initialization time, which requires considering both the dynamic distribution of required VNFs over time and resource constraints on the edge network. In this paper, we initiate the study of Online SFC placement combined with Instance Reuse. An OSIR algorithm is proposed to gain a tradeoff between service costs and users’ quality of experience. The OSIR is designed based on deep reinforcement learning, which improves the system performance by maximizing the long-term cumulative reward. In OSIR, an SFC queue network is designed to extract the dynamic distribution of required VNFs over time, composed of memory space and the long short-term memory learning approach. The experimental results with real-world data traces show that OSIR can efficiently and effectively improve system performance and outperform the best result of all existing algorithms ranging from 17% to 26%.}

	abstract = {Secure routing algorithm plays an important role in the performance of LEO satellite network survivability. However, due to the instability, openness and exposure of inter-satellite links, the internal routing of LEO satellite network is vulnerable to malicious attacks. Considering that trust management has a better performance in solving the internal attacks, this paper proposes a secure routing algorithm based on node trust for LEO satellite network, called SLT. The SLT is based on the distributed trust evaluation model, which is used to calculate the direct trust, indirect trust and aggregate trust value between satellite nodes through D-S evidence theory. Then, combining the low cost OPSPF routing protocol with the trust evaluation, the SLT algorithm is designed. Through timely detection and isolation of malicious nodes in the satellite network, STL algorithm can reduce the impact of malicious packet dropping caused by internal attacks. Finally, the simulations verifies that SLT algorithm has an average increase of 27% in packet delivery rate and an average decrease of 70% in packet loss rate, compared with OPSPF.}
