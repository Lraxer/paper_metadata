	abstract = {In the fog network with multiple terminals and fog nodes, how to make a tradeoff between energy consumption fairness among fog nodes (FNs) and task processing delay of terminal nodes (TNs) is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Kuhn-Munkres (KM) based Fair Task Offloading (KFTO) scheme, which includes two optimization models: FN selection model and task offloading decision model. FN selection model employs the KM algorithm to obtain the optimal matching scheme between TNs and FNs that maximizes the total network potential. The second model is used to obtain the task size offloaded to FN that minimizes the task processing delay of TN while satisfying the energy consumption constraint. Numerical simulation results reveal that the proposed KFTO scheme achieves a satisfactory tradeoff between the energy fairness among FNs and the task processing delay of TNs.}

	abstract = {Cloud computing has a shared set of resources, including physical servers, networks, storage, and user applications. Resource allocation is a critical issue for cloud computing, especially in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). The decision-making process in the cloud computing network is non-trivial as it is handled by switches and routers. Moreover, the network concept drifts resulting from changing user demands are among the problems affecting cloud computing. The cloud data center needs agile and elastic network control functions with control of computing resources to ensure proper virtual machine (VM) operations, traffic performance, and energy conservation. Software-Defined Network (SDN) proffers new opportunities to blueprint resource management to handle cloud services allocation while dynamically updating traffic requirements of running VMs. The inclusion of an SDN for managing the infrastructure in a cloud data center better empowers cloud computing, making it easier to allocate resources. In this survey, we discuss and survey resource allocation in cloud computing based on SDN. It is noted that various related studies did not contain all the required requirements. This study is intended to enhance resource allocation mechanisms that involve both cloud computing and SDN domains. Consequently, we analyze resource allocation mechanisms utilized by various researchers; we categorize and evaluate them based on the measured parameters and the problems presented. This survey also contributes to a better understanding of the core of current research that will allow researchers to obtain further information about the possible cloud computing strategies relevant to IaaS resource allocation.}

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has increasingly gained importance to address some emerging networking challenges like agility and cost-effectiveness. NFV enables to run Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) on top of any generic, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware, anytime and anywhere in the network. Specific service providers offer VNFs to prospective network providers. Service providers publish VNFs in dedicated marketplaces where network providers search VNFs and instantiate them according to a pre-established service-level agreement. On top of being proprietary and specific to the service providers, the existing VNF description models include details on VNF deployment but fail to fit VNF functional and non-functional specifications. This description alters an efficient selection of the most relevant VNFs and prevents full automation of the VNFs provisioning. This paper introduces a novel domain-independent VIrtualized networK functIoN ontoloGy (VIKING for short) for VNF description and publication in federated repositories. It also proposes a semantic-based matchmaking algorithm to discover and select the most relevant VNFs that satisfy prospective VNF consumers’ requests. As for validation, a prototype called Mastermyr Chest, including VIKING’s instantiation along with the matchmaker in Content Delivery Networks (CDN) domain was implemented. This prototype illustrates a new way to contribute to the redesign of the CDN’s traditional architecture by enabling value-added CDN service provisioning in an agile and dynamic manner. A set of experiments was run to (i) evaluate the matchmaker performances and (ii) demonstrate its accuracy and precision.}

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is already considered as a structural enabler of today’s networking technology and particularly the 5th Generation of Broadband and Cellular Networks (5G). NFV provides the means to flexibly and dynamically manage and allocate resources, without being restricted to the hardware limitations of the network/cloud infrastructure. Resource orchestration for specific 5G vertical industries and use case families, such as Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), often introduce very strict requirements in terms of network performance. In such a dynamic environment, the challenge is to efficiently place directed graphs of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), named as SFCs (Service Function Chains), to the underlying network topology and to dynamically allocate the required resources. To this end, this work presents a novel framework, which makes use of a delay and location aware Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach, in order to perform optimized sequential SFC placement. Evaluation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of producing solutions that approximate well the global optimal, as well as achieving low execution time due to the employed GA-based approach and the incorporation of an early stopping criterion. The performance benefits of the proposed framework are evaluated in the context of an extensive set of simulation-based scenarios, under diverse network configurations and scales.}

This is no surprise given the high number of reported data breach incidents annually, and the implication of these on the individuals or organisations targeted. Data exfiltration is a key stage in this form of cyber-attack, and the use of the Domain Name System protocol for data exfiltration is popular due to the essential nature of the protocol for network communication. This paper presents a DNS data exfiltration Protection (DNSxP) security architecture leveraging Software-Defined Networking and Data Plane Programmability. The solution is developed based on analysis of different malicious use cases for transmitting data over the DNS protocol. By performing coarse-grained packet filtering and analysis in the data plane, clear benign or malicious traffic can be identified quickly, while suspicious traffic is passed to additional security controls at the SDN controller for classification. As the results demonstrate, this approach offers the combined benefit of reducing data loss during an exfiltration attack and reducing network resource consumption.}

	abstract = {In device-to-device (D2D) networks, multiple resource-limited mobile devices cooperate with one another to execute computation tasks. As the battery capacity of mobile devices is limited, the computation tasks running on the mobile devices will terminate once the battery is dead. In order to achieve sustainable computation, energy-harvesting technology has been introduced into D2D networks. At present, how to make multiple energy harvesting mobile devices work collaboratively to minimize the long-term system cost for task execution under limited computing, network and battery capacity constraint is a challenging issue. To deal with such a challenge, in this paper, we design a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) based cost-aware collaborative task-execution (CACTE) scheme in energy harvesting D2D (EH-D2D) networks. To validate the CACTE scheme's performance, we conducted extensive experiments to compare the CACTE scheme with four baseline algorithms, including Local, Random, ECLB (Energy Capacity Load Balance) and CCLB (Computing Capacity Load Balance). Experiments were accompanied by various system parameters, such as the mobile device's battery capacity, task workload, the bandwidth and so on. The experimental results show that the CACTE scheme can make multiple mobile devices cooperate effectively with one another to execute many more tasks and achieve a higher long-term reward, including lower task latency and fewer dropped tasks.}

	abstract = {Next generation communication networks are expected to accommodate a high number of new and resource-voracious applications that can be offered to a large range of end users. Even though end devices are becoming more powerful, the available local resources cannot cope with the requirements of these applications. This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices at the edge of the network. This paper provides a detailed survey of how the Edge and/or Cloud can be combined together to facilitate the task offloading problem. Particular emphasis is given on the mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory optimization approaches that can be used to satisfy the various objectives, constraints and dynamic conditions of this end-to-end application execution approach. The survey concludes with identifying open challenges and future directions of the problem at hand.}

Integrated NG-IoT network, AR can improve efficiency in many fields such as mobile computing, smart city, intelligent transportation and telemedicine. However, limited by capability of mobile device, the reliability and latency requirements of AR applications is difficult to meet by local processing. To solve this problem, we study a binary offloading scheme for AR edge computing. Based on the proposed model, the parts of AR computing can offload to edge network servers, which is extend the computing capability of mobile AR devices. Moreover, a deep reinforcement learning offloading model is considered to acquire B5G network resource allocation and optimally AR offloading decisions. First, this offloading model does not need to solve combinatorial optimization, which is greatly reduced the computational complexity. Then the wireless channel gains and binary offloading states is modeled as a Markov decision process, and solved by deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that our scheme can achieve better performance compared with existing optimization methods.}

	abstract = {Coexistence between cellular systems and Wi-Fi gained the attention of the research community when LTE License Assisted Access (LAA) entered the unlicensed band. The recent introduction of NR-U as part of 5G introduces new coexistence opportunities because it implements scalable numerology (flexible subcarrier spacing and OFDM symbol lengths), and non-slot based scheduling (mini-slots), which considerably impact channel access. This paper analyzes the impact of NR-U settings on its coexistence with Wi-Fi networks and compares it with LAA operation using simulations and experiments. First, we propose a downlink channel access simulation model, which addresses the problem of the dependency and non-uniformity of transmission attempts of different nodes, as a result of the synchronization mechanism introduced by NR-U. Second, we validate the accuracy of the proposed model using FPGA-based LAA, NR-U, and Wi-Fi prototypes with over-the-air transmissions. Additionally, we show that replacing LAA with NR-U would not only allow to overcome the problem of bandwidth wastage caused by reservation signals but also, in some cases, to preserve fairness in channel access for both scheduled and random-access systems. Finally, we conclude that fair coexistence of the aforementioned systems in unlicensed bands is not guaranteed in general, and novel mechanisms are necessary for improving the sharing of resources between scheduled and contention-based technologies.}

	abstract = {Virtual network embedding (VNE) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that has been widely addressed through metaheuristics. However, one key element for the successful application of metaheuristics in the VNE problem is the evaluation function, which should be pivotal to making fine distinctions among all the potential embeddings to avoid producing zones with solutions of the same fitness value (i.e., plateaus zones). The existence of plateaus zones in the search space is a critical aspect that would jeopardize the detection of promising search directions in metaheuristic-based VNE. In this paper, we demonstrate that the classical VNE evaluation function based on the embedding cost has poor discrimination capabilities, namely it fails in establishing preferences among the potential embedding solutions. To cope with this important issue, we propose the Alternative Function Based on Degree (AFBD), which takes into account the degree of the nodes of the substrate network to drive the search process. Our results demonstrate that VNE based on the AFBD objective function outperforms the state-of-the-art evaluation functions in terms of the acceptance rate and revenue-to-cost metric. Using AFBD as a reference, we report performance decreases in VNE algorithms with the state-of-the-art evaluation functions ranging from 1% to 7% (relative) for the acceptance rate and decreases close to 12% for the revenue-to-cost metric, which means that the AFBD-based VNE algorithm accepts more virtual networks at lower embedding cost. Formal analysis demonstrates that it is possible to enhance the performance of metaheuristic-based VNE through the use of the AFBD objective function, even with substrate network topologies where the performance of metaheuristic based-VNE decreases drastically.}

	abstract = {Modern mobile wireless networks have been demonstrated to be high-speed but lossy, while mobile applications have more strict requirements including reliability, low latency, goodput guarantee, bandwidth efficiency, and computation efficiency. Such a complicated combination of requirements and conditions in networks pushes the pressure to transport layer protocol design. We analyze and argue that few of existing network transport layer solutions are able to handle all these requirements. We design and implement Sphinx to satisfy the five requirements in high-speed and lossy networks. Sphinx has (1) a proactive coding-based method named semi-random LT codes for loss recovery, which estimates packet loss rate and adjusts the redundancy level accordingly, (2) a reactive retransmission method named Instantaneous Compensation Mechanism (ICM), which retransmits precisely and timely once decoding failure occurs, and (3) a parallel coding architecture, which speeds up coding process by leveraging multi-core, shared memory and kernel-bypass Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). Prototype and evaluation show that Sphinx outperforms TCP schemes and other coding solutions significantly in microbenchmarks across all five requirements, and improves the performance of the video streaming application.}

	abstract = {Quality of Service (QoS) aware spectrum handoff operation is critical for Secondary Users (SUs) executing real-time applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). The problem is aggravated by the inclusion of occasionally mobile SUs where pre-selected target channels are often rendered insignificant during handoff under dynamic conditions. Conventional proactive and reactive schemes may underperform due to channel obsolescence issues and unacceptable handoff latency respectively while a combined approach is not yet explored under the constraints of practical applicability. In view of these challenges and enormous significance of VoIP based CRN in 5G networks, this paper proposes a practically feasible two-phase spectrum handoff methodology with I_Phase and S_Phase operating under alternate conditions. I_Phase deploys a three-level dropping decision scheme followed by a two-tier spectrum handoff policy and is motivated by an integrated approach spanning every CR operation. S_Phase incorporates user mobility and application-oriented aspects where channel drop is governed by a joint two-order Hidden Markov Model — custom Damerau–Levenshtein distance metric based policy and spectrum handoff is monitored by a novel non-cooperative TOPSIS method. These phases are assisted by two proposed prerequisite techniques namely ACT (Adaptive Call Transmission) involving CR timing parameters and VER (VoIP Early Resumption) dealing with early call resumption. Comparative analysis of QoS metrics including per-instance handoff latency, transmission duration per target channel, channel drop and call drop probabilities, etc. in analytical and simulation platforms record significant performance improvement. Novelty of this work further relies on design and execution of SU prototype with the proposed scheme in test-bed that successfully provides QoS guarantees during spectrum handoff.}

	abstract = {Fog computing is a revolutionary technology for the next generation to bridge the gap between cloud data centers and end-users. Fog computing is not a counterfeit for cloud computing but a persuasive counterpart. It also accredits by utilizing the network edge while still rendering the possibility to interact with the cloud. Nevertheless, the features of fog computing are encountering several security challenges. The security of end-users and/or fog servers brings a significant dilemma in implementing fog computing. Moreover, in conventional cloud computing, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) technology is not appropriate for end-users due to restricted computing resources, i.e., limited resources, high end-to-end delay, and transmission capability. Hence, the revocation and outsourcing mechanisms become inappropriate between end-users and cloud servers. In this regard, this paper recommends a multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE) technique to support revocation and outsource the attributes to fog computation. We present an attribute revocation scheme based on cipher-text attribute-based encryption by introducing the attribute group keys. In this process, the secret keys are dynamically altered and realized the requirement of immediate attribute revocations. Hence, we provide the complete encryption and decryption process for end-users and fog servers based on multi-authority, attribute revocation, and outsourcing computation, while most of the existing scheme lack to incorporate all these parameters. Our scheme also outsources the complicated encryption and decryption tasks to the fog server that significantly improves the overall computation efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art work.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), where each secondary receiver (SR) can harvest energy and decode information using the signals received from the secondary transmitter (ST). It is assumed that the ST and SR adopt orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. Each SR uses the power splitting (PS) to coordinate the process of energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID). The optimization problem of maximizing the energy efficiency of the secondary system is formulated. In particular, in order to accurately analyze the uncertain channel state information (CSI) and improve the performance of wireless networks in dynamic environments, the probability constraints are introduced. To settle this non-convex problem, the nonlinear fractional programming is utilized. Then we decompose the equivalent optimization problem into two convex subproblems, and the probability constraints of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) are converted to deterministic ones by integral transformation. An efficient iterative algorithm for robust resource allocation is presented. Finally, simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

	abstract = {Fog computing improves IoT systems by analyzing and storing data locally at the network edge. However, it is challenging to design a fog-based IoT system data flow as data transmissions must be agile and resistant to network failures and disconnections. Data collected by sensors must persist in the fog, even during a long disconnection period. When the connection is available again, the fog needs to send the data immediately to the cloud. This paper proposes and evaluates the Fog-DaRe system for supporting data flow resilience between fog and cloud during network availability and unavailability situations. Fog-DaRe allows data persistence in the fog and uses different compression techniques to reduce the data volume. We evaluate 10 data flow configurations in experiments with 5,000 simulated sensors, computing hardware, and network metrics. The Fog-DaRe strategy yields different tradeoffs for scenarios with network unavailability, lossy compression techniques, and data encryption. For example, our results reveal a reduction of at least 77.7% for fog-to-cloud batch transfer time and 81.5% for fog storage usage when the network is unavailable. When the network between fog and cloud is available, delay increases by 10% due to data buffering in the fog, but storage requirement drops 73.6%. Lossy data filtering yields a reduction of 83.3% in batch transfer time and 50% in storage. Also, the compression of encrypted data increases storage usage and batch transfer time by 125%, compared to plain data.}

	abstract = {−\nThere are innumerable ways the Internet of Drones (IoD) technology can impact our society. With the deployment of an airborne network, the IoD can support real-time low-cost delivery of services ranging from military surveillance to a myriad of civilian applications. Nevertheless, the drones employ insecure wireless communication channels to communicate with other entities in the system, inhibiting its induction in sensitive installations if insecure or inefficient Authenticated Key Agreement (AKA) schemes are employed. The blockchain, an open distributed ledger-based technology, is increasingly being adopted to address the security concern as discussed. Recently, Bera et al. presented an efficient blockchain-enabled AKA scheme for data management among various entities in IoD network. However, their scheme does not support anonymity and untraceability for the drones; also, it does not provide resistance to Ground station server impersonation attack, while the protocol has a few redundancies. Later, we proposed an enhanced blockchain-enabled AKA scheme BOD5-IOD to authenticate drones in the system. The BOD5-IOD, other than supporting a robust access control mechanism between drones and GSS, also ensures safe transactions among all entities in the IoD environment. The formal analysis and performance evaluation endorse that our scheme supports security requirements with computational and communication efficiency of 34.4% and 23.3%, respectively.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, cloud storage has been accepted as a convenient service by an increasing number of organizations and individuals. However, when users lose control of their data, ensuring that the uploaded data are securely stored by the cloud becomes a critical requirement. A key research challenge associated with existing designs of data auditing protocols is the limitation of application scenarios due to low auditing efficiency. In order to address this problem, we propose a provably secure and public auditing protocol based on Bell triangle for cloud data with blockless verification and batch auditing. We introduce the associative property of Bell triangle; design an index conversion algorithm to convert the one-dimensional index to a two-dimensional index ensuring that the block signature satisfies the Bell triangle requirements, and develop a recursive association algorithm to ensure relevance between the signatures of adjacent file blocks. This protocol offers significant advantages over existing protocols in terms of auditing efficiency and security in a multi-user and high-volume environment. In addition, the security analysis and the results of the experiment indicate that the protocol is secure and efficient.}
