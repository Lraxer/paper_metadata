	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolutionary networking paradigm which has been adopted by large network and cloud providers, among which are Tech Giants. However, embracing a new and futuristic paradigm as an alternative to well-established and mature legacy networking paradigm requires a lot of time along with considerable financial resources and technical expertise. Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a. Hybrid SDN (hSDN)) in which SDN functionalities are leveraged while existing traditional network infrastructures are acknowledged.}

	abstract = {The enormous number of network packets transferred in modern networks together with the high speed of transmissions hamper the implementation of successful IT security mechanisms. In addition, virtual networks create highly dynamic and flexible environments which differ widely from well-known infrastructures of the past decade. Network forensic investigation that aims at the detection of covert channels, malware usage or anomaly detection is faced with new problems and is thus a time-consuming, error-prone and complex process. Machine learning provides advanced techniques to perform this work faster, more precise and, simultaneously, with fewer errors. Depending on the learning technique, algorithms work nearly without any interaction to detect relevant events in the transferred network packets. Current algorithms work well in static environments, but the highly dynamic environments of virtual networks create additional events which might confuse anomaly detection algorithms. This paper analyzes highly flexible networks and their inherent on-demand changes like the migration of virtual machines, SDN-programmability or user customization and the resulting effect on the detection rate of anomalies in the environment. Our research shows the need for adapted pre-processing of the network data and improved cooperation between IT security and IT administration departments.}

	abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have high requirements on both Quality of Service (QoS) and security due to their unique wireless features such as highly dynamic vehicles and unreliable channels. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize QoS and security because they are conflicting objectives that contend for limited network resources. Therefore, it is essential to make a tradeoff between them. In this study, a two-period game is designed to deal with the external decision-making of vehicles and internal resource competition of an individual vehicle, respectively. In the first-period external decision-making, each vehicle aims to maximize the throughput by constructing a cross-layer utility between Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layers. Moreover, the optimal transmission power of the external decision-making is obtained as the vehicle’s best strategy, which serves as an input in the next period. In the second-period internal decision-making, the conflicting objectives, i.e., QoS and security, inside an individual vehicle are viewed as two abstract players who compete for the vehicle’s limited resources. Furthermore, a general game is formulated for the internal decision-making to model the behaviors of the “communication player” in controlling the number of data blocks and that of the “security player” in deciding the hash length. The theoretical value of the Nash equilibrium of the internal game is derived and proved to be the two players’ optimal strategy composition. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed game enables a vehicle to obtain satisfactory QoS and security levels by dynamically adjusting its optimal strategies according to the situated network and traffic environment.}

	abstract = {Machine learning has seen a significant surge and uptake across many diverse applications. The high flexibility, adaptability, and computing capabilities it provides extend traditional approaches used in multiple fields including network operation and management. Numerous surveys have explored machine learning algorithms in the context of networking, such as traffic engineering, performance optimization, and network security. Many machine learning approaches focus on clustering, classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The innovation of this research, and the contribution of this paper lies in the detailed summary and comparison of learning-based congestion control approaches. Compared with traditional congestion control algorithms which are typically rule-based, capabilities to learn from historical experience are highly desirable. From the literature, it is observed that reinforcement learning is a crucial trend among learning-based congestion control algorithms. In this paper, we explore the performance of reinforcement learning-based congestion control algorithms and present current problems with reinforcement learning-based congestion control algorithms. Moreover, we outline challenges and trends related to learning-based congestion control algorithms.}

The harsh challenge for network operators is how to find the potential root causes from massive alarms in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for the root causes analysis. The solution includes a silent gap based approach to resolve the asynchrony of alarms, an algorithm for constructing Bayesian network (BN) based on sequentiality between alarms, and Bayesian inference to identify the root causes. The silent gap-based approach reduces preprocessing time while taking into account the validity. Also, the proposed BN-based mechanism allows the identification of the root causes with a higher accuracy. Experiments conducted on a real alarm dataset are provided to support the proposed methods. In addition, we propose a new algorithm processing framework.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) redefines the way how commodity and industrial tasks are performed every day. The integration of sensors, lightweight computation, and the proliferation of different wireless technologies on IoT platforms enable human beings to easily interact with their surrounding physical world thoroughly. With the recent rise of IoT, several different IoT platforms have been introduced for researchers and developers to ease the management and control of various IoT devices. In general, the IoT platforms act as a bridge between core IoT functionalities and users by providing APIs. Due to their wide variety of applications, IoT platforms are mostly unique in their architectures and designs. Thus, IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) are challenged with substantial configuration differences in the proper configuration, implementation, and protection of the IoT solutions. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth analysis of popular IoT platforms from different application domains. More specifically, we define a comprehensive evaluation framework that considers seven different technical comparison criteria: (1) topology design, (2) programming languages, (3) third-party support, (4) extended protocol support, (5) event handling, (6) security, and (7) privacy. Then, we use the framework to evaluate the different IoT platforms highlighting their distinguishing attributes on communications, security, and privacy. First, we describe the communication protocols supported by the different IoT platforms surveyed. Then, rather than uncovering novel threats affecting IoT, we aim to analyze how the different IoT platforms handle security and privacy vulnerabilities affecting the most common security services of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and access control. Further, we present possible solutions that these platforms could implement to strengthen security and privacy within the IoT solution. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of every IoT platform, so IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) can make an informed decision on the use of specific platforms to implement their IoT solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to evaluate different IoT platforms using the criteria defined in this work.}

The problem basically seeks to determine the best location scheme of sensors of different types and characteristics in a belt-shaped boundary area with the purpose of providing a sufficient level of field, point and barrier coverage against different types of intruders. To solve the problem, first, the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model developed by Karatas (2020) is used together with a commercial solver and a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), adapted to solve especially large-sized instances of the problem, is applied. Next, we compare the NSGA-II heuristic with the MILP solved via a commercial exact solver on a number of test instances. The experiment results suggest that the heuristic algorithm can produce a large number of diverse and high-quality solutions in very short computation times in comparison to the exact solver.}

	abstract = {More than ever, data networks have demonstrated their central role in the world economy, but also in the well-being of humanity that needs fast and reliable networks. In parallel, with the emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), efficient network algorithms considered too hard to be put in practice in the past now have a second chance to be considered again. In this context, as new networks will be deployed and current ones get significant upgrades, it is thus time to rethink the network dimensioning problem with protection against failures. In this paper, we consider a path-based protection scheme with the global rerouting strategy in which, for each failure situation, there may be a new routing of all the demands. Our optimization task is to minimize the needed amount of bandwidth. After discussing the hardness of the problem, we develop two scalable mathematical models that we handle using both Column Generation and Benders Decomposition techniques. Through extensive simulations on real-world IP network topologies and on randomly generated instances, we show the effectiveness of our methods: they lead to savings of 40 to 48% of the bandwidth to be installed in a network to protect against failures compared to traditional schemes. Finally, our implementation in OpenDaylight demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Its evaluation with Mininet shows that our solution provides sub-second recovery times, but the way it is implemented may greatly impact the amount of signaling traffic exchanged. In our evaluations, the recovery phase requires only a few tens of milliseconds for the fastest implementation, compared to a few hundreds of milliseconds for the slowest one.}

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides great opportunities to improve the network performance of Wide Area Networks (WANs). In Software-Defined WANs (SD-WANs), SDN controllers dynamically route flows based on network status by managing underlying switches. However, under controller failures in SD-WANs, existing solutions are unadaptable and thus cannot efficiently map offline switches, which were controlled by failed controllers, to active controllers. Thus, flows, which traverse offline switches, become offline and lose their programmability, which means they cannot be rerouted to accommodate to traffic variation. Consequently, the network programmability degrades. In this paper, we propose Matchmaker, an adaptive solution to recover offline flows under controller failures in SD-WANs. Matchmaker smartly changes the paths of some offline flows to adjust the control cost of offline switches based on given control ability of active controllers. As a result, Matchmaker can efficiently map offline switches to active controllers and increase the number of recovered flows. The simulation results show that Matchmaker outperforms existing solutions by increasing the number of recovered offline flows up to 45% under ATT topology and up to 77% under Belnet topology.}

	abstract = {Smart Grid networks use data collected from sensors in evaluating the current system state to make optimal resource distribution decisions and facilitate two-way energy exchange. Efficient and timely communication between smart grid assets using high efficiency and reliable Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for the last-mile can play a significantly important role. For this requirement, wireless mesh networking can be used to offer scalable, flexible and resilient wireless connectivity. Despite significant advantages and tremendous applications, smart grid NANs are vulnerable to security and reliability issues during electric power delivery. After being compromised by an adversary, cascading-failure-induced disasters may disrupt the power grid from a remote location; customer’s private information may become vulnerable if accessed illegally; the adversary may also compromise selected nodes (change the normal behavior of a node to malicious behavior) and thus fail the critical mission of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Moreover, the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism of IEEE 802.11e wireless technology can be leveraged for service differentiation based routing among flows of differing priorities. Routing decisions in mesh networks are based on routing metrics which have been the focus of research for the past decade. However, NANs offer a different implementation scenario from traditional mesh infrastructures and also necessitate the need for differentiated quality of service. In this paper, we discuss how state-of-the-art routing metrics have limitations for the NAN scenario, especially for EDCA based differentiated access. Moreover, we propose and design a secure and EDCA based contention-aware routing approach - iRoute, for 802.11e based wireless NANs which enables the selection of reliable routes that also satisfy QoS requirements (low contention, high throughput routes). Simulation-based performance evaluation of the proposed approach shows that it can provide significantly better performance in terms of throughput and delay for NAN communication.}

At present, it has become a trend to provide multi-view real-time environmental state for autonomous unmanned ground vehicles. And more and more object detection algorithms will be applied in autonomous driving. In the recent years, multi-sensor-based driving assistance systems have become a way to solve these problems. In this paper, we introduce a driving assistance system based on data fusion of multiple sensors for autonomous driving. On the one hand, six fisheye cameras and twelve ultrasonic radars are used to collect surround-view environmental state. On the other hand, this system uses a low-light camera and a lidar to provide forward-view environmental state. In the meantime, we design panoramic mosaic algorithm, surround-view data fusion algorithm and forward-view data fusion algorithm. Besides, object detection algorithm is used to provide forward-view detection results. This driving assistance system will advance research into autonomous unmanned ground vehicles.}

	abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies, more and more applications, such as autonomous vehicles and tele-medicine, become more sensitive to network latency and accuracy, which require routing schemes to be more flexible and efficient. In order to meet such urgent need, learning-based routing strategies are emerging as strong candidate solutions, with the advantages of high flexibility and accuracy. These strategies can be divided into two categories, centralized and distributed, enjoying the advantages of high precision and high efficiency, respectively. However, routing becomes more complex in dynamic IoT network, where the link connections and access states are time-varying, hence these learning-based routing mechanisms are required to have the capability to adapt to network changes in real time. In this paper, we designed and implemented both centralized and distributed Reinforcement Learning-based Routing schemes combined with Multi-optimality routing criteria (RLR-M). By conducting a series of experiments, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the results and arrived at the conclusion that the centralized is better suited to cope with dynamic networks due to its faster reconvergence (2.2\n×\nover distributed), while the distributed is better positioned to handle with large-scale networks through its high scalability (1.6\n×\nover centralized). Moreover, the multi-optimality routing scheme is implemented through model fusion, which is more flexible than traditional strategies and as such is better placed to meet the needs of IoT.}

	abstract = {5G wireless networks will be extremely dense, given the projected increase in the number of users and access points (APs), as well as heterogeneous, given the different types of APs and the applications being accessed by the users. In such challenging environments, efficient mobility management (MM), and specifically user association, will be critical to assist the 5G networks in provisioning the Quality of Service (QoS) of diverse applications 5G targets to serve. Whilst determining the most suitable AP for the users, multiple constraints such as available backhaul capacity, link latency, etc., will need to be accommodated for. Hence, to provide an optimal user association solution, in this paper we present a joint optimization framework, namely AURA-5G. Under this framework we formulate our user association strategy as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that aims to maximize the total sum rate of the network whilst optimizing the bandwidth assignment and access point selection. We analyze multiple active application profiles simultaneously, i.e. enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), in the network and study the performance of AURA-5G. Additionally, we provision a novel study on the multiple dual connectivity modes, wherein the user can be connected to either one macro cell and a possible small cell, or with any two favorable candidate access points. Utilizing the AURA-5G framework, we perform a novel comparative study of all the considered scenarios on the basis of total network throughput, performance against baseline scenario and system fairness. We show that the AURA-5G optimal solutions improve the performance of different network scenarios in terms of total network throughput (by 38\n×\n–690\n×\n) and system fairness as compared to the baseline scenario, which is a conventional user association solution. Further, we also present a fidelity analysis of the AURA-5G framework based on the backhaul utilization, latency compliance, convergence time distribution and solvability. And since, a given network cannot always guarantee to satisfy the future network loads and application constraints, we show that AURA-5G can be utilized by the operators/vendors to evaluate the myriad network re-dimensioning approaches for attaining a feasible and optimal solution. Henceforth, we then explore the possibility of network re-dimensioning and study its impact on system performance for scenarios where the performance of AURA-5G is severely impacted due to the extremely strict nature of the constraints imposed in the MILP.}

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) connect all components of the factory by constructing low-delay and high-reliability network (wired or wireless), realizing ubiquitous interconnection and smooth data communication, and finally forming an intelligent and efficient industrial ecosystem. There are three widely used device-to-device (D2D) techniques, including Bluetooth (BT), WiFi Hotspot (WFH) and WiFi Direct (WFD), which could provide wireless connections and communications for IIoT devices when the WLANs or cellular networks are unavailable. These D2D communication techniques have gained popularity with the emergence of offloading computing as well as edge computing. Existing studies investigate the outdated versions of BT and WFH, and there are no studies comprehensively comparing them together.}

	abstract = {Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are deployed in computer networks to identify intrusions. NIDSs analyse network traffic to detect malicious content generated from different types of cyber-attacks. Though NIDSs can classify frequent attacks correctly, their performance declines on infrequent network intrusions. This paper proposes LIO-IDS based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier and Improved One-vs-One technique for handling both frequent and infrequent network intrusions. LIO-IDS is a two-layer Anomaly-based NIDS (A-NIDS) that detects different network intrusions with high Accuracy and low computational time. Layer 1 of LIO-IDS identifies intrusions from normal network traffic by using the LSTM classifier. Layer 2 uses ensemble algorithms to classify the detected intrusions into different attack classes. This paper also proposes an Improved One-vs-One (I-OVO) technique for performing multi-class classification at the second layer of the proposed LIO-IDS. In contrast to the traditional OVO technique, the proposed I-OVO technique uses only three classifiers to test each sample, thereby reducing the testing time significantly. Also, oversampling techniques have been used at Layer 2 to enhance the detection ability of the proposed LIO-IDS. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Receiver Characteristics Operating (ROC) curve, Area Under ROC (AUC) values, training time and testing time for the NSL-KDD, CIDDS-001, and CICIDS2017 datasets. The proposed LIO-IDS shows significant improvement in the results as compared to its counterparts. High attack detection rates and short computational times make the proposed LIO-IDS suitable to be deployed in the real-world for network-based intrusion detection.}

	abstract = {“Big Tech” companies provide digital services used by billions of people. Recent developments, however, have shown that these companies often abuse their unprecedented market dominance for selfish interests. Meanwhile, decentralized applications without central authority are gaining traction. Decentralized applications critically depend on its users working together. Ensuring that users do not consume too many resources without reciprocating is a crucial requirement for the sustainability of such applications. We present ConTrib, a universal mechanism to maintain fairness in decentralized applications by accounting the work performed by peers. In ConTrib, participants maintain a personal ledger with tamper-evident records. A record describes some work performed by a peer and links to other records. Fraud in ConTrib occurs when a peer illegitimately modifies one of the records in its personal ledger. This is detected through the continuous exchange of random records between peers and by verifying the consistency of incoming records against known ones. Our simple fraud detection algorithm is highly scalable, tolerates significant packet loss, and exhibits relatively low fraud detection times. We experimentally show that fraud is detected within seconds and with low bandwidth requirements. To demonstrate the applicability of our work, we deploy ConTrib in the Tribler file-sharing application and successfully address free-riding behaviour. This two-year trial has resulted in over 160 million records, created by more than 94’000 users.}

	abstract = {The improvement of the energy efficiency and the reduction of the latency are two of the main goals of the next generation of Radio Access Networks (RANs). In order to achieve the latter, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising solution: it consists of the placement of computing and storage servers, directly at each Base Station (BS) of these networks. For the RAN energy efficiency, the dynamic activation of the BSs is considered an effective approach. In this paper, the caching feature of the MEC paradigm is considered in a portion of an heterogeneous RAN, powered by a renewable energy generator system, energy batteries and the power grid, where micro cell BSs are deactivated in case of renewable energy shortage. The performance of the caching in the RAN is analysed through simulations for different traffic characteristics, as well as for different capacity of the caches and different spread of it. New user association policies are proposed, in order to totally exploit the MEC technology and reduce the network energy consumption. Simulation results reveal that, thanks to this technology and the proposed methodologies, the experienced delay and the energy consumption drop, respectively, up to 60% and 40%.}

In the considered IIoT networks, all devices have some computational tasks to be computed with the help of some computational access points (CAPs). Although the performance of the IIoT networks can be optimized by using the resource allocation based on some centralized schemes, such solution is neither efficient nor flexible. To address this issue, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based federated learning algorithm to adjust three parameters: the task offloading ratio, bandwidth allocation ratio and transmit power. The optimization can minimize the normalized system cost, while reduce the communication cost in the optimization process. Moreover, simulation results are demonstrated to verify that the proposed federated framework can achieve an efficient and flexible management for the IIoT networks.}

Certain aspects of these network approaches may be exploited by players to gain unfair advantage or degrade the gaming experience for others. This paper lays the conceptual groundwork for networked videogames by describing common network architectures that facilitate competitive videogame play. These networking concepts are then evaluated for susceptibility to potential exploits. Finally, three current gaming titles are selected as case studies, using the principles established within this paper, to evaluate the effects of client-side exploits, latency, and state synchronization, on competitive game play.}
