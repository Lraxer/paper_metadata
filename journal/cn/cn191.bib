	abstract = {The market prediction for network deployments has positioned Software-Defined Networks (SDN) as the first of the options for changing local, transport, or cloud networks. Since the OpenFlow protocol gained traction and evolved in the last versions, the possibilities for expanding network capabilities to deploy custom services have risen considerably. With next-generation SDN (NG-SDN), flexibility has grown as data plane programming languages, such as P4, and Data-Control Plane Interface (DCPI) protocols like P4Runtime have appeared. Furthermore, the ability to program the data plane has opened the possibilities to develop new network telemetry approaches, such as In-band Network Telemetry (INT). A transition to partially incorporated SDN, also known as hybrid SDN, often involves considerable complexity, especially when legacy devices implement non-open standards and protocols. Therefore, incorporating programmable SDN devices and deploying network telemetry protocols on top of existing legacy devices is still challenging. This research focuses on deploying and integrating the INT protocol using programmable P4 switches over a hybrid SDN network. We describe and implement the required control plane applications and data plane configuration, and discuss the constraints that need to be managed so that P4 programmable switches can interact with the rest of the MPLS legacy devices. In this sense, we discuss P4 switch placement alternatives to maximize their performance and usability in a hybrid SDN network. Then, we validate the INT-based monitoring system by ensuring traffic forwarding using several INT header placements. In these tests, we demonstrate the feasibility of merging P4 switches running INT traffic and legacy devices, presenting the requirements to accomplish hybrid next-generation SDN (HNG-SDN) architectures. Besides, we provide new monitoring features, such as MPLS label verification, and we also use telemetry data to feed back traffic forwarding applications for traffic engineering purposes. We finally show the time that packets spend in the pipeline comparing different parsing and actions performed in different cases.}

	abstract = {Passive, device-free localization of a person exploiting the Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi signals is quickly becoming a reality. While this capability would enable new applications and services, it also raises concerns about citizens’ privacy. In this work, we propose a carefully-crafted obfuscating technique against one of such CSI-based localization methods. In particular, we modify the transmitted I/Q samples by leveraging an irreversible randomized sequence. I/Q symbol manipulation at the transmitter distorts the location-specific information in the CSI while preserving communication, so that an attacker can no longer derive information on user’s location. We test this technique against a Neural Network (NN)-based localization system and show that the randomization of the CSI makes undesired localization practically unfeasible. Both the localization system and the CSI randomization are implemented on real devices. The experimental results obtained in our laboratories show that the considered localization method works smoothly regardless of the environment, and that adding random information to the CSI prevents the localization, thus providing the community with a system that preserve location privacy and communication performance at the same time.}

With security features such as immutability and decentralization, blockchain is used to ensure the security of other applications and services. However, the security issues of the blockchain itself are always easily overlooked. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive literature survey on the security issues of the blockchain itself. From the perspective of architectural layering, each layer of the blockchain has its own corresponding security issues. We systematically review and analyze attacks against blockchains based on the basic framework of blockchain and conduct a state-of-the-art investigation of the corresponding countermeasures against those attacks. Furthermore, we conclude our observation and point out the future direction of blockchain security issues. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers with future development insights of blockchain security and to stimulate more efforts about blockchain security issues.}

Moreover, the proposal is also able to detect both unidirectional and bidirectional links between wireless devices. eHDDP has been thoroughly evaluated in different scenarios and exhibits good scalability properties since the number of required messages is proportional to the number of existing links in the network topology. Moreover, the obtained discovery and processing times give the opportunity to support scenarios with low mobility devices since the discovery times are in the range of hundreds of milliseconds.}

Viewport adaptive streaming is a promising technique to cope with these challenges by allocating more bitrates to a user’s constrained field of view and streaming appropriate representations based on the user’s estimated throughput and fixation point. A typical dynamic adaptive streaming system uses a Media Presentation Description (MPD) file to describe the sustainable bitrates of a period for different quality representations. However, video bitrates vary significantly along the temporal dimension for Variable Bitrate (VBR) videos. In addition to the throughput overestimate/underestimate problem, video bitrate overestimate/underestimate also affects the efficiency of Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms.}

	abstract = {In the near future, one of the promising concepts that are going to change undoubtedly the whole automobile industry, vehicular networking, and transportation sector is the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). IoVs open new opportunities in different services and applications to enhance road conditions, driver/passenger safety, transportation issues, non-safety applications, and especially for the avoidance of accidents. For reducing accidents, timely warning messages play an important role. For that, lightweight protocols are needed. Another important criterion to be ensured is ‘security’. Because the attackers always try to convey false warning messages that may result in serious issues or attacks. However, in the existing research, secure and lightweight protocols in IoVs are missing. Hence, in this paper, we designed a protocol, P2-SHARP (Privacy-Preserving Secure Hash-based Authentication and Revelation Protocol) using IoVs. In this scheme, secure transmission of local and global warning messages is done. For ensuring security, we have used several cryptographic operations. Security and performance analysis reveals the efficiency of P2-SHARP.}

	abstract = {Ultrasound based contactless sensing has the potential to extend the interactive range of mobile devices significantly. However, existing approaches either require multiple transceiver pairs that are not available on commercial mobile devices or can only recognize simple actions with one single stroke. These drawbacks significantly limit the practicability of prior work. This article presents UltraScr, an ultrasound sensing system that can recognize the sophisticated gestures with multiple strokes (e.g., writing a capital letter) using just a single sound transceiver pair. To do so, UltraScr first uses the frequency attenuation profile (FAP) to capture the subtle hand movements. It then employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the subtle hand movements’ discriminative features to build an accurate ultrasound sensing system. We go further by exploiting the rejection classification method (RCM) and incremental learning to improve the robustness of our sensing system in the end-user environment. We evaluate UltraScr by applying it to gesture recognition across different scenarios and users. Extensive experimental results show that while using only one transceiver pair, the performance of UltraScr is comparable to the multi-transceiver-paired implementations. We show that UltraScr is robust to the change of external conditions (i.e., different humidity and battery) and can work effectively on a wide range of locations, but requires 3\n×\nfewer training samples compared to the state-of-the-art.}

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) provides programmable control and centralized management in data centers, making it a popular architecture. The large scale of networks has required to propose the geographical distribution of logically centralized control plane to achieve scalability and reliability. For solving the load imbalance among multiple controllers associated with the statically configured control plane, a switch migration mechanism is proposed to admit dynamic load balancing. Many studies have been carried out for solving the control plane load balancing problem based on the switch migration mechanism. However, previous studies focus on migrating the switches when the controllers are overloaded, thereby, wasting time in the switch migration phase and resulting in high latency. To address these problems, we propose the Assessing Profit Of Prediction (APOP) scheme, a load-balancing strategy in the multiple-controllers control plane based on the overloaded state prediction and profit assessment. We introduce Taylor’s formula to predict the flow change in the network and assess the profit of migrating switches in advance, in order to decrease the migration time and minimize the harmful effects during the migration phase. The result of simulation experiments shows that our scheme performs effectively in reducing the migration cost in control plane load balancing.}

However, existing data trading platforms are not fully trusted. Such platforms face the problems of a single point of failure (SPOF), opaque transactions, uncontrollability, untraceability, and issues of data privacy. Several blockchain-based big data trading methods have been proposed; however, they do not adequately address the security issues introduced by dishonesty in the data provider and data agent or the fairness of data revenue distribution and price bargaining. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized data trading system in which data trading is completed by smart contract-based data matching, price negotiation, and reward assigning. Moreover, the proposed data trading system evaluates the data quality on the basis of three metrics, records the evaluation results in a side-chain, and distributes the data users’ application revenue to the data provider according to the evaluated data quality. We verify the security, usability, and efficiency of the proposed big data trading system.}

With several drones flying in different zones to carry out specified tasks, the IoD can be beneficial to gather the real time data for interpretation by the users. However, the data access is carried out through an open channel and battery operated drones. Therefore, the drones’ security and privacy are crucial for accomplishing mission-critical, safety-critical, or surveillance operations. In 2020, Bera et al. presented a certificate based access control scheme for securing the IoD access and argued the scheme’s security through formal and informal methods. However, the analysis presented in this paper shows that the scheme of Bera et al. does not provide anonymity and is insecure against multiple threats, including drone impersonation, the man in the middle, and replay attacks. We then designed a generic certificate based access control scheme to provide inter-drone and drone to ground station access control/authentication in the IoD domain (GCACS-IoD). The GCACS-IoD is provably secure against the known attacks and provides anonymity. GCACS-IoD extends security while preserving computation and communication efficiencies.}

	abstract = {With the ambitious plans of renewal and expansion of industrialization in many countries, the efficiency, agility and cost savings potentially resulting from the application of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are drawing attentions. Although blockchain and machine learning technologies (especially deep learning and deep reinforcement learning) may provide the next promising use case for IIoT, they are working in an adversarial way to some extent. While blockchain facilitates the data collection that is critical for machine learning under the premise of data regulation rules like privacy protection, it may suffer from privacy leakage due to big data analytics with the help of machine learning. To make machine learning and blockchain useful and practical for diversified services in industrial sectors, it is of paramount importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the development of both technologies in the context of IIoT. To this end, in this paper we summarize and analyze the applications of blockchain and machine learning in IIoT from three important aspects, i.e., consensus mechanism, storage and communication. This survey provides a deeper understanding on the security and privacy risks of the key components of a blockchain from the perspective of machine learning, which is useful in the design of practical blockchain solutions for IIoT. In addition, we provide useful guidance for future research in the area by identifying interesting open problems that need to be addressed before large-scale deployments of IIoT applications are practicable.}

Key architectural aspects of blockchain solutions, like the platforms’ software and network setups, the consensus protocols used, as well as smart contracts, are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and assure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On the other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a challenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the underlying consensus protocols’ performance and fault tolerance is also considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our reference IoT domain.}

	abstract = {Modern malware is becoming hard to spot since attackers are increasingly adopting new techniques to elude signature- and rule-based detection mechanisms. Among the others, steganography and information hiding can be used to bypass security frameworks searching for suspicious communications between processes or exfiltration attempts through covert channels. Since the array of potential carriers is very large (e.g., information can be hidden in hardware resources, various multimedia files or network flows), detecting this class of threats is a scarcely generalizable process and gathering multiple behavioral information is time-consuming, lacks scalability, and could lead to performance degradation.}

	abstract = {Ransomware has presented itself as one of the most critical computer threats in the past few years. Along with the increase of user’s data on portable devices, ransomware has also vastly targeted smartphones. In this paper, we present RansomCare, a data-centric detection and mitigation method against smartphone crypto-ransomware. RansomCare can detect and neutralize crypto-ransomware in real-time on smartphones employing dynamic and lightweight static analysis. It is capable of recovering user’s lost files while preserving data privacy, thanks to its backup before modification or deletion. Our solution mainly relies on the structure of the user’s data and data entropy for the detection of crypto-ransomware. We assessed RansomCare on two datasets of recent smartphone crypto-ransomware and performed experiments to evaluate its detection time, accuracy, and performance overhead. We also compared our work with some state-of-the-art commercial and academic solutions. The results reveal that RansomCare is capable of fast detection of crypto-ransomware on smartphones with high accuracy and zero data loss.}

	abstract = {Defending networks is becoming more challenging due to the growing number and variety of cyber threats. On the other hand, network security professionals have new technologies and tools at their disposal. This paper focuses on a few of these technologies and investigates new ways to take advantage of them. To this end, we present Citadel, a novel security system utilizing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to construct automated defense solutions in software-defined networking (SDN) environments. Citadel also incorporates network function virtualization (NFV) and service function chaining (SFC) to achieve flexible, cost-efficient, and proactive network defense. We examine CTI data to extract common attacker models and design security services as virtual network functions chained together using SFC to counter these threats. The modular and extensible nature of Citadel makes it suitable for incremental deployment in networks. Besides, we propose a new CTI data model to use as an extension of the existing CTI models for better compatibility with automated network defense. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposals are applicable and effectively facilitate the management of agile defense in SDN/NFV-enabled networks.}

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a Software Defined Networking (SDN) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) along with Selective Logging for IP Traceback. We achieve a detection accuracy of 95.98% on the full NSL-KDD dataset and 87.74% on the selected sub-features of the dataset. Detection of anomalous traffic and network intrusion is done during the PACKET_IN event at the controller and then again by fetching the flow statistics from the OpenFlow switches at regular intervals. Selective logging of suspicious packets/flows during a PACKET_IN event enables an IP traceback to be performed in the eventuality of an attack which can be initiated by a network admin using an HTTP-based web console. This approach gains significance given that it is practically impossible to achieve 100% attack detection accuracy. Moreover, it is not always correct to take punitive action against packets of a traffic flow, solely based on a detection of a possible threat which may result in blocking or dropping of genuine packets. In the proposed scheme, logging is performed selectively at the controller and not at the switches, achieving significant savings in terms of overall memory resources. Moreover logging is performed using the in-memory structure at the controller thereby enhances the performance of the logging operation over traditional file-based database by 9.76%. Finally, we have chosen this approach because (i) SDN provides a centralized architecture for detection analysis and logging (ii) SVM provides decent detection accuracy without much computation overhead (iii) Selective Logging provides about 90% to 95% savings in terms of overall memory resources and (iv) IP traceback provides the ability to track the actual source of the packets in the eventuality of an attack.}

	abstract = {Recent advances in networking and mobile technologies such as 5G, long-term evolution (LTE), LiFi, wireless broadband (WiBro), WiFi-Direct, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) have paved the way for intelligent and smart services. With an average of more than 6.5 devices per person, a plethora of applications are being developed especially related to healthcare. Although, current edge devices such as smartphone and smartwatch are becoming increasingly more powerful and more affordable, there are certain tasks such as those involving machine learning that require higher computational resources, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption in the case of edge devices. Offloading tasks to co-located edge nodes such as fog (a cloud-like localized, smaller resource pool), or a femto-cloud (integration of multiple edge nodes) is one viable solution to address the issues such as performing compute-intensive tasks, and managing energy consumption. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and becoming a pandemic has also made a case for edge computing (involving smartphone, wearables, health sensors) for the detection of symptoms to quarantine potential carriers of the virus. We focus on how various forms of smart and opportunistic healthcare (oHealth) can be provided by leveraging edge computing that makes use of a machine learning-based approach. We apply k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector classification (SVC) algorithms on real data trace for the healthcare and safety-related scenarios we considered. The empirical results obtained provide useful insights into machine learning-based task offloading in edge computing.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital world, digital rights management (DRM) becomes increasingly important. Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) schemes provide suitable solutions for flexible fine-grained access control in DRM. However, there are two accountable problems unsolved when applying existing ABE schemes to DRM directly: illegal authorization and key disclosure. Illegal authorization means that some attribute authorities might collude with users and issue attribute keys to unauthorized users illegally. Key disclosure denotes that some users might maliciously expose their attribute keys to the public. Both the above problems could lead to unauthorized users accessing digital content, which is extremely harmful to DRM.}
