	abstract = {The edge computing model is an approach to Internet of Things (IoT) architectures based on the redistribution of services and infrastructure from centralized clouds to locations closer to IoT devices. The Web of Things (WoT) is another important IoT trend, currently led by the W3C, which aims at solving the IoT interoperability problem by adopting proven technologies and patterns from the Web. The design and validation of IoT deployments based on these paradigms is a complex task that involves multiple services, heterogeneous hardware and diverse communication technologies. Testing such projects in real world conditions usually requires a significant investment of resources. There are simulation tools that can assist in this process with much lower barriers of entry, however, they involve the designer making modelling assumptions that are not always representative of the real systems. This work presents an emulation tool for IoT projects based on the edge computing model that is able to seamlessly scale horizontally by leveraging container orchestration (Docker swarm mode). Furthermore, the W3C WoT model is included as a first-class citizen, enabling the designer to model all actors in the system as Things. The tool can run the real production code with minimal modifications and provides meaningful insights into the behaviour of the proposed architecture. This knowledge serves to rapidly iterate the optimization process, simplifying design issues and the detection of bottlenecks before committing to a real deployment in the field. A real-world scenario is also emulated in order to demonstrate its capabilities and validate its contribution.}

	abstract = {The growing number of IoT edge devices have inflicted a change in the cyber-attack space. The DDoS attacks, in particular, have significantly increased in magnitude and intensity. Of the existing DDoS solutions, while the destination-based defense mechanisms incur high false positives due to the seemingly legitimate nature of the attack traffic, defense mechanisms implemented at the source alone do not suffice due to the lack of visibility into ongoing DDoS attacks. This paper proposes a distributed DDoS detection and mitigation framework, SmartDefense, based on edge computing approaches towards detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks at and near the source. By mitigating the DDoS attacks near the source, SmartDefense significantly reduces unnecessary bandwidth otherwise consumed by DDoS traffic going from residential edge networks to the ISP edge network.}

	abstract = {Caching the most likely to be requested content at the base stations in a cooperative manner can facilitate direct content delivery without fetching content from the remote content server and thus alleviate the user-perceived latency, reduce the burden on backhaul and minimize the duplicated content transmissions. Content popularity plays a vital role, and it drives caching on edge. In the literature, earlier works considered the content popularity either known earlier or obtained on prediction. However, the content popularity is time-varying and unknown in reality, so the above assumption makes it less practical. Therefore, this paper considers the cooperative cache replacement problem in a realistic scenario where the edge nodes are unaware of the content popularity in mobile edge networks. To address this problem, the main contribution of this paper is to design an intelligent content update mechanism using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning in dynamic environments. With the goal of maximizing the saved delay with deadline and capacity constraints, we formulate the cache replacement problem as Integer linear programming problem. Considering the dynamic nature of the content popularity, high dimensional parameters, and for an intelligent caching decision, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and present an efficient deep reinforcement learning algorithm by embedding the long short-term memory network (LSTM) into a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient formalism. The LSTM inclusion reduces the instability produced by partial observability of the environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative caching mechanism significantly improves the performance in terms of reward, acceleration ratio and hit ratio compared with existing mechanisms.}

	abstract = {6G system targets many emerging industrial verticals, including industry 4.0 and autonomous driving, with extreme service requirements and a high amount of resources, which further overload mobile networks. These industrial verticals are characterized by intense, continuous, and conflicting requirements that harden the mission of the next generation. To achieve the coveted objectives and deal with these shortcomings, the end-to-end network communication should be self-managed, self-orchestrated, and self-optimized, including network edges and clouds. Besides software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) that offer network softwarization, elasticity, and flexibility, Machine Learning (ML) is expected to play a vital role in the next-generation of networks. The decisions made at the orchestration plan should be quick besides their accuracy and optimality to overcome the foreseeable challenges. In this paper, we propose a generic framework, named Deep Learning Optimization for Service Function Chaining (DLO-SFC), that provides fast optimal configurations using deep learning techniques and network optimization. We have designed the proposed framework to be generic and orthogonal to a specific use case. Indeed, the framework can be leveraged for any networking configuration and orchestration problems with a slight modification. We evaluate our proposed framework performances showing that it reduces the OPEX costs while optimizing the execution time.}

	abstract = {Enterprises are increasingly outsourcing their computing needs to cloud computing. This dependency on cloud services requires uninterrupted and high availability of services. However, achieving the availability of services is not always possible because cloud services may need to be temporarily suspended for several reasons. These include real-time maintenance of cloud infrastructure, load balancing of services, deployment of countermeasures against cyber attacks, power management, proactive fault tolerance, or resource utilization, etc. The unavailability of critical cloud services may negatively impact the business model of cloud providers because clients would likely be unhappy with frequent service interruptions. One solution to this service interruption is real-time Live Machine Migration (LVM) — a virtualization technique in network-based systems involving migrating virtual machines (VMs) from one host to another. The key objective of LVM is to avoid or minimize the interruption of application services running on a VM during the migration from a source to a destination host server. To achieve this objective, some challenges need to be tackled. An optimal LVM approach first needs to address the challenge of simultaneously minimizing downtime, network resource usage for migration, and total migration time. Several optimization techniques have been proposed for enhancing the performance of LVM. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the LVM challenges particularly focusing on memory content migration and the proposed solutions to overcome the identified challenges and their limitations. The paper also points out some open research issues and future directions towards optimizing LVM.}

	abstract = {Due to the exploding traffic demands and the diversity of novel applications requiring extensive computation and radio resources, research has been active to devise mechanisms for responding to these challenges. Mobile edge computing (MEC) and device-to-device (D2D) computation task offloading are expected to play a major role in serving devices with limited capabilities, and thus enhance system performance. In this work, we propose a joint computing, communication and cost-aware task offloading optimization problem aiming at maximizing the number of completed tasks, while minimizing energy consumption and monetary cost in D2D-enabled heterogeneous MEC networks. Our proposed scheme allows partial offloading where a requester mobile terminal offloads different parts of its data task simultaneously to multiple peer mobile terminals (MTs), edge servers and cloud. We formulate and solve the optimal allocation strategy then decompose the problem into two sub-problems in an attempt to reduce its complexity. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that generates high performance results and can be applied for large-scale networks. Compared to conventional and state-of-the-art system models, results show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and provide useful insights into the tradeoffs between the number of completed tasks, energy consumption and monetary cost.}

Accurate wireless channel estimation plays a crucial role for provision of high quality of service to billions of wireless devices in current and future wireless networks. Our proposed approach uses contemporary ML technique, Federated Learning (FL), in conjunction with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to optimise the WCE problem. Our proposed approach leverages the local user wireless channel information to locally optimise the objective at users and then uses this locally optimised information at the server to optimise the global objective function. The proposed approach is referred to as joint Federated Server Learning and Federated Client Learning (j-FSL-FCL) in the paper. We formulate the WCE problem with a novel loss function to be used for the optimisation problem. To evaluate the performance of our proposed j-FSL-FCL approach (with and without SGD), we consider a Down Link (DL) wireless channel model with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) setting that mimic closely to the wireless channel for 5G and beyond wireless channel models. The performance measuring parameters for j-FSL-FCL are to minimise the difference between actual and estimated wireless channel parameters (channel strength and direction). We compare the results of our proposed approach with the other techniques in the literature based on Least Squares (LS), Linear Regression (LR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution quickly when used with SGD compared to other existing techniques. It is also shown that the efficiency of the proposed approach for WCE problem is much higher compared to other LS and MSE based techniques. Finally, we present some interesting futuristic applications of FL in the context of 5G and beyond wireless networks.}

However, location privacy is at stake in such platforms because consumers retrieve content by specifying the plaintext names of the locations of their interest (LOIs). Previous studies on IP have leveraged\nk\n-anonymity of location offered by a trusted proxy called an anonymizer to hide LOIs. Specifically, an anonymizer sends content requests to\nk\nlocations in a location anonymity set, which comprises an LOI and the other dummy locations. This technique can be applied to ICN; however, two problems need to be solved: the adversary models are unrealistic and the requirements for a location anonymity set have been defined in ad-hoc manners. In this study, we assume a semi-honest anonymizer and define the requirements rigorously using the notions of entropy and\nt\n-closeness. Next, we design an architecture for location privacy protection and an algorithm for location anonymity set generation. Finally, we evaluate the overhead incurred by our architecture and the quality of generated location anonymity sets through experiments under a realistic scenario. Our results indicate that our architecture and algorithm offer strong location privacy with marginal overhead.}

	abstract = {The proliferation of wireless devices and their ever increasing influence on our day-to-day life is very evident and seems irreplaceable. This exponential growth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service (QoS) had spawned the concept of cross-layer optimization several years ago. The primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict boundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. The objective was to enable information flow between layers which then can be leveraged to optimize the network’s performance across the layers mitigating the challenges due to scarce resources while meeting QoS demands. The initial decade focused on establishing the theoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the effectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of software defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its added flexibility. Even with the immense interest and progress in this area of research, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions designed in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first present an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature with emphasis on their maturity scale. Next, we briefly discuss how a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), low SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) embedded SDR (e-SDR) was transformed into a standalone, fieldable transceiver. Thereafter, we provide the software design ethos that focuses on efficiency and flexibility such that the optimization objectives and cross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly. To demonstrate our claims, we provide results from extensive outdoor over-the-air experiments in various settings with up to 10-node network topologies. The results from the field trials demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic routing capability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature, a COTS e-SDR has been leveraged to successfully design a cross-layer optimized transceiver that is capable of forming an ad hoc network that provides high throughput and high reliability in a ruggedized, weatherized, and fieldable form factor.}

	abstract = {DNS is often used by attackers as a covert channel for data exfiltration, also known as DNS tunneling. Since the plaintext DNS lookup leads to privacy issues, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has recently been standardized and deployed. DoH encapsulates DNS in HTTPS to encrypt DNS traffic between clients and recursive resolvers. Attackers can also use DoH for subtle data exfiltration. However, existing DNS tunneling detection methods for plaintext DNS are usually ineffective for DoH tunneling. In this paper, we propose a method to detect DoH-based data exfiltration. We analyze TLS fingerprints of DoH clients and build classifiers with flow-based features to detect DoH tunneling. Our experiment discusses the influence of various factors on the detection results in detail, including adversarial considerations by exploring the potential evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, and it is very difficult to evade detection due to the difficulty of feature imitation. Besides, our method can still provide the defender with helpful information for attack investigation even if the attacker evades detection.}

	abstract = {In remote monitoring edge-based IoT applications, high latency caused by the mobility of a sensor device can cause serious consequences such as inaccurate analysis and low quality of services. Therefore, it is required to have mobility support approaches that help reduce latency while maintaining a connection, high quality of service, and energy efficiency. However, the number of mobility support approaches for high data rate IoT applications using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is limited and they have some disadvantages. For example. they have not been designed for edge-based applications where local computation occurs frequently. Many of them have not been implemented and tested in daily working environments with actual mobility cases. They have not comprehensively analyzed the mobility latency and energy consumption of sensor devices. Hence, this paper presents three possible mobility support approaches including passive and active handover mechanisms for edge-based IoT applications using high data rate BLE5. These approaches based on passive and active handover mechanisms are implemented and tested in an office environment. The results of latency and power consumption of a sensor device via many experiments are measured and analyzed. The results show that the presented mobility support approaches maintain the connection during mobility with a latency of around 900ms for many cases. The results also show that using BLE5’s LE 2M physical layer consumes less power than using LE 1M physical layer. Specifically, it can reduce energy consumption when sending or receiving larger data sizes at faster rates.}

	abstract = {How to get the node position, as a hotter topic in the field of wireless communication, is the primary problem to be solved in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The DV-Hop positioning scheme is a kind of range-free positioning scheme, which has been favored by researchers in recent years. However, the original DV-Hop scheme faces the shortcoming of low positioning precision and stability. To ameliorate the positioning capability of the DV-Hop, an enhanced DV-Hop scheme based on the spring model and reliable beacon node set has been presented in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between nodes in the network is abstracted as a spring model, and the distance between unknown nodes and beacon nodes is corrected by comprehensively considering the influence of each beacon node from the physical phenomenon of force vector decomposition. After that, based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, the reliable beacon nodes with smaller distance deviation to the unknown node are picked out to compute the unknown node coordinates, rather than all beacon nodes participating in the calculation. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on distance accuracy and positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed positioning scheme outperforms better than original DV-Hop and other existing improved schemes under different scenarios.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a relay-assisted non-standalone (NSA) 5G network, where source (S) intends to transmit signals to users by assistance with a relay R, which receives the signals from S operating in microwave frequency and transfers to target users by utilizing steerable-beam non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme operating in millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency. The steerable-beam NOMA scheme can flexibly switch between single-beam and multi-beam modes according to angle difference of users in NOMA group, i.e., when at least one angle difference is smaller than mmWave beamwidth of main lobe, R adopts a single-beam for achieving NOMA transmission, otherwise multi-beam scheme is used to complete NOMA transmission. For insight into the performance of steerable-beam NOMA scheme, we analyze the coverage probability of the system in-depth for deriving the analytical expressions and approximately closed-form solutions of target users’ coverage probabilities within a NOMA group, where the first user\nU\no\nis selected with the shortest distance to the S and the paired user\nU\np\nis determined based on the minimum angle difference to the first user. However, when R adopts multi-beam, the user with the smallest angle difference to the\nU\no\nmay not be the best paired user due to the influence of path attenuation and antenna allocation. We then propose a two-stage scheme to obtain optimal user pairing by jointly considering the angle, distance, and sum-rate, while optimizing power allocation subject to maximize the sum-rate. Simulation results illustrate the coverage performance of the system with steerable-beam NOMA scheme for different parameters, and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed two-stage strategy offers a significant improvement in terms of average sum-rate compared to other schemes.}

	abstract = {The self-sufficient Smart Grid (SG) with two-way data communication among its constituents is proposed as a remedy to the shortcomings of the traditional power grid. Due to their low cost and ease of deployment along with the advanced communication capabilities they offer, WSNs are seen as an important technology for SG applications. To this end, it is important to design energy-efficient communication protocols to achieve a long network lifetime while maintaining the desired coverage level. In this paper, we consider the case where the transmission paths are re-adapted to topology changes as long as the required coverage level and connectivity to the base station can be maintained with the current set of sensors with positive residual energy. We first propose a novel 0–1 mixed-integer programming (MIP) model, and then present two alternative 0–1 MIP models optimizing the network behavior in unit time decomposition with an emphasis on energy consumption. Our study is unique in terms of including topology adaptation due to energy depletion within a holistic solution framework based on optimization methods. We avoid the traditional time until the first sensor dies metric and allow the WSN to continue to function optimally as long as the predetermined coverage level and connectivity to the BS can be achieved with the remaining sensors. We observe that network lifetime can be increased significantly even after a one-time reorganization. Moreover, we analyze how the solutions of the three models differ in terms of lifetime and coverage level. As a side contribution, we show that maximizing the time until the first sensor dies is equivalent to minimizing the energy consumption of the most used sensor for the classical single-period problem, which is not necessarily true when there is an adaptation to a topology change. Hence, we provide a practical tool to determine the theoretical upper bound on the network lifetime with coverage and connectivity-based QoS requirements.}
