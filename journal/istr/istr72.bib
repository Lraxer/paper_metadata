	abstract = {One of the essential technologies in the medical industry for achieving high performance and accuracy is the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT). The MIoT technology processes a large amount of patient information in real-time. And therefore, it poses a high risk of leaking personal information. Furthermore, as data is sent over public networks, security is critical in MIoT. To overcome the above issues, we developed a designated tester-based Certificateless Public-key Encryption with Conjunctive Keyword search for cloud-based MIoT in dynamic multi-user environment (dCL-PECK). This study explores three features: (1). A secure channel is not necessary to transfer the data from the data-user (i.e., data owner or data receiver) to the designated tester (i.e., medical cloud server) and allows only the designated tester to execute the test algorithm. (2). Data is encrypted only once for multiple data users and supports conjunctive keyword search. (3). Users are added and revoked dynamically. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is provably secure under ciphertext indistinguishable against inside and outside adversaries and trapdoor indistinguishable against outside adversaries. Finally, theoretical and experimental analyses have been performed, demonstrating that the proposed system is better than similar Certificateless Keyword Search (CLKS) systems. As a result, we feel that it is suitable for cloud-based MIoT.}

	abstract = {With the coming up of social network sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc information sharing has seen tremendous growth in the past few years. Although people wish to interact with like-minded persons through such platforms, there is a lot of personal information about individuals that need to be secured. To maintain the privacy of sensitive information in a social network, efficient privacy-preserving techniques like k-anonymization, randomization, generalization, etc., are used. The majority of the proposed techniques apply edge editing and clustering based methods for creating k-anonymized social network graphs. Since these techniques distort the original properties of the graph to a great extent, various enhancements have been proposed which consider the addition of noisy nodes as one of the alternatives. In this paper, an improved version of k-degree-anonymization on social network graph has been provided which uses the hybridization of Neural Network and SVM, called NeuroSVM where average path length of the graph is preserved and addition of noisy nodes and noisy edges is reduced significantly. The proposed technique is evaluated on various parameters which include Average path length, Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Information loss. It has been experimentally proved that the proposed technique has less distortion in average path length as compared to existing techniques. The accuracy of the proposed technique is more than 75% and information loss is also reduced.}

	abstract = {Today, Bluetooth technology has become the primary means of short-distance. In the Bluetooth protocol stack, the Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) specifies three methods to provide authentication, Out-of-Band, Numeric Comparison, and Passkey Entry. All three schemes require extra or additional channel assistance in addition to the Bluetooth wireless channel during the authentication process. At the same time, attacks against the Bluetooth pairing protocol have gradually increased, and some attacks (e.g., Tap’n Ghost) targeting those extra channels have attracted the attention of the Bluetooth Association. Current attacks place new demands on Bluetooth SSP security and thus require new models to formalize these threats. Troncoso and Hale proposed the CYBORG model to address this challenge by modeling the channel between users and devices in detail and defining rich attacker capabilities and freshness rules. They also proposed an improved Passkey Entry protocol, Dual-Passkey Entry. However, the CYBORG model does not cover current attacks and threats as they claim, and it only focused on the Passkey Entry protocol. We formalized the threat models to clarify and bridge the gaps in the protocol design and practical requirements of the original CYBORG model. Attackers of Confidential- and Authenticated-extra channels are designed to deal with the settings in threats and protocol requirements. The analysis results show weaknesses and insecurities of SSP protocols.}

However, the genetic sequences involve people’s privacy, confirming an individual’s identification and even disease information. This work proposes a secure genotype imputation model, which uses a linear regression model and the homomorphic encryption scheme over ciphertext to impute missing genotypes. The inference model is trained with float plaintext parameters, which are round into integers to avoid high complexity homomorphic evaluation on float number operations without bootstrapping operations. Even though the rounding parameters in the inference model are not the same as those in the trained model, We find that it will no effect on the outcome of the homomorphic prediction. Thus, a high-efficiency genotype imputation inference model over the ciphertext is obtained while keeping the high-security level. The simulation results indicate that the accuracy of the secure inference model is almost the same as the original model trained on float parameters. The secure inference model’s accuracy is 98.6% for a single genotype.}

A dynamic contributory group key agreement (DCGKA) protocol generates a session key based on contributions of all group members and allows a member to dynamically join or leave this group. Although current DCGKA can resist passive attacks, it cannot resist positive attacks like the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. In this paper, we propose a dynamic contributory Group Key Agreement protocol by using Short Signature (called GKA-SS) which uses bilinear map to accomplish the signature and the verification processes. The formal security proof shows that our protocol can resist both active and passive attacks under random oracle model. The informal security analysis indicates that our protocol can obtain backward secrecy, forward secrecy, etc. Besides, we analyze the communication and computation cost of our protocol and simulate it with pypbc library. As compared with TGECDH, our protocol is 2.4 times faster in join phase and 29 times faster in leave phase, when\np\nis 512 bits,\nq\nis 160 bits and group size is 256.}

	abstract = {Trust is an essential security component and plays a crucial role in building secure information processing systems. Many organizations have adopted zero-trust principles in their security mechanisms, especially in Cloud Computing environments, where everything is presumed to be semi-honest and untrustworthy until proven otherwise. This is in blunt contrast to the traditional perimeter-security model, where it is presumed that the malicious actors are always outside the perimeter of the trusted network, and trustworthy users are always inside the network. One of the most significant challenges with the notion of trust is that till now more focus was put on the subjective aspect of trust which was challenging to evaluate and verify. There is an urgent need to address the objective and verifiable notion of trust, especially in the systems involving Federated Learning as in Cloud environments. We propose a Rich model based zero-trust security framework for trust verification of SaaS and employ machine learning functionalities to perform multimedia data analytics over the service processing behaviors for improved visibility into service operations and risks. Our proposed model relies heavily on the features extracted form Federated learning on the data of different cloud service users that is subjected to AI processing. We utilized the Rich models for feature extraction of large scale multimedia data for monitoring cloud service behavior and employed Ensemble classifier for analyzing the data features and employed majority voting of individual learners for decision making. The experiments performed on the standard dataset proved that the proposed model successfully monitored and analyzed the behavior of cloud services for validating the legitimacy of trusted SaaS and detecting any trust violations.}

	abstract = {Palm vein biometrics is a potential authentication technique. In addition to the inherent liveness property, the palm vein pattern exhibits high authentication accuracy and anti-spoofing capability due to the dense vein pattern and broad coverage area. However, the large palm size increases the acquisition device’s cost and size and significantly hinders device miniaturization, resulting in the limited applicability of palm vein biometrics. A solution to this problem is to restrict the area of the palm vein pattern required for authentication. Towards this, in this paper, we explore the potential of partial palm vein patterns for authentication. Through experimentation with varied-sized partial palm vein images, we show that\n(\n1\n4\n)\nth\nof palm vein pattern is adequate for individual authentication. Based on this observation, we propose an authentication framework using partial palm vein patterns. The system takes\n(\n1\n4\n)\nth\npalm vein pattern as input in both the enrollment and authentication phase, and partial to full image matching is performed. We propose a rule-based image acquisition and stitching method for accurately converting partial images into full images during enrollment. The proposed partial palm vein authentication framework using elastic matching achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.0202%, 0.1919%, and 0.2282% on the CASIA, VERA, and PUT datasets, respectively. Experiments using deep feature matching also gave comparable results to elastic matching.}

In this work, traditional key-generation mechanisms have been combined with meta-heuristic techniques to derive new key generation models in chaos-based image cryptography. Initially, one among the key-strings has been generated using the logistic map approach that is known for its ability to produce effective chaotic performance. In this paper, the chaotic effect of the key-string generated by the logistic map has further been enhanced by the application of differential evolution (DE), a population-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. This improved key sequence is used to produce chaotic a map which has been applied to images for diffusion operation. The confusion operation on the other hand is performed by the transposition process using another key-string produced by the application of another meta-heuristic technique, namely, Genetic Algorithm (GA). After thorough experimental works, the results have been compared with the state-of-the-art and it is observed that the approach proposed here provides strong cryptographic behavior in terms of information entropy, key sensitivity, robustness against noise, and hereby stands against all kinds of statistical and differential attacks including brute force.}

	abstract = {Machine learning is key for automated detection of malicious network activity to ensure that computer networks and organizations are protected against cyber security attacks. Recently, there has been growing interest in the domain of adversarial machine learning, which explores how a machine learning model can be compromised by an adversary, resulting in misclassified output. Whilst to date, most focus has been given to visual domains, the challenge is present in all applications of machine learning where a malicious attacker would want to cause unintended functionality, including cyber security and network traffic analysis. We first present a study on conducting adversarial attacks against a well-trained network traffic classification model. We show how well-crafted adversarial examples can be constructed so that known attack types are misclassified by the model as benign activity. To combat this, we present a novel defensive strategy based on hierarchical learning to help reduce the attack surface that an adversarial example can exploit within the constraints of the parameter space of the intended attack. Our results show that our defensive learning model can withstand crafted adversarial attacks and can achieve classification accuracy in line with our original model when not under attack.}

Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown a promising potential for fraud detection tasks, where fraudulent nodes are identified by aggregating the neighbors that share similar feedbacks and relations. However, crafty fraudsters can trivially get around such detection via seemingly legitimate feedbacks once connected to legitimate users. In this paper, we leverage Relational Density Theory and propose a Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HA-GNN) for fraud detection, which incorporates weighted adjacency matrices across different relations against camouflage. This is motivated by the fact that there are dense connections between fraudsters who collectively participate in fraud activities. Specifically, we design a relation attention module to reflect the tie strength between two nodes, while a neighborhood attention module to capture the long-range structural affinity associated with the graph. We generate node embeddings by aggregating information from local/long-range structures and original node features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves 3.21 – 9.97% RUC improvement compared with the state-of-the-arts.}

New malware variants appear in the wild to evade the malware detection and classification systems and may infect with ransomware or crypto miners for adversary financial gain. A recent colonial pipeline ransomware attack is an example of these attacks that impacted daily human activities, and the victim had to pay ransom to restore their operations. Windows-based systems are the most adopted systems across different industries for running applications. They are prone to get targeted by installing the malware. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform the malware classification on Portable Executable (PE) binary files using the fusion feature set approach. We present an extensive performance evaluation of various DL model architecture and Machine Learning (ML) classifier i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), on multi-aspect feature sets covering the static, dynamic, and image features to select the proposed CNN model. We further leverage the CNN-based architecture for effective classification of the malware using different combinations of feature sets and compare the results with the best-performed individual feature set. Our performance evaluation of the proposed model shows that the model classifies the malware or benign files with an accuracy of 97% when using fusion feature sets. The proposed model is robust and generalizable and showed similar performances on completely unseen two malware datasets. In addition, the embedding features of the CNN model are visualized, and various visualization methods are employed to understand the characteristics of the datasets. Further, large-scale learning and stacked classifiers were employed after the penultimate layer to enhance the CNN classification performance.}

	abstract = {Fog computing aims to provide resources to cloud data centers at the network’s edge to support time-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications with low-latency requirements. Protecting the IoT-Fog resources and the scheduling services from the treats is critical for executing the users’ requests in the IoT-Fog network. Proper scheduling algorithms are essential to fulfill the requirements of users’ applications properly and fully harness the potential of IoT-Fog resources. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a structure that decouples the control plane from the data plane, resulting in more flexible management. That eases the implementation of security mechanisms in the IoT-Fog networks. In SDN-based IoT-Fog networks, SDN switches and controllers can serve as fog gateways/cloud gateways. SDN switches and controllers, on the other hand, are more susceptible to a variety of assaults, making the SDN controller a bottleneck and thus easy to control plane saturation. IoT devices are inherently insecure, making the IoT-Fog network vulnerable to a variety of attacks. This paper presents S-FoS, an SDN-based security-aware workflow scheduler for IoT-Fog networks. The proposed approach defends scheduling services against distributed denial of service (DDoS) and port scanning assaults. S-FoS is a joint security and performance optimization approach that uses fuzzy-based anomaly detection algorithms to identify the source of attacks and block malicious requestors. It also uses a NSGA-III multi-objective scheduler optimization approach to consider load balancing and delay simultaneously. We show that the S-FoS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in IoT-based scenarios through comprehensive simulations. The experiments indicate that by varying the attack rates, the number of IoT devices, and the number of fog devices, the response time of S-FoS could be improved by 31% and 18%, and the network utilization of S-FoS could be improved by 9% and 4%, respectively, compared to the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) play an important role in computer network security. There are several detection mechanisms where anomaly-based automated detection outperforms others significantly. Amid the sophistication and growing number of attacks, dealing with large amounts of data is a recognized issue in the development of anomaly-based NIDS. However, do current models meet the needs of today’s networks in terms of required accuracy and dependability? In this research, we propose a new hybrid model that combines machine learning and deep learning to increase detection rates while securing dependability. Our proposed method ensures efficient pre-processing by combining SMOTE for data balancing and XGBoost for feature selection. We compared our developed method to various machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to find a more efficient algorithm to implement in the pipeline. Furthermore, we chose the most effective model for network intrusion based on a set of benchmarked performance analysis criteria. Our method produces excellent results when tested on two datasets, KDDCUP’99 and CIC-MalMem-2022, with an accuracy of 99.99% and 100% for KDDCUP’99 and CIC-MalMem-2022, respectively, and no overfitting or Type-1 and Type-2 issues.}

	abstract = {SM4 is China’s commercial block cipher standard and an ISO/IEC international standard. While SM4 withstood a great deal of analysis, its non-tweakable structure makes it inflexible. In this paper, we study three different methods to turn SM4 into a tweakable block cipher. Based on the Tweak-aNd-Tweak (TNT) introduced by Bao et al. at EUROCRYPT 2020, we propose the first scheme, called TNT-SM4, which can be treated as an instantiation of TNT. For comparative analysis, the 128 and 32 bits tweaks are both adopted, which is denoted as TNT-SM4-128 and TNT-SM4-32, respectively. By taking full advantage of the structural characteristics of SM4, we also propose the second method, which studies how to tweak SM4 into a tweakable block cipher in a direct way. With the design goal of reducing the design, security evaluation, and implementation costs, we use SM4 as is and attach a lightweight linear tweak schedule to it. The biggest challenge is to find the best insertion location for tweaks in both aspects of security and efficiency. We extensively utilize mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to perform a comprehensive search. The third method adopts the same tweak schedule as the key schedule of SM4, which is equivalent to one more key schedule for SM4. We analyze the security of the three schemes, focusing on related-key and related-tweak attacks, and provide a comparative analysis of the three schemes. The results show that our schemes are secure, and a better scheme that makes SM4 more flexible is obtained from the comparison of the three schemes.}

	abstract = {Information security is a practice of encrypting data in movement and on hold, improving discretion and integrity. One can protect, encrypt and decrypt critical data in several ways. One of them is reversible data hiding in an encrypted image. The technique enables the user to encrypt images that need authentication and restore them to their original form of images. This technique returns a lossless image as an output making it the most suiTable for medical images and the military. Histogram shifting of pixel difference is an effectual reversible data hiding method in information security. Each image's pixel is encrypted when a user wants to safely store a digital image in an open environment like a cloud. The authentication or any other relevant information related to that image is embedded in the pixel difference histogram. The proposed approach's advantage is that the grayscale image transfer is carried out exceedingly safely, with near-zero correlation and Entropy closer to 8. The Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) for a directly decrypted image with an embedding capacity of 0.0807 bpp is 50.84 dB. Moreover, the secret and cover images are retrieved without error.}

	abstract = {The enormous growth of information in the digital era has urged the researchers to secure the digital content. Guaranteeing security to these aspects remain to be the demanding challenge for the researchers in everyday life. The security needed for the confidential images has grown enormous of ages and in-order to offer exquisite protection for the collection of images in a distinct period of time, Multiple Gray Image Encryption (MGIE) model is proposed here to ensure the prevailing need. This encryption scheme incorporates two chaotic systems namely Chua system and Lu–Chen system due to their complex behavior. The proposed model endeavours the following: (1) source image can be of any type, (2) multiple images can be taken for processing, (3) cris-cross scrambling procedure is followed to absolutely alter the pixel locations, (4) diffusion is accelerated to strengthen the proposed MGIE system. The encryption procedures are interconnected and also provide cascading effect and so termed to be domino encryption strategy. The various experimental measures and performance analyses such as key space, key sensitivity, histogram, correlation, NPCR, UACI, entropy, noise, dataloss, computational complexity, time complexity analysis etc., prove that the MGIE model has inbuilt capacity to blow-away the prevailing attacks. Hence the proposed algorithm is suitable for secure transmission of multiple images.}

	abstract = {Recent works have shown that deep learning models are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, limiting the application of deep learning in security-critical systems. This paper aims to interpret the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial examples. We propose adversarial distillation to illustrate that adversarial examples are generalizable data features. Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples because models do not learn this data distribution. More specifically, we obtain adversarial features by introducing a generation and extraction mechanism. The generation mechanism generates adversarial examples, which mislead the source model trained on the original clean samples. The extraction term removes the original features and selects valid and generalizable adversarial features. Valuable adversarial features guide the model to learn the data distribution of adversarial examples and realize the model’s generalization on the adversarial dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations have proved the excellent generalization performance of the adversarial distillation model. Compared with the normally trained model, the mAP has increased by 2.17% on their respective test sets, while the mAP on the opponent’s test set is very low. The experimental results further prove that adversarial examples are also generalizable data features, which obey a different data distribution from the clean data.}
