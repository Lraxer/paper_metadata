	abstract = {Increasing interest and advancement of internet and communication technologies have made network security rise as a vibrant research domain. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have developed as indispensable defense mechanisms in cybersecurity that are employed in discovery and prevention of malicious network activities. In the recent years, researchers have proposed deep learning approaches in the development of NIDSs owing to their ability to extract better representations from large corpus of data. In the literature, convolutional neural network architecture is extensively used for spatial feature learning, while the long short term memory networks are employed to learn temporal features. In this paper, a novel hybrid method that learn the discriminative spatial and temporal features from the network flow is proposed for detecting network intrusions. A two dimensional convolution neural network is proposed to intelligently extract the spatial characteristics whereas a bi-directional long short term memory is used to extract temporal features of network traffic data samples consequently, forming a deep hybrid neural network architecture for identification and classification of network intrusion samples. Extensive experimental evaluations were performed on two well-known benchmarks datasets: CIC-IDS 2017 and the NSL-KDD datasets. The proposed network model demonstrated state-of-the-art performance with experimental results showing that the accuracy and precision scores of the intrusion detection model are significantly better than those of other existing models. These results depicts the applicability of the proposed model in the spatial-temporal feature learning in network intrusion detection systems.}

	abstract = {Online reviews, which play a key role in the ecosystem of nowadays business, have been the primary source of consumer opinions. Due to their importance, professional review writing services are employed for paid reviews and even being exploited to conduct opinion spam. Posting deceptive reviews could mislead customers, yield significant benefits or losses to service vendors, and erode confidence in the entire online purchasing ecosystem. In this paper, we ferret out deceptive reviews originated from professional review writing services. We do so even when reviewers leverage a number of pseudonymous identities to avoid the detection. To unveil the pseudonymous identities associated with deceptive reviewers, we leverage the multiview clustering method. This enables us to characterize the writing style of reviewers (deceptive vs normal) and cluster the reviewers based on their writing style. Furthermore, we explore different neural network models to model the writing style of deceptive reviews. We select the best performing neural network to generate the representation of reviews. We validate the effectiveness of the multiview clustering framework using real-world Amazon review data under different experimental scenarios. Our results show that our approach outperforms previous research. We further demonstrate its superiority through a large-scale case study based on publicly available Amazon datasets.}

	abstract = {In text-based authentication, the passwords along with user names are maintained in the Authentication Data Table (ADT). It is necessary to preserve the privacy of passwords in ADT to avoid offline attacks like brute force attacks, lookup table attacks, etc. In this paper, three password protection schemes, namely Encrypted Image Password (EIP), Dynamic Authentication Data Table (D-ADT), and Extended Encrypted Image Password (EEIP) are proposed for secure authentication. In EIP, the input passwords are first converted to hashed passwords and then transformed into images. Next, these image passwords are encrypted using a novel image password encryption system using chaos functions and confusion-diffusion mechanisms. In D-ADT, the hashed passwords are encrypted using a random key. The major highlight of this scheme is that during every log, the hashed password is encrypted with a new random key while keeping the plain password same as it is. So, during each login of the user, the old encrypted password is replaced with a new encrypted password in the authentication data table. The EEIP scheme combines both approaches. Passwords are converted to images and image passwords are encrypted with the new random key at every login. Performance and security analysis are carried out for the proposed algorithm concerning correlation analysis, differential analysis, entropy analysis, computation time, keyspace, and offline attack analysis.}

	abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) involves collecting, processing, and analyzing datasets in agriculture for an informed decision. Due to the high data storage and application maintenance costs, farmers usually outsource their agricultural data obtained from PA to cloud service providers to leverage cloud services. Nonetheless, serious security concerns arise from using cloud services for farmers. For instance, an attacker can intercept agricultural data and run comprehensive statistical analyses to adjudicate farmers’ financial status, extort money, commit identity theft, etc. As a result, compelling data security schemes have become crucial for secure precision farming, where only legitimate users are required to access the agricultural data outsourced to the cloud. This article presents a certificateless signcryption scheme with proxy re-encryption (CLS-PRE) for secure access control in PA. An in-depth security analysis proves that the CLS-PRE scheme is secure in the Random Oracle Model. Detailed performance evaluation also shows that the scheme can reduce the time required to signcrypt and unsigncrypt messages and lower communication overhead.}

	abstract = {Traditionally, the mission of intercepting malicious traffic between the Internet and the internal network of entities like organizations and corporations, is largely fulfilled by techniques such as deep packet inspection (DPI). However, steganography, the methodology of hiding secret data in seemingly benign public mediums (e.g., images), has been leveraged by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups in recent years, and is almost impossible to be detected and intercepted by traditional techniques, posing a pervasive and realistic threat to cybersecurity. Additionally, internal networks’ vulnerability to steganography is further exacerbated by the connectivity and large attack surface of the Internet of Things (IoT), whose adoption and deployment are quickly expanding. To protect computer systems against malicious communications that apply steganographic methods potentially unknown to cybersecurity stakeholders, we propose StegEraser, an approach to removing the secret information embedded in public mediums by adversaries, that is fundamentally distinct from existing research which is primarily designed for known steganographic methods. Implemented for images, StegEraser injects an excessively huge amount of random binary data with a novel steganographic method into the images, by utilizing the information-merging capabilities of invertible neural networks (INNs), in order to “overload” adversaries’ steganographic hiding capacity of images transmitted through the firewall performing DPI. In the meantime, StegEraser preserves the perceptual quality of the images. In other words, StegEraser “defeats unknown steganography with steganography”. Extensive evaluation verifies that StegEraser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of removing secret information embedded with both traditional and neural network-based steganographic methods, while visually maintaining the image quality.}

By capturing the information flow, our method finds a better feature representation for detection tasks with rely solely on sequence information. To enhance the stability of feature representation, this work adopts a multi-task learning strategy which achieves better performance in independent testing. We evaluate our method on two different realworld datasets and compare it against four superior malware detection models. During malware detection using our method, we conducted in-depth discussions on feature length, graph embedding direction, model depth, and different multi-task learning strategies. Experimental and discussion results show that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches across evaluation settings.}

	abstract = {Cache attacks pose a serious security threat to cryptographic implementations in processor architectures. In this paper, we first propose cache attacks against Blowfish, which can break the protection of key-dependent S-box. This attack targets at the subkey calculation of Blowfish, and fully exploits features of the subkey calculation to construct a leakage equation group about the key. Without any knowledge of plaintext and ciphertext, the attacker only needs to obtain the cache leakage once to recover a variable-length key in minute-level time. More than that, we establish a leakage model for cache attack situations to evaluate the exhausting space of the intermediate value of block ciphers, and estimate the time complexity of cache attacks. In our experiments, we perform Flush + Reload and Prime + Probe attacks and recover the random key of Blowfish in OpenSSL 1.1.1h in 4 minutes. Furthermore, we have applied our attacks to existing systems, such as JavaScript-blowfish and Bcrypt. Our attack on JavaScript-blowfish can recover any plaintext input by the user. As for Bcrypt, our attack can recover the hash values stored in the database, thereby allowing attackers to impersonate the user’s identity.}

	abstract = {While network attacks play a critical role in many advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, an arms race exists between the network defenders and the adversary: to make APT campaigns stealthy, the adversary is strongly motivated to evade the detection system. However, new studies have shown that neural network is likely a game-changer in the arms race: neural network could be applied to achieve accurate, signature-free, and low-false-alarm-rate detection. In this work, we investigate whether the adversary could fight back during the next phase of the arms race. In particular, noticing that none of the existing adversarial example generation methods could generate malicious packets (and sessions) that can simultaneously compromise the target machine and evade the neural network detection model, we propose a novel attack method to achieve this goal. We have designed and implemented the new attack. We have also used Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning and Domain Name System (DNS) Cache Poisoning as the case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack.}

While several defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate DOP attacks, they often introduce substantial overhead due to the blind protection of a large range of data objects. To address this issue, we focus on selecting and protecting the specific target data that are of interest to DOP attackers, rather than securing the entire non-control data in the program. In this regard, we perform static analysis on 20 real-world applications and identify the target data, verifying that they constitute only a small percentage of the overall program, averaging around 3%. Additionally, we propose a semi-automated tool to analyze how to chain operations on the target data in these 20 applications to achieve Turing-complete attacks. Furthermore, we introduce DSLR-: a low-overhead Data Structure Layout Randomization (DSLR) method, which modifies the existing DSLR technique to only randomize the selected target data for DOP. Experimental results demonstrate that DSLR- effectively mitigates DOP attacks, reducing performance overhead by 71.2% and memory overhead by 82.5% compared to the original DSLR technique.}

Our approach encompasses abstract requirements for proactive policy enforcement, a system model describing how enforcement mechanisms interact with and control target systems, and concrete policy languages and associated enforcement mechanisms. As examples of policy languages, we consider finite automata and timed dynamic condition response (DCR) graphs. We use finite automata to illustrate the basic principles and DCR graphs to show how these principles can be adapted to a practical, real-time policy language. In both cases, we show how to algorithmically determine whether a given policy is enforceable and, when this is the case, construct an associated enforcement mechanism. Our approach improves upon existing formalisms in two ways: (1) we exploit the target system’s existing functionality to avert policy violations proactively, rather than compensate for them reactively; and (2) rather than requiring the manual specification of remedial actions in the policy, we deduce required actions directly from the policy.}

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a systematic Inter-Component Communications (ICCs) dynamic Analysis Technique (SIAT) for detecting privacy-sensitive data leak threats. SIAT’s specific approach involves the identification of malicious ICC patterns by actively tracing both data flows and implicit control flows within ICC processes during runtime. This is achieved by utilizing the taint tagging methodology, a technique utilized by TaintDroid. As a result, it can discover the malicious intent usage pattern and further resolve the coincidental malicious ICCs and bypass cases without incurring performance degradation. SIAT comprises two key modules: Monitor and Analyzer. The Monitor makes the first attempt to revise the taint tag approach named TaintDroid by developing the built-in intent service primitives to help Android capture the intent-related taint propagation at multi-level for malicious ICC detection. Specifically, we enable the Monitor to perform systemwide tracking of intent with five abstraction functionalities embedded in the interactive workflow of components. By analyzing the taint logs offered by the Monitor, the Analyzer can build the accurate and integrated ICC patterns adopted to identify the specific leak threat patterns with the identification algorithms and predefined rules. Meanwhile, we employ the patterns’ deflation technique to improve the efficiency of the Analyzer. We implement the SIAT with Android Open Source Project and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments on a particular dataset consisting of well-known datasets and real-world apps. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the SIAT can achieve about 25% ∼200% accuracy improvements with 1.0 precision and 0.98 recall at negligible runtime overhead. Apart from that, the SIAT can identify two undisclosed cases of bypassing that prior technologies cannot detect and quite a few malicious ICC threats in real-world apps with lots of downloads on the Google Play market.}

	abstract = {The transition from paper-based information to Electronic-Health-Records (EHRs) has driven various advancements in the modern healthcare industry. In many cases, patients need to share their EHR with healthcare professionals. Given the sensitive and security-critical nature of EHRs, it is essential to consider the security and privacy issues of storing and sharing EHR. However, existing security solutions excessively encrypt the whole database, thus requiring the entire database to be decrypted for each access request, which is time-consuming. On the other hand, the use of EHR for medical research (e.g., development of precision medicine and diagnostics techniques) and optimisation of practices in healthcare organisations require the EHR to be analysed. To achieve that, they should be easily accessible without compromising the patient’s privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique called E-Tenon that not only securely keeps all EHR publicly accessible but also provides the desired security features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which an Open Database is used for protecting EHR. The proposed E-Tenon empowers patients to securely share their EHR under their own multi-level, fine-grained access policies. Analyses show that our system outperforms existing solutions in terms of computational complexity.}

	abstract = {The Kidney Exchange Problem (KEP) aims at finding an optimal set of exchanges among pairs of patients and their medically incompatible living kidney donors as well as altruistic donors who are not associated with any particular patient but want to donate a kidney to any person in need. Existing platforms that offer the finding of such exchanges for patient-donor pairs and altruistic donors are organized in a centralized fashion and operated by a single platform operator. This makes them susceptible to manipulation and corruption. Recent research has targeted these security issues by proposing decentralized Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) protocols for solving the KEP. However, these protocols fail to meet two important requirements for kidney exchange in practice. First, they do not allow for altruistic donors. While such donors are not legally allowed in all countries, they have been shown to have a positive effect on the number of transplants that can be found. Second, the existing SMPC protocols do not support prioritization, which is used in existing platforms to give priority to certain exchanges or patient-donor pairs, e.g., to patients who are hard to match due to their medical characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a generic gate for implementing prioritization in kidney exchange. We extend two existing SMPC protocols for solving the KEP such that they allow for altruistic donors and prioritization and present one novel SMPC protocol for solving the KEP with altruistic donors and prioritization based on dynamic programming. We prove the security of all protocols and analyze their complexity. We implement all protocols and evaluate their performance for the setting where altruistic donors are legally allowed and for the setting where they are not. Thereby, we determine the performance impact of the inclusion of altruistic donors and obtain those approaches that perform best for each setting.}

	abstract = {As far as mobile edge computing is concerned, it is necessary to ensure the data integrity of latency-sensitive applications during the process of computing. While certain research programs have demonstrated efficacy, challenges persist, including the inefficient utilization of computing resources, network backhaul issues, and the occurrence of false-negative detections. To solve these problems, an integrity protection scheme is proposed in this paper on the basis of data right confirmation (DRC). Under this scheme, a two-layer consensus algorithm is developed. The outer algorithm is applied to establish a data authorization mechanism by marking the original data source to avoid the false negative results caused by network attacks from the data source. In addition, blockchain-based mobile edge computing (BMEC) technology is applied to enable data sharing in the context of mobile edge computing while minimizing the network backhaul of edge computing. Based on the Merkle Tree algorithm, the inner layer algorithm is capable not only of accurately locating and promptly repairing damaged data but also of verifying all servers in the mobile edge computing network either regularly or on demand. Finally, our proposal is evaluated against two existing research schemes. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme is not only effective in ensuring data integrity in mobile edge computing, but it is also capable of achieving better performance.}

	abstract = {Biometric-based authentication methods have been widely used, for example on portable devices (e.g., Android and iOS devices). However, there are several known limitations in existing authentication methods based on biometrics (e.g., those using facial, iris, and fingerprint). For example, in a healthcare context, a user may be physically incapable of completing the authentication due to his/her medical conditions. Hence, as a complementary authentication mechanism, there have been attempts to also utilize electrocardiogram (ECG). In this work, we propose an ECG authentication system that leverages deep learning. Specifically, to achieve generalization ability, complementary ensemble empirical decomposition (CEEMD) is introduced in our design. Moreover, a 1-D Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (1-D MCNN) is implemented to achieve accurate authentication. To evaluate the usability of our proposed approach, we have performed extensive experiments on eight databases, and the findings show that our proposed approach achieves good performance even on abnormal databases and can be adapted for different application environments. In addition, our adopted data from eight public databases requires theoretical statistical treatment for practical applications in real authentication scenarios.}

	abstract = {The increased adoption of the Internet Protocol (IP) in ICSs has made these systems vulnerable to the same security risks that are present in traditional IT environments. The legacy nature of ICSs and their unique operational requirements make them vulnerable to security threats that are different from those in IT environments. In this paper, we describe a protocol, named ArpON, which is able to wipe out in quasi real time any ARP cache poisoning attempt, thus making it ineffective. Contrarily to solutions presented in the literature for contrasting ARP cache poisoning, ArpON incurs in low operational costs, is backward compatible, transparent to the ARP protocol and does not use any HW feature nor cryptography functionality. We also model and validate ArpON in the OMNET\n+\n+\nnetwork simulator. The simulation results show that ArpON is effective in avoiding ARP poisoning, and its communication overhead is negligible with respect to classical ARP protocol.}

	abstract = {The development of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for the in-vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is one of the main efforts being taken to secure the in-vehicle network against various cyberattacks, which have the potential to cause vehicles to malfunction and result in dangerous accidents. These CAN IDS are evaluated in disparate experimental conditions that vary in terms of the workload used, the features used, the metrics reported, etc., which makes direct comparison difficult. Therefore, there have been several benchmarking frameworks and comparative studies designed to evaluate CAN IDS in similar experimental conditions to understand their relative performance and facilitate the selection of the best CAN IDS for implementation in automotive networks. This work provides a comprehensive survey of CAN IDS benchmarking frameworks and comparative studies in the current literature. A CAN IDS evaluation design space is also proposed in this work, which draws from the wider CAN IDS literature. This is not only expected to serve as a guide for designing CAN IDS evaluation experiments but is also used for categorising current benchmarking efforts. The surveyed works have been discussed on the basis of the five aspects in the design space – namely, IDS type, attack model, evaluation type, workload generation, and evaluation metrics – and recommendations for future work have been identified.}

	abstract = {Identity-based chameleon hash (IBCH) is a cryptographic primitive with nice properties. IBCH equips each user with a trapdoor and the hash values can be publicly evaluated w.r.t. the identity of any user. On the one hand, it is hard to find collisions for the hash values without the user’s trapdoor. On the other hand, with the help of the user’s trapdoor, finding collisions becomes easy. An important application of IBCH is to upgrade an identity-based signature (IBS) scheme to an on-line/off-line identity-based signature (OO-IBS) scheme. OO-IBS is a useful tool to provide authenticity in lightweight smart devices, since it only involves light on-line computations and does not need key certificate. Up to now, there are many IBCH constructions from traditional number-theoretic assumptions like RSA, CDH, etc. However, none of the existing IBCH schemes achieve the post-quantum security in the standard model.}

	abstract = {Detecting encrypted malware traffic promptly to halt the further propagation of an attack is critical. Currently, machine learning becomes a key technique for extracting encrypted malware traffic patterns. However, due to the dynamic nature of network environments and the frequent updates of malware, current methods face the challenges of detecting unknown malware traffic in open-world environment. To address the issue, we introduce MVDet, a novel method that employs machine learning to mine the behavioral features of malware traffic based on multi-view analysis. Unlike traditional methods, MVDet innovatively characterizes the behavioral features of malware traffic at 4-tuple flows from four views: statistical view, DNS view, TLS view, and business view, which is a more stable feature representation capable of handling complex network environments and malware updates. Additionally, we achieve a short-time behavioral features construction, significantly reducing the time cost for feature extraction and malware detection. As a result, we can detect malware behavior at an early stage promptly. Our evaluation demonstrates that MVDet can detect a wide variety of known malware traffic and exhibits efficient and robust detection in both open-world and unknown malware scenarios. MVDet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-world known malware detection, open-world known malware detection, and open-world unknown malware detection.}

	abstract = {A massive amount of data is transmitted in the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, the concerning of security issues are the major factor while transferring data through wireless networks. Since, data privacy becomes complicated. In this research work, a newly proposed model for multimedia steganography is developed. Initially, the required video is obtained from the publically available datasets, and then the acquired input is subjected to the Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) based block process. The optimal blocks are chosen by the Adaptive Multi-cascaded ResNet (AMC-ResNet) model for applying stego data. Here, the parameter optimization takes place in the DCT and ResNet model to enhance the steganography performance via the Mouth Brooding Fish Emperor Penguin Optimization (MBFEPO) derived from the Mouth Brooding Fish Algorithm (MBFA) and Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (EPOA). Finally, the inverse DCT is employed at the blocks to get the final stego video. In the audio steganography phase, the wanted audio is gathered from external websites. The collected data are given to the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert into the spectrogram image, and then the spectrogram image is given to the Adaptive DCT block, selecting the block to apply stego data. Thus, the blocks are selected with the utilization of the Adaptive Multi-cascaded ResNet (AMC-ResNet), where the parameters within the DCT and the ResNet are optimized via the same MBFEPO to improve the performance. After, the Inverse ADCT is applied to reconstruct the spectrogram image. Then, the resultant stego audio is obtained by using the Inverse STFT. Finally, several experiments are conducted to estimate the working ability of the proposed steganography model. The outcome of the recommended model shows 12.3%, 52.6%, 12.3%, and 84.3% better performance SFO, HBA, MBFA, and EPOA in terms of median. The recommended model performs superior performance rather than the existing approaches.}
