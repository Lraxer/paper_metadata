	abstract = {Private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) and private intersection-sum with cardinality (PSI-CA-sum) are two primitives that enable data owners to learn the intersection cardinality of their data sets, with the difference that PSI-CA-sum additionally outputs the sum of the associated integer values of all the data that belongs to the intersection (i.e., intersection-sum). However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing multi-party PSI-CA (MPSI-CA) protocols are either limited by high computational cost or face security challenges under arbitrary collusion. As for multi-party PSI-CA-sum (MPSI-CA-sum), there is even no formalization for this notion at present, not to mention secure constructions for it. In this paper, we first present an efficient MPSI-CA protocol with two non-colluding parties. This protocol significantly decreases the number of parties involved in expensive interactive procedures, leading to a significant enhancement in runtime efficiency. Our numeric results demonstrate that the running time of this protocol is merely one-quarter of the time required by our proposed MPSI-CA protocol that is secure against arbitrary collusion. Therefore, in scenarios where performance is a priority, this protocol stands out as an excellent choice. Second, we successfully construct the first MPSI-CA protocol that achieves simultaneous practicality and security against arbitrary collusion. Additionally, we also conduct implementation to verify its practicality (while the previous results under arbitrary collusion only present theoretical analysis of performance, lacking real implementation). Numeric results show that by shifting the costly operations to an offline phase, the online computation can be completed in just 12.805 seconds, even in the dishonest majority setting, where 15 parties each hold a set of size  2 16 . Third, we formalize the concept of MPSI-CA-sum and present the first realization that ensures simultaneous practicality and security against arbitrary collusion. The computational complexity of this protocol is roughly twice that of our MPSI-CA protocol. Besides the main results, we introduce the concepts and efficient constructions of two novel building blocks: multi-party secret-shared shuffle and multi-party oblivious zero-sum check, which may be of independent interest.}

	abstract = {With the advancement of network security equipment, insider threats gradually replace external threats and become a critical contributing factor for cluster security threats. When detecting and combating insider threats, existing methods often concentrate on users’ behavior and analyze logs recording their operations in an information system. Traditional sequence-based method considers temporal relationships for user actions, but cannot represent complex logical relationships well between various entities and different behaviors. Current machine learning-based approaches, such as graph-based methods, can establish connections among log entries but have limitations in terms of complexity and identifying malicious behavior of user’s inherent intention. In this paper, we propose Log2Graph, a novel insider threat detection method based on graph convolution neural network. To achieve efficient anomaly detection, Log2Graph first retrieves logs and corresponding features from log files through feature extraction. Specifically, we use an auxiliary feature of anomaly index to describe the relationship between entities, such as users and hosts, instead of establishing complex connections between them. Second, these logs and features are augmented through a combination of oversampling and downsampling, to prepare for the next-stage supervised learning process. Third, we use three elaborated rules to construct the graph of each user by connecting the logs according to chronological and logical relationships. At last, the dedicated built graph convolution neural network is used to detect insider threats. Our validation and extensive evaluation results confirm that Log2Graph can greatly improve the performance of insider threat detection compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.}

The conventional 2D-Bifid cipher is changed to handle the encryption and decryption of color images. Further, a block-based method is realized using Arnold map to encrypt and decrypt the image data of square as well as non-square sizes. The proposed scheme is constructed on a widely adopted cryptographic framework, i.e., substitution-permutation design, where Bifid cipher-based scheme acts as a substitution layer and Arnold map-based scheme acts as a diffusion layer. The designed scheme has a huge key space with key sensitivity not only to accurate keys but also to their accurate orders. The practicability and performance of the designed scheme is validated by conducting a detailed analysis along with a comparative study. This paper contributes to a simple, efficient and secure image encryption method, which outperforms to the related works.}

To overcome the limitation of computation ability in one edge node, collaborative edge computing is proposed. Each edge node only needs to verify a subset of the message integrity, which is beneficial when incoming messages are large. In this paper, we propose an Elliptic Curve Based Multi-hop Sanitizable Signature (ECMSS), which can provide both signature aggregation and subset verification. The theoretical analysis shows that ECMSS can achieve unforgeability and non-transferability. Concurrently, the experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves high efficiency and guaranteed security.}

	abstract = {Organizations are vulnerable to cyber attacks as they rely on computer networks and the internet for communication and data storage. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely used strategy to simulate and learn from these attacks, RL-guided offensives against unknown scenarios often lead to early exposure due to low stealth resulting from mistakes during the training phase. To address this issue, this work evaluates if the use of Knowledge Transfer Techniques (KTT), such as Transfer Learning and Imitation Learning, reduces the probability of early exposure by smoothing mistakes during training. This study developed a laboratory platform and a method to compare RL-based cyber attacks using KTT for unknown scenarios. The experiments simulated 2 unknown scenarios using 4 traditional RL algorithms and 4 KTT. In the results, although some algorithms using KTT obtained superior results, they were not so significant for stealth during the initial epochs of training. Nevertheless, experiments also revealed that throughout the entire learning cycle, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is a promising algorithm for conducting cyber offensives based on Reinforcement Learning.}

	abstract = {Body area networks (BANs) frequently generate sensitive healthcare data from sensors and other devices. Security and privacy breaches in BAN systems can compromise information affecting patients’ physical health, emotional state, and financial well-being. The lack of well-defined security perimeters and qualified personnel to administer security in such dynamic environments requires an authorization framework for protecting patient data, where access depends on the users’ credentials, location, and time. Toward this end, this work aims to define a secure system architecture to incorporate fine-grained information access management. It also leverages a spatiotemporal attribute-based access control (STABAC) model to make it possible to enforce location and time factors with BAN policies and required attributes to make access decisions. The BAN policies have various dynamic constraints that may conflict with each other or introduce inconsistencies. Therefore, this work proposes a formal verification framework using timed colored Petri nets to ensure such errors are not introduced. The blockchain network is utilized to maintain policy integrity, where STABAC verifies policy integrity from the network through smart contract services before making access decisions. Finally, the policy and attribute management framework ensures that STABAC maintains a verified set of policies and attributes for authorizing uninterrupted care and services.}

To address these challenges, we introduce ANT-ET, an end-to-end multimodal framework designed for fine-grained encrypted webpage traffic fingerprinting. ANT-ET leverages a transformer to model payload semantics and constructs a traffic interaction graph to capture both temporal and spatial characteristics of packet interactions. Additionally, ANT-ET incorporates a gradient reversal layer to improve generalization by facilitating domain-invariant feature learning across related webpages. Experimental results demonstrate ANT-ET’s superior performance compared to various baseline models, which were evaluated using a proprietary encrypted webpage traffic dataset and three public datasets. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of different framework components, while sensitivity and complexity analyses further validate ANT-ET’s robustness and flexibility.}

	abstract = {The growing prevalence of encrypted malicious network traffic poses significant challenges for cybersecurity, as it conceals the content from traditional detection methods. Temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) present promising capabilities for extracting complex temporal features and patterns from the dynamic traffic flow data. However, the unidirectional nature of traditional TCNs limits their effectiveness in capturing the full context of network traffic, which often exhibits bidirectional temporal dependencies. Consequently, a few studies have proposed bidirectional TCN (BiTCN) architectures to address the limitations. However, these methods present complex architectures that require a significant amount of parameters to be learned, which imposes high memory requirements on the computational resources for training such models. In this study, we introduce the efficient bidirectional TCN (eBiTCN) model, an efficient BiTCN that requires fewer parameters yet not at the expense of computational cost and effective detection. The eBiTCN framework combines a bidirectional processor, a lightweight gating mechanism, temporal attention, dropout, a novel loss function, and dense layers. Extensive experiments show that eBiTCN outperforms eight state-of-the-art competing models in terms of detection efficacy, speed, and scalability. The eBiTCN model showcased robust performance in detecting evolving attacks and excelled across various real-world datasets. Its efficiency in training speed and reduced memory usage translates to lower infrastructure costs, making it an accessible and effective choice for deployment. These findings highlight eBiTCN’s practicality and dependability in addressing contemporary network security needs.}

	abstract = {With the increased demand for intelligence, neural networks have become an increasingly popular solution for intrusion detection systems (IDS), as their ability to learn complex patterns and behaviors makes them a suitable solution for distinguishing normal traffic from network intrusions. Hence, this paper proposes a new unsupervised IDS ensemble framework that utilizes parallel deep learning techniques based on three different anomaly detection concepts. That is, modeling the detection of point anomalies, collective anomalies, and contextual anomalies simultaneously.These detectors are trained in parallel, and the anomaly scores obtained from each detector are combined to provide the final detection decision. This ensemble approach can simultaneously consider the different types of anomalies in time series data and reduce the impact of overfitting some unsupervised anomaly detectors. Compared to supervised methods, the developed scheme reduces the overhead of manually annotated data and detects online possible novel attack data streams. The proposed ensemble model has been tested on the UNSW-NB15, DAPT 2020 and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 datasets. Compared to baseline models, the single detectors used to constitute the ensemble model achieve better performance separately in most cases. Through three simple ensemble strategies, Vote, ‘And’ logic and ‘Or’ logic, the ensemble model exhibits improved stability, precision performance, and recall performance, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed ensemble model can successfully combine the advantages of different unsupervised detectors, offering an advantage over other single unsupervised anomaly detection models. Moreover, the suggested method is effective for detecting various traffic anomalies caused by network intrusions that occur in the datasets.}

	abstract = {In the era of Big Data, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly concerning privacy and fairness. While differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a robust methodology for preserving privacy in real-world applications, its local variant (LDP) specifically addresses trust issues by removing the reliance on a centralized server. Equally critical, conducting fairness audits of AI systems helps identify and mitigate discriminatory outcomes in machine learning. Although the relationship between DP and fairness is inherently multifaceted, this paper offers a detailed empirical examination of how collecting multi-dimensional sensitive attributes under LDP affects fairness in binary classification tasks. Our findings reveal that LDP can  slightly improve  fairness without substantially degrading model performance—challenging the notion that DP necessarily exacerbates unfairness. We demonstrate these results by evaluating seven state-of-the-art LDP protocols on three benchmark datasets, using established group fairness metrics. Moreover, we propose a novel privacy budget allocation scheme that incorporates varying domain sizes of sensitive attributes, achieving a superior privacy–utility–fairness trade-off compared to existing solutions.}

While significant research has been conducted on backdoor attacks in classified models, limited attention has been given to object detection models. Previous studies have predominantly focused on backdoor attacks in digital environments, overlooking real-world implications. Notably, the efficacy of backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios can be significantly influenced by physical factors such as distance and illumination. In this article, we introduce a variable-size backdoor trigger designed to accommodate objects of different sizes, mitigating disruptions arising from varying distances between the viewing point and the targeted object. Additionally, we propose malicious adversarial training for backdoor training, enabling the backdoor object detector to learn trigger features amidst physical noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our robust backdoor attack (RBA) enhances the success rate of attacks in real-world settings.}

To be widely adopted, ensuring the security of the cryptographic protocols used in e-voting is of paramount importance. However, the security analysis of this type of protocol raises a number of challenges, and they are often out of reach of existing verification tools. In this paper, we study  vote privacy , a central security property that should be satisfied by any e-voting system. More precisely, we propose the first formalisation of the recent  BPRIV  notion in the symbolic setting. To ease the formal security analysis of this notion, we propose a reduction result allowing one to bind the number of voters and ballots needed to mount an attack. We first consider the case where voters do not revote, and the ballot box is trusted. Then, we extend this reduction result, as well as our formalisation of  BPRIV , to account for the case of re-voting and a dishonest ballot box. We apply our reduction results to a number of case studies including several versions of Helios, Belenios, JCJ/Civitas, and Prêt-à-Voter. For some of these protocols, thanks to our result, we are able to conduct the analysis relying on the automatic tool  Proverif .}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing local data, offering privacy benefits. However, its distributed nature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries manipulate training data or model updates to trigger attacker-chosen outputs. Existing defenses often fail under high proportions of malicious clients and struggle to balance robustness and model utility. This article proposes FedRAB, a collaborative FL defense framework using dynamic smoothing to mitigate backdoor threats. FedRAB remains effective even when over 50% of clients are malicious. In this framework, clients are categorized into three types: fully trusted clients, malicious but trusted clients and malicious and untrusted clients. The first two inject controlled perturbation noise into their local datasets, suppressing poisoning attacks while preserving accuracy. To address diverse and severe backdoor behaviors, the server applies dimensionality reduction followed by clustering to identify and filter out the most harmful malicious updates. This enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of malicious update detection. The server then clips and perturbs the remaining model updates, further strengthening defense against backdoors while preserving data diversity and generalization. We evaluate the effectiveness of FedRAB on various datasets. For example, on the MNIST dataset, when 65% of clients are malicious, FedRAB reduces the backdoor accuracy from 94.6% to 1.5%, while only decreasing the model's accuracy on benign samples by 1.2%.}

	abstract = {Testing a program’s capability to effectively handle errors is a significant challenge, given that program errors are relatively uncommon. To address this, software fault injection (SFI)-based fuzzing combines SFI with traditional fuzzing to inject faults and trigger errors, enabling the testing of (error handling) code. However, current SFI-based fuzzing approaches have overlooked the correlation between paths housing error points. In fact, the execution paths of error points often share common paths. As a result, fuzzers usually generate test cases repeatedly to explore these common paths. This practice can compromise the efficiency of the fuzzer(s). To address this issue, this paper introduces HuntFUZZ, a novel SFI-based fuzzing framework designed to minimize redundant exploration of error points with correlated paths. HuntFUZZ achieves this by clustering these correlated error points and using concolic execution to resolve the path constraints necessary for approaching or reaching these clusters. This approach provides the fuzzer with optimized test cases, allowing it to efficiently explore error points within the cluster while minimizing redundancy. We evaluate HuntFUZZ on a diverse set of 42 applications, and HuntFUZZ successfully reveals 162 known bugs, with 62 of them being related to error handling. Additionally, due to its efficient error point detection method, HuntFUZZ discovers seven unique zero-day bugs, which are all missed by existing fuzzers. Furthermore, we compare HuntFUZZ with four existing fuzzing approaches, including AFL, AFL++, AFLGo, and EH-FUZZ. Our evaluation confirms that HuntFUZZ can cover a broader range of error points, and it exhibits better performance in terms of bug-finding speed.}

	abstract = {In today’s digital era of constant information sharing, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital documents—particularly portable document format (PDF) files—has become increasingly important. This paper introduces a watermarking scheme for PDF files by embedding quick response (QR) codes into the spatial domain of text color. The method takes a PDF and a QR code as input, resizing the QR code to match the length of the text on each page. The embedding process incorporates Arnold’s transformation and a permutation equal to the QR code’s size to secure both embedding and extraction. The QR code is applied by slightly altering the color of specific text characters that correspond to black pixels in the QR code image, achieving spatial-domain watermarking without degrading visual quality. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the method’s robustness against various attacks, with the watermarked PDFs achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 57.6 dB and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.99. The extracted QR codes maintain PSNR values above 68.8 dB and SSIM equal to 1 after common processing attacks. The scheme also effectively detects malicious tampering, proving the potential of the proposed watermarking scheme in the protection of PDF files.}

In this paper, a new diagnostic method for data recorded over a working computer network is presented. It can be used in information security applications such as intrusion detection and prevention. The proposed technique considers a generalized correlation data representation and applies a digit distribution. The current techniques were evaluated, documented, and presented by conducting various tests on the recorded features of the network using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The evaluation results illustrate the high-detection rates achieved.}

	abstract = {Ghosh, Kamara, and Tamassia (GKT) (ASIA CCS 2021) proposed a graph encryption scheme supporting shortest path queries. This work presents a query recovery attack against the scheme when the adversary is given the original graph and the leakage of certain subsets of queries. The attack falls within the security model used by GKT, and is the first targeting schemes\xa0supporting shortest path queries. The attack uses classical graph algorithms to compute the canonical names of the single-destination shortest path spanning trees of the underlying graph and uses these canonical names to precompute the set of candidate queries that match each response. When all shortest path queries to a single node have been observed, the canonical names for the corresponding query tree are computed, and the responses are matched to the candidate queries from the offline phase. The output is guaranteed to contain the correct query. For a graph on  n  vertices, the attack runs in time  O ( n 3 )  and matches the time complexity of the GKT scheme’s setup. The attack’s practicality is demonstrated through an implementation and evaluation on the real-world datasets used in the original paper and on random graphs.}

	abstract = {In protocol verification, we observe a wide spectrum from fully automated methods to interactive theorem proving with proof assistants such as Isabelle/HOL. The latter provides overwhelmingly high assurance of the correctness, which automated methods often cannot: due to their complexity, bugs in such automated verification tools are likely, and thus the risk of erroneously verifying a flawed protocol is nonnegligible. There are a few works that try to combine the advantages from both ends of the spectrum: a high degree of automation and assurance. We present here a first step toward achieving this for a more challenging class of protocols, namely those that work with a mutable long-term state. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that achieves fully automated verification of stateful protocols in an LCF-style theorem prover. The approach also includes a simple user-friendly transaction-based protocol specification language embedded into Isabelle, and can also leverage a number of existing results, such as the soundness of a typed model.}
