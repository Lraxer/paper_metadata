	abstract = {Access control policies specify which access requests should be allowed or denied in a system. Many access control policy models have used the concept of “negation” as part of their policy language, to enable fine-grained specification of authorizations. We identify two forms of this concept in the literature, namely, negated conditions and negative authorizations (deny rules). We argue that the choice of supporting negated conditions or negative authorizations can affect the expressive power of a policy model. Understanding their differences is crucial for designing an appropriate policy model for an intended application. However, no prior work has concretely analyzed them.}

	abstract = {Machine Type Communication (MTC) has been emerging for a wide range of applications and services for the Internet of Things (IoT). In some scenarios, a large group of MTC devices (MTCDs) may enter the communication coverage of a new target base station simultaneously. However, the current handover mechanism specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16 incurs high signaling overhead over the access network and the core network for such scenario. Moreover, other existing solutions have several security problems in terms of the failure of key forward secrecy (KFS) and lack of mutual authentication. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication protocol for a group of MTCDs in all handover scenarios. By the proposal, the messages from two MTCDs are concatenated with an aggregated message authentication code (MAC) and sent by an authenticated group member to reduce the signaling cost. The proposed protocol has been formally evaluated by Scyther tool to prove its security. And it has been analysed on its security functionality to show its ability to resist major typical malicious attacks. Temporary identities of MTCDs have been used to preserve users’ privacy. It can be expected that the proposed protocol is applicable to all kinds of group mobility scenarios such as a platoon of vehicles or a high-speed train. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocol is efficient in terms of computational, communication, signaling, and energy cost.}

TEE is responsible for isolating and protecting the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the device. There are several TrustZone-based TEE solutions utilized in devices, among which Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) is the most well-known TEE utilized in many Android devices. Since the underlying QSEE is entailed to ensure the security of sensitive data on the user device, it is essential to analyze its vulnerability state; however, most of the prior work on QSEE targets older devices or firmware versions. In this work, we carry out a comprehensive review of QSEE vulnerabilities and validate the current security state of the target TEE on a physical device. Our approach has been based on mining of CVEs targeting QSEE or its components spanning about seven years, so as to derive the security trend for QSEE as well as a heat-map to narrow down the more targeted areas of the TEE. As the heat-map indicated a major problem area to be vulnerabilities in Trusted Apps (TAs), we validated the integrity issues of TAs on a physical Android device. Our review highlights that while QSEE has considerably improved its security over the years; yet, still vulnerabilities may arise due to variations in vendor-level configurations on physical devices.}

We consider the problem of improving the resilience of Federated Learning to adversarial samples without compromising the privacy preserving features which Federated Learning was primarily designed to provide.Common techniques such as adversarial training, in their basic form are not well suited for a Federated Learning environment. Our study shows that adversarial training, while improving adversarial robustness, comes at a cost of reducing the privacy guarantee of Federated Learning.}

	abstract = {Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are an important mechanism to identify malicious behaviour or policy violations within a network. Such detection systems typically face several challenges, among which are the base-rate fallacy and the resilience against adaptive adversaries. These challenges are often countered in modern NIDSs by combining multiple detection systems to diversify the used feature levels or utilize the advantages of multiple detection methods. However, currently there exists no suitable framework for a detailed analysis of such composed systems. Therefore, the contribution of this work is an evaluation framework for composed systems, which builds on previous information-theoretic approaches and highlights the utility of information-theoretic redundancies for robustness evaluations. This framework enables an attribution of the overall system performance to its individual components, to fine-tune parameters and to study the dynamics between classifiers. The versatility of the framework is demonstrated by designing and evaluating a composed NIDS example based on systems described in the literature and using an open data set. Studying the impact of an evasion attempt with adversarial examples on this system highlighted the importance of robustness against false-alarms as well as detection evasion. Moreover, the framework enables general insights on how to improve the design of composed NIDSs: based on the dynamics between classifiers, it can be shown that optimizing the operation point of each component individually does not necessarily maximize the overall system performance from an information-theoretic perspective. Additionally, it can be shown that existing classification redundancies might not be fully utilized during an attack on the NIDS components, due to a static system design.}

	abstract = {A textual password is widely used for user authentication for a variety of applications. Passwords that are easy to remember are also easy to be guessed, while complex and long passwords that provide strong security are difficult to remember. Also, there has been limited quantitative research to understand the factors that make passwords strong. In this research, we aim to expand our understanding of passwords through the lenses of data-driven analysis by characterizing a large number of password datasets with four different hypotheses. In particular, we use the tensor decomposition method that is effective in analyzing unlabeled high dimensional data. We first obtain 362,805 passwords from four different leaked password datasets. Next, we generate syntactic and semantic features for each password, then classify it into three strength groups using a statistical guessing attack model. Finally, we construct a 3rd-order password tensor and decompose it using the PARAFAC2 algorithm to examine the main characteristics which make passwords strong. Also, we apply an orthogonal constraint to the component matrix to mitigate the uniqueness problem. For the optimal rank and constraint selection, we compare three types of constraints in terms of the computational time, reconstruction ratio, and Corcondia score. With various statistical and tensor decomposition analyses, we find dominant factors that influence on a strong password. In addition, we extend our tensor decomposition-based model for strength retrieval when a new password needs to be evaluated. This strength retrieval model can estimate the strength of the new password input quickly and provide recommendations to strengthen the password. We hope that our model based on data science perspective can validate widely accepted password composition policy and suggestion methods, and further provide insights to designing better password suggestion systems and password composition policies.}

These ranges provide a platform for conducting cybersecurity exercises; however, conducting such exercises is a complex process because they involve people with different skill sets for the scenario modeling, infrastructure preparation, dry run, execution, and evaluation. This process is very complex and inefficient in terms of time and resources. Moreover, the exercise infrastructure created in current cyber ranges does not reflect the dynamic environment of real-world systems and does not provide adaptability for changing requirements. To tackle these issues, we developed a system that can automate many tasks of the cybersecurity exercise life cycle. We used model-driven approaches to (1) model the roles of the different teams present in the cybersecurity exercises and (2) generate automation artifacts to execute their functions efficiently in an autonomous manner. By executing different team roles such as attackers and defenders, we can add friction in the environment, making it dynamic and realistic. We conducted case studies in the form of operational cybersecurity exercises involving national-level cybersecurity competitions and a university class setting in Norway to evaluate our developed system for its efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, and skill improvement of the exercise participants. In the right conditions, our proposed system could create a complex cybersecurity exercise infrastructure involving 400 nodes with customized vulnerabilities, emulated attackers, defenders, and traffic generators under 40 minutes. It provided a realistic environment for cybersecurity exercises and positively affected the exercise participants’ skill sets.}

	abstract = {To counter software reverse engineering or tampering, software obfuscation tools can be used. However, such tools to a large degree hard-code how the obfuscations are deployed. They hence lack resilience and stealth in the face of many attacks. To counter this problem, we propose the novel concept of flexible obfuscators, which implement protections in terms of data structures and APIs already present in the application to be protected. The protections are hence tailored to the application in which they are deployed, making them less learnable and less distinguishable. In our research, we concretized the flexible protection concept for opaque predicates. We designed an interface to enable the reuse of existing data structures and APIs in injected opaque predicates, we analyzed their resilience and stealth, we implemented a proof-of-concept flexible obfuscator, and we evaluated it on a number of real-world use cases. This paper presents an in-depth motivation for our work, the design of the interface, an in-depth security analysis, and a feasibility report based on our experimental evaluation. The findings are that flexible opaque predicates indeed provide strong resilience and improved stealth, but also that their deployment is costly, and that they should hence be used sparsely to protect only the most security-sensitive code fragments that do not dominate performance. Flexible obfuscation therefor delivers an expensive but also more durable new weapon in the ever ongoing software protection arms race.}

	abstract = {With the growing number of vulnerabilities while attacks are becoming more advanced, known software security vulnerabilities need to be managed more efficiently with prioritization and contextualization. The current industry standard approach towards vulnerability management at a large scale is limited for two reasons. First, it does not automatically capture the temporal characteristics of the Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) (i.e., how CVEs change over time). Second, it requires manual labor to prioritize identified vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, this research designs a context-aware vulnerability prioritization (CAVP) model to calculate temporal-enabled vulnerability scores of CVEs and prioritize these vulnerabilities visually. The CAVP model includes an enhanced Context-Aware Vulnerability Scoring System (CAVSS) that automatically derives temporal metric values of CVEs through a set of expert-validated heuristic rules. The CAVP model is the first attempt to provide a step-by-step process of vulnerability prioritization that can be integrated within the risk management workflow of an organization. The implementation of the CAVP model in two organizations validates its usefulness.}

	abstract = {Learning discriminative features with adversarial behaviors can be extremely challenging to build a robust learning model. This is partly evidenced by the difficulties in training robust maximum-margin models (e.g., ArcFace and CosFace) that cannot discriminate decision boundaries between perturbed samples perfectly. One potential approach is to design a loss function that achieves robust generalization by learning high-density features in the latent space to discriminate between adversarial and legitimate samples effectively. Therefore, we propose an Ensemble Maximum-Margin Softmax (EMMS) method to construct a robust generalization that yields reliable models. Specifically, EMMS is designed to address the limitation in maximum-margin methods and induce high-density discriminative features for clean and adversarial settings. The empirical experiments using the CIFAR and SVHN datasets show that EMMS is more robust in terms of accuracy and error rates than other peer techniques. The outcomes suggest that EMMS could improve the robustness of the model compared with ArcFace and CosFace under various types of attacks.}

A 10-month field intervention with 826 corporate trainees who received daily newspapers covering privacy and security articles. Our findings show that it is possible to increase employee knowledge of security and privacy, and in turn positively affect their usage of information protective settings over time through repeated, perceived-to-be-mandatory information exposure.

The results suggest organizations need holistic employee compliance programs, where in addition to developing policies, as well as compliance testing and sanctions, they provide repeated information exposure.}

Such a masterkey is directly researched from a cancelable biometric database, but we also investigate another scenario in which the masterkey is fixed before the creation of the cancelable biometric database, providing additional access rights in the system for the masterkey’s owner. Experimental results are realized on three biometric databases: the fingerprint database FVC, the face image database LFW and the ECG database PTB.

However, these techniques are vulnerable to Adversarial Examples (AEs), i.e., carefully crafted samples designed by an attacker to be misclassified by the target model. In this work, we propose a general method to produce AEs from existing malware, which is useful to increase the robustness of ML-based models. Our method dynamically introduces unused blocks (caves) in malware binaries, preserving their original functionality. Then, by using optimization techniques based on Genetic Algorithms, we determine the most adequate content to place in such code caves to achieve misclassification. We evaluate our model in a black-box setting with a well-known state-of-the-art architecture (MalConv), resulting in a successful evasion rate of 97.99 % from the 2k tested malware samples. Additionally, we successfully test the transferability of our proposal to commercial AV engines available at VirusTotal, showing a reduction in the detection rate for the crafted AEs. Finally, the obtained AEs are used to retrain the ML-based malware detector previously evaluated, showing an improve on its robustness.}

	abstract = {Ransomware has risen to be among the top cyber threats in recent years. There is an alarming trend of ransomware stealing data in addition to locking files. Compared to traditional ransomware, this new data-selling ransomware can be more harmful to the victims facing the data leakage threat. Traditional wisdom of defensive measures such as data backup is less effective in preventing the attacker from making money by selling data. We propose two preventive measures designed to defend against the data-selling ransomware, i.e., preventive data encryption and preventive data deception. Users may form a preventive portfolio made up of the two preventive measures. We contribute a novel game theoretical model of the data-selling ransomware to study the equilibrium strategies of the attacker and victims. The equilibrium solution of the portfolio and tradeoff analysis of both data encryption and deception are particularly useful for the users to optimize their system to defend against ransomware attacks. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the preventive portfolio, which maximizes user utility while significantly reducing the profit of the attacker.}

	abstract = {The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast protocol is one of the latest compulsory advances in air surveillance. While it supports the tracking of the ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel multivariate anomaly detection model called Contextual Auto-Encoder (CAE). It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising or descending) during its training. To illustrate the CAE’s efficiency, an evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as realistically crafted trajectory modifications, with which the CAE as well as three anomaly detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the CAE achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset, the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an online repository, thereby enabling replicability and facilitating future experiments.}

However, when data is breached, how do individuals know whether the organisation took reasonable steps to protect their data? When breached organisations notify affected individuals, this communication is likely to be one of the few windows into the incident from the outside and can become an important artefact for research. This desktop study aimed to consider the extent to which publicly available Australian data breach communications reflect data privacy and security best practices. This paper presents a brief review of literature and government guidance on data security and privacy best practices, along with the results of a qualitative content analysis of 33 publicly available Australian data breach communications. This analysis illustrated that there was little reflection of data privacy and security practices. Literature, government guidance and the content analysis were used to inform and develop a new voluntary framework for organisations. This consists of a series of evaluation questions divided into two broad categories: responsible data management and responsible portrayal of the breach. The framework has the potential to help organisations plan the inclusion of data privacy and security management aspects in their data breach communications. This could assist organisations to address their legal and ethical responsibility to account for their actions in managing privacy and security of the personal data they hold.}

	abstract = {PowerShell is an important tool used to automate administrative tasks. It is an open-source tool that is pre-installed on Windows machines and is accessible on many other operating systems. Administrators generally utilize PowerShell to carry out a range of typical management tasks, such as adding and deleting accounts, editing groups, and accessing hard-to-find user information. However, researchers recently found that PowerShell was used to execute various attacks. These attacks leveraged PowerShell’s vast number of properties to access privileged information, gain control of entire machines or spread over an organization. Because of the obfuscation and complex natures of these malicious scripts, detection is costly and difficult. Here, we present Malicious PowerShell Script Autodetect (MPSAutodetect), a detection model that relies on machine learning techniques to detect malicious PowerShell scripts. Our model was built with the use of stacked denoising auto-encoders (SdAs) to extract meaningful features. These valuable, easily attained features were fed to the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier. Two substantial datasets (labelled and unlabelled) were collected to train and test MPSAutodetect in supervised and semi-supervised manners. The dataset contained malicious and benign obfuscated scripts. The results showed that regardless of the features extracted from the SdA, the supervised approach resulted in better detection, with a significant 98% true-positive rate and a low 0.6% false-positive rate. Thus, the analysis of MPSAutodetect showed that the model achieves respectable performance without the hassling process of manual feature engineering.}

As a result, this study proposes a feature section architecture, namely FeSA, independent of the underlying classification algorithm and aims to find a set of features that will improve the longevity of the machine learning classifier. The feature set produced by FeSA is evaluated by creating scenarios in which concept drift is presented to our trained model. Based on our results, the generated feature set remains robust and maintains high detection rates of ransomware malware. Throughout this paper, we will refer to the true-positive rate of ransomware as detection; this is to clearly define what we focus on, as the high true positive rate for ransomware is the main priority. Our architecture is compared to other nature-inspired feature selection algorithms such as evolutionary search, genetic search, harmony search, best-first search and the greedy stepwise feature selection algorithm. Our results show that FeSA displays the least degradation on average when exposed to concept drift. FeSA is evaluated based on ransomware detection rate, recall, false positives and precision. The FeSA architecture provides a feature set that shows competitive recall, false positives and precision under concept drift while maintaining the highest detection rate from the algorithms it has been compared to.}

	abstract = {There exists a never-ending “arms race” between malware analysts and adversarial malicious code developers as malevolent programs evolve and countermeasures are developed to detect and eradicate them. Malware has become more complex in its intent and capabilities over time, which has prompted the need for constant improvement in detection and defence methods. Of particular concern are the anti-analysis obfuscation techniques, such as packing and encryption, that are employed by malware developers to evade detection and thwart the analysis process. In such cases, malware is generally impervious to basic analysis methods and so analysts must use more invasive techniques to extract signatures for classification, which are inevitably not scalable due to their complexity. In this article, we present a hybrid framework for malware classification designed to overcome the challenges incurred by current approaches. The framework incorporates novel static and dynamic malware analysis methods, where static malware executables and dynamic process memory dumps are converted to images mapped through space-filling curves, from which visual features are extracted for classification. The framework is less invasive than traditional analysis methods in that there is no reverse engineering required, nor does it suffer from the obfuscation limitations of static analysis. On a dataset of 13,599 obfuscated and non-obfuscated malware samples from 23 families, the framework outperformed both static and dynamic standalone methods with precision, recall and accuracy scores of 97.6%, 97.6% and 97.6% respectively.}

More specifically, we introduce a semi-automated methodology based on topic modeling, to discover relevant topics from our dataset of 99 relevant SE research articles. We find 24 topics discussing the use of SVDBs in SE domain. The results shows that i) topics describing the use of SVDBs range from security empirical (case) studies to tools for generating security test cases; ii) the majority of the surveyed papers cover a limited number of software engineering contributions or activities (e.g., maintenance) and iii) that most of the surveyed articles rely on only one SVDB as their knowledge source.

	abstract = {Since malware creates severe damage to the system, past studies leveraged various algorithms to detect malicious domains generated from Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). Although they achieved a promising performance, security practitioners had to acquire a large amount of fine-labeled dataset with a particular effort. Throughout the research, we propose a series of analysis to build a novel malicious domain detection method with the autoencoder in an unsupervised approach to overcome this limit. The contributions of our study are as follows. First, we proposed significant feature extraction methods that focused on the domain’s linguistic patterns and validated the proposed set of features effectively discriminate benign domains and malicious domains. Second, we established a malicious domain detection method with the autoencoder only with benign domains provided during the model training. Thus, we let a security practitioner build a malicious domain detection model with less labeling effort. Third, the proposed malicious domain detection model achieved a precise detection performance of 99% accuracy and F1 score. Lastly, our model maintains the aforementioned detection performance, although it is trained with a small training set; thus, the model reduces training dataset accumulation effort. Although our detection model cannot identify malicious domains’ origins, particular types of DGA, we evaluate security practitioners can easily implement a countermeasure against DGAs with less effort. In pursuit of precise malicious domain detection, we expect our study can be a concrete baseline for future works.}

	abstract = {Darknet traffic classification is crucial for identifying anonymous network applications and defensing cyber crimes. Although notable research efforts have been dedicated to classifying darknet traffic by combining machine learning algorithms and elaborately designed features, current methods either heavily depend on hand-crafted features or overlook the global intrinsic relationships among the local features automatically extracted from different data positions, leading to limited classification performance. To tackle this issue, we propose DarknetSec, a novel self-attentive deep learning method for darknet traffic classification and application identification. Concretely, DarknetSec utilizes a cascaded model with a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture local spatial-temporal features from the payload content of packets, while the self-attention mechanism is integrated into the abovementioned feature extraction network to mine the intrinsic relationships and hidden connections among the previously extracted content features. In addition, DarknetSec extracts side-channel features from payload statistics to enhance its classification performance. We evaluate DarknetSec on the CICDarknet2020 dataset, which is a representative of darknet traffic covering both Virtual Private Network (VPN) and The Onion Router (Tor) applications. Thorough experiments show that DarknetSec is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving a multiclass accuracy of 92.22% and a macro-F1-score of 92.10%. Additionally, DarknetSec maintains its high accuracy when applied to other encrypted traffic classification tasks.}

	abstract = {The IoT cloud computing paradigm is emerging for IoT applications. In such a paradigm, how to guarantee non-repudiation service provisioning has attracted research efforts recently. While existing solutions could work for distributed IoT cloud applications, storage, computation, and economic cost is still a practical challenging concern. In this paper, we propose a new, cost-lower non-repudiation scheme for IoT cloud applications. The proposed scheme guarantees that neither the IoT client nor the cloud could repudiate a service enjoyment and provisioning. Specifically, the proposed scheme employs a blockchain to achieve non-repudiation. First, when the cloud provides a service, it encrypts the service, stores a cryptographic hash digest of the encrypted service on the blockchain, and then sends the encrypted service to the IoT client. Second, the IoT client needs to acknowledge the hash digest on the blockchain to obtain the service. Third, the cloud sends the decryption key to the blockchain under the IoT client’s public key to finish a service provisioning. We show that the proposed scheme achieves non-repudiation fairly. We prototyped, evaluated, and open-sourced the proposed scheme. Experimental results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed scheme and the speedup compared with the state-of-the-art solution.}

	abstract = {Code reuse attacks (CRAs), such as return-oriented programming (ROP) and jump-oriented programming (JOP) attacks, have become a great threat to the runtime security of ARM-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Attackers can utilize CRAs to hijack the control flow of programs in ARM-based IoT devices to make them perform malicious actions without injecting any codes. Control flow integrity (CFI) is an important cornerstone for the security of ARM-based IoT devices, as it enforces the correct control flow of devices and defends against CRAs. However, coarse-grained CFI schemes suffer from security issues, like key leakage and coarse-grained protection, which allows attackers to bypass their defenses. Meanwhile, fine-grained CFI schemes bring high overhead and have the multi-to-one problem. In this paper, we propose FH-CFI, a fine-grained hardware-assisted CFI scheme to help ARM-based IoT devices resist refined CRAs without leaking their encryption/decryption keys. We utilize hash-based message authentication codes to protect the return addresses from being changed, thus resisting ROP attacks without key leakage. Moreover, we encrypt instructions at target sites with the call sites’ information to defeat JOP attacks in fine-grained. Additionally, we have designed a diverter to solve the multi-to-one problem that exists in fine-grained CFI schemes. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the security of our FH-CFI. Experimental evaluations on ARM-based IoT devices show that FH-CFI has greater effectiveness and stronger security than existing state-of-the-art CFI schemes, with few additional overheads.}

The traditional password recovery system is mainly based on CPUs and GPUs, which have low cracking efficiency and cannot meet the computing needs of users. Therefore, this paper proposes a cognitively reconfigurable mimic-based heterogeneous password recovery system. Applying the concept of mimic computing, a multidimensional and reconfigurable hybrid heterogeneous system is established through the use of CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, which works by coordinating software and hardware to improve the system’s computing ability and range of solution types to meet diverse cracking needs. Second, high-performance password recovery and password generation algorithms that run on FPGAs are designed to expedite the calculation and verification of passwords. Third, a hierarchical password database is established to realize dynamic feedback and updating of passwords, aiming for various application scenarios and improving password recovery efficiency. Finally, through task perception and decision-making reasoning and with dynamic structural transformation and load balancing, the computing potential of the system is fully mobilized so that the entire system can efficiently complete the encryption recovery task. Experimental analysis and results show that compared with traditional CPU and GPU systems, our system exhibits significantly improved recovery efficiency and can better support heterogeneous systems, with high scalability and energy efficiency.}

Though several intrusion detection methods have been introduced in the past years, developing an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with prevailing intrusion detection strategy is still very much desirable. Hence, a robust and effective intrusion detection approach, named RV coefficient+Exponential Sea Lion Optimization-enabled Deep Residual Network (ExpSLO-enabled DRN) using spark is devised for the intrusion detection. Here, the unique features are selected using proposed RV coefficient-based hybrid feature fusion, which is designed by the incorporation of wrapper, class-wise information gain (CIG), and Canberra distance in slave node. With the distinctive features selected, the process of data augmentation is done using oversampling for making the data more appropriate to perform the further process in the slave node. Moreover, DRN classifier is utilized for detecting the intrusions in the master node where the DRN training is done using devised ExpSLO algorithm, which is the hybridization of Exponentially Weighted Moving average (EWMA) and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). Furthermore, the devised method obtained better performance by considering the evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F-measure with the higher values of 0.8800, 0.8845, and 0.8822 based on without attacks using dataset-2.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed how we interact with the world around us. Many devices are moving from offline to online mode, connecting between them and the Internet, offering more functionality to users. Despite the increase in the quality of life for users provided by IoT devices, it is also necessary to establish trust in the privacy and security of end-users. With this level of connectivity, the amount of data exchanged between devices also increases, inducing malicious activities. One of the main problems is the lack of regulation in the IoT industry, especially between different manufacturers. There are no formal security rules, and manufacturers may not choose to install security mechanisms. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the adoption of security measures. One way to do this is by using IoT devices and systems certification. In recent years, IoT certifications have emerged. Meanwhile, the European Union has passed the Cyber Security Act to unify and regulate security certifications in member states. Our work collects the requirements that different IoT environments and application scenarios impose on certifications and discusses the current certifications’ status according to those requirements. In addition, we also explored how EU measures apply to IoT and, where applicable, how certifications implement them, highlighting future research challenges.}

	abstract = {Due to the widespread expansion of the Android malware industry, malicious Android processes mining became a necessity to understand their behavior. Nevertheless, due to the complexities of size, length, and associations of some essential and distinguishing Android applications’ features such as API calls and system calls, mining malicious Android processes become a prominent obstacle. The malicious process mining obstacle is also coupled with the increasing rate of zero-day attacks, with no prior knowledge about those kinds of behaviors. Hence, malware detection alone is no longer enough; instead, we need new methodologies to predict malicious behaviors early. In this paper, we propose a behavioral Android malware smell predictor model. Our model relies on various static and dynamic features. We overcame the problem of massive feature size and complex associations by encapsulating related features in a few cluster classes. Accordingly, the cluster classes are exchangeably used to represent the features in the original calling sequences. Regarding substantially long sequences, experimental results showed that our model could predict whether a process is behaving maliciously or not based on rapid-sequence-snapshot analysis. The proposed model counted on the LSTM model to classify the reformed API and system call sequences snapshots. Moreover, we used ensemble machine learning classifiers to classify Android permissions. We trained the LSTM model using random snapshots of the newly formed API and system call cluster sequences. We tested our model against common ransomware attacks. We found that our trained LSTM model showed stable performance at a particular snapshot size. The model showed competitive accuracy in predicting new sequences. Accordingly, we proposed an early alarm solution for blocking malicious payloads instead of identifying them after their fulfillment. Hence, we can avoid the cost of future damage.}

	abstract = {In the machine learning-based detection model, the detection accuracy tends to be proportional to the quantity and quality of the training dataset. The machine learning-based SSH detection model’s performance is affected by the size of the training dataset and the ratio of target classes. However, in an actual network environment within a short period, it is inconvenient to collect a sufficient and diverse training dataset. Even though many training data samples are collected, it takes a lot of effort and time to prepare the training dataset through data classification. To overcome these limitations, we generate sophisticated samples using the WGAN-GP algorithm and present how to select samples by comparing generator loss. The synthetic training dataset with generated samples improves the performance of the SSH detection model. Furthermore, we add the new features to include the distinction of inter-packet arrival time. The enhanced SSH detection model decreases false positives and provides a 0.999 F\n1\n-score by applying the synthetic dataset and the packet inter-arrival time features.}

Such businesses are enmeshed with the wider societies in which they operate. Using data gathered from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 15 Chief Information Security Officers, as well as six senior organisational leaders, we show that the work of political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, particularly Leviathan, offers a useful lens through which to understand the context of these functions and of cyber security in Western society. Our findings indicate that cyber security within these businesses demonstrates a number of Hobbesian features that are further implicated in, and provide significant benefits to, the wider Leviathan-esque state. These include the normalisation of intrusive controls, such as surveillance, and the stimulation of consumption. We conclude by suggesting implications for cyber-security practitioners, in particular, the reflexivity that these perspectives offer, as well as for businesses and other researchers.}

	abstract = {As network techniques rapidly evolve, attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and threatening. Network intrusion detection has been widely accepted as an effective method to deal with network threats. Many approaches have been proposed, exploring different techniques and targeting different types of traffic. Anomaly-based network intrusion detection is an important research and development direction of intrusion detection. Despite the extensive investigation of anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques, there lacks a systematic literature review of recent techniques and datasets. We follow the methodology of systematic literature review to survey and study 119 top-cited papers on anomaly-based intrusion detection. Our study rigorously and comprehensively investigates the technical landscape of the field in order to facilitate subsequent research within this field. Specifically, our investigation is conducted from the following perspectives: application domains, data preprocessing and attack-detection techniques, evaluation metrics, coauthor relationships, and datasets. Based on the research results, we identify unsolved research challenges and unstudied research topics from each perspective, respectively. Finally, we present several promising high-impact future research directions.}

	abstract = {Cyberattack simulations appear across multiple computer security domains and are interpreted in many different but equally viable ways. However, this makes the topic appear fragmented and inconsistent, making it challenging to identify and communicate relevant research. Therefore, this article contributes to a unified baseline by presenting the results of a systematic literature review. The review targeted attack simulations published between 1999 and 2019, specifically those exploring which specific steps result in successful attacks. The search initially produced 647 articles, later reduced to 11 key contributions. Despite being scattered across application domains, their general aims, contributions, and problem statements were remarkably similar. This was despite them generally not citing each other or a common body of work. However, the attack simulations differed in implementation details, such as modeling techniques, attacker decision-making, and how time is incorporated. How to construct a fully unified view of the entire topic is still somewhat unclear, particularly from the 11 articles. However, the results presented here should help orient practitioners and researchers interested in attack simulations regarding both present and future work. Particularly since, despite the seemingly implausible sample, the cumulative evidence suggests that attack simulations have yet to be pursued as a distinct research topic.}

	abstract = {Adversarial attacks have stimulated research interests in the field of deep learning security. In terms of autonomous driving technology, instance segmentation can help autonomous vehicles identify a drivable area in a driving environment and a traffic accident will happen once instance segmentation is attacked by adversarial examples. However, only few studies have been done on adversarial attacks about instance segmentation. It would be more meaningful and more practical to research adversarial attacks against instance segmentation. In this paper, we propose the improved Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to produce adversarial examples on the total loss of You Only Look At CoefficienT (YOLACT) instance segmentation. Firstly, we design the loss function and calculate the adversarial gradient. Then we propose the improved PGD. Finally, we obtain adversarial examples of YOLACT instance segmentation. Our attack method is efficient and powerful in both white-box and black-box attack settings, and is applicable in a variety of neural network architectures. On COCO 2017, under white-box attacks, our method achieves 1.14% box mean average precision (mAP) and 1.50% mask mAP on YOLACT with ResNet101 backbone. We also compare the similarity between clean images and adversarial examples among three different backbones and compare the operation time among three different backbones. We also find that box regression loss, classification loss and mask loss are also effective separately for generating adversarial examples. Our research will provide inspiration for further efforts in efficient and effective defense methods on instance segmentation.}

	abstract = {Ransomware has emerged as one of the most concerned cyber risks in recent years, which has caused millions of dollars monetary loss over the world. It typically demands a certain amount of ransom payment within a limited timeframe to decrypt the encrypted victim’s files. This paper explores whether the ransomware should be paid in a novel game-theoretic model from the perspective of Bayesian game. In particular, the new model analyzes the ransom payment strategies within the framework of incomplete information for both hacker and victim. Our results show that there exist pure and randomized Bayesian Nash equilibria under some mild conditions for the hacker and victim. The sufficient conditions that when the ransom should be paid are presented when an organization is compromised by the ransomware attack. We further study how the costs and probabilities of cracking or recovering affect the expected payoffs of the hacker and the victim in the equilibria. In particular, it is found that the backup option for computer files is not always beneficial, which actually depends on the related cost. Moreover, it is discovered that fake ransomware may be more than expected because of the potential high payoffs. Numerical examples are also presented for illustration.}

	abstract = {Dynamic malware detection executes the software in a secured virtual environment and monitors its run-time behavior. This technique widely uses API sequence analysis to identify whether the running software is malicious or not. However, existing solutions typically only consider the API name or frequency of API usage, and the feature mining of API sequence is not sufficient, which leads some malware to escape from being detected. In this paper, we propose a novel malware detection framework using deep learning models to capture and combine more meaningful features which are called intrinsic features of the API sequence. Specifically, we first apply embedding and convolutional layers to conduct a joint representation of multiple APIs to represent the software behavior. Secondly, we use the category, action, and operation object of the API to represent the semantic information of each API call. Finally, we use the Bi-LSTM module to mine the relationship information between APIs. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.9731 and an F1-score of 0.9724 on a large real dataset, which outperforms baselines significantly. We also conduct ablation studies to prove the effectiveness of our intrinsic features.}

These remote services use their up-to-date information and global context (view) to help classify the files and instruct their agents to take a predetermined action (e.g., delete or quarantine). In this study, we provide a security analysis of a specific form of communication between anti-malware agents and their services, which takes place entirely over the insecure DNS protocol. These services, which we denote DNS anti-malware list (DNSAML) services, affect the classification of files scanned by anti-malware agents, therefore potentially putting their consumers at risk due to known integrity and confidentiality flaws of the DNS protocol. By analyzing a large-scale DNS traffic dataset made available to the authors by a well-known CDN provider, we identify anti-malware solutions that seem to make use of DNSAML services. We found that these solutions, deployed on almost three million machines worldwide, exchange hundreds of millions of DNS requests daily. These requests carry sensitive file scan information, often - as we demonstrate - without any additional safeguards to compensate for the insecurities of the DNS protocol. As a result, these anti-malware solutions that use DNSAML are vulnerable to DNS attacks. For instance, an attacker capable of tampering with DNS queries gains the ability to alter the classification of scanned files, without a presence on the scanning machine. We showcase three attacks applicable to at least three anti-malware solutions that could result in the disclosure of sensitive information and improper behavior by the anti-malware agent, such as ignoring detected threats. Finally, we propose and review a set of countermeasures for anti-malware solution providers to prevent attacks stemming from the use of DNSAML services.}
