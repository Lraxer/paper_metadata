	abstract = {Authoritative domain name servers (referred to as authoritative servers) play a critical role in the Domain Name System (DNS) by resolving domain names to specific IP or CNAME records, ensuring seamless internet access. However, misconfigurations in authoritative servers can introduce risks to domain name resolution. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to analyze and evaluate the configuration risks of authoritative servers. We develop a tool called “AuthDetect” to detect configuration anomalies in authoritative servers, and leveraging this tool, we conduct anomaly detection and analyze resolution risks from three perspectives: resolution latency, content, and reliability. Our evaluation indicates that 90% of the domains have a favorable overall resolution risk (below 0.13), but varying levels of risks exist: (1) 60% face resolution latency risk, (2) only 8.33% of domain names exhibit content risk, and (3) almost all domain names (99.8%) experience resolution reliability risk, primarily due to inadequate server configuration. These findings offer valuable data support for domain name managers, providing insights into the current configuration status of authoritative servers and contributing to maintaining a healthy and stable DNS system operation.}

	abstract = {IPv6 over Low-powered Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) has grown in importance in recent years, with the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) emerging as a major enabler. However, RPL can be subject to attack, with severe consequences. Most proposed IDSs have been limited to specific RPL attacks and typically assume a stationary environment. In this article, we propose the first adaptive hybrid IDS to efficiently detect and identify a wide range of RPL attacks (including DIO Suppression, Increase Rank, and Worst Parent attacks, which have been overlooked in the literature) in evolving data environments. We apply our framework to networks under various levels of node mobility and maliciousness. We experiment with several incremental machine learning (ML) approaches and various ‘concept-drift detection’ mechanisms (e.g. ADWIN, DDM, and EDDM) to determine the best underlying settings for the proposed scheme.}

	abstract = {Epidemiological investigation is a crucial method to deal with epidemics (e.g., COVID-19), and the location data in the epidemiological investigation is widely used to determine close contacts. Through the analysis of the location data of the respondents and the diagnosis point data, it can effectively determine the close contacts and then promote the prevention and control of the epidemic. Due to the sensitivity of location data, the direct release and epidemiological investigation of location data will cause social panic and seriously threaten to personal privacy. Therefore, two aspects need to be considered in epidemiological investigation: the location privacy of responder and the location privacy of the diagnosis point. Focusing on the above two privacy requirements, we propose a bidirectional location privacy protection scheme based on oblivious transfer. Firstly, we introduce the Hilbert curve into Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) to encode the position of the diagnosis point. Then the Bloom filter is used to perturb the encode of diagnosis point to ensure the location privacy of CDCP. Secondly, 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol is carried on between the CDCP and the responder to achieve screening of close contacts. At the same time, the bidirectional privacy protection of the location between CDCP and respondents has been ensured. Security analysis and performance analysis prove that the overall scheme is secure, feasible, and efficient.}

The study proposed AdKNN, a composition of k's nearest neighbour, an enhanced Adam's optimiser in this paper. The KNN in AdKNN is for the early detection of the botnet within the AMI networks, while the new Adam-based optimiser is responsible for optimising AdKNN. An extensive experiment has demonstrated that our model AdKNN is efficient and effective for botnet classification in AMI networks on the publicly available dataset for IoT-botnet detection evaluated on AMI network dataset compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

	abstract = {Recurrent networks have been adopted as default architecture in approaches performing sequence modelling of network intrusion detection problems. However, models based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture have some limitations regarding computation complexity and detection performance due to information loss. Recent studies suggested that certain convolutional-based architectures that can natively process temporal data outperform recurrent networks in time series modelling, such as speech synthesis and machine translation. Inspired by the success of temporal-based convolutional architectures in other domains, this paper designs and implements four temporal-based convolutional models in network intrusion detection and studies their classification performance. The models are based on MINImally RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (MiniRocket), eXplainable Convolutional Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Classification (XCM), One-Dimensional Convolution Neural Network (OS-CNN), and Time Series Transformer (TST) architecture. We evaluate our models using the effectiveness and efficiency metrics based on CICDDoS2019 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Every model has achieved a high evaluation performance in the range between 98.07% and 99.99% in most considered metrics using the test dataset. MiniRocket and OS-CNN obtained the highest evaluation results regarding the effectiveness metrics. The high evaluation results suggest that they can improve the detection effectiveness of approaches formulating network intrusion detection as a time series task.}

Machine Learning (ML) methods are widely applied to attack classification on encrypted traffic owing to no need for manual analysis. However, existing studies only concentrate on basic statistical features and cannot obtain the crucial attack behaviors hiding in the encrypted traffic. Worse still, attackers constantly update attack vectors to evade detection, which means outdated features extracted from historical traffic fail to recognize unseen attacks.}

	abstract = {With the wide applications of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, current research shows their serious security risks due to the lack of privacy protection. Observing the DNN's outputs allows the adversary to perform a membership inference attack (MIA, i.e., infer the training dataset's attributes) or a model stealing attack (MSA, i.e., replicate the model's functionality by training a clone). Several defense solutions against the above attacks have been proposed. However, most of them are still limited from three aspects: defense generality, efficiency, and model accuracy. To overcome the challenges, we propose GONE, a Generic\nO\n_\n(1) NoisE layer added behind any DNNs' output layer at the testing phase, which differs from previous work in three key aspects: (1) generic - it not only protects model privacy but also resists adversarial attacks; (2) efficient - it only takes\nO\n(1) complexity through blurring the probability distribution; (3) accuracy-keep - it does not affect the model classification performance of clean data due to its monotonic. We evaluate GONE on several popular DNNs and demonstrate its outperformance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. After implementing GONE on DNNs, the membership inference accuracy of MIA drops from 0.8170 to 0.0620 measured by F1 score, and the prediction accuracy of the stolen model obtained through MSA drops from 0.7710 to 0.1970. Besides, GONE achieves superior performance in defending against score-based adversarial attacks, with the average attack success rate dropping from 0.8700 to 0.0590.

Also, attacks that seek to alter their settings, change their behavior and exhaust their resources are very common. Access control solutions help considerably IoT systems to efficiently cope with these attacks and ensure the required security level. In this paper, we survey the most relevant IoT access control solutions starting from the basic centralized ones to the more modern and distributed solutions that rely on emerging technologies such as blockchain and fog computing. Additionally, our work offers a spotlight on the IoT inter-organizational access control solutions. We demystify the challenges, problems and benefits of each surveyed approach. Furthermore, a novel taxonomy of the access control approaches according to their architecture, underlying layers and organizational aspect is proposed.

However, managing multiple containers and providing services such as load balancing and fault tolerance is a challenging aspect. This led to the inception of Kubernetes, which allows for building resilient containerized distributed systems. The authorization process provided by Kubernetes is well-defined and thorough; however, the policies are prone to redundancy conflict. The size of an authorization policy has a direct impact on its manageability and performance of the evaluation process. Redundant rules in an access control policy increase the size of the policy and may induce unexpected side effects. In this paper, we have proposed an approach for the identification of redundancy conflicts in the authorization policies supported by Kubernetes. The proposed approach is formal and based on Event-Calculus, a logic programming formalism. The proposed approach can model different authorization modes (such as ABAC and RBAC) as supported by Kubernetes and allows for the identification of redundant policies amongst attributes, roles, and their combinations. We have provided tool support to convert the Kubernetes policyobjects to Event-Calculus models and then to automatically invoke the reasoner on the converted models and display any identified conflicts. We have also detailed the performance evaluation results to justify the practicality of the proposed approach.}

Despite its benefits, due to the untrustworthiness of clients and the server, traditional federated learning faces the risk of privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. Privacy-preserving methods change the original model parameters whereas robust aggregation algorithms required accurate parameters. To solve such a dilemma, we propose a new framework named FedSIGN. On the one hand, it utilizes the sign of local model update to update the global model to protect privacy and improve efficiency. On the other hand, focus on the Sybil-based poisoning attack: malicious client controlled by a single adversary who directs those clients to launch a poisoning attack, we design a Poisoning Attack Detector to identify malicious clients based on the similarity between sign vectors. Experimental results show that FedSIGN resists privacy and poisoning attacks while maintaining better global model performance. Especially, FedSIGN is not affected by the number of malicious clients and is effective in both the IID and non-IID scenarios.}

Even though it offers significant potential for user convenience it is subjected to different security as well as privacy issues due to the refusal of the cloud peer to disclose their identity to others. This arise the need for an effective data exchange among different cloud peers by preserving the anonymity and data privacy of the users. Hence, an anonymous secure data exchange solution is presented in this article by employing authentication as well as key agreement (AKA) protocol. The Fuzzy Logic-Based Anonymous Identity Generation Module is used to improve the data security and user privacy of the AKA protocol by establishing mutual authentication for multiple users via the session keys. The use of the peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud system in this study offers secure and reliable storage since data is partitioned into small blocks and stored in multiple locations. The fuzzy logic model offers registration services and prevents the P2P cloud from various attacks and temporary key leakage issues using the session key. The proposed model is tested on the NIST Special Database 302, and it demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving better security and resilience against various cyber-attacks. Furthermore, it minimizes communication overhead during the authentication process and provides resistance against various cyber-attacks. In this manner, the proposed model withstands different attacks and preserves user privacy when compared to the baseline security protocols.}

	abstract = {In early 2023, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry experienced a significant advancement with the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a research product that demonstrated remarkable capabilities and garnered widespread attention. ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot powered by the Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) architecture, designed to generate human-like conversations encompassing a wide range of knowledge domains. Many AI researchers are currently engaging with the new technology to understand its functionality and limitations. Various expressions across a range of social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and numerous others, are currently under investigation. This research seeks to analyze the opinions of ChatGPT users as it regards cybersecurity. This research is important due to its contribution towards gaining enhanced understanding and devising intricate improvements for the chatbot. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is utilized to extract relevant topics from the texts. Additionally, to analyze user opinions and decipher the sentiments as either positive, negative, or neutral, we use the Natural language tool kit Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (NLTK's VADER) and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (roBERTa) libraries. The data used is obtained from Twitter via the SNScrape library, which aided in the retrieval of over 700,000 tweets via the search terms #chatgptsecurity, #chatgpthackers, #chatgptcybersecurity, and #chatgptcyberthreats. The analysis of the results by the VADER model shows 43.8% positive, 36.3% neutral, and 19.9% negative sentiments. Similarly, the roBERTa model shows 14.1% positive, 53.2% neutral, and 32.7% negative. These results show that there is an ongoing concern about ChatGPT and cybersecurity, especially in malware code generation, hacking, intelligence gathering, and phishing attacks.}

	abstract = {As the number of vulnerability databases established by various nations continues to grow, they have accumulated hundreds of thousands of security vulnerability reports, which play a crucial role in protecting system security. However, many databases are found to lack essential information, contain inaccuracies, or are inconsistent with others. Despite these challenges, the importance of vulnerability databases continues to grow. Current research on vulnerability databases is limited to software version and vulnerability reproduction, but the software names, an essential component of vulnerability databases, have not been extensively studied. Understanding the consistency of software names in different vulnerability databases is crucial for improving the accuracy of vulnerability databases.}

	abstract = {As the use of software containerisation has increased, so too has the need for security research on their usage, with various surveys and studies conducted to assess the overall security posture of software container images. To date, there has been very little work that has taken a longitudinal view of container security to observe whether vulnerabilities are being resolved over time, as well as understanding the real-world implications of reported vulnerabilities, to assess the evolving security posture. In this work, we study the evolution of 380 software container images across 3 analysis periods between July 2022 and January 2023 to analyse maintenance and vulnerabilities factors over time. We sample across the 3 DockerHub categories: Official, Verified and OSS (Sponsored) Open Source Software. We found that the number of vulnerabilities present increased over time despite many containers receiving regular updates by providers. We also found that the choice of container OS can dramatically impact the number of reported vulnerabilities present over time, with Debian-based images typically having many more vulnerabilities that other Linux distributions, and with some containers still reporting vulnerabilities that date back as far as 1999. However, when taking into account additional reported attributes such as the attack vector required and the existence of a public exploit rated higher than negligible, we found that for each analysis period, less than 1% of all vulnerabilities present what we would consider as high risk real-world impact. Through our investigation, we aim to improve the understanding of the threat landscape posed by software containerisation that is further complicated by the discrepancies between different vulnerability reporting tools.}

	abstract = {The transaction volume of Ethereum has been witnessing a year-on-year increase, which has unfortunately been accompanied by significant losses due to phishing scams. To enhance the ability of downstream classifiers to distinguish phishing accounts more effectively, we produce dense representations of Ethereum accounts in latent space, leveraging the transaction network topology and associated statistical features. However, the task of learning representations from sparse yet voluminous transaction records presents a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Temporal-based Sequences Generator (TSG) and the Heterogeneous-based Sequences Generator (HSG). These generators create sequences from the transaction network, optimizing the use of transaction temporal constraints, diverse account types, and transaction amounts. Our method aims to capture latent higher-order information and generate dense vectors using a network embedding technique. Furthermore, we propose a novel Statistics-Based Sampling (SBS) method to mitigate label leakage. We validate our approach through experiments with various classic downstream classifiers, demonstrating that Phish2vec surpasses other comparative methods in performance and exhibits robustness and stability.}

	abstract = {Caches are key microarchitectural components of modern processors to improve memory access speed. However, attackers can readily implement timing side-channel attacks by exploiting the inherent time difference between cache hits and misses, which brings serious security threats to computer systems. In recent years, cache attacks have achieved fruitful consequences regarding attack techniques, targets, and platforms. At the same time, in order to measure the cache vulnerability, researchers have been looking at verifying the security policies and have proposed a variety of evaluation metrics. However, there are certain limitations in the current metrics, such as harsh assumptions, the distinguishing ability cannot be maintained all the time, the false positive and false negative noises can not be explicitly quantified, other tools are needed, and the verification environment is difficult to reproduce. To face these issues, we proposed a set of evaluation metrics, which includes the highest score (HS), minimum rounds to disclosure (MRD), and key score scissors differential (KSSD); we give the formal expressions in practice and theoretical, respectively. In order to facilitate the accurate reproduction of the experimental environment and results, we build a dual-core RISC-V bare-metal system based on the open-source framework Chipyard. On this basis, we conduct comprehensive evaluations to exploit vulnerabilities within the RISC-V cache architecture to verify the validity of the metrics suite. Furthermore, we compared the metrics with the commonly used success rate (SR) and guessing entropy (GE). The comparison results show that our proposed metrics suite can accurately depict the effects of attacks. Moreover, KSSD can maintain discrimination and converge quickly; MRD has more practical guidance; HS can specifically describe false negative noises. Finally, we perform a theoretical evaluation of AES algorithms with different T-table implementations using the proposed metrics, analyze the system's false positive and false negative noises, and suggest how the number of cache evictions can be determined under the random replacement policy.}

	abstract = {A controller area network (CAN) has been widely deployed in automotive environments due to the decentralized environment which enables the easy control of many components in a vehicle. The CAN is now being adopted in other areas, including aviation and robots, especially unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Cyphal has been developed for years to provide communication over the CAN in UAV environments. For instance, the plug-and-play mode of Cyphal enables the automated configuration of the unique source IDs to nodes on the CAN bus. This reduces the overhead to assign static nodes to each node newly attached to the CAN bus. As such a configuration may occur the collision of the frames to the small size of the source ID, Cyphal currently recommends the use of such features only for non-critical applications. While attaching a new node to the CAN bus needs the authentication process to prevent the unauthorized devices attached and used by adversaries, Cyphal does not consider such security issues. To address these issues, we propose a security design to improve the robustness and security of the plug-and-play mode in Cyphal. Our proposal provides the collision avoidance and authentication of modules. To give efficiency in lightweight modules, our design uses the symmetric key-based method. We evaluate how the collision is avoided in our design compared to Cyphal, and also analyze the security of our proposal. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is effective in enabling the plug-and-play mode of Cyphal for the critical environment.}

	abstract = {It is a challenging task to fool a text classifier based on deep neural networks under the black-box setting where the target model can only be queried. Among the existing black-box attacks, decision-based methods have a large query cost due to exponential perturbation space and greedy search strategy. Transfer-based methods, on the other hand, tend to overfit the surrogate model and thus fail when applied to unknown target models. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective adversarial attack framework for black-box transformer-based models, thereby exposing vulnerabilities within large language models. Specifically, we leverage a fine-tuned large language model as a white-box surrogate model and optimize a distribution of adversarial text. This distribution is parameterized by a continuous-valued matrix based upon the surrogate model. To avoid overfitting of the distribution and improve its adversarial transferability, we incorporate an additional causal language model into our framework as a constraint model. Based on this constraint model, we add language model perplexity and semantic consistency as regularization terms during the distribution training process. To further reduce the number of queries to the target model, i.e., improve the threat level of examples drawn from our distribution, we employ a geometric loss strategy to ensure that the distribution training process learns the optimal perturbation. Extensive experimental studies have been carried out on benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvement on the performance and query efficiency under black-box setting in comparison with well-established approaches. Our approach achieves an 80.98% reduction in BERT model accuracy while consuming only 21.86% of the query times required by prior attacks.}

Their success and the security of the networks they protect depend on the accuracy of their classification results. Adversarial attacks against machine learning, which seriously threaten any IDS, are still not countered effectively. In this study, we first develop a method that employs generative adversarial networks to produce adversarial attack data. Then, we propose RAIDS, a robust IDS model, designed to be resilient against adversarial attacks. In RAIDS, an autoencoder's reconstruction error is used as a prediction value for a classifier. Also, to prevent the attacker from guessing about the feature set, multiple feature sets are created and used to train baseline machine learning classifiers. A LightGBM classifier is then trained with the results produced by two autoencoders and an ensemble of baseline machine learning classifiers. The results show that the proposed robust model can increase overall accuracy by at least 13.2% and F1-score by more than 110% against adversarial attacks without the need for adversarial training.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel non-linear fractal fractional mathematical model for analyzing the spread of malicious codes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The model incorporates fractional calculus and non-linear interactions among nodes in a WSN. It is based on the Fractal-Fractional (FF) operator, a powerful mathematical tool that combines fractional and fractal calculus. This study explores the potential of fractional derivatives in addressing computer virus-related issues and proposes a model that elucidates the spread of viruses in a vulnerable system and potential countermeasures. The Fractal-Fractional operator is utilized to fractionalize the model, and the fixed point theory of Schauder and Banach is applied to establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution. Numerical simulations, employing MATLAB and the Adams-Bashforth method, validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in capturing the propagation dynamics of malicious codes. Ulam-Hyers stability techniques are also employed for stability analysis. The model's insights contribute to enhancing the security and robustness of WSNs against malicious code propagation, paving the way for more secure network designs. This research provides a unique perspective on analyzing the dynamics of WSNs and underscores the significance of fractional derivatives in addressing security threats in network systems.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks pose significant security threats to governments and large enterprises. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) methods, which are standard solutions to combat APT attacks, can efficaciously respond to associated security threats by leveraging the semantic richness of provenance graphs and clear causality relations to resist illegal tampering. However, the large number of audit logs produced over time, which provide key supporting information for EDR methods, lead to substantial computational overhead and increased storage costs. Therefore, a robust data management framework must be developed. However, most existing reviews discuss data collection, compression, and storage methods independently. Due to the lack of a comprehensive, structured survey of data management strategies, current data management analyses tend to be separated into individual modules, making it difficult to obtain prompt and precise guidance for higher-level security analysis tasks from these analyses. In this paper, a comprehensive and structured survey of data management strategies based on provenance graphs is conducted, the core ideas of the mainstream approaches to each aspect of data management are summarized, and existing approaches are systematically classified and compared. Then, the problems with individual data management modules are investigated, and potential complementary and collaborative strategies are examined based on the insights and challenges of existing work as a basis for recommending best practices for practical deployment. Finally, an ideal data management framework is described to guide future research.}

Existing PoR schemes can support two mutually exclusive verification modes, namely either private verifiability or public verifiability, depending on whether the outsourced data is verifiable by the data owner (user) only or by everyone. In order to allow the user to flexibly designate the capability of verification, we propose a novel framework for PoR schemes that enables fine-grained control of remote data verification for cloud storage. Our idea is enabling the user to dynamically release some tokens (verification keys) to one or more third parties (designated verifiers), such that only the user and the designated verifiers can verify and retrieve the outsourced data from the server. We formalize this notion as PoR with Flexible Designated Verification (PoR-FDV), and define an extended adversarial model for PoR-FDV based on Juel et al.'s PoR model. Under the new framework, we propose a generic, simple and elegant construction of PoR-FDV from public verifiable PoR and identity-based KEM/DEM, which then gives birth to a concrete and efficient PoR-FDV scheme. Compared to existing PoR schemes, PoR-FDV provides higher flexibility and scalability, as well as many useful features.}

Recently, unobservable physiological signals (e.g., Electroencephalogram, Photoplethysmogram, Electrocardiogram) as biometrics offer a potential remedy to this problem. In particular, Photoplethysmogram (PPG) measures the change in blood flow of the human body by an optical method. Clinically, researchers commonly use PPG signals to obtain patients' blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and other information to assist in diagnosing heart-related diseases. Since PPG signals contain a wealth of individual cardiac information, researchers have begun to explore their potential in cyber security applications. The unique advantages (simple acquisition, difficult to steal, and live detection) of the PPG signal allow it to improve the security and usability of the authentication in various aspects. However, the research on PPG-based authentication is still in its infancy. The lack of systematization hinders new research in this field. We conduct a comprehensive study of PPG-based authentication and discuss these applications' limitations before pointing out future research directions.}

	abstract = {The enterprise technique for application deployment has undergone a major transformation during the past two decades. Using conventional techniques, software developers write code in a particular computing environment, frequently leading to mistakes and defects when moving it to a new computing environment. However, during the past few years, enterprises have begun to use containers & microservices to segregate infrastructure in a particular perspective and develop new models of the technology stack. Software developers could construct and deploy apps more quickly and effectively now, thanks to containerization. Despite the fact that containers have their own namespace, it is still feasible for a containerized image to attack the host system by inserting malicious software into it. This necessitates threat modeling of the container life span. During the investigation, we were able to create the elemental systematic modelling that identifies threats pertaining to container application workflow and its preliminary mitigation techniques, where attack trees are defined alongside the model, which helps academics and enthusiasts better comprehend the significance of container security. We utilize the well-known threat modeling framework, DREAD, to further advance threat modeling across the infrastructure of containers that aids in prioritizing the risks. Additionally, tools for assessing container vulnerabilities and discrete real-world exploits were researched, and approaches for security analysis in container technology were compared to the existing literature. Finally, this study brings to a conclusion by outlining the state-of-the-art survey for future research and identifying potential research topics in server-based and serverless containers.}

	abstract = {Most malware detectors rely on machine-learning approaches. However, new malware samples are growing very fast day by day, and their labeling is very expensive. Consequently, companies cannot label each sample submitted for analysis. Instead, they label certain samples and treat the remaining as benign. Unfortunately, malicious samples are mislabeled and become noisy inputs. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the detection model is diminished by the bias introduced by mislabeling. Even obfuscation and adversarial attacks make malware detection difficult sometimes. These challenges motivate us to propose a novel two-stage pipeline technique based on two distinct sample behavior specifiers. First, using dynamic analysis tools, system calls, and application programming interface (API) call traces of samples are collected. Dynamic analysis is selected since it resolves the obfuscation issue significantly compared to static analysis. Second, API and system call traces are translated into a bag of n-grams or a sequence of anomaly scores. Then, the struc2vec algorithm is used to select the best n-gram features. The sequence of anomaly scores is transformed into six meta-features. A two-stage pipeline is proposed to detect the mislabeled malware and protect the host from Black-Box attacks. Each pipeline stage has a filtering algorithm for identifying the real label of any mislabeled malware. Experimental results on the VirusTotal and Ember datasets indicate that our proposed model achieves a 0.79 Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and a 0.62 MCC for classifying over 18,000 mislabeled malware samples, respectively. Also, our proposed model performs better in comparison to the existing models.}

	abstract = {Binary Similarity Analysis (BSA) emerges as a vital approach for identifying homologous vulnerabilities. However, it is constrained by semantic incompleteness, structural differences, and false positives arising from variations in compilation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised Semantic Learning Model named SENSE for cross-platform vulnerability search. The model comprises two main components: semantic learner and graph learner. The semantic learner is pre-trained with a mask language task on a well-normalized binary corpus, enabling it to capture contextual semantic relations and generate block embedding that effectively encode the semantic features. In the graph learner, a gated graph neural network with a self-gating layer is adopted to eliminate redundant features and an adversarial loss is incorporated to enhance the robustness of function embedding across different compiler environments. Finally, SENSE is trained in an unsupervised manner using a batch-wise sampling strategy along with maximum mutual information loss. This encourages semantically similar functions to exhibit tighter embedding representations, thereby reducing false positives and improving search efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we have demonstrated that SENSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of binary search accuracy. Our results also reveal that SENSE is capable of generating robust function embedding that mitigate the differences arising from diverse architecture and optimization options.}

	abstract = {Deep learning models have been widely used in the field of vulnerability detection. Deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods can automatically learn code patterns. Some methods consider processing codes as text sequences to achieve scalable vulnerability detection. They leverage natural language processing models to extract code features. These methods do not consider the code's semantic structure and treat code slices as text. Vulnerability detection methods based on graph structures and graph neural networks are more accurate than text-based methods. However, these methods lack scalability in practice. Both graph generation and graph neural network training are all time-consuming. We propose a vulnerability detection method based on graphs and images (VulGAI). VulGAI choose the more reasonable node centrality to generate the image. It can preserve program details and distinguish node importance from different perspectives. In addition, we design a more efficient CNN model, which reduces computational overhead and improves detection performance (Time and Accuracy). We implement VulGAI and evaluate six methods (VulDePecker, SySeVR, Devign, VulCNN, mVulPreter, and VulGAI) on 40,657 functions. Experimental results show that VulGAI achieves higher Accuracy, TPR, and F1-Score than the others. In addition, we compare VulGAI and VulCNN on 30270 real-world functions. VulGAI outperforms VulCNN by 1.48 times in the number of TP. VulGAI is about 3.9 times faster than VulCNN in detection time.}

Although current deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithms have achieved good detection performance, there are still limitations in dealing with unbalanced datasets and identifying minority attacks and unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection model AE-SAC based on adversarial environment learning and soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm. First, this paper introduces an environmental agent for training data resampling to solve the imbalance problem of the original data. Second, rewards are redefined in reinforcement learning. In order to improve the recognition rate of few categories of network attacks, we set different reward values for different categories of attacks. The environment agent and classifier agent are trained adversarially around maximizing their respective reward values. Finally, a multi-classification experiment is conducted on the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets to compare with the existed excellent intrusion detection algorithms. AE-SAC achieves excellent classification performance with an accuracy of 84.15% and a f1-score of 83.97% on the NSL-KDD dataset, and an accuracy and a f1-score over 98.9% on the AWID dataset.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL), an effective distributed machine learning framework, implements model training and meanwhile protects local data privacy. It has been applied to a broad variety of practical areas due to their great performance and appreciable profits. Who really owns the model, and how to protect the copyright has become a real problem. Intuitively, the existing property rights protection methods in centralized scenarios (e.g., watermark embedding and model fingerprints) are possible solutions for FL. But they are still challenged by the distributed nature of FL in aspects of the no data sharing, parameter aggregation, and federated training settings. For the first time we formalize the problem of copyright protection for FL, and propose FedRight to protect model copyright based on model fingerprints, i.e., extracting model features by generating adversarial examples as model fingerprints. FedRight outperforms previous works in four key aspects: (i) Validity - it extracts model features to generate transferable fingerprints to train a detector to verify the copyright of the model. (ii) Fidelity - it is with imperceptible impact on the federated training, thus promises good main task performance. (iii) Robustness - it is empirically robust against malicious attack on copyright protection, i.e., fine-tuning, model pruning and adaptive attacks. (iv) Black-box - it is valid in black-box forensic scenario where only application programming interface calls to the model are available. Extensive evaluations across 3 datasets and 9 model structures demonstrate FedRight's superior fidelity, validity and robustness.}

	abstract = {Binary code vulnerability detection is an important research direction in the field of network security. The extensive reuse of open-source code has led to the spread of vulnerabilities that originally only affected a small number of targets to other software. Existing vulnerability detection methods are mainly based on binary code similarity analysis, that is, by comparing the similarity of code embedding to detect vulnerabilities. However, existing methods lack semantic understanding of binary code and cannot distinguish between different functions with similar code structures, which reduces the accuracy of vulnerability detection. This paper proposes a binary vulnerability detection method BinAIV based on function semantics. BinAIV is based on a neural network model, which defines and constructs binary function semantics to achieve more accurate similarity analysis. Experimental results show that in terms of binary code similarity analysis performance, BinAIV has a significant improvement compared to traditional methods that only use function embedding. In cross-compiler function search, cross-optimization function search, and cross-obfuscation function search experiments, the average Recall@1 value of BinAIV compared to the best-performing baseline methods increased by 40.1 %, 99.8 %, and 184.0 %. In the real-world vulnerability detection experiment, BinAIV had the highest detection accuracy for all vulnerabilities, with an improvement of 155.1 % and 97.7 % compared to Asm2Vec and SAFE, respectively.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), a network of interconnected devices, has grown and gained traction over the last few years. This paradigm can impact our lives while also providing significant economic benefits. However, although resource-constrained IoT devices offer numerous advantages, they are also vulnerable to cyberattacks. As a result, ransomware severely threatens IoT devices managing sensitive and relevant information. Solutions based on Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) that consider behavioral data have been identified as promising. However, most detection solutions have been developed for Windows-based systems, which generally have more resources than IoT devices. As a result, these solutions are not suitable for resource-constrained components. In addition, no solution compares the pros and cons of different behavioral dimensions of resource-constrained devices. Thus, this work presents a framework that combines three different behavioral sources with supervised and unsupervised ML/DL algorithms to detect and classify heterogeneous ransomware impacting resource-constrained spectrum sensors. A pool of experiments has demonstrated the suitability of the proposed solution and compared its performance with a rule-based system. In conclusion, the usage of resources combined with local outlier factor and decision tree are the most promising combinations to detect anomalies and classify ransomware while consuming CPU, RAM, and time of devices in a reduced manner.}

This research addresses the challenges associated with App-DDoS detection and presents a highly effective and adaptable solution for detecting various types of App-DDoS attacks. Motivated by the critical need for improved DDoS detection, our approach achieves dual objectives by accurately detecting both known and unknown DDoS attacks while minimizing false alarms. To achieve this, we combine Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and a human with expertise in DDoS to enhance the system's resilience against evolving attack patterns. Furthermore, we prioritize high-quality data curation by utilizing multiple datasets, CICIDS2017 and CICDDoS2019, and incorporating GMM to adapt effectively to varying data distributions over time. In addition, we propose a comprehensive feature selection strategy that addresses the false alarm rate and improves classifier performance by utilizing decision tree (DT) feature importance and the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) approach. Moreover, we adopt genetic algorithms (GA) for automated hyper-parameter optimization to ensure efficient and effective DDoS detection. Quantitative analysis shows a significant reduction in false alarms to 0.12% (52 out of 45,149 samples), with the RF classifier achieving outstanding accuracy (99.9%), precision (100%), recall (99.8%), and F1 score (99.9%).

Individuals who use the TOR network may employ obfuscated traffic to conceal their internet activity from network administrators or security systems attempting to block or monitor them. Furthermore, some may use obfuscated Tor traffic to hide illegal activities, such as buying and selling illegal goods or accessing illegal services on the dark web. Despite efforts to identify and block Tor traffic, challenges remain, such as a limited set of features for identification, leading to false positives and negatives.

Nowadays, large amounts of location data are collected by various Location-Based Services (LBS), which helps to improve the accuracy of reachability queries. Meanwhile, as many LBS systems are deployed on cloud platforms, users have huge concerns about the leakage of their location data. In this paper, we consider how to implement privacy-preserving reachability queries over private location data. We first propose SecReach, a system which can process secure reachability queries by applying Bloom filters and Homomorphic Encryption. Based on the main idea of SecReach, we propose a more efficient system, FastReach, that significantly reduces the computation costs by using Single Instruction Multiple Data operations and Z-order index. We prove the security of our systems rigorously, and demonstrate their efficiency comprehensively.}

	abstract = {Our everyday life depends more and more on online services and, therefore, access to related user accounts. The security of user accounts, again, is tied to the security of the corresponding primary and fallback authentication methods. Accounts can be linked to each other – by fallback authentication, through SSO, or by using the same authentication devices – creating an account network. These account networks enhance login comfort and are needed in case of account recovery, but they also increase each account's attack surface. In addition, misconfigurations might result in account inaccessibility. However, these problems can only be detected by analyzing single accounts first and then the resulting account networks. Despite the importance to understand account security and accessibility, almost no analysis methods exist.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) play a crucial role in maintaining network security. However, current NIDS techniques tend to neglect the topological structures of network traffic to varying degrees. This fundamental oversight leads to challenges in handling class-imbalanced and highly dynamic network traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic multi-scale topological representation (DMTR) method for improving network intrusion detection performance. Our DMTR method achieves the perception of multi-scale topology and exhibits strong robustness. It provides accurate and stable representations even in the presence of data distribution shifts and class imbalance problems. The multi-scale topology is obtained through multiple topology lenses, which reveal topological structures from different dimensional aspects. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing detection models based on static network traffic, the DMTR method also achieves dynamic topological representation through our proposed group shuffle operation (GSO) strategy. When new traffic data arrives, the topological representation is updated by preserving a portion of the original information without reprocessing all data. Experiments on four publicly available network traffic datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed DMTR method in handling class imbalanced and highly dynamic network traffic.}

	abstract = {Security authentication involves the process of verifying a person's identity. Authentication technology has played a crucial role in data security for many years. However, existing typical biometric authentication technologies exhibit limitations related to usability, time efficiency, and notably, the long-term viability of the method. Recent technological advancements have led to the development of specific devices capable of reproducing human biometrics due to their visibility and tactile nature. Consequently, there is a demand for a new biometric method to address the limitations of current authentication systems. Human brain signals have been utilized in various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Nevertheless, this approach also faces challenges related to usability, time efficiency, and most importantly, the stability of the method over time. Studies reveal that the stability of brain patterns poses a significant challenge in EEG-based authentication techniques. Stability refers to the capacity to withstand changes or disruptions, while permanency implies a lasting and unchanging state. Notably, stability can be temporary and subject to fluctuations, whereas permanency suggests a more enduring condition. Research demonstrates that utilizing alpha brainwaves is a superior option for authentication compared to other brainwave types. Many brain states lack stability in different situations. Interestingly, deep breathing can enhance alpha waves irrespective of the brain's current state. To explore the potential of utilizing deep breathing as a security pattern for authentication purposes, an experiment was conducted to investigate its effects on brain activity and its role in enhancing alpha brainwaves. By focusing on bolstering the permanency of brain patterns, our aim is to address the challenges associated with stability in EEG-based authentication techniques. The experimental results exhibited a high success rate of 91 % and 90 % for Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers, respectively. These results suggest that deep breathing not only enhances permanency but could also serve as a suitable option for a brainwave-based authentication method.}

It also unveils the attacker's intentions and operations. After identification, it is inevitable to design an efficient network attack detection model. Therefore, this work modifies the generic network forensic framework for attack investigation with two primary objectives i.e., Analysis and detection of attacks. In the proposed framework, a three-level analysis is performed. First, packet-level analysis is performed to study the attack behavior. Second, a graphical analysis is completed to determine both the attack flow and whether a node is an attacker or a victim. Moreover, it also assigns a score to the node indicating the severity of the attack. Finally, forensics exploratory data analysis (FEDA) is performed to distinguish the distribution of different features during attack and normal scenarios. For attack detection, the framework uses a convolution neural network (CNN-1D). CSE-CIC-IDS2018 (CIC2018), UNSW-NB15 and CIC-Darknet2020 datasets are used to test the performance of the proposed framework, wherein, it classifies distinct classes of attacks with an accuracy of 99.4%, 99.0%, and 90% on each dataset respectively. The results show that the proposed framework is more effective than previous works in attack detection and network traffic classification.}

	abstract = {The black-box adversarial attacks for skeletal action recognition currently construct high-quality adversarial examples by sacrificing queries and perturbation imperceptibility. To overcome the above drawbacks, we propose a novel fast guided decision attack based on gradient signs for skeletal action recognition (FGDA-GS) scheme. Firstly, to reduce the queries, we guide the adversary to attack along the gradient direction obtained by sampling in a custom Gaussian distribution and design a gradient direction estimation method based on successful history information queries, which can quickly determine the updated direction of the effective perturbation without a large query. Secondly, to ensure the imperceptibility of the adversarial examples, we design a manifold projection function matching the first-order derivatives based on joint position constraints, joint angle constraints, and bone-length constraints to generate complete and natural skeletal adversarial examples that are invisible to the human eye. Finally, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FGDA-GS can generate strong-natured, highly effective adversarial examples with significantly reduced query. Specifically, FGDA-GS achieves a 100% attack success rate on different datasets and models with reduced queries by hundreds to thousands and reduced time by more than half. Particularly in the untargeted attack setting, compared to BASAR, FGDA-GS outperforms in terms of average joint position deviation, average joint acceleration deviation, average joint angle acceleration deviation, and average bone-length deviation percentage for the ST-GCN model on the NTU dataset, with percentage reductions of 91.13%, 91.81%, 80.60%, and 81.08%, respectively. We also conducted experiments on defense methods to validate our proposed scheme's effectiveness further.}

	abstract = {Organizations are at risk of cyber-attacks more than ever before due to the ongoing digitalization of business operations. Industry reports indicate that it is not a matter of if but when organizations become victims of cyber-attacks or breaches. In this research, we argue that organizations must enable agility in their incident response (IR) to quickly respond to diverse cybersecurity threats, and big data analytics (BDA) plays a pivotal role in enabling agility in the IR. Drawing from dynamic capabilities theory, we conducted a field study using a case study approach to examine the following research question: What dimensions of big data analytics-embedded dynamic capabilities enable agility in cybersecurity incident response? We develop a framework that presents five key dimensions of BDA-embedded dynamic capabilities (data consolidation, threat intelligence, incident investigation, analytical skillset, and cybersecurity analytics warehouse) in IR at four specific stages, that is, manual analysis, basic analytics, advanced analytics, and pervasive analytics. The detail of the framework explains how BDA-embedded dynamic capabilities at the pervasive analytics stage enable agility in IR by infusing agile characteristics of flexibility, speed, and learning in IR. This study contributes to the knowledge of IT-embedded dynamic capabilities and cybersecurity IR agility. Detailed recommendations are also provided for potential practitioners.}

	abstract = {Dynamic taint analysis is a commonly used technique in software security. By tracking the processing of tainted data in the program, dynamic taint analysis can provide users with information on how the variables they are interested in are affected by the program input. The information is stored in tags corresponding to the variables, and the type of the tag determines the level of detail it can store. While integer tags can only indicate whether the taint exists, container tags provide knowledge of which part of the input the taint originated from. This knowledge is crucial for fields such as protocol reverse engineering and fuzzing. Despite their advantages, container tags suffer from low execution efficiency. In some applications, the execution time can increase by thousands of times as compared to the use of integer tags. In this paper, we propose an efficient container tag scheme based on the Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram. The test results indicate that our container tag scheme achieves average speedups of 7.53x and 100.96x compared to the two container tag schemes utilized in libdft64.}

The framework is developed using the design science research methodology and has been validated by generating four novel metrics to assess the technical performance of a SOC. Additionally, the study examines the existing landscape of metrics for SOCs and concludes that a majority of the metrics discussed in the literature primarily focus on operational aspects rather than technical performance. The absence of adequate technical performance metrics makes it challenging to accurately evaluate the tangible impact of a SOC on overall cyber defense capabilities. The research also highlights the insufficiency of current methods in constructing metrics and frameworks tailored for measuring SOCs' technical performance. The resulting framework offers SOCs means to create high-quality metrics for performance evaluation. Furthermore, the metrics the framework was validated with offer SOCs an opportunity to enhance their ability to quantify their threat detection capabilities.}

	abstract = {Due to the emergence of fog computing, the computational resources can be deployed close to the data source and conduct data-driven tasks. A typical scenario is integrity assurance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, since the devices in IIoT scenario have low computation capability, they cannot verify the integrity of all incoming messages using traditional message authentication code (MAC), especially when the messages are in large volume and high frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC scheme, namely, Partial Verification Message Authentication Code (PV-MAC), to partially offload the verification tasks to a device with more processing power, (e.g., a fog node). Moreover, the fog node can transparently choose parts of contents in the message for verification on behalf of the device that uses these data. Afterward, the user device can verify the integrity of the rest contents. The theoretical analysis and the experimental results show that our proposed schemes can achieve high efficiency and dynamic workload balancing while retaining a rigorous security guarantee.}
