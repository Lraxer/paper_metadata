	abstract = {In an age where global connectivity has become pivotal to socio-economic development, satellite communication (SATCOM) systems have become the backbone of modern telecommunication infrastructure. However, the increasing reliance on SATCOM also elevates the potential impact of cyber threats. Cyber risk assessment is a critical component of any satellite communications risk management strategy. It plays a pivotal role in identifying and managing risks to satellite communications, which helps stakeholders isolate the most critical threats and select the appropriate cybersecurity measures. To the best of our knowledge, the field of satellite communications lacks an established framework for cyber risk assessment. Moreover, previous research work has focused only on a limited number of security threats and categories. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive risk assessment methodology to qualitatively assess the risk associated with satellite communications cyber threats, following the NIST special publication 800-30: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments. We analyze existing literature and real-world scenarios to identify potential satellite communications cyber threats and employ the STRIDE threat model for threat modeling. We validate the proposed methodology by performing a risk assessment for the cyber threats identified. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and open research problems for satellite communications cyber risk assessment.}

	abstract = {User-centric  privacy preservation  is of  paramount importance  in the realm of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where making decisions based on nature of data is crucial. This abstract presents a novel approach to safeguarding user privacy within CPS environments by leveraging user query trends and dataset trends while incorporating the principles of  differential privacy . By meticulously analyzing historical query patterns and dataset dynamics, this methodology empowers users to retain control over their sensitive data. The application of differential  privacy techniques  ensures that  individual user  information remains confidential while enabling comprehensive data analysis to unveil valuable insights, trends, and changes in  data distribution . This approach fosters a dynamic privacy ecosystem where users can interact with CPS systems, query their data, and extract valuable knowledge, all while preserving their personal privacy. As we navigate the evolving landscape of CPS, characterized by increasing  interconnectivity  and data sharing, this user-centric privacy framework not only guarantees data protection but also ushers in a new era of responsible data-driven decision-making, where privacy and utility coexist harmoniously, ultimately enhancing the trust and confidence of users in the CPS environment.}

We analyze CTA  data collected  over 4 years from January 2020 until December 2023 comprising over one billion cyber-security observations from where we extract 7.7M URLs and 1.8M domains related to malware. We complement this dataset with an active measurement where we periodically attempt to download the content pointed out by 33,876 recently reported malicious URLs. We investigate the following questions. How generalized is malware abuse of Internet services? How do domains of abused Internet services differ? For what purpose are Internet services abused? and How long do malicious resources remain active? Among others, we uncover a broad abuse affecting 22K domains of Internet services, that Internet services are largely abused for enabling malware distribution, and that  malicious content  in Internet services remains active longer than on  malicious domains .}

	abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats  (APTs) pose considerable challenges in the realm of cybersecurity, characterized by their evolving tactics and complex  evasion techniques . These characteristics often outsmart traditional security measures and necessitate the development of more sophisticated detection methods. This study introduces Feature Evolution using  Genetic Programming  (FEGP), a novel method that leverages multi-tree Genetic Programming (GP) to construct and enhance features for APT detection. While GP has been widely utilized for tackling various problems in different domains, our study focuses on the adaptation of GP to the multifaceted landscape of APT detection. The proposed method automatically constructs  discriminative features  by combining the original features using  mathematical operators . By leveraging GP, the system adapts to the evolving tactics employed by APTs, enhancing the identification of APT activities with greater accuracy and reliability. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments were conducted on widely used and publicly accessible APT datasets. Using the combination of constructed and original features on the DAPT-2020 dataset, FEGP achieved a balanced accuracy of 79.28%, surpassing the best  comparative methods  by an average of 2.12% in detecting APT stages. Additionally, utilizing only constructed features on the Unraveled dataset, FEGP achieved a balanced accuracy of 83.14%, demonstrating a 3.73% improvement over the best comparative method. The findings presented in this paper underscore the importance of GP-based  feature construction  for APT detection, providing a pathway toward improved accuracy and efficiency in identifying APT activities. The comparative analysis of the proposed method against existing feature construction methods demonstrates FEGP’s effectiveness as a state-of-the-art method for multi-class APT classification. In addition to the performance evaluation, further analysis was conducted, encompassing feature importance analysis, and a detailed time analysis.}

	abstract = {The evolution of  IoT malware  and the effectiveness of defense strategies, e.g., leveraging  malware family  classification, have driven the development of advanced  classification learning  models. These models, particularly those that utilize model-extracted features, significantly enhance classification performance while minimizing the need for extensive expert knowledge from developers. However, a critical challenge lies in the  interpretability  of these learning models, which can obscure potential security risks. Among these risks are backdoor attacks, a sophisticated and deceptive threat where attackers induce  malicious behaviors  in the model under specific triggers. In response to the growing need for integrity and reliability in these models, this work assesses the vulnerability of state-of-the-art  IoT malware classification models  to backdoor attacks. Given the complexities of attacking model-based classifiers, we propose a novel trigger generation framework, B-CTG, supported by a specialized training procedure. This framework enables B-CTG to dynamically poison or attack samples to achieve specific objectives. From an attacker’s perspective, the design and training of B-CTG incorporate knowledge from the  IoT  domain to ensure the attack’s effectiveness. We conduct experiments under two distinct knowledge assumptions: the main evaluation, which assesses the attack method’s performance when the attacker has limited control over the model training pipeline, and the transferred setting, which further explores the significance of knowledge in predicting attacks in real-world scenarios. Our in-depth analysis focuses on attack performance in specific scenarios rather than a broad examination across multiple scenarios. Results from the main evaluation demonstrate that the proposed attack strategy can achieve high success rates even with low poisoning ratios, though stability remains a concern. Additionally, the inconsistent trends in model performance suggest that designers may struggle to detect the poisoned state of a model based on its performance alone. The transferred setting highlights the critical importance of model and feature knowledge for  successful attack  predictions, with feature knowledge proving particularly crucial. This insight prompts further investigation into model-agnostic mitigation methods and their effectiveness against the proposed attack strategy, with findings indicating that stability remains a significant concern for both attackers and defenders.}

	abstract = {Lateral movement  (LM) is an umbrella term for techniques through which attackers spread from an entry point to the rest of the network. Typically, LM involves both pivoting through multiple systems and  privilege escalation . As LM techniques proliferate and evolve, there is a need for advanced security controls able to detect and possibly nip such attacks in the bud. Based on the published literature, we argue that although LM-focused  intrusion detection systems  have received considerable attention, a prominent issue remains largely unaddressed. This concerns the detection of LM through  unsupervised machine learning  (ML) techniques. This work contributes to this field by capitalizing on the LMD-2023 dataset containing traces of 15 diverse LM attack techniques as they were logged by the system monitor (Sysmon) service of the MS Windows platform. We provide a panorama of this sub-field and associated methodologies, exploring the potential of standard ML-based detection. In further detail, in addition to analyzing feature selection and preprocessing, we detail and evaluate a plethora of unsupervised  ML  techniques, both shallow and deep. The derived scores for the best performer in terms of the AUC and F1 metrics are quite promising, around 94.7%/93% and 95.2%/93.8%, for the best shallow and  deep neural network  model, respectively. On top of that, in an effort to further improve on those metrics, we devise and evaluate a two-stage  ML  model, surpassing the previous best score by approximately 3.5%. Overall, to our knowledge, this work provides the first full-blown study on LM detection via  unsupervised learning  techniques, therefore it is anticipated to serve as a groundwork for anyone working in this timely field.}

	abstract = {Industrial networks are vulnerable to various cyber threats that can compromise their Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). To counter the increasing frequency of such threats, we designed and developed an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) integrated  Deep Learning  (DL)-based threat detection system (XDLTDS). We first employ a Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) to encode  IIoT  data and mitigate inference attacks. Then, we introduce an Attention-based  Gated Recurrent Unit  (AGRU) with softmax for multiclass threat classification in  IIoT  networks. To address the black-box nature of DL-based  IDS , we use the  Shapley Additive Explanations  (SHAP) mechanism to provide transparency and trust for the system’s decisions. This interpretation helps  SOC  analysts understand why specific events are flagged as malicious by the XDLTDS framework. Our approach reduces the risk of sensitive data and reputation loss. We also present a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based  deployment architecture  for the XDLTDS framework. Extensive experiments with the N-BaIoT, Edge-IIoTset, and CIC-IDS2017 datasets confirm the effectiveness of XDLTDS against existing frameworks in addressing modern cybersecurity challenges and protecting industrial networks.}

However, the current situation is that the identification of relational information among security knowledge elements is not sufficient and timely, and a large number of key relational information is missing. In view of this, we propose a security knowledge  graph relational  reasoning method, based on the fusion embedding of semantic correlation and structure correlation, named  SecKG2vec . By  SecKG2vec , the embedded vector simultaneously presents both semantic and structural characteristics, and it can exhibit better relational reasoning performance.

The first line of defence for  malware authors  is often to bypass  static analysis , a relatively straightforward task using readily available tools such as packers and cryptors. To address this shortcoming, defenders send potential  malware samples  for execution in a  sandbox environment . While sandboxing can provide valuable insights into the behaviour of software on an  information system , advanced techniques like anti-virtualisation and hooking evasion allow malware to escape detection. The  primary objective  of this work is to complement sandbox execution with symbolic execution frameworks to detect new malware strains efficiently. Symbolic execution offers a distinct advantage over sandboxing by achieving greater coverage of all possible execution traces, as it can explore every potential execution path, regardless of the evasion methods employed by the malware authors. By carefully selecting the samples to be analysed, we can significantly reduce the workload while extracting essential dynamic features in a fraction of the time and with far fewer  computational resources  compared to sandboxing. To this end, we leverage  machine learning  in an automated pipeline, enabling the accurate detection of sophisticated malware using a real-world dataset. Our approach yields average F1 scores of 0.93 for the benign class and 0.99 for the malware class in a  binary classification  setup, surpassing the detection rates reported in the literature. Additionally, our method outperforms a commercial malware sandbox when applied to the same dataset, further highlighting the efficacy of the proposed method.}

Therefore, efficient Encrypted  Traffic Classification  (ETC) is of significant importance for the security of user data and  computer systems . Incremental Learning (IL) strategies for ETC methods allow them to evolve with the network environment, achieving remarkable results in real-world scenarios. However, existing IL frameworks for  ETC tasks  face issues of low computational efficiency and insufficient incremental capability, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory performance. In this work, we introduce an incremental  ETC scheme , HCA-Net, which uses hierarchical perception to evolve with traffic flows. We design a feature-reweighted  Depthwise separable convolution  that ensures computational efficiency without compromising feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, our IL framework comprises a carefully constructed  contrastive loss  and a representative exemplar selection strategy, enabling the distillation of knowledge from learning old traffic categories to the parameters of learning new knowledge, mitigating the inevitable catastrophic forgetting problem in IL methods. Comprehensive experimental results on three public datasets show that our scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating exceptional performance in  ETC tasks . By acquiring specific traffic samples at each training stage, our approach achieves incremental ETC, showcasing robust incremental capability and computational efficiency.}

However, most studies have used a cross-sectional design with symmetrical analysis techniques such as structure equation modeling (SEM) and regression. A data-driven approach, such as  predictive modeling , is lacking and can potentially evaluate and validate the  predictive power  of PMT for cybersecurity behaviors. The objective of this study is to assess the explanatory and predictive power of PMT for cyber security behaviors related to computers and smartphone. An online survey was employed to collect data from 1027 participants. The relationship of security behaviors with  threat appraisal (severity and vulnerability)  and  coping appraisal (response efficacy, self-efficacy and response cost)  components were tested via explanatory and predictive modeling. Explanatory modeling was employed via SEM, whereas three  machine learning algorithms , namely  Decision Tree  (DT),  Support Vector Machine  (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used for predictive modeling. Wrapper feature selection was employed to understand the most important factors of PMT in predictive modeling. The results revealed that the  threat severity  from the  threat appraisal  component of PMT significantly influenced  computer security  and smartphone security behaviors. From the  coping appraisal, response efficacy  and  self-efficacy  significantly influenced computer and smartphone security behaviors. The ML analysis showed that the highest predictive power of PMT for computer security was 76 % and for smartphone security 68 % by KNN algorithm. The wrapper feature selection approach revealed that  the most important features in predicting security behaviors are self-efficacy, response efficacy and intention to secure device s. Thus, the findings indicate the complementarity of the cross-sectional and data driven methods.}

	abstract = {The financial sector is a prime target for  cybercriminals  which increases the need for banks to enhance employee  cybersecurity  awareness. This study examines the critical factors that enhance  cybersecurity  awareness among bank employees in the context of developing countries, focusing on Bangladesh. By collecting 355 valid responses through purposive sampling from bank employees across major districts, the research employs a multi-stage analytical approach that integrates Partial  Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling  (PLS-SEM), Artificial  Neural Networks  (ANN), and Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Findings reveal a  positive correlation  between response cost, information security awareness, knowledge of cyber threats, and employees' perceived threat and vulnerability, indicating their significance in shaping cybersecurity awareness. The study's methodological novelty lies in its combined use of linear and non-linear analytical techniques which optimize prediction accuracy and contribute to the robustness of cybersecurity awareness research. Its implications are vital for developing nations where technological dependence for safeguarding IT resources is critical. The outcomes highlight the need for an informed approach to cyber  threat management  and the promotion of cybersecurity awareness among bank employees as a shield against social engineering and other cyberattacks.}

	abstract = {As more and more documents are converted from hard copies to  digital formats  and move to cloud storage, securing data access has become a critical and emergent security concern. Without a doubt,  intrusion detection system  (IDS) has become the primary defense mechanism for governments and enterprises to identify network attacks. However, the emergence of  Advanced Persistent Threat  (APT) has brought heightened challenges for an IDS, since  malicious hackers  can deploy various attacks to penetrate  information systems  invisibly over extended periods of time. Thus, the authors aim to design a High Discrimination APT Intrusion Detection System (HDAPT-IDS); consisting of Cyber Clustering Module (CCM) and  Clustering Analysis  Module (CAM). CCM conducts a preliminary classification of  traffic packets  and utilizes the  random forest  algorithm to predict the main-class, while CAM selects the applicable  Deep Neural Network  (DNN) based on the prediction results of CCM to derive the sub-class of  traffic packets  as the final result. Aside from laying out a high detection rate, HDAPT-IDS can effectively reduce the number of categories during classification to achieve better performance.}

	abstract = {The stable operation of  Industrial Control Systems  (ICS) is critical to industrial production. However, with the advancement of industrialization and informatization, ICS face increasing security threats, particularly from cyber-attacks. As a core technology for ICS security,  intrusion detection  has garnered significant attention in recent years. Traditional  intrusion detection  methods typically rely on models constructed from network event logs, but these methods have notable limitations in capturing the spatiotemporal correlations among multiple variables (sensors/actuators) and the periodicity of data within the system. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an  ICS intrusion  detection method, PdGAT-ID, which integrates periodicity extraction with  spatiotemporal graph attention networks . This method aggregates multi-scale periodic information from time series and utilizes  spatiotemporal graph attention networks  to capture the system's spatiotemporal features, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of detection. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets,  SWaT , WADI, and Gas  Pipeline Dataset , demonstrate that PdGAT-ID performs exceptionally well in detecting abnormal behaviors and intrusion events. Specifically, its F1 score outperforms the best existing models by 1.55 % to 5.51 %, significantly improving the effectiveness and reliability of ICS  anomaly detection .}
