	abstract = {Quantum computing  promises to revolutionize our understanding of the limits of computation, and its implications in cryptography have long been evident. Today, cryptographers are actively devising post-quantum solutions to counter the threats posed by quantum-enabled adversaries. Meanwhile, quantum scientists are innovating quantum protocols to empower defenders. However, the broader impact of quantum computing and  quantum machine learning  (QML) on other cybersecurity domains still needs to be explored. In this work, we investigate the potential impact of QML on cybersecurity applications of traditional  ML . First, we explore the potential advantages of quantum computing in machine learning problems specifically related to cybersecurity. Then, we describe a methodology to quantify the future impact of fault-tolerant  QML algorithms  on real-world problems. As a  case study , we apply our approach to standard methods and datasets in  network intrusion detection , one of the most studied applications of machine learning in cybersecurity. Our results provide insight into the conditions for obtaining a quantum advantage and the need for future quantum hardware and software advancements.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks  (DNNs) for  biometrics  represent the intellectual property of model owners due to the extensive  biometric data  and significant computing resources required for training them. However, existing technologies for protecting the intellectual property of DNNs are primarily tailored for general tasks and often fail to account for the unique characteristics of DNNs for  biometrics . Consequently, these technologies have limitations as they may increase data costs. This is because they typically require additional data samples to construct pairs that can be used for verifying intellectual property. Given the heightened privacy concerns and the challenging nature of acquiring authorized  biometric data , addressing the issue of increased data costs is paramount in biometric model  intellectual property protection  technology. To address this challenge, we introduce MGIP (Multi-Generator Intellectual Property protection), a novel data-free fingerprinting framework specifically designed for biometric classifiers. Our key technology innovations include: (1) a collaborative multi-generator architecture that creates a variety of fingerprints without external data, (2) an adaptive threshold strategy that dynamically adjusts verification criteria, and (3) a robust fingerprint selection that ensures reliable ownership verification. In our empirical evaluation, we conduct an ablation study using three state-of-the-art technologies and six datasets, including three general datasets and three biometric datasets. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that MGIP consistently outperforms three state-of-the-art technologies in accurately identifying pirated models.}

	abstract = {Insider threat attacks occur when individuals misuse their access to an organization’s systems, data, or networks. These attacks, including  Advanced Persistent Threats  (APT), Pivoting, and  Lateral Movement , often involve prolonged timelines and similar sensitive actions. Given the complexity of these attacks, current internal threat detection methods have their shortcomings. Firstly, internal threat attacks typically involve multiple sequences of  malicious operations , making it challenging to capture the entire attack process using a single model. Secondly, current research often overlooks the interconnections between  user behavior  sequences, failing to differentiate between malicious intentions, actions, and outcomes. This neglect may lead to forensic inaccuracies and the misattribution of benign activities as attacks, potentially causing erroneous responses. Furthermore, existing internal threat detection methods fail to mine relevant attack evidence from known sensitive behaviors to thoroughly analyze the attack mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose Ripple2Detect, a multi-step evidence detection framework for insider threat detection. First, Ripple2Detect builds an evidence sequence library by decomposing known attack behaviors into sequences and constructing a knowledge graph to measure their correlations. Next, we train a semantic similarity model based on the  BERT  architecture, tailored for operation sequences, to improve the detection of attack evidence. To overcome data imbalance, we introduce a  contrastive learning  loss to better distinguish between attack and non-attack behaviors. Finally, a preference  propagation mechanism  is used to predict attack behaviors within the knowledge graph. We conduct experiments on Cert-r4.2 and Cert-r5.2 benchmark datasets, comparing our model with state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that our model can identify malicious sequences with 0.96 F1 score and achieve an attack identification F1 score of up to 0.99.

Existing  intrusion detection systems  (IDS) for different network attacks often struggle to identify unknown attacks or respond to them in real-time. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid  deep learning model , FC-Trans, designed to enhance network intrusion monitoring.

To address the issue of imbalanced  sample distribution , we utilize MultiF Loss as the training loss function for the multi-classification task, enabling the model to prioritize difficult-to-classify samples. We compare the performance of our method with other approaches on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both binary and multivariate classification tasks. The results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

This paper introduces an innovative approach to penetration testing that employs interactive checklists, supporting both manual and automated tests, as demonstrated within the Penterep environment. These checklists, functioning as a quantifiable measure of test completeness, guide pentesters through methodological testing, addressing the inherent challenges of the security testing domain. While some may perceive a limitation in the dependency on predefined checklists, the results from a presented  case study  underscore the  criticality  of methodological testing. The study reveals that relying solely on fully automated tools would be inadequate to identify all vulnerabilities and flaws without the inclusion of manual tests. Our innovative approach complements established methodologies, such as PTES, OWASP, and NIST, providing crucial support to  penetration testers  and ensuring a comprehensive testing process. Implemented within the Penterep environment, our approach is designed with deployment flexibility (both on-premises and cloud-based), setting it apart through an overview comparison with existing tools aligned with state-of-the-art penetration testing approaches. This flexible and scalable approach effectively bridges the gap between manual and automated testing, meeting the increasing demands for effectiveness and adaptability in penetration testing.}

	abstract = {The protection of location privacy, as a highly sensitive characteristic of information, has been extensively analyzed and discussed for a significant period. Recently, exploiting the semantics of locations offers a new dimension to enhance  privacy preservation  by enabling more effective control over the information disclosed by users. Different from most prior research efforts, which regard location semantics as a category, in this paper, location semantics is the statistical information about the Points of Interest (PoIs) in the specific location’s vicinity, which can be represented as a multi-dimensional vector. Further, Semantic Indistinguishability (Sem-Ind), a more relaxed privacy guarantee for location privacy than Geo-Indistinguishability (Geo-Ind), is derived under the paradigm of  differential privacy . Multiple location obfuscation mechanisms, which integrate linear programming and  heuristic search , respectively, are proposed to reduce utility loss while ensuring Sem-Ind. Based on the defined utility and privacy metrics, these obfuscation mechanisms are empirically evaluated on the GeoLife dataset. Experimental results indicate that the existing Geo-Ind-based obfuscation mechanisms satisfy Sem-Ind at an excessive loss of utility. Furthermore, the linear programming-based approach is capable of discovering optimal obfuscation functions, whereas the  heuristic algorithms  are more efficient in obtaining acceptable utility results.}

	abstract = {Machine learning-based  Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS) have significantly enhanced operational efficiency in  Industrial Control Systems  (ICS), but they face a growing threat from  Adversarial Machine Learning  (AML) attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in IDS, leading to delayed threat detection, infrastructure compromise, financial losses, and  service disruptions . Traditional approaches, such as adversarial retraining, are not only resource-intensive but also suffer from limited generalization, as they rely on training models with specific adversarial samples. Given the constantly evolving nature of adversarial attacks, it is impractical to train on all possible attack variations, leaving systems vulnerable to new and unforeseen threats. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Reactive  Autoencoder  Defense for Industrial Adversarial Network Threats (RADIANT), a novel IDS that mitigates adversarial threats without relying on retraining. By reconstructing input data and analyzing three distinct reconstruction errors, RADIANT effectively reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations. To evaluate RADIANT’s performance, we used a comprehensive assessment framework that compared it against state-of-the-art defenses and undefended baseline classifiers on real-world ICS data. The evaluation included advanced adversarial attacks, such as HopSkipJump and Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), conducted under gray-box conditions. During ZOO attacks, RADIANT achieved an F1 score of 85.9%, significantly outperforming the baseline classifier’s 17.1% and demonstrating its robustness against adversarial threats. Similarly, under HopSkipJump attacks, RADIANT maintained a strong F1 score of 91.4%, far exceeding the baseline’s 20.5%. Additionally, when compared to state-of-the-art proactive defenses based on adversarial training, RADIANT consistently delivered a superior balance of precision, recall, and overall robustness, all without the need for adversarial retraining. These results highlight RADIANT’s practicality and effectiveness, offering reliable protection for ICS while addressing the increasing sophistication of AML attacks.}

As a consequence, a number of organizations such as government agencies, research institutions, trade groups, and other parties have published documents containing advice on the topic of insider threats. Here, we provide an evaluation of such advice documents. We employ the relatively new SAcoding (security advice coding) methodology to perform a  systematic analysis . This approach enables us both to assess the advice documents and to provide feedback on the use of SAcoding for a novel category (advice intended specifically for organizations), and for a novel topic (advice on the topic of insider threats). We find that 62.5% of 424 advice items extracted from six source documents are actionable, but the per-document proportion of actionable advice ranges substantially from 85.4% to just 35.1%. This finding suggests that organizations may incur opportunity costs by engaging with documents that offer little actionable advice. We also find that organizations may struggle to apply the published guidance, due to the high quantity of advice and the high portion of advice that requires specialist expertise. We use these and other findings to deliver a practical framework that provides guidance for the authors of advice documents, and for organizations seeking advice on the topic of insider threats. Additionally, we provide feedback on various aspects of the SAcoding method.}

	abstract = {Various mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers have been increasingly incorporated with wireless charging technology. Nevertheless, this widespread adoption of wireless chargers has raised substantial concerns regarding privacy and security. The  Universal Serial Bus  (USB), serving as the primary power supply port, is widely acknowledged as a significant source of privacy vulnerabilities. This article introduces Surf-Snooping, a side-channel attack that is aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless charging systems. Through monitoring the voltage fluctuations of a nearby USB charging port, an attacker can eavesdrop on the detailed activities and operations that are happening during smartphone charging (e.g., PIN code and text input), even without engaging in data communication. With a trained model, Surf-Snooping exhibits a 100% accuracy on device model identification, while the activity  recognition accuracy  can reach up to 86.7%, 89.9%, and 81.7% for password recognition, application identification, and keystroke inference, respectively. It is noteworthy that Surf-Snooping achieves accuracies of 92.3%, 98%, and 94.5% for the three types of activity categorization when the phone is fully charged. We also validate the  privacy leakage  risk of Surf-Snooping with different scenarios, and our work reveals an inherent flaw in the current implementation of wireless charging systems. It provides enhanced obfuscation and stability, requires no physical interference with the charging infrastructure, and remains effective throughout the entire charging cycle.}

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology,  advanced persistent threat  (APT) attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent. This form of attack is known for its persistence, diversity, and stealth, and it results in serious security threats and economic losses for various organizations and institutions. In the face of this threat, tracing the attack chain (i.e., attack investigation) is critical to understanding the attacker’s behavior, identifying attack methods and patterns, and taking appropriate defensive measures. However, the current APT attack investigation techniques suffer from insufficient audit log refinement, attack entrance location difficulties, and attack path tracking accuracy challenges. In this paper, we propose LinTracer, which is an efficient attack investigation system based on the ATT&CK attack model for  Linux systems  that fuses entity and event semantics for cyber-attack chains. First, an auditing mechanism is used to stably collect the kernel data of the target operating system, and data  compression techniques  are used to refine the log data and reduce the overhead imposed by the attack investigation system. Second, a backward causal analysis is performed from the alarm point to construct a suspicious provenance graph. LinTracer extracts the features used to distinguish between attack events and benign events, calculates the feature scores of the events, and then uses the backward  propagation algorithm  to propagate the dependency scores backward from the alarm point to identify the attack entry points. Finally, entity  semantic labels  are designed based on the ATT&CK framework to perform forward label propagation on the attack entry points, ultimately enabling an effective attack investigation. The experimental results derived from laboratory tests and DARPA Engagement (approximately 64 million auditing events obtained from real systems) show that LinTracer has good real-time performance and can accurately identify attack chains.}

However, most of the existing IDS rely on computationally intensive  deep learning  architectures, rendering them unsuitable for  IoT  environments with limited resources. Additionally, existing IDS approaches, including those using  Knowledge Distillation  (KD), often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and contextual relationships inherent in  IoT  traffic, which limits their ability to detect complex multi-stage attacks. Furthermore, these models frequently lack transparency, hindering effective decision-making by security experts. To address these gaps, we propose DistillGuard, a novel IDS framework designed specifically for IoT networks. The proposed framework employs a Transformer-based teacher model, which utilizes a hybrid  attention mechanism  combining multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and cross-attention layers to effectively capture both temporal and contextual patterns in network traffic. The framework further incorporates a Selective Gradient-Based Knowledge Distillation (SG-KD) process to transfer critical knowledge from the teacher model to a lightweight student model, optimizing performance while reducing computational costs. In addition, ‘DistillGuard’ integrates gradient contribution heatmaps, layer-wise contribution, and gradient selection impact analysis to provide detailed explanability, enabling security experts to understand which layers contribute to the detection of attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that ‘DistillGuard’ achieves superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art IDS models.}

	abstract = {Privacy threat modeling is an intrinsically complex analysis task that requires expertise in sophisticated privacy threats, their harms and implications, as well as potential mitigations. To support both novices and experts in attaining a desired degree of rigor and completeness in their analysis, supporting materials such as privacy threat trees and threat examples are crucial as they consolidate and harmonize the complete spectrum of threat characteristics, and as such assist with the broader uptake of privacy threat modeling practices. However, the existing knowledge structures, taxonomies, and trees used in privacy threat analysis prove to have limited use in practice. They are either too broad and generic, or too tightly coupled to a specific modeling approach ( dfd s) or to a specific threat  elicitation method  (e.g., per-element). In addition, current privacy threat knowledge structures suffer from semantic ambiguity. Finally, existing structures are too rigid to support evolution, thus hindering the incorporation of emerging privacy threats. This article introduces three contributions to address these shortcomings: (i) it defines the metamodel to express threat knowledge in the form of threat types,  elicitation  criteria, examples, and additional metadata; (ii) it discusses its application to the privacy threat knowledge of the  linddun  privacy threat modeling framework; and (iii) it introduces the automated  knowledge management  tools comprised of extraction logic that allows more flexible adoption in different privacy analysis approaches, and that fundamentally supports continuous evolution and refinement of this privacy threat knowledge. A major outcome is the updated  linddun  privacy threat knowledge which completely subsumes earlier versions and provides more rooted support for adoption, refinement, and continuous evolution.}

	abstract = {The darknet’s accessibility has increased significantly in recent years, making it more susceptible to exploitation by  cybercriminals . The darknet’s inherent characteristics of high concealment, strong  anonymity , and resistance to tracing have created a fertile ground for illicit activities, which are becoming increasingly prevalent.  Deep learning  models’ complex computations in high-dimensional feature spaces result in significant computational overhead and prolonged inference times, hindering their deployment in  backbone networks  where real-time detection is crucial. Dealing these challenges requires innovative solutions for efficient traffic sampling, feature engineering, model simplification, memory optimization and inference acceleration. Therefore, this paper introduces a  collaborative filtering algorithm , an extensible channel-wise feature group, and a lightweight  detection algorithm , designed to optimize performance through operator fusion and channel alignment. The proposed algorithm combines the advantages of lightweight CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), leverages GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)  parallelism , and reduces memory allocation overhead, resulting in a CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) core-optimized  neural network model  that achieves significant inference speedup. We utilize extensible channel-wise feature group derived from short  traffic packet  sequences to improve detection accuracy. Our approach targets the detection and prevention of illicit darknet traffic during the connection phase, rather than interfering with data transmission. By integrating rule-based filtering with small flow sampling within collaborative filtering, we facilitate early detection while maintaining minimal complexity overhead. To the best of our knowledge, the methodology proposed in this paper is the first to be designed based on operator fusion and channel alignment strategies, specifically aimed at detecting extremely low-proportion darknet traffic within  backbone networks . Our approach synthesizes three extremely low-proportion darknet traffic datasets, utilizing the self-built, CIC-Darknet2020, and TCUB datasets as  Tor  sources. Notably, our approach achieves a 45.79% reduction in actual inference time compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, while maintaining SOTA detection accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits the capability to filter out up to 91.26% (with a minimum of 78.01%) of the packets to be processed, without compromising any flows.}

	abstract = {Industrial Control Systems  (ICSs), widely employed in many critical infrastructure sectors that manage and control physical processes (e.g., energy, water, transportation), face heightened security risks due to increased digitization and connectivity. Monitoring Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), observable signs of intrusion, such as unusual network activity or unauthorized system changes, are crucial for early detection and response to  malicious activities , including data breaches and insider threats. While IoCs have been extensively studied in traditional Information Technology (IT), their effectiveness and suitability for the unique challenges of ICS environments, which directly control physical processes, remain unclear. Moreover, the influence of human factors (e.g., sociotechnical factors, usability) on the utilization and interpretation of IoCs for attack prevention in ICSs is not well understood. To address this gap, we conducted two studies involving 52 ICS security professionals. In an IoC Applicability study (n=32), we explore the relevance of existing IoCs within ICS environments and investigate factors contributing to potential ambiguities in their interpretation. We examine the perceived value, effort required for the collection, and volatility of various data sources used for IoC identification. Participants in the IoC Applicability Study emphasized the significant role of human factors in recognizing and interpreting IoCs for threat mitigation within ICS ecosystems. Based on this insight, we conducted a Socio-technical Factors in Recognition and Detection study (n=20) to investigate the impact of human factors on threat detection and explore the sociotechnical factors that influence the effective utilization of IoCs. Our results show significant discrepancies between conventional IT-based IoCs and their applicability to ICS environments, along with various socio-technical challenges (e.g., alert overload and desensitization). Our study provides pointers to rethinking the specific operational, technological, and human aspects of IoCs within the ICS context. Our findings provide insights for the development of ICS-specific IoC to enable security analysts to better respond to potential threats in industrial environments.}

	abstract = {In the intelligent era of the  Internet of Everything , the cloud–edge collaborative  network architecture  solves the  data storage  and computing problems caused by the  exponential growth  of terminal data. However, at the same time, the network attack situation is becoming increasingly severe and the types of network anomalies are complex and diverse. The traffic characteristic information collected in traditional  network security  situation analysis is single and coarse in  granularity , which makes it difficult to completely reflect the original traffic and network equipment status. Moreover, the collection of a large amount of fine-grained  telemetry  data generates substantial  telemetry  overhead, which hinders the efficient detection of network anomalies and malicious intrusions. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic  anomaly detection  method using In-band  Network Telemetry  (INT) and  GCN  for cloud–edge collaborative networks, which flexibly and efficiently collects network  state information  to identify network anomalies and  network intrusions . Firstly, we design an anomaly  telemetry  architecture for cloud–edge collaborative networks and use in-band network  telemetry  technology of  programmable network  to extract network characteristic information, and then use dynamic telemetry mechanism to extract network situation elements on demand, so as to quickly identify network anomalies by information  entropy method  in the edge layer. According to the identified network anomaly information, we deeply telemetry the abnormal position and design a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that aggregates anomaly information named AGCN in the cloud layer, and analyze whether there is malicious intrusion by combining spatiotemporal dimensions, so that network administrators can accurately grasp the  network security  situation and discover malicious intrusion in time. The experimental results show that the proposed method can quickly identify network anomalies and detect  network intrusions , which can quickly converge while saving telemetry overhead, and the detection accuracy of network intrusions can reach 98.69%.}

	abstract = {The reciprocity of  channel state information  (CSI) collected by two devices communicating over a wireless channel has been leveraged to provide security solutions to resource-limited  IoT  devices. Despite the extensive research that has been done on this topic, much of the focus has been on theoretical and simulation analysis. However, these security solutions face key implementation challenges, mostly pertaining to limitations of  IoT  hardware and variations of channel conditions, limiting their practical adoption. To address this research gap, we revisit the  channel reciprocity  assumption from an experimental standpoint using resource-constrained devices. Our experimental study reveals a significant degradation in  channel reciprocity  for low-cost devices due to the varying channel conditions. Through experimental investigations, we first identify key practical causes for the degraded channel reciprocity. We then propose a new wavelet-based CSI reconstruction technique using wavelet coherence and time-lagged cross-correlation to construct CSI data that are consistent between the two participating devices, resulting in significant improvement in channel reciprocity. Additionally, we propose a secret-key generation scheme that exploits the wavelet-based CSI reconstruction, yielding significant increase in the key generation rates. Finally, we propose a technique that exploits CSI temporal variations to enhance  device authentication  resiliency through effective detection of replay attacks.}

	abstract = {A policy comprised of a set of rules forms the backbone of Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) systems. Every incoming request is checked against such a policy and if at least one rule grants the access, it is allowed. Else, access is denied. The initial  ABAC policy  could be hand crafted by the security administrator or mined from a given set of authorizations using a policy engineering technique. In dynamic ABAC systems, over a period of time, additional authorizations may have to be granted or some removed as per situational changes. These changes are maintained in an  auxiliary  list. For access resolution, both the policy as well as the auxiliary list are considered before taking a decision. Since such a list can grow indefinitely and checking it adversely affects access resolution efficiency, periodic policy rebuilding must be done by combining the existing policy and the auxiliary list. However, regenerating the ABAC policy requires re-running computationally expensive policy mining algorithms. Further, access mediation has to be put on hold while this step is being carried out, resulting in periods of unavailability of the system. In this paper, we study the intricate problem of balancing access request resolution, accommodating dynamic authorization updates, and ABAC policy rebuilding. We employ a queuing  theoretic approach  where the access mediation process is modeled as an M/G/1 queue with vacation or limited service. While the server is primarily involved in resolving access requests, it occasionally goes on vacation to rebuild the ABAC policy. We study the effect of queue discipline on several performance parameters like request arrival rate, access resolution time, vacation duration and interval between vacations. Results of an extensive set of experiments provide a direction toward  efficient implementation  of dynamic ABAC systems.}

However, maritime falls short of its comparative industries, with very little attention given to cyber threats despite the growing concern. In this paper, we explore the use of visualisations as a way to improve the situational awareness of non-experts onboard ships. We designed a visualisation tool with focus on systems that are accessible once onboard. In order to elicit requirements for our visualisations, we conducted semi-structured interviews with experts. We further created a  synthetic dataset  of attacks that target the systems of ships, which we used to assess the usability of our visualisation. In order to evaluate our visualisations, we conducted a user study with both expert and non-expert users. Our results show that non-expert participants were able to accurately and efficiently detect synthetic attacks targeting ships in an experimental setting, and they were able to use the visualisation to consider what the consequences of these attacks might be. Expert evaluations further suggest the visualisation has merit as a training tool for raising awareness among maritime employees.}

	abstract = {User-sensitive face images captured by widely used image-collection devices are frequently shared on social media. If these images are misused, they may pose a serious threat to users’ privacy. To ensure both privacy-preserving and image usability, this work introduces a  Differential Privacy  Obfuscation method of Face images (DPO-Face), which addresses the current limitations in balancing privacy and  recognition accuracy . DPO-Face effectively balances  privacy preservation  and  recognition accuracy  to meet practical application demands. First, sensitive and non-sensitive regions of the image are accurately identified and located using an improved hybrid convolutional  neural network  by DPO-Face. Subsequently, face  parsing  technology is employed to precisely segment the input face image into multiple internal and external facial components. Moreover, precisely adjusted noise is introduced to the internal facial component regions using a differential privacy mechanism to disturb them, effectively protecting the privacy information of these regions while leaving the non-sensitive external components unchanged. Finally, the privacy-protected image is transmitted to the face detection and recognition module to evaluate the effectiveness of the privacy protection, such as maintaining high face detection and recognition accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that DPO-Face meets  ɛ ɛ <math><mi is="true">ɛ</mi></math> -local differential privacy requirements, achieving recognition rates of 91%–96% and a maximum privacy protection success rate of 0.9720. This method allows the privacy level to be precisely adjusted, preventing privacy leaks to honest but curious third-party servers, thus achieving a balance between privacy-preserving and usability.}

	abstract = {Security is one of the most critical requirements for modern digital systems. As the paradigm shifts from attempting to develop  fully  secure systems to designing resilient strategies that detect, respond to, and recover from attacks,  Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS) become indispensable. However, developing robust IDS that address sophisticated attacks—especially in scenarios such as Cloud services,  IoT ,  edge computing , and  microservices , remains a significant challenge. Among these, containerized services present unique security challenges due to their architecture, deployment methods, and reliance on  shared resources . On the other hand,  Machine Learning  (ML) offers promising, but not yet fully understood, solutions to enable automated, scalable, and adaptive  intrusion detection  mechanisms. In this paper, we study the applicability of a ML-based approach to enhance intrusion detection in containerized services by training and testing various  ML algorithms  on system call data, a commonly used  data type  in intrusion detection. Furthermore, we propose a novel graph-based representation for system calls that preserves critical relationships and contextual information between system calls. With this improved representation, we achieve enhancements in intrusion detection performance, including an increase in detection rates by at least 193% for the tested vulnerabilities while maintaining false alarms at a safer threshold, below a mean of 0.4% to maximize attack identification while minimizing false alarms we also incorporate a post-processing phase using a sliding window technique. This work not only addresses the challenges of securing containerized environments but also provides a robust framework for leveraging machine learning to build next-generation IDS.}

Our approach  gathers information  from both the organization’s internal environment and cybersecurity-related open sources. It then converts the collected qualitative data into  numerical form  by applying predefined mapping rules, including categorical assignments and frequency-based quantification. These  numerical values  are then integrated with other  quantitative data  using a  probabilistic method . Subsequently, all this information is integrated into a  Bayesian network model  to dynamically estimate the probability of success of a  cyber attack . This probability, combined with the impact assessments of the organization’s assets, is used to provide risk estimations.

Formal methods are widely used to analyze and verify the security properties of IoT protocols, but existing methods often fail to address the special security mechanisms required in the complex IoT network environment. A novel symbolic model based on event logic is proposed to implement the comprehensive analysis of secure IoT protocols. The model enhances the description of message flow and match, while also extending the inference capabilities of equivalence and  injectivity . Aiming at the pre-shared key, cookie, raw  public key , and certificate authority in the IoT protocols, a proof system of the model is proposed to prove the security properties of these mechanisms. To improve efficiency, the match buffer reduction method is also presented to eliminate the redundant proof steps. Formal analysis and verification of protocols, including  DTLS ,  SRTP , CoAP, and PUF, uncover several attacks that violate security properties. The results reveal that the proposed symbolic model is an effective method for the formal analysis and proof of IoT protocols.}

	abstract = {PowerShell is frequently utilized by attackers in the realm of Windows system security, particularly in cyberattack activities such as information stealing, vulnerability exploitation, and  password cracking . To evade detection, attackers often employ code  obfuscation techniques  on their scripts. Current detection solutions face challenges due to limited deobfuscation methods and a predominant focus on identifying static and  local features . This limitation hinders the ability to capture fine-grained code features and long-distance  semantic relationships , resulting in reduced robustness and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel  malicious script  detection method, Power-ASTNN, which integrates deobfuscation and a tree  neural network . Initially, the method utilizes  AMSI  memory dump to deobfuscate  PowerShell scripts , yielding fully deobfuscated samples. Subsequently, a subtree splitting algorithm tailored for  abstract syntax trees  extracts fine-grained code features from subtree fragments. Finally, a two-layer  neural network model  encodes representations based on subtree node semantics and sequence semantics, effectively capturing the semantic characteristics of the code. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Power-ASTNN, achieving an accuracy of 98.87% on a self  built dataset  collected from multiple publicly available sources, while maintaining a low  false negative  rate and a high area under the curve (AUC) value exceeding 0.995. Furthermore, Power-ASTNN demonstrates superior detection performance against adversarial samples compared with existing detection models.}

	abstract = {In the dynamic and complex realm of the  Internet of Things  (IoT) and  artificial intelligence  (AI), it is a significant challenge to design a network  intrusion detection system  that balances accuracy, efficiency, and data privacy.  Federated learning  offers a solution by enabling the sharing of high-quality attack samples to enhance local models’  intrusion detection  capabilities without compromising local data privacy. However, most existing research on federated learning for  intrusion detection  assumes homogeneity among local models, which can reduce detection accuracy in real-world scenarios where local datasets are often non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID). The Non-IID characteristic, marked by varied distributional properties and correlations, impacts model convergence and stability. To address this challenge, we propose a personalized federated cross learning framework (pFedCross) for intrusion detection, to manage imbalanced and  heterogeneous data  distributions. First, we present a collaborative model cross aggregation algorithm for personalized local model update, to solve the problem that one global model cannot always accommodate all the incompatible convergence directions of local models. Then, we introduce a gradient  approximation α <math><mi is="true">α</mi></math> -fairness algorithm for global model generation to achieve a well-generalization. Finally, the experiments show that pFedCross outperforms  baseline methods  in improving model accuracy and reducing loss, highlighting its promise for enhancing IoT security.}

	abstract = {The widespread use of cell phones, along with their constant internet connection, makes them vulnerable to malicious  SMS  attacks, including smishing and  spam . Smishing involves attempts to steal personal information, while  spam  focuses on unwanted advertisements. Both pose cybersecurity threats, often requiring effective filtering techniques. Researchers have devised multiple methods for detecting malicious  SMS , yet a notable gap remains in creating algorithms to reduce  false positives , where normal messages are wrongly classified as malicious. The method employs  ensemble learning  to automatically identify malicious or legitimate messages. It combines  Support Vector Machine  and  Random Forest models , compared with individual  machine learning approaches  for  smishing detection . Feature extraction methods like Term Frequency (TF) and Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF) are employed to derive features from the data. The imbalanced issue of the dataset is addressed by applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The results showed that the ensemble model outperformed the individual models, with an accuracy score of 99.58% when trained using TF–IDF on the balanced dataset. The proposed approach offers proactive defense against malicious SMS attacks, enhancing cybersecurity in the mobile communications sector.}

	abstract = {Federated learning  (FL) is an advanced technique in  machine learning  that ensures privacy while enabling multiple devices or clients to jointly train a model. Instead of sharing their private data, each device trains a local model on its own data and transmits only the model updates to a central server. However, FL systems face security threats such as poisoning attacks. The maliciously generated data can cause serious consequences on the global model. Also, it can be used to steal sensitive data or cause the model to make incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to enhance the detection of  malicious clients  against these attacks. Our novel approach is titled M3D-FL for Multi-layer Malicious Model Detection for Federated Learning in  IoT  networks. The first layer computes the malicious score of participating FL clients using the  LOF  algorithm, enabling their rejection from the FL aggregation process. Meanwhile, the second layer targets rejected clients and employs MAD  outlier detection  to permanently eliminate them from the FL process. Simulation results using the CIFAR10, Mnist, and Fashion-Mnist datasets showed that the M3D-FL approach outperforms other studied approaches from the literature regarding several performance metrics like the Accuracy Rate (ACC), Detection Rate (DR), Attack Success Rate (ASR), precision, and the CPU aggregation run-time. The M3D-FL approach is demonstrated to be a more effective and strict detection method of malicious models in FL.}

However, the current Web application security protection methods and tools are easy to bypassed by security attacks, have high  false positives , and are cumbersome to configure, are unable to protect efficiently against the growing application demands and the increasingly complicated  malicious attacks . In this regard, the SecRASP high-performance application security protection method and framework based on RASP are proposed to solve the current Web application security protection problems such as low accuracy, inability to quickly block 0-day security holes, and serious impact on the performance of Web applications and other "choke points". Experimental results show that in terms of security attack protection accuracy, SecRASP\'s security protection accuracy reaches 100 %, while Baidu OpenRASP\'s security protection accuracy is only 77.60 %; in terms of the impact on the performance of the protected application, SecRASP\'s impact on the performance of the application is minimal, compared to the OpenRASP in the CPU utilization rate, memory utilization rate, the performance of the protected application is reduced by 5.2 %.}

	abstract = {The information conveyed by vulnerability reports is crucial for enhancing the security of  information systems . Nonetheless, there are widespread information inconsistencies across reports, including, numerical discrepancies, misreported version ranges, semantic conflict, and so on. Identifying these inconsistencies is essential for improving information quality. Current research primarily focuses on standardized, non-free-form information’s inconsistency at the character or numerical level, while research for unstructured ones at the semantic level is limited. Given this, we introduce Vul diff Finder to determine the inconsistency of unstructured  vulnerability information  at the semantic level. Firstly, it utilizes NLP tools to break down unstructured information into constituent sets, and design a determination strategy based on the constituent’s  syntactic  hierarchies and semantic similarity. The designed strategy can determine information pairs in arbitrary structure. Secondly, it creates a span similarity-based fine-tuning task to enhance the embedding capabilities of the SpanBERT model, ensuring accurately capturing semantic information in the vulnerability domain. Finally, a dataset containing eight categories of  vulnerability information  and 1,612 samples is utilized to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that Vul diff Finder outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes, showing a 4.31% improvement in the F1-score. Additionally, we discover that consistency is higher in information that has simpler writing structures (up to 56.46%). Heterogeneous and Contained are often found in information with fixed or complex writing structures (up to 23.33% and 38.30%, respectively). Divergent and Repugnant mainly occur in information with a high missing rate.}

	abstract = {Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises or SMEs comprise of 99.9 % of all businesses in the UK and make a significant contribution the overall economy. In UK's path to  digitalisation , ensuring the cyber security and resilience of SMEs becomes an integral element that must be adequately safeguarded to protect national interests. Despite playing a crucial role, there is limited research on SMEs adopting cyber security practices, becoming cyber secure or improving their resilience to attacks. To examine this journey, a  qualitative study  was designed to learn from the experiences of organisations that provide cyber security advice or solutions. The three aims of the study were to: (1) understand the various types of support offered by providers; (2) topics for which support is sought and the circumstances that trigger the need for assistance; and (3) the perceived effectiveness of the support provided, associated challenges and opportunities to improve from the  lived experiences  of providers. Following semi-structured interviews with 12 participants, findings confirm results presented in earlier literature and provides new insights. Each participant had exposure to numerous SMEs, in some instances hundreds, at a regional or national level due to their roles at their respective organisations. The inherent knowledge gained from this exposure results in each participant's experience representing the cumulative experience of several SMEs as opposed to a singular view of one. We conclude that there is a vast amount of cyber security related content aimed at SMEs and our findings reveal providers are playing an assistive role in the understanding, education and implementation of cyber security defences. Despite significant efforts being made, cyber hygiene amongst SMEs remains low and they are unlikely to proactively reach out for support. Additionally, SMEs have low knowledge levels and are hampered in their efforts due to comprehension, capability, attitudes, and resources whilst providers face numerous internal and external challenges when delivering this support. Insights from data reveal several opportunities for improvement can be realised through the creation of security focused communities that can provide support, collaboration and learning.}

These two alternatives are interlinked, as insurance premiums can be reduced by investing more in cybersecurity controls. However, cyber insurance remains under-utilized, a puzzle that Expected Utility Theory (EUT) cannot explain. In this paper, we analyze how decision-makers allocate resources between cybersecurity controls and cyber insurance, comparing optimal allocation under Prospect Theory (PT) to that under EUT. We propose a new functional form of risk curves to model the relationship between investment in cybersecurity controls and  cyber risk , demonstrating how a bespoke risk curve can be fitted for an organization. We derive the optimal allocation strategy of resources to cybersecurity controls and cyber insurance under EUT and PT paradigms. Using mathematical results and numerical examples, we identify specific behavioral considerations in PT that lead to different  resource allocations  compared to EUT. We show that decision-makers aligned with EUT are generally indifferent to purchasing insurance, whereas those aligned with PT favor full insurance coverage; otherwise, they invest more in self-protection. Our results indicate that, in addition to a challenging cybersecurity environment and the nature of insurance coverage, behavioral aspects (diminished sensitivity to losses and probability weights) play a key role in determining the optimal level of investment in cybersecurity.}

While deep  learning approaches  have advanced software vulnerability classification, they exhibit critical limitations regarding word weighting. Conventional methods like term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF) prioritize global term distributions but overlook intra-class distinctions. While improved variants of this technique have been proposed, they often fail to consider that a word’s importance can vary across categories and struggle to prioritize rare but distinctive words adequately. Additionally, high inter-class semantic overlap and terminological ambiguity in vulnerability descriptions hinder model performance by failing to separate intra-class keywords From background noise. to address these gaps, we propose a novel vulnerability classification and word vector weighting approach based on bayes theorem. our method dynamically adjusts term relevance by calculating  posterior probabilities  of word-category associations, emphasizing rare tokens with high intra-class specificity. we validate the approach on four test datasets derived from databases such as the national  vulnerability database  (NVD) and the chinese  vulnerability database  (CNNVD). rigorous ablation and comparative studies demonstrate that bayes-based word weighting outperformed other methods by achieving a performance of 97.63% accuracy, and 97.60% F1-score on the most challenging test data. all our models and code to produce our results are open-sourced.}

Multiple server-side TEE offerings have been released over the years, exhibiting substantial differences with respect to several aspects. The first comer was Intel SGX, which featured  Process-based TEE  protection, an efficient yet difficult to use approach. Some SGX limitations were (partially) overcome by runtimes, notably:  Gramine ,  Scone , and  Occlum . A major paradigm shift was later brought by AMD SEV, with  VM-based TEE  protection, which enabled ”lift-and-shift” deployment of legacy applications. This new paradigm has been implemented by Intel only recently, in TDX. While the threat model of the aforementioned TEE solutions has been widely discussed, a thorough performance comparison is still lacking in the literature. This paper provides a  comparative evaluation  of  TDX ,  SEV ,  Gramine-SGX , and  Occlum-SGX . We study computational overhead and resource usage, under different operational scenarios and using a diverse suite of legacy applications. By doing so, we provide a reliable performance assessment under realistic conditions. We explicitly emphasize that — at the time of writing — TDX was recently released to the public. Thus, the evaluation of TDX is a unique feature of this study.}

DecoyPot, a  honeypot  Web  Application Programming Interface  (API) that generates legitimate API responses, is introduced in this paper. DecoyPot's command extractor module carefully analyzes API requests to create prompt-response pairs that improve a Retrieval-Augmented Generation based (RAG)  large language model  (LLM). DecoyPot can instantly adjust its answers to mimic API activity in a contextually correct and convincing manner to attackers. To assess system efficacy, we used a two-phase similarity analysis. Initial queries were matched with prompt-response pairs to ensure contextually suitable responses. Second, similarity measures were used to compare generated responses to reference responses, producing an average score of 0.9780. The high score shows that the system can create API-like responses, boosting its utility. DecoyPot engaged opponents and learned their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The study shows that  honeypot  cybersecurity effectiveness must be improved by merging AI-driven response creation with enhanced deception technologies.

	abstract = {The  Internet of Things  (IoT) has more and more been integrated into our work and life. However, besides the benefits brought by the recent advancements, there is an increasing challenge for securing  IoT devices  and networks. A common security mechanism is  authentication . However, IoT devices are often resource-constrained which make the use of state-of-the-art  encryption technologies  infeasible. Therefore, researchers are trying to develop lightweight  authentication methods . A promising example of this is the use of behavioral device fingerprinting. Still, the remaining problem with this technology is that it is unclear which feature sets are most feasible to implement device fingerprinting schemes in practical systems. In short, the current research body lacks clearly defined requirements. To overcome this issue, this research aims to design a requirements framework for IoT  authentication schemes  using behavioral device fingerprinting. To do so, Design Science Research is used, incorporating a systematic literature review. In the end, a requirements framework for behavioral device fingerprinting authentication is presented. The proposed framework features 20 requirements in the four categories High-level IoT, Fingerprint sophistication,  Machine learning  sophistication, and Attack resistance. We have demonstrated the application of the requirements framework in this article. It is believed that the proposed framework will help researchers and practitioners to develop better IoT authentication solutions.}

	abstract = {Software Defined Network  (SDN) is an emerging  network architecture . The decoupled data plane and control plane provide  programmability  for efficient network management. As a new  network architecture , SDN also faces the threat of Low-rate Distributed Denial of Service (LDDoS) attacks. However, the centralized control, forwarding separation, scalability, and  programmability  of SDN provide new ideas for the detection and defense of LDDoS attacks. In this paper, we perform feature extraction of LDDoS attack flows in terms of time–frequency distribution of LDDoS attack flows and  quality of service  (QoS) of TCP flows, and identify the victim switch and victim ports by using the hybrid GCN-GRU  deep learning  model and the double sliding window method. Finally, the location of the attacking host is determined based on the victim port, and defense measures are issued to the victim switch at the attack source through the  OpenFlow  protocol. The evaluation results indicate that the detection method deployed on  SDN controllers  has a high detection rate and low false positive rate for LDDoS attacks, and can detect and alleviate LDDoS attacks online and in real-time.}

	abstract = {The rise of advanced cyber threats targeting  critical system  recovery mechanisms necessitates proactive and scalable threat-hunting solutions. This research introduces a novel methodology leveraging a Linux-based Elasticsearch server to detect adversary techniques that inhibit system recovery (T1490). By integrating Elasticsearch for centralized log storage, Kibana for dynamic visualization, and Lucene for precise query search, the proposed platform offers a cost-effective and adaptable alternative to proprietary SIEM solutions. The methodology emphasizes real-time identification of indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as shadow copy deletions, suspicious commands, and backup configuration modifications, enabling security teams to uncover adversarial behaviors before they disrupt recovery processes. Practical implementation demonstrates the platform's flexibility across diverse IT environments, accommodating logs from endpoints with varying operating systems and infrastructures. The study further highlights the adaptability of the approach, with Kibana dashboards and Lucene queries tailored to specific organizational needs, making it a versatile tool for enterprises. Additionally, the research underscores the significance of proactive detection by moving beyond traditional reactive methods, positioning organizations to address system recovery threats effectively. This work bridges a critical gap in cybersecurity by offering a scalable, open-source threat-hunting platform that aligns with the growing need for robust defenses against evolving adversary techniques. The findings hold  practical significance  for enhancing  incident response  strategies and bolstering organizational resilience, paving the way for future integration with advanced  threat intelligence feeds  and automated detection mechanisms. This novel approach not only strengthens the security landscape but also provides a blueprint for cost-efficient, real-world applications in defending against adversary techniques designed to inhibit system recovery.}

	abstract = {In this study, we propose a streamlined approach to  intrusion detection  by leveraging the Interpacket Arrival Time (IAT) as a primary metric for identifying malicious network traffic. Our objective is to enhance the efficiency of  intrusion detection systems  by implementing a preliminary filtering layer that rapidly identifies easily detectable attacks, thereby reducing the  computational load  on more sophisticated, resource-intensive models. Using datasets such as CICIoT2023, CIC-IDS-2017, and UNSW-NB15, we conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The study employed techniques like SMOTE to address dataset imbalances and Min-Max scaling to normalize the IAT feature, ensuring  optimal performance  of  machine learning  models. We evaluated models such as  Random Forest , K-Nearest Neighbors, and  Multilayer Perceptron , with a particular emphasis on their ability to generalize across various datasets. Our findings demonstrate that by focusing on a single, well-chosen feature like IAT, it is possible to achieve high detection accuracy while significantly reducing training and prediction times. This method not only improves the overall efficiency of  intrusion detection systems  but also suggests a practical solution for real- time applications where  resource constraints  are a critical concern.}
