	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial samples, the detection of which is crucial for the wide application of these DNN models. While existing methods have utilized differences between clean and adversarial samples to expose these perturbations, most are limited to a single model, rendering them vulnerable to adaptive attacks. To address the problem, we propose Graph-Guided Testing (GGT), a multiple-model-based detection algorithm that generates diverse models guided by graph characteristics. GGT identifies adversarial samples by their instability on the multi-model decision boundaries. GGT is highly efficient, with the generated model requiring only about 5% of the floating-point operations of the original model. Our experiments demonstrate that GGT outperforms state-of-the-art methods against adaptive attacks. We release our code at https://github.com/implicitDeclaration/graph-guided-testing.}

	abstract = {While the cybersecurity literature on behavioral factors has expanded, current countermeasures often overlook employee-specific behavioral differences, leading to generic solutions. This study addresses this gap by introducing a typology of knowledge worker cybersecurity behaviors through cluster analysis. Based on online survey data (n = 264), we identify six main dimensions of cybersecurity attitude and behavior and, based on these, four behavioral cybersecurity types with distinct characteristics and demographic profiles: Na√Øve Greenhorns, Traditional Examiners, Flexible Mavericks, and Reliable Troupers. Contrary to common beliefs, the study found that older employees demonstrate high cybersecurity resilience, while younger ones pose a higher risk. These findings underscore the importance of tailored, human-centered cybersecurity approaches.}

	abstract = {Cyber insurance is becoming a popular cyber risk management tool. Beyond pure financial risk transfer, prior theoretical works anticipated that cyber insurance would influence the mitigation measures employed by policyholders, such as by excluding losses caused by security mismanagement or by offering premium discounts for security controls. Empirical literature has shown cyber insurance is ineffective at influencing pre-breach security levels; however, it has also identified how insurers indemnify the cost of a team of post-breach providers with expertise spanning legal, technical, and communications. Our work models the peculiarities of the institution, the panel, that triages incidents and assigns firms. In particular, we model the incomplete aspect of this contract in which policyholders may be assigned a less efficient firm, which can be interpreted as a bait and switch. At the same time, our context for the bait and switch is business-to-business (B2B) and differs from the usual understanding of the phenomenon as an upsell. Consequently, new managerial implications arise on the insurer-side of the market. We characterise the conditions under which policyholders accept their insurer's hotline recommendation for incident response under the incomplete contract. We additionally show how panels can mitigate the adverse selection problem with respect to policyholders' losses by including providers of differentiated efficiency.}

	abstract = {The complexity of ICT infrastructures is continuously increasing, presenting a formidable challenge in safeguarding them against cyber attacks. In light of escalating cyber threats and limited availability of expert resources, organizations must explore more efficient approaches to assess their resilience and undertake proactive measures. Threat modeling is an effective approach for assessing the cyber resilience of ICT systems. One method is to utilize Attack Graphs, which visually represent the steps taken by adversaries during an attack. Previously, MAL (the Meta Attack Language) was proposed, which serves as a framework for developing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and generating Attack Graphs for modeled infrastructures. coreLang is a MAL-based threat modeling language that utilizes such Attack Graphs to enable attack simulations and security assessments for the generic ICT domain. Developing domain-specific languages for threat modeling and attack simulations provides a powerful approach for conducting security assessments of infrastructures. However, ensuring the correctness of these modeling languages raises a separate research question. In this study we conduct an empirical experiment aiming to falsify such a domain-specific threat modeling language. The potential inability to falsify the language through our empirical testing would lead to its corroboration, strengthening our belief in its validity within the parameters of our study. The outcomes of this approach indicated that, on average, the assessments generated by attack simulations outperformed those of human experts. Additionally, both human experts and simulations exhibited significantly superior performance compared to random guessers in their assessments. While specific human experts occasionally achieved better assessments for particular questions in the experiments, the efficiency of simulation-generated assessments surpasses that of human domain experts.}

Since the computation cost and memory limitation of the Hessian matrix, the application of Hessian or approximate Hessian in white-box attacks is gradually shelved. In this work, we note that the sparsity requirement on perturbations naturally lends itself to the usage of Hessian information. We study the attack performance and computation cost of the attack method based on Hessian information with a limited number of perturbation pixels. Specifically, we propose the Limited Pixel BFGS (LP-BFGS) attack method by incorporating the perturbation pixel selection strategy and the BFGS algorithm. Pixels with top-k attribution scores calculated by the Integrated Gradient method are regarded as optimization variables of the LP-BFGS attack by the position map matrix. Experimental results across different networks and datasets demonstrate that our approach has promising attack ability with reasonable computation in different numbers of perturbation pixels compared with existing solutions.}

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a significant threat to network security as they can disintegrate the security fortress of enterprises. Recent studies have focused on detecting APT attacks by matching typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT attacks. However, the lack of positive APT samples affects the performance of existing approaches. To address this challenge, we propose a novel attack intent-driven and sequence-based learning approach (AISL) for APT detection. AISL integrates heterogeneous audit data and creates corresponding security tags based on attack intent. Specifically, we investigate various data sources of attack detection and establish a dedicated network event ontology. Based on this ontology, we construct a provenance graph that integrates audit data from heterogeneous sources. During the construction of the provenance graph, we identify and tag potential attack behaviors based on attack intent to increase the number of positive samples in the dataset. Finally, we train a tag-sequence-based semantic model for APT detection. We evaluated AISL through ten realistic APT attacks and achieved an average precision of 93.05%, recall of 98.12%, and F1-score of 95.36%, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.}

	abstract = {Cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads are an important part of XSS attacks, which contain malicious code and are injected into Web pages. There have been many research results based on machine learning and deep learning for the detection of XSS attacks. However, the current widely used datasets suffer from a serious data imbalance in the field of XSS attack detection, with a very limited number of samples for most XSS payload categories. Unfortunately, this problem has been overlooked in existing research. Although existing methods generally show high detection performance, they have been experimentally proven to have poor detection and generalization performance for some XSS payload categories. However, since such samples have a sparse number, their classification errors do not significantly affect the overall performance. To solve this problem, a few-shot graph classification method FSXSS applicable to XSS attacks detection is proposed. FSXSS reduces obfuscated malicious code by anti-obfuscation means such as circular decoding and code stitching, and then transforms the sample data into homomorphic graphs using contextual relationships and external word embeddings. These homomorphic graphs are used as input to obtain a vector representation of the graph through graph representation learning, and then the classifier classifies the samples by computing the similarity between them and the prototype. In addition, since there is no publicly available dataset for the few-shot XSS attack detection problem, we processed and labeled the data from the XSSED project to create the dataset FSXSSED. Experiments proved that FSXSS has excellent capabilities for the few-shot XSS attack detection problem.}

	abstract = {The challenge faced by industrial control systems is that they are vulnerable to adversarial sample attacks. In the ICS field, the challenge with adversarial sample attacks is that the adversarial samples generated by the attack do not conform to protocol specifications. The challenge of adversarial sample defense is that it is difficult to design a defense model without information about the adversarial samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial sample attack and defense method based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED). The objectives are to address challenges of adversarial samples not conforming to protocol specifications and physical meaning, inefficient generation of adversarial samples, and the difficulty of designing a defense model without information about adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample attack efficiently generates samples conforming to protocol specifications and physical meaning by adding perturbation values to sensors and actuators, while complying with feature constraints. Subsequently, we introduce an LSTM-ED Feature Weight defense method (LSTM-FWED) designed without explicit adversarial sample information. In LSTM-FWED, we normalize reconstruction errors across different features to prevent anomaly scores from being influenced by poorly predicted features, thereby ensuring robust defense results. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world critical infrastructure testbed. The proposed adversarial sample attack reduces the precision of the LSTM-ED model by an average of 66.26%, with a maximum adversarial sample generation time of 18 seconds, significantly improving attack efficiency. Furthermore, in comprehensive experiments, LSTM-FWED demonstrates an average AUC improvement of 21.83% compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection baseline methods.}

In this paper, we present TS-Mal, a novel Malware detection model incorporated Temporal and Structural features learning. Particularly, TS-Mal first designs a temporal vector learning method to automatically capture the evolving representation from the non-repetitive API sequences, which can efficiently pursue the attack preferences of malware. Then TS-Mal introduces heterogeneous graphs to model the interactive relationships between APIs and presents a dense-interactive structural embedding approach to generate the fine-grained API structural representation, which is capable of utilizing API category interaction information to boost detection effectiveness. Finally, TS-Mal simultaneously integrates temporal and structural attack features to accurately identify the unknown malware, effectively defending against new malware attacks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed TS-Mal model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.}

Besides specialized knowledge of engineers and developers, organizational culture can contribute to software security to a great extent if specific cultural dimensions are in alignment with security. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the SOLID-S, a six-dimensional inventory assessing this type of software security culture in software development companies. We present the iterative test development process of the inventory and examine its psychometric properties in an empirical study with\nN\n=\n327\nparticipants by means of Item Response Theory. We identify the SOLID-S to have appropriate measurement qualities in terms of accuracy, fairness across subgroups, item fit and dimensionality. Results suggest that the inventory's subscales comply with the Partial Credit Model and, hence, raw sum scores of the subscales can be interpreted reliably. The SOLID-S can therefore be used for research, as a starting point for organizational change programs, or to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve security culture.}

	abstract = {The digitisation of agriculture, integral to Agriculture 4.0, has brought significant benefits while simultaneously escalating cybersecurity risks. With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity. This is essential for protecting the agriculture sector in the era of digital transformation, ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the food supply chain against emerging cyber risks.}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of information and communication technology (ICT), the smart grid is critically vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as false data injection (FDI), denial-of-service, and data spoofing. The cyber-attackers defunctionalize critical operations of the smart grid by compromising the ICT. The decisions for the critical operation of the smart grid are processed with a state estimator, and ICT makes the state estimator vulnerable to FDI attacks. Hence, vulnerability analysis of the state estimator needs to be investigated for potential FDI attacks to protect it from future cyber-attacks. This work proposes the FDI attack vector construction without the knowledge of bad data detection (BDD) threshold on linear and non-linear state estimators using max-min optimization considering the partial network information. The optimization problem is formulated from the attacker's perspective to target the manipulation of measurements in the attack zone so as to increase the generation cost. The equivalent power injection model is developed for the attack zone to construct the deceptive attacks using DC and AC power flow models. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been tested on 5 bus PJM network, modified IEEE 30 bus, IEEE 57 bus, and IEEE 118 bus system. The proposed framework is compared with existing state-of-art methods (viz., linear attack policy, non-linear attack policy, load redistribution attack, and line flow attack) to assess its efficacy. It is observed that the developed FDI attack vector successfully bypasses the bad data detectors such as the chi-square test, largest normalized residue, and\ndetector that is normally used by the system operator. Moreover, the study compares and discusses the impact of FDI attacks on the estimated state variables obtained with state estimators and, thereby, the generation cost calculated with the DC & AC optimal power flow tool.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks have been proven to pose effective threats to deep neural networks in various domains, such as biometrics, authentication, and autonomous driving. Attackers compromise the integrity of the model, causing it to behave normally on benign samples under normal circumstances but perform attacker-specified actions on samples containing specific triggers. However, existing attack methods often suffer from two main drawbacks: permissions and concealment. While some attack methods may not require high levels of permissions from the attacker, the triggers are typically visible to the naked eye, significantly reducing the attack's concealment and making it susceptible to detection by existing defense mechanisms. Although many advanced attack methods enhance concealment, they often necessitate control over the model's training process, thereby significantly limiting the practical applicability of the attack. To circumvent the two aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called WaTrojan, which implements the attack by adding triggers in the wavelet domain. The key to this attack lies in adding perturbations to the wavelet domain of an image, thereby altering the entire spatial domain of pixels. This approach challenges many assumptions of existing defense methods and makes poisoned images nearly indistinguishable from clean images visually. We evaluate WaTrojan on five benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CelebA, and ImageNet. The results indicate that our attack achieves an extremely high attack success rate while causing almost no drop in accuracy on benign samples. The visual quality of the poisoned images is high, with little perceptual difference from benign images. Furthermore, we assess the performance of WaTrojan under existing defense measures, and the results show that WaTrojan is robust and can significantly evade and resist the impacts generated by these defense measures.}

The number of attacks reported each day is increasing constantly and is causing an impact not only at the end-user level but also at the network operator level. Malware like FluBot contributes to identity theft and data loss but also enables remote Command & Control (C2) operations, which can instrument infected devices to conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Current mobile device-installed solutions are not effective, as the end user can ignore security warnings or install malicious software. This article designs and evaluates MONDEO-Tactics5G - a multistage botnet detection mechanism that does not require software installation on end-user devices, together with tactics for 5G network operators to manage infected devices. We conducted an evaluation that demonstrates high accuracy in detecting FluBot malware, and in the different adaptation strategies to reduce the risk of DDoS while minimising the impact on the clients' satisfaction by avoiding disrupting established sessions.}

	abstract = {Many current malware detection methods are based on supervised learning techniques, which however have certain limitations. First, these techniques require a large amount of labeled data for training which is often difficult to obtain. Second, they are not very effective when there are differences in domain distribution between new malware and known malware. To address these issues, we propose MD-ADA ‚Äì a malware detection framework that leverages adversarial domain adaptation (DA). DA allows one to adapt a training malware dataset available at a domain, referred to as the source, for training a classifier in another domain, referred to as the target. DA, typically used when the target has limited training malware data available, maps the source and target datasets into a common latent space. As we use an image representation for malware binaries, MD-ADA uses a convolution neural network (CNN) providing a lossless image embedding for the source and target datasets. MD-ADA also employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) for malware classification that is suitable for scenarios with few target-labeled data where the distribution of the features is similar (homogeneous) or different (heterogeneous). We have carried out several experiments to assess the performance of MD-ADA. The experiments show that MD-ADA outperforms the fine-tuning approach with an accuracy of 99.29% on the BODMAS dataset, 89.3% for the Malevis dataset on homogeneous feature distribution, and 90.12% on the CICMalMem2022 dataset (Target) and 83.23% on the Microsoft Kaggle dataset (Target) for heterogeneous feature distribution. The observed F1-scores of 99.13% and 87.5% for homogeneous feature distributions and 91.27% and 81.7% for heterogeneous distributions indicate that the MD-ADA performance is satisfactory for both data distributions when the target has very few labeled data.}

	abstract = {Fog computing is a new computing model with limited resources located near the Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide low transmission delay, mobility, and location awareness services. However, fog technology not only extends the cloud resources but also inherits its properties and security problems, such as device capture, man-in-the-middle, secret key compromise, identity impersonation, and message replay attacks. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the integrity of IoT-fog communications. Nevertheless, the existing mutual authentication approaches either suffer from high computational overheads or fail to provide secure mutual authentication. To address this gap, this paper introduces LAAKA, a Lightweight Anonymous Authentication and Key Agreement scheme. Considering the constrained resources of IoT and fog devices, LAAKA utilizes lightweight operations such as hash function and bitwise XOR. Its main objective is to facilitate mutual authentication and establish secure session keys between IoT devices and fog servers, making it useful for various IoT applications. We validate the robustness of LAAKA against various security threats by conducting comprehensive formal security analysis, including Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and Random Oracle Model (ROM), as well as informal analysis. The efficacy of our scheme is further demonstrated through evaluation with the Scyther tool. Compared to other proposed authentication approaches, the results illustrate the superior performance and efficiency of our approach in enhancing the security features, minimizing the computational cost, and optimizing storage utilization.}

	abstract = {Security policies of authentication systems are a crucial factor in mitigating the risk of impersonation, which is often the first stage of advanced persistent threats. Online authentication systems may often interact with each other, due to various mechanisms, such as account recovery or federated authentication. This leads to an implicit extension of the security policies of an authentication system with policies over which the system has no control. As a result, an authentication system that adopts very strong security policies can be unexpectedly weak. This paper deals with the above problem, which affects most real-world online authentication systems. The paper proposes a theoretical framework that formalizes authentication policies and interactions among authentication systems, together with a protocol that prevents, whenever an interaction is established or updated, the security issues described above. An SSI-based implementation of the proposed protocol is presented as well.}

However, manual mapping methods are time-consuming, while rule-based feature-based mapping methods often under- or misreport many attacks. Inspired by the successful application of image multi-label classification techniques, we propose a method called Malware2ATT&CK to automatically map malware to ATT&CK techniques. The method applies pre-trained models to extract features from the two pieces of information ‚Äî the static analysis information of assembly instruction and API calls from malware. The malicious techniques are identified by a multi-label classifier based on the graph neural network and knowledge graph. In the experiments over two test sets, Malware2ATT&CK shows excellent performance achieving an average F1 score of 83.6% in the technology mapping task. Further evaluation indicates that the high accuracy of the prediction is due to our ability to accurately capture the correlation between behaviors.}

Cloud computing (CC) makes a broad range of information technologies available. Security and privacy are key challenges in storing big data in the cloud. To overcome this challenge, a Self-Attention Conditional Generative Adversarial Network Optimised with Crayfish Optimization Algorithm for Improving Cyber Security in Cloud Computing (CybS-CC-SACGANCOA) is proposed in this paper to enhance the safety of CC environment. The input data is amassed from NSL-KDD database. After that, the data is fed to pre-processing segment. The segment of pre-processing eliminates Cloud data termination and missing value replacement using Reformed Phase Conserving Vibrant Range Compression filter. The results of pre-processing serves for feature selection. The optimal features are selected by means of Manta Ray Foraging Optimization Algorithm (MRFOA). Cloud data is categorized as normal and abnormal data, like Denial-of-Service (DoS), Probe, Remote to local attack (R2L), User to root attack (U2R) by the help of SACGAN. Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (COA) is proposed to optimize the SACGAN classifier that classifies anomaly data precisely. The proposed CSCC-SACGANCOA technique is activated in Python under some metrics. The proposed CSCC-SACGANCOA approach has attained higher detection accuracy, lower computation time, higher AUC, higher scalability and lower detection error rate compared to the existing methods.}

In order to distinguish between human users and bots, the Completely Automatic Public Turing Test (CAPTCHA) has been used for almost 20 years. Nevertheless, CAPTCHA can be easily broken if it lacks security features. Consequently, the motivation for utilizing CAPTCHA is undermined. This article proposes a framework that can evaluate the security aspects of text CAPTCHAs. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by using a generalized attack method consisting of pre-processing and utilizing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library such as Tesseract OCR. We have carried out a systematic study of existing CAPTCHAs utilized on Bangladeshi websites. We have studied 238 Bangladeshi websites and found that only 44 websites used a CAPTCHA mechanism. Then, we have assessed the security levels of the selected text CAPTCHAs by the proposed framework. As per our analysis, we have found that there are 29 different CAPTCHA schemes being adopted on Bangladeshi websites and among them 23 are vulnerable to automated attacks. In order to address these issues, we also present a number of recommendations.}

	abstract = {P2P botnets are distributed with complex topology and communication behavior, making them harder to detect and remove. Individuals or organizations can effectively detect P2P botnets by analyzing abnormal behaviors in network traffic. Existing works focus on extracting deterministic traffic interaction features, which are highly dependent on statistical features. Moreover, these methods are mainly aimed at generalized botnet detection and lack specificity for detecting P2P botnets. They ignore the topological information of P2P botnets, resulting in unsatisfactory detection accuracy. Among the few existing methods targeting P2P botnets, they consider the topological information but mainly rely on classical graph theory statistical features, such as degree, feature vector centrality, etc. This limits the generalization ability of the detection model. In this paper, we delve into the topological features of P2P botnets from the perspective of complex graph theory. We propose a P2P botnet detection method that combines representation learning and graph contrastive learning, dubbed PeerG. Specifically, we construct the communication graphs based on the flow interaction behavior between components of the P2P botnets. The Line algorithm is employed to embed the nodes of the communication graph into a low-dimensional representation vector space. Subsequently, the graph contrastive learning approach is utilized to optimize the feature extractor, enabling it to capture more representative node features. PeerG serves as a benchmark detection model for identifying P2P botnet nodes. Additionally, we devise two optimized contrastive detection strategies (PeerG-PreG and PeerG-PreF) based on graph-level and feature-level to boost the performance of PeerG. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PeerG brings significant improvements in detection accuracy over state-of-art detection methods. Furthermore, compared with PeerG, the detection strategies PeerG-PreG and PeerG-PreF have further improved detection performance, and achieve the best detection accuracy among multiple filtered P2P botnet types.}

While the theoretical construct in emotional valence (e.g., fear) and cognitive valence (e.g., perceived efficacy) were deemed as mediators in previous EPPM-related ISec studies, existing research has ignored the value of testing and reporting the dominant mediator between the emotional valence and the cognitive valence. In this paper, we reintroduce the theoretical origins of the dominant mediator assumption in EPPM and highlight its merits using the multiple mediation method. Theoretically, we illustrate how testing and reporting the dominant mediator can help identify the dominant mechanism triggering specific behavioral outcomes. Further, this paper questions the dominant mediating role of fear on the behavioral outcome in ISec context. Methodologically, this study proposes to assess the dominant mediator via a multiple mediation model instead of using the discriminant value equation introduced by Witte (1995), Witte et al. (1996) and enhanced by Chen et al. (2021) when testing the EPPM theory in the ISec context.}

	abstract = {When it comes to in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the controller area network (CAN) bus dominates the market; automobiles manufactured and sold worldwide depend on the CAN bus for safety-critical communications between various components of the vehicle (e.g., the engine, the transmission, the steering column). Unfortunately, the CAN bus is inherently insecure; in fact, it completely lacks controls such as authentication, authorization, and confidentiality (i.e., encryption). Therefore, researchers have travailed to develop automotive security enhancements. The automotive intrusion detection system (IDS) is especially popular in the literature‚Äîdue to its relatively low cost in terms of money, resource utilization, and implementation effort. That said, developing and evaluating an automotive IDS is often challenging; if researchers do not have access to a test vehicle, then they are forced to depend on publicly available CAN data‚Äîwhich is not without limitations. Lack of access to adequate CAN data, then, becomes a barrier to entry into automotive security research.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received a lot of attention from the information and communication technology community. It has turned out to be a crucial development for harnessing the incredible power of wireless media in the real world. The nature of IoT-Fog networks requires the use of defense techniques who are light and mobile-aware. The edge resources in such a distributed environment are open to various safety hazards. DDoS UDP flooding attacks are the most frequent threats to edge resources in IoT-Fog networks. It is crucial for sabotaging fog gateways and can overcome traditional data filtering techniques. This paper introduces M-RL, a lightweight intrusion detection system with mobility awareness that can detect DDoS UDP flooding attacks while taking into account adversarial IoT devices that engage in IP spoofing. To this end, this paper analyzes the malicious behaviors that result in anonymity against Rate Limiting and Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches, combines their advantages, and addresses their vulnerabilities. We test our method in different contexts to achieve that goal, and we find that it may decrease the accuracy of the RL, RSS, and RSS-RL methods to 70%, 48.9%, and 64.3%, respectively. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed approach's resistance to software-based source address forgery, impersonation, and signal modification. It offers more than 99% accuracy and supports node mobility. In this case, the best possible accuracy of the previous methods is 77%.}

This study takes an unprecedented deep dive into large-scale phishing campaigns aimed at Meta's users, offering a dual perspective on the technical mechanics and human elements involved. Analysing data from over 25,000 victims worldwide, we highlight the nuances of these campaigns, from the intricate techniques deployed by the attackers to the sentiments and behaviours of those targeted. Unlike prior research conducted in controlled environments, this investigation capitalises on the vast, diverse, and genuine data extracted directly from active phishing campaigns, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the drivers, facilitators, and human factors. Through applying advanced computational techniques, including natural language processing and machine learning, this work unveils critical insights into the psyche of victims and the evolving tactics of modern phishers. Our analysis illustrates very poor password selection choices from the victims, with 30.27% of them picking low-complexity passwords and 58.23% reusing leaked passwords. Additionally, more than 10% exhibit strong persistence in re-victimisation by posting again to the phishing platforms of the same phishers. Finally, we reveal many correlations regarding demographics and the time periods when victims are more vulnerable during the day, as well as analyse the sentiment, emotion, and tone of text responses that they submitted, illustrating how convinced they were of the scam.}

	abstract = {The network security problem in today's world is becoming more and more prominent, and intrusion detection as a branch in the field of network security has been developed tremendously. At present, back propagation (BP) neural network is widely used in intrusion detection. However, its weights and thresholds are randomly initialized, so that fall into local optimal after training. To solve this problem, an intrusion detection model based on improved social network search (ISNS) algorithm to optimize BP neural network is proposed. The model first uses chaotic mapping and elite mechanism to improve the original Social Network Search (SNS) algorithm, and then uses the ISNS algorithm to filter the initial weights and thresholds of the BP neural network, and constructs the neural network with the optimal values to avoid falling into local optimum. The experimental results show that the proposed method solves the problem that the traditional BP neural network is easy to fall into local optimum. At the same time, the ISNS_BP model achieves better classification performance than other models, and the accuracy on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets reaches 98.62% and 93.97%, respectively.}

It contains a 12-digit unique identification number (known as the Aadhaar number) and personal details such as name, address, date of birth and biometric data. The biometric data captured for Aadhaar includes fingerprints, facial images and iris scans, which are unique to each individual. The Aadhaar data is used for entity authentication while accessing various government services, availing subsidies, opening bank accounts and conducting other identity-dependent transactions. Thus, the Aadhaar framework provides efficient authentication services in India's public delivery systems. Although UIDAI has implemented stringent security measures such as encryption, access controls and regular audits of the system, the use of Aadhaar has raised several concerns regarding privacy and data security aspects. In this regard, only a handful of studies discuss the security challenges related to Aadhaar. Furthermore, the Aadhaar framework itself is always evolving, thus making prior studies less informative. This paper describes in detail the security features of the Aadhaar card while emphasizing the security challenges involving demographic and biometric data. We have also outlined the preventive measures that can be enforced to secure these data. Finally, this study investigates possible linkage attacks that could occur when different databases are linked for Aadhaar-enabled public schemes. Hence, our work summarizes the security and privacy implications of the Aadhaar infrastructure from a holistic perspective. We believe that our work would be useful for security professionals and policy makers engaged in designing large-scale authentication frameworks.}

The Botnets are the most dangerous threats that launch a wide range of cyberattacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam emails, spreading malware, and stealing sensitive information. The identification and categorization of botnets has become a highly complex and critical process due to the massive amount of network traffic generated every second. This paper presents a multilayer botnet detection and classification framework based on explainable machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach comprises of three distinct layers: Feature Selection Layer, Botnet Detection Layer and Botnet Classification Layer. The Feature Selection Layer reduces the dataset into six essential features, that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the framework. The botnet detection layer detects botnet activity by filtering the reduced dataset into normal packets and botnet packets. The filtered botnet packets further examined by botnet classification layer to classify the botnet packets into different types of botnets. Moreover, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique is utilized to provide transparency to the model's decision-making process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, NCC-2 and CTU-13 datasets are examined. 10-fold cross-validation technique is applied to validate the experimental findings. The average accuracy achieved by proposed approach in botnet detection stands impressively at 99.98%, while the average accuracy achieved in classifying botnet families is 99.30%, exhibiting an exceptional level of performance. The comparative analysis is performed which demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score.}

The proliferation of online advertising technologies further exacerbates privacy concerns by exploiting user data for marketing or surveillance, frequently without explicit consent. It is crucial to regularly ensure the latest features of default configurations, which are most relevant for novice users, adequately address growing privacy demands given the centrality of web browsers to internet usage. Our work scrutinizes the privacy claims of 14 desktop browsers and their default configurations, from mainstream options like Chrome to those prioritizing privacy, such as Brave. We validate these claims through a suite of privacy tests on two operating systems commonly used by cyber novices. Based on our findings, we categorize browsers into three tiers of privacy protection. We conclude by outlining future browser design principles and offering privacy-centric recommendations tailored for novice users.}

In this study, we integrate the security notions of cryptographic primitives with formal methods. Particularly, we use observational equivalence to create security games within the symbolic model. This innovative approach allows for the automation of security detection for cryptographic primitives within the symbolic model. In addition, we have designed and implemented various cryptographic primitives that satisfy different security properties and detect them with our developed security games. The results confirm the effectiveness of our security games. It is worth mentioning that the cryptographic primitives and the characterization of adversary capabilities discussed in this paper can be extended to the formal analysis of other protocols. The ultimate goal is to relax the assumption of perfect encryption and narrow the gap between the formal analysis of security protocols and the real world.}

Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown promise in detecting some types of attacks. However, they are not universally successful in detecting sequential attacks. In this study, we propose RRIoT, to mitigate this issue. RRIoT applies a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm in conjunction with an LSTM layer within an adversarial environment to detect and identify attacks. We evaluate our method against novel and state-of-the-art ML/RL algorithms which build upon previous RL algorithms such as deep Q-networks (DQN), dueling deep Q-networks (DDQN), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Our results indicate that our proposed RRIoT generally performs better than existing ML algorithms and performs as well as or better than novel RL algorithms with new network architectures. We leverage Shapley Additive Global Importance (SAGE) to provide additional insight into which features contribute most to a model's performance and verify feature importance through the implementation of an ablation study across three IoT telemetry datasets.}

	abstract = {A core problem of vulnerability detection is to detect multi-type vulnerabilities simultaneously by characterizing vulnerabilities of high diversity and complexity in real program source code. Current methods mainly adjust and compromise multiple code representations such as code sequence and code graph based on composite graph. However, sequential features extracted by graph are hardly sufficient to model the contextual semantic associations of the token sequence. Meanwhile, structural features of the code graph extracted by models based on Euclidean Graph Neural Network are difficult to fit the tree-like calling relationships between code lines. These limitations make it difficult to detect diverse vulnerabilities. In addition, most of the existing models ignore the type of code statement, which is closely associated with some specific vulnerability types. In this paper, we propose a Parallelism Framework with Hierarchical feature Enhancement for Multi-type Vulnerability Detection (PFHE-MVD). PFHE-MVD models program code from three parallel perspectives, containing sequence, code graph, and Abstract Syntax Tree statistic. Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network is integrated to model the top-down hierarchical calling structure in program code graph through hyperbolic space mapping. Besides, the statement type of code is embedded along with the code text to strengthen the identification ability for different types of vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that PFHE-MVD achieves new state-of-the-art results in multi-type vulnerability detection. PFHE-MVD captures tree-like hierarchical code structure feature and enhances the distinguishing ability for vulnerabilities by code statement type embedding.}

Researchers have proposed various approaches to mine semantic information from API calls to improve the performance of malware analysis. However, with increasingly sophisticated malware, the exploration of new semantic dimensions for API calls is never-ending. In this paper, we find that the official Windows API documentation is an unexplored information source in malware detection. Therefore, we propose a novel documentation-augmented Windows malware detection framework DawnGNN using the pre-trained semantic enhanced mechanism and graph neural network. First, it converts the API sequences into API graphs for further contextual information extraction. Next, we crawl API documentation from the official website and employ the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to encode functionality descriptions as API embeddings. Finally, it feeds the API graphs with API node attributes into the Graph Attention Network (GAT) classifier to perform Windows malware detection. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of DawnGNN on three public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DawnGNN. Semantic information from the official API documentation is promising in the Windows malware detection domain.}

One such issue is DDoS attacks on edge servers, which arise when edge tasks are offloaded. There is a dearth of research on countermeasures for these kinds of DDoS attacks. Consequently, we present EDM_TOS, a task offloading strategy. This technique makes sure that tasks are transferred to dependable edge nodes based on the edge nodes' risk assessment mechanism, thereby reducing edge DDoS attacks. On the other hand, EDM_TOS works better than current approaches in five domains of evaluating awareness and capacity limitations for resolving edge DDoS attacks and issues with edge computing offloading. The edge computing task offloading algorithm, weighted cluster analysis algorithm, and risk assessment algorithm, respectively, are used to implement the risk assessment module, cluster analysis module, and task offloading module of the EDM_TOS mechanism. The three modules were evaluated experimentally. The findings demonstrate that the task offloading module's transactions per second (TPS) and the risk assessment module's malicious detection rate (MDR) respectively outperform to those of other policies. The cluster analysis module's clustering effect is superior to that of the conventional K-means algorithm. EDM_TOS performs better than current methods for thwarting edge DDoS attacks, according to performance assessments on five datasets. EDM_TOS can successfully fend off edge DDoS attacks, as demonstrated by practice.}

Besides security threats, trust among participants is also a primary concern because many participants may be unknown to each other. Thus, security and trust play a vital role in secure and trustworthy social networking. Current research addresses OSN security and privacy, yet gaps persist in exploring emerging threats (Profile cloning, Sybil attacks) and their countermeasures, along with the crucial aspect of trust management. This paper discusses various security threats and current defense solutions against them. We mainly explore the two most immerging security threats: Profile cloning and Sybil attacks. Besides security threats and their solutions, we also discuss trust management in online social networks. We conduct a comprehensive review of various trust evaluation methods and present our discoveries from the extensive literature survey. Additionally, we provide an overview of potential avenues for future research in this field.}

	abstract = {Honeypot technologies are becoming increasingly popular in cybersecurity as they offer valuable insights into adversary behavior with a low rate of false detections. By diverting the attention of potential attackers and siphoning off their resources, honeypots are a powerful tool for protecting critical assets within a network. However, the cybersecurity landscape constantly evolves, and professional attackers are always working to uncover and bypass honeypots. Once an adversary successfully identifies a deception mechanism in place, they may change their tactics, potentially causing significant harm to the network. Maintaining a high level of deception is crucial for honeypots to remain undetectable. This paper explores various deception techniques designed specifically for honeypots to enhance their performance while making them impervious to detection. Previous research has not provided a detailed comparison of these techniques, particularly those tailored to honeynets. Therefore, we categorize the presented techniques into relevant classes, subject them to a comparative analysis, and evaluate their effectiveness in simulation scenarios. We also present a mathematical model that comprehensively represents and compares various honeynet research endeavors. In addition, we provide insightful suggestions that highlight the existing research gaps in this field and offer a roadmap for future expansion. This includes extending deception techniques to emulate vulnerabilities inherent in 5G and software-defined networks, which address the evolving challenges of the cybersecurity landscape. The findings and insights presented in this paper are valuable to honeypot developers and cybersecurity researchers alike, providing a vital resource for advancing the field and fortifying network defenses against ever-evolving threats.}

DT can provide numerous advantages such as real-time synchronised functioning, monitoring and data analysis. However, security and privacy issues in DT have not been thoroughly investigated. This article proposes a user-empowerment-based privacy-preserving authentication protocol for a cloud-based Digital Twin using a Decentralised Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC). Here, user empowerment provides full control to users over their identities, and with the help of VC, users can prove their authenticity and preserve their privacy. Although DID has emerged as a promising technology for introducing user empowerment, it suffers from some fundamental problems such as usability and auditability. Here we address all these issues and propose a user-revocation-enabled security solution for the DT. A security analysis of the proposed scheme shows that it is secured against significant security threats. With the help of performance analysis, we prove that the proposed work effectively ensures security and privacy in DT.}

	abstract = {Consumer privacy protection has become an important issue and challenge in the development of e-commerce, and consumers' concerns for privacy may lead to negative user experiences and make them more cautious about disclosing personal information. As one of the widely adopted privacy concerns inhibiting approaches, the accumulated information privacy literature indicated that providing privacy controls may not always mitigate privacy concerns, implying that there are potential boundary conditions to be clarified. This study aims to explain the inconsistent effect of perceived privacy control on privacy concerns from the perspective of individual factor differences among consumers. We investigated the roles of trust, Internet privacy experience, and risk propensity in the relationship between perceived privacy control and privacy concerns. We collected empirical data containing 625 representative samples of Chinese consumers based on a mainstream online survey platform in China. The results suggest that trust in e-commerce partially mediates the influence of perceived privacy control on privacy concerns. Internet privacy experience positively moderates the relationship between perceived privacy control and trust in e-commerce, and both Internet privacy experience and risk propensity negatively moderate the relationship between trust in e-commerce and privacy concerns. This study extends existing information privacy and trust literature through the analysis of the mediating effect of trust and the moderating effects of consumers' individual factors. We also discuss the potential positive and negative implications of this research.}

Decisions to apply technical or policy solutions must consider how an individual's values and moral stance influence their responses to these implementations. Our research aims to evaluate how individuals prioritise different ethical principles when making cybersecurity sensitive decisions and how much perceived choice they have when doing so. Further, we sought to use participants‚Äô responses to cybersecurity scenarios to create profiles that describe their values and individual factors including personality. Participants (n = 193) in our study responded to five different ethically sensitive cybersecurity scenarios in random order, selecting their action in that scenario and rating and ranking of the ethical principles (i.e., Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice, Autonomy, Explicability) behind that action. Using participants‚Äô demographics, personality, values, and cyber hygiene practices, we created profiles using machine learning to predict participants‚Äô choices and the principle of most importance to them across scenarios. Further, we found that, generalising, for our participants Autonomy was the most important ethical principle in our scenarios, followed by Justice. Our study also suggests that participants felt they had some agency in their decision making and they were able to weigh up different ethical principles.}

	abstract = {Tor anonymity communication system provides privacy to users while also allowing sensitive users to access illegal websites. Website fingerprinting (WF) attack is a technique employed to identify websites visited by users, serving as a crucial tool for effectively recognizing user access to illegal online content. However, the majority of existing WF methods heavily rely on extensive training data, which faces challenges when dealing with more common few-shot scenarios which involve limited traffic traces. In such circumstance, these methods often fall into low accuracy in face of the absence of sufficient samples. Therefore, a N-shot WF recognition method with effective fusion feature attention (WF3A) is proposed in this paper. Different from the conventional single-feature recognition method, we innovatively combine direction and length, design and use the fusion feature that covers more website identification information; In order to interpret the traffic patterns that can identify the website categories from the fusion feature, we introduce the Enhanced Channel Attention (ECA) and design a stronger feature extractor when constructing WF model, which enhances the learning ability of the model by channel attention mechanism. The experimental results indicate that fusion feature outperforms original feature in few-shot scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed WF3A demonstrates superior performance compared to existing WF method. In the closed-world, the classification accuracy of WF3A is enhanced by 3.86% to 56.3% compared to existing methods. In the open-world, when the recall is controlled at 91.43%, the precision still remains stable at 81.16%.}

	abstract = {The rise of payment details theft has led to increasing concerns regarding the security of e-commerce platforms. For the MageCart threat family, the attacks employ e-skimmers, which are pieces of software code that instruct clients to forward payment details to an attacker-controlled server. They can be injected into hosting providers' servers as HTML tags such as script, iframe, and img. By leveraging image steganography - the technique of hiding structured information inside images without visual perturbances - MageCart groups can deliver e-skimmers without raising suspicion. In this work, we systematically review applicable solutions in the literature and evaluate their drawbacks in the setting of a compromised hosting provider. While promising, existing solutions in the literature present shortcomings such as a lack of compatibility, adaptability, or functionality in the presence of an attacker. Based on this review, we compile a set of features for a better solution, which we use as a foundation for designing our proposed solution - NAISS: Network Authentication of Images to Stop e-Skimmers. Through our solution, digital signatures of individual images are checked inside a server-side middlebox residing in the hosting provider's network to prevent the transmission of unauthorized images to clients. Elliptic curve signatures are provided by the e-commerce platform developer prior to uploading a website to the hosting provider. Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that NAISS is capable of filtering 100% of present stegoimages, regardless of their novelty, while imposing a minimal performance detriment and no client-side modifications.}

The use of named entity recognition not only allows for the detection of potential vulnerabilities, but also for the classification of different vulnerability types. This research uses the publicly available CodeBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT models to fine-tune for the downstream task of token classification for six different common weakness enumeration specifications. The results achieved in this research outperform previous Python-based vulnerability detection methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of applying named entity recognition to enhance the overall research into Python source code vulnerabilities.}

However, such service outsourcing also entails critical data privacy concerns, as the cloud providers are generally not in the same trust domain as the data owners/users and could even suffer from data breaches. In this paper, different from most existing works that propose security designs for keyword search, we focus on secure realizations of advanced skyline query processing, which plays an important role in multi-criteria decision support applications. We propose BopSkyline, a new system framework for privacy-preserving skyline query service in cloud computing. BopSkyline is designed to not only ensure the confidentiality of outsourced databases, skyline queries, and query results, but also conceal data patterns (like the dominance relationships among database tuples) and search access patterns that may indirectly lead to data leakages. Notably, through a delicate synergy of key ideas on secure database shuffling and differentially private database padding, BopSkyline achieves a significant performance boost over the state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art prior work, BopSkyline is up to 4.7√ó better in query latency and achieves up to 99.38% cost savings in communication.}

	abstract = {Spyware is a type of malware widely used by attackers to steal confidential information from users without their knowledge. It has the characteristics of high latency, high stealth, and high threat. Spyware typically uses trigger-based tactics to implement its malicious behavior, making it a challenge for traditional host-based detection methods and traditional network traffic-based detection methods to implement highly accurate and efficient spyware detection. To address this problem, this article focuses on the network behavior of spyware, analyzes the inducibility of spyware network traffic, and further proposes a spyware network traffic detection method based on inducement operations (SNDMI). SNDMI can cause spyware to generate more network traffic for detection by using inducement operations in the constructed inducement operation set. SNDMI extracts three types of network traffic features: distributional features, statistical features, and trend features, and uses a genetic algorithm to select features. The experimental results show that SNDMI with LightGBM achieves an accuracy of 98.98% and a false positive rate of 0.45% on the traffic of hundreds of benign and spyware samples.}

	abstract = {Currently, the prevalence of Android malware remains substantial. Malicious programs increasingly use advanced obfuscation techniques, posing challenges for security professionals with enhanced disguises, a proliferation of variants, and escalating detection difficulty. Leveraging semantic features presents a promising avenue to address these challenges. Rich semantic information encapsulated within opcodes and API call graphs has been identified as crucial in distinguishing benign from malicious applications. Consequently, various Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, such as Word2vec, are employed to encode features of Dalvik opcode sequences, thereby yielding embedded representations. Given that malware developers often opt for semantically similar APIs to achieve comparable functionalities, it is posited that the opcode embeddings for such APIs should exhibit similar characteristics. However, simple NLP models that only extract statistical information are insufficient for understanding obfuscated malware's behavioral patterns, as they do not provide comprehensive semantic insights. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel, lightweight embedding model based on CodeBERT and TextCNN. This model aims for efficient and precise representation of opcode sequences. Consequently, we introduce GSEDroid, an Android malware detection framework that uses an API call graph with permission and opcode semantic features to characterize APKs. This approach converts the detection challenge into a graph classification task executed via a graph neural network algorithm. The efficacy of our method has been validated through comparative analyses with other techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our GraphSage+SAGPooling model achieved an accuracy of 99.47% and an F1-score of 99.44%, underscoring its effectiveness in Android malware detection.}

	abstract = {System logs record system operation status and important event information. They are the important basis for debugging system failures and cause analysis. Due to the low accuracy of log parsing and insufficient labeled samples, anomaly detection precision is low. Therefore, we propose a new log-based semi-supervised anomaly detection method named BTCNLog. Firstly, the improved log parsing method with the dictionary keeps part of the parameter information in the log event. So, it can improve the utilization rate of log information and the accuracy of log parsing. Then, BERT is used to encode the semantic information to obtain the semantic vector of the log for the template. What's more, the clustering method is applied to estimate the tag to deal with insufficient data tagging problems. Therefore, it can improve the ability to detect unstable data for the model. Finally, a bidirectional temporal convolution network (Bi-TCN) with residual blocks is introduced to capture contextual information from two directions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, BTCNLog is compared with six baselines on two datasets. The final experimental results show that, compared with the latest three benchmark models, LogBERT, PLELog, and LogEncoder, the proposed method showed an average improvement of 7%, 14.1%, and 8.04% in F1 values.}

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) was originally invented to reduce the cost of the prototyping process. Over time, the technology evolved to be faster, more accurate, and affordable. These factors, in addition to the potential use of AM in parts production, have helped rapidly drive the growth of AM in both industrial and personal uses. Thus, there is an accompanying demand to understand the cybersecurity implications of such systems. In our research, we present an in-depth security review of Stratasys Dimension Elite and show how manufacturers of such high-end 3D printers failed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the printed 3D models. Revealing the intricate dimensions of cyber threats within the realm of AM and laying the foundation for understanding the multifaceted nature of attacks, offering insights into vulnerabilities and potential consequences. Moreover, we demonstrate the massive impact network attacks can have on 3D printers' communication channels. Our sniffing attack stole transmitted models with a minimal overhead of 0.015 seconds to evade detection. The developed replacement attack targeted and replaced specific models with offline-prepared models. Also, we automated a sabotaging attack to alter the interior model structure on the fly with minimal visual but significant strength differences. By revealing these attacks, this research not only improves the security posture of 3D printers but also enhances the understanding of security challenges in additive manufacturing as a whole.}

As an alternative to many defense techniques of ROP attacks that require software modification and hardware assistance, researchers have proposed ROP defense techniques using hardware performance counters (HPCs) to mitigate concerns about additional cost and compatibility issues. However the existing HPC data-based ROP detection techniques typically suffer from low detection performance mainly because of the non-deterministic nature of HPCs.}

	abstract = {Google Play and other application marketplaces have various Android applications and metadata. Among these, description information and privacy policy help explain the application's functionality. They also describe the permission of the application, especially those related to sensitive information. Detecting the inconsistency between the description of the application and privacy information and the permission extracted in the application's source code helps users decide whether to install and use the application. In this research, we propose a new method based on a pre-trained language model to detect inconsistencies between the permission extracted from the description application and privacy policy and the permission extracted from the application's source code (file APK). Related works focus on models of large-scale datasets, especially for resource-rich languages such as English. However, a language with low resources, like Vietnamese, needs more datasets for the task. To solve this problem, we propose the ViDPApp dataset (Description and Privacy Policy of Applications on Vietnamese domains), a high-quality dataset that humans manually annotate with 12,000+ sentences with an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of over 85%. In addition, we proposed XLMR4MD, a new framework using large language models, outperforming powerful machine models (LSTM, Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN, WikiBERT, DistilBERT, mBERT, and PhoBERT) and achieving the best with 84.04% F1 score in detecting inconsistencies between Android application permission and description. This framework can be fine-tuned for 100 languages, which benefits low-resource languages like Vietnamese. The dataset is available for research purposes.}

	abstract = {As cyber attacks are growing, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enhances the ability of security systems to resist novel cyber threats. However, since most CTI is unstructured data written in natural language, it needs to be understood and summarized by security experts to be effectively utilized. To address the problem, we adopt the ATT&CK matrix as the taxonomy to propose a method for automated mapping of unstructured threat intelligence to tactics and techniques. The proposed method contains a pre-processor for text denoising, a label extractor for classifying which tactics and techniques category the text belongs to, and a post-processor for correcting the classification results. The label extractor consists of two multi-label classifiers based on DistilBERT for tactics and techniques classification respectively. The post-processor corrects the classification results based on the relations between tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques in the matrix, eliminating errors caused by the independence between categories. In the evaluation, we collect the text data from the ATT&CK knowledge base and real cyber threat reports to build an experiment dataset, which contains 26,602 sentence samples. We apply the proposed method to the dataset to verify its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method can accurately retrieve tactics and techniques with\nF\n0.5\nscore of 85.50% and 75.17% respectively, which outperforms the baseline method by about 10%.}
