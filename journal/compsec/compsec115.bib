	abstract = {Existing studies using deception are ad-hoc attempts and few theoretical models have been designed to plan and integrate deception. We theorise that a pre-planning stage should be a fundamental part to obtain information about the attackers’ behaviours and the attack process by analysing known attacks. This will help plan and take defence actions by actively interacting with the attackers and predicting their actions using a probabilistic approach. This paper proposes a framework that provides a theoretical understanding to plan and integrate deception systematically and strategically. We also present probabilistic modelling to predict attack actions by formalising a real case of attacks captured on simulated Internet of Things devices as an Markov Decision Process (MDP) and verifying related properties using Probabilistic Symbolic Model Checker (PRISM). MDP’s properties verification results reveal that the associated cost for defence actions can be decreased by successfully predicting attackers’ probable actions. Moreover, we identify several quantification metrics (e.g. cost, reward, trust, incentive and penalty) to evaluate the performance of actions performed by attackers and defenders.}

	abstract = {Smartphone authentication is becoming a cornerstone security component, so it is necessary to have methods that are usable and secure to ensure adequate protection, especially for mobile banking. Though biometric authentication seems to be perceived as very usable by users, there is a lack of research to compare smartphone-based fingerprint verification to other authentication methods for mobile banking in terms of usability and perceived security. Using two independent samples, we conducted a study for a younger group aged 26–54 (N = 229) and an older group aged 55+ (N = 239) about their perceptions of the usability and security of four authentication methods: fingerprint, PIN, token, and card reader. All four methods were evaluated positively for both usability and security, with fingerprint verification evaluated as the most usable and the most secure method for mobile banking. Interestingly, none of our hypothesized predictors (i.e., age, gender, education, smartphone self-efficacy, smartphone security behaviour, knowledge of secure smartphone behaviour) was consistently related to how users perceive the usability and security of the examined methods. This suggests that smartphone users would be able to successfully adopt, and be quite satisfied with, any of the tested methods, regardless of demography or smartphone skills.}

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new network architecture that offers considerable management convenience and efficiency relative to conventional networks. However, the centralized control employed in SDN incurs a high risk of single point failure that is susceptible to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The present work addresses this issue by proposing a hybrid approach for detecting DDoS attacks using an initial detection module based on information entropy to quickly identify anomalous traffic and a second detection module based on machine learning with a stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE)–support vector machine (SVM) architecture to confirm the suspected anomalous traffic. If DDoS traffic is detected, a defense module is implemented to restore normal network communication in a timely manner via an issued flow table. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for DDoS detection is experimentally evaluated using both real-time and benchmark datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides superior detection performance and identifies greater than 98% of existing DDoS traffic with greatly reduced training time and computational burden.}

	abstract = {In the commodification of consent, a legal concept designed to empower users has been transformed into an asset that can be traded across firms. Users interact with a consent dialog offered by one coalition member. The default setting allows any other coalition member, including both publishers and third-party vendors, to use this consent as a legal basis for processing personal data. In doing so, the commodification of consent creates interdependent privacy considerations within the notice and consent paradigm. This paper considers how this legal innovation could change the distribution of revenues among firms. Our model shows coalitions create the most value for firms with large consent deficits, which describes the proportion of users who the firm does not directly obtain consent from. The market leader in consent can capture all of the coalition fees by forming a series of 2-firm coalitions. Finally, a model extension shows how consent coalitions shift users towards providing consent to the coalition against the users’ wishes even though the probability of erroneously providing consent in a given dialog remains unchanged.}

	abstract = {Compiler trap doors constitute a longstanding security problem for which there is currently no good solution. This paper presents a practical approach that shifts the focus from compiler correctness in its entirety to compiler correctness for a particular software. The guarantee is that the compiled binary’s control flow is consistent with the source’s control flow for a software of interest. We present an automated method to establish the equivalence by checking whether the source and the binary control flow graphs (CFGs) are isomorphic after semantics preserving graph transformations. The automated method produces evidence that can enable and simplify manual cross-checking as required to qualify an automated tool for safety-critical applications. We believe the proposed control equivalence method and its automation would be equally useful in avionics, automotive, medical devices and other safety-critical software industries where establishing trust in the binary code is critically important.}

	abstract = {The growing size and complexity of today’s computer network make it hard to achieve and maintain so-called cyber situational awareness, i.e., the ability to perceive and comprehend the cyber environment and be able to project the situation in the near future. Namely, the personnel of cybersecurity incident response teams or security operation centers should be aware of the security situation in the network to effectively prevent or mitigate cyber attacks and avoid mistakes in the process. In this paper, we present a toolset for achieving cyber situational awareness in a large and heterogeneous environment. Our goal is to support cybersecurity teams in iterating through the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). We designed tools to help the operator make informed decisions in incident handling and response for each phase of the cycle. The Observe phase builds on common tools for active and passive network monitoring and vulnerability assessment. In the Orient phase, the data on the network are structured and presented in a comprehensible and visually appealing manner. The Decide phase opens opportunities for decision-support systems, in our case, a recommender system that suggests the most resilient configuration of the critical infrastructure. Finally, the Act phase is supported by a service that orchestrates network security tools and allows for prompt mitigation actions. Finally, we present lessons learned from the deployment of the toolset in the campus network and the results of a user evaluation study.}

	abstract = {Recent studies show that attackers evade authentication by exploiting valid credentials and crafting authentication request messages to compromise assets and illegitimately access data in smart communities such as smart campuses and smart cities. In addition, attackers can send large numbers of authentication and data access requests to spread malware across the smart communities’ network and cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper proposes SPrivAD, a secure and privacy-preserving mutually dependent authentication and data access solution by which smart communities’ assets such as users, devices, and apps can authenticate each other before allowing data access. SPrivAD uses an Inter-Attribute-based Zero Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (IA-ZKPK) protocol based on computational attributes of cryptographic operations, and cryptographic identities of the assets to perform Mutually Dependent Multi-Factor Authentication and Data Access (MDMFA). The computational attributes such as message size and number of executed steps of cryptographic operations are features derived from the knowledge of cryptographic operations between the assets. Our approach for deriving a unique, deactivatable, and revocable cryptographic identity is based on the secrets of an asset in a modified Elliptic Curve Pedersen Commitment Scheme (EC-PCS) with security and privacy guarantees. We implement a prototype of SPrivAD and evaluate it with respect to its security, privacy, and performance. The results show that it is secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient for mutually dependent authentication and data access in smart communities. Furthermore, we design and analyse a new attack, Smart Communities Authentication Bypass Attack (SCABA), on real-world authentication and secure access schemes such as Ruckus Cloudpath Enrollment System and Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This type of attack exploits valid credentials of smart communities’ assets. We show that SPrivAD mitigates SCABA.}

With the global increase in cybercrime, practitioners and researchers are increasingly investigating opportunities for applying SCP strategies and techniques to prevent cyber-focused and cyber-enabled crimes. Recent research proposes ways that SCP can be applied to cybercrime. Yet most of this research utilizes only a few of the SCP techniques and the linkages between the SCP techniques and opportunities for reducing cybercrimes are rarely made explicit. In this paper we evaluate the relevance of the full spectrum of SCP techniques to cybercrime and explicate how computer scientists, cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers and practitioners apply SCP principles to prevent and control cyber-enabled crime. Through a focused systematic review of 352 articles across computer science, criminal justice and criminology literature using the PRISMA method, this paper clarifies terminologies, explores the rise of cybercrimes, and explains the value of SCP for responding to cybercrimes. We provide a review of the current research undertaken to apply SCP to cybercrimes and conclude with a discussion on research gaps and potential future areas of research.}

These approaches allow security managers to perform context-aware decision making, adapting controls’ deployment, configuration or use to every specific situation, depending on the current value of risk indicators or scores and on the level of risk tolerated by the organisation at any given time. This paper proposes a model to automatically adapt security controls to different risk scenarios in almost real-time (if required). This model is based on a three-layer architecture and a three-step flow (measurement-decision-adaptation), relying on a scalable policies&rules framework capable of integrating with different kinds of controls. Furthermore, the proposed model is validated and evaluated with an actual use case.}

	abstract = {Cybersecurity teams have widely used malware analysis sandboxes to investigate the threat of malware. Correspondingly, armored malware adopts various anti-sandbox techniques to evade analysis, from simple environment-specific traits detection to complex real-user operation environment verification. Particularly, malware may identify sandbox environments by checking several system artifacts that are impacted by the accumulation of normal user activities, such as file accesses. It remains a challenge to defeat this type of anti-sandbox technique. In this paper, we design an emulation-based system called UBER to enhance malware analysis sandboxes. The core idea is to generate realistic system artifacts based on automatically derived user profile models. We solve two major challenges. First, we generate authentic system artifacts continuously to emulate the real-user behaviors. Second, we integrate the generated artifacts stealthily to hide the trace of the emulation. We implement a system prototype using Python system-event monitor and automation control modules. Our experimental results demonstrate that UBER is capable of generating believable system artifacts and effectively mitigates the sandbox evasion techniques that exploit system fingerprinting.}

The particular strategies for collective privacy employed by each group emerged from a confluence of the group's defining characteristics and core values, the dynamics of interactions within the group, and the group's relationships with people and entities external to it.

	abstract = {Owing to the increasing number and complexity of malware threats, research on automated malware detection has become a hot topic in the field of network security. Traditional malware detection techniques require a lot of human intervention and resources (in terms of time and storage) as these involve manual analysis of all malware files in the application. Moreover, malware authors have developed techniques like polymorphism and code obfuscation that evade the traditional signature-based detection approaches employed by anti-virus companies. To solve this issue, malware detection enabled by deep learning (DL) methods is being used recently. This paper presents a performance comparison of 26 state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models in Android malware detection. It also includes performance obtained by large-scale learning with SVM and RF classifiers and stacking with CNN models. Based on the results, an EfficientNet-B4 CNN-based model is proposed to detect Android malware using image-based malware representations of the Android DEX file. EfficientNet-B4 extracts relevant features from the malware images. These features are then passed through a global average pooling layer and fed into a softmax classifier. The proposed method obtained an accuracy of 95.7% in the binary classification of Android malware images, outperforming the compared models in all performance metrics.}

	abstract = {Payment Channel Networks (PCN) form a class of techniques created to solve the scalability problems that permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin face. The Lightning Network (LN) is the biggest PCN to date. As of September 2021, LN is an interconnected network with 27 thousand nodes and 71 thousand channels, representing a total payment capacity of 2500 bitcoins (\n114\nM\nUSD). LN nodes establish trustless payment channels by locking funds in a funding transaction. The distribution of the funds can be modified with near-instant transactions without broadcasting them to the blockchain. By chaining channels together, it is possible for two nodes to transact without having a direct channel between them. This results in far fewer transactions needing to be broadcast and a theoretical number of off-chain transactions per second that can rival established, centralized payment systems. With off-chain transactions one can obtain more privacy than with on-chain transaction: individual payments through LN should be able to stay private. However, recent research suggests that this is not the case. Several works have shown that channel balances can be tracked with the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA). Monitoring the changes in channel balances over time enables an adversary to track individual payments in LN. Since payments can travel through channels outside the scope of influence of the payer or the payee, these BDA’s form an Interdependent Privacy (IDP) risk for the participants of the LN network. This work applies approximate differential privacy to hide payment amounts of a realistic size in LN. To our knowledge, this is the first time that strong privacy guarantees in the sense of approximate differential privacy are achieved in the setting of LN. We prove the feasibility with our prototype, compatible with LN today. Our solution is evaluated in terms of cost and utility and we show that the latter is not affected by our solution.}

This has led to the introduction of new privacy options by the browsers, including private mode. In this paper, a methodology to explore the effectiveness of the private mode included in most browsers is proposed. A browsing session was designed and conducted in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome running on four different Linux environments. After analyzing the information written to disk and the information available in memory, it can be observed that Firefox and Chrome did not store any browsing-related information on the hard disk. However, memory analysis reveals that a large amount of information could be retrieved in some of the environments tested. For example, for the case where the browsers were executed in a VMware virtual machine, it was possible to retrieve most of the actions performed, from the keywords entered in a search field to the username and password entered to log in to a website, even after restarting the computer. In contrast, when Firefox was run on a slightly hardened non-virtualized Linux, it was not possible to retrieve any browsing-related artifacts after the browser was closed.}

	abstract = {The modern day cyber attacks are highly targeted and incorporate advanced tactics, techniques and procedures for greater stealth, impact and success. These attacks are also known as Advanced Persistent Threats(APT) because of their evasive and stealth nature along with longer foothold on the victim’s digital infrastructure. The malware involved in APT attacks are sophisticated and developed with the intention of sabotaging the victim’s digital infrastructure or performing espionage. They are capable of targeting multiple operating environments starting from desktop and server operating systems (Windows, Linux and MacOS), Mobile platforms (Android, iOS), Embedded platforms (IoT Devices), to Industrial control systems (ICS/SCADA Devices). The evolution of evasive tactics and techniques employed in such advanced malware leads to extensive research efforts to develop mechanisms that can counter these evasion techniques. The research primarily aims to demonstrate that evasive manoeuvers are currently over-weighing the security countermeasures deployed by the prevalent security solutions. This paper will first explain the evasion mechanism in a systematic manner employed in modern APT malware and aims to implement a novel Evasive Manoeuvers Re-Engineering Framework(EMRF).EMRF aims to establish and demonstrate combinations of evasive manoeuvers with much known APT malware samples to elude security solutions. The payload variants, i.e., executable, dynamic link library, and shell-code, were experimented through a research-based framework EMRF to demonstrate 36% to 96% of evasive behavior countering the majority of defender engines. The EMRF system with its dynamic user defined evasion manoeuvers is able to transform non-zero-day payloads more potent by evading majority of the modern security solutions. This research clearly demonstrates the attacker’s ability to deliver non-zero-day payloads easily rather than investing resources and time in discovering zero-day exploits and developing zero-day payloads. This important observation can potentially disrupt the Advanced Persistent Threat Defenses incorporated in modern day security solution where focus is mainly on to detect zero-day payloads and exploits. Exhibiting the threat landscape poised due to APT, the paper utilizes a dataset of 4403 APT malware samples to extract and orchestrate the prevalence of evasive manoeuvers like stealth, covert communication, and anti-analysis mechanisms. This paper will contribute towards advanced malware analysis as an avenue to analyzing intrusion, evasion, and deception to prevent detection and verification, an association of responsibility, and determination of intent.}

	abstract = {The popularity of face-authentication systems has also generated interest in the study of malicious authentication attempts, such as face spoofing attacks. In this study we investigate two dynamic face-authentication challenges: the camera close-up, and head-rotation paradigms. For each paradigm we developed an ML-based face-authentication system that performs the tasks of liveness detection and face verification. In order to generate structured data-representations from the videos collected in the wild, we designed feature representations that extract three-dimensional and spatial characteristics of a face, while also capturing the particular liveness cues of the requested challenge-based movements. Furthermore, a set of Neural-Network models that employ Convolutional Neural Networks and Siamese Neural Network architectures were proposed. To train and test our models we collected a dataset of 177 live videos recorded by 41 different subjects and a set of 243 attack attempts in uncontrolled scenarios. The resulting NN models yield good performance against multiple types of media-based attacks (printed-attacks, screen-attacks, 2D-masks, videos acquired from public social media, deep fakes). The camera close-up system presented an overall liveness detection accuracy of 97.7% and a face verification accuracy of 97.6%. On the other hand, the evaluation of the head-rotation system resulted in a liveness detection accuracy of 92.4% and face verification accuracy of 98.1%. Face authentication methods based on dynamic user-challenges constitute a scalable approach that does not require specialized hardware to increase the security of face authentication systems in realistic usage scenarios. The proposed methods not only make it harder for attackers to generate spoofing attacks, but they also constitute a practical complement to static biometric authentication systems.}

	abstract = {In recent years, issues of privacy preservation in data mining and machine learning have received more and more attention from the research community. Privacy-preserving data mining and machine learning solutions enable data holders to jointly discover knowledge and valuable information, as well as construct machine learning models without privacy concerns. In this paper, we address the distressing problem of privacy-preservation for a novel data model called the semi-fully distributed setting. Differently from the existing scenarios, each record of the dataset in this data model is composed of three parts, in which the first part is privately kept by a data user, the second one is securely stored by the miner, and the rest is publicly known by both the miner and the data user. For this new data model, we propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classification solution based on secure multi-party computation. Our proposed solution not only achieves a high level of privacy but also guarantees the accuracy of the classification model. The experimental results show that the new proposal is efficient in real-life applications. Furthermore, our pioneering study paves the way for new researches into privacy preservation issues for the semi-fully distributed data model.}

	abstract = {Network traffic analysis is an important cybersecurity task, which helps to classify anomalous, potentially dangerous connections. In many cases, it is critical not only to detect individual malicious connections, but to detect which node in a network has generated malicious traffic so that appropriate actions can be taken to reduce the threat and increase the system’s cybersecurity. Instead of analysing connections only, node behavioural analysis can be performed by exploiting the graph information encoded in a connection network. Network traffic, however, is temporal data and extracting graph information without a fixed time scope may only unveil macro-dynamics that are less related to cybersecurity threats. To address these issues, a threefold approach is proposed here: firstly, temporal dissection for extracting graph-based information is applied. As the resulting graphs are typically affected by class imbalance (i.e. malicious nodes are under-represented), two novel graph data-level preprocessing techniques - R-hybrid and SM-hybrid - are introduced, which focus on exploiting the most relevant graph substructures. Finally, a Neural Network (NN) and two Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approaches are compared when performing node behaviour classification. Furthermore, we compare the node classification performance of these supervised models with traditional unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. Results show that temporal dissection parameters affected classification performance, while the data-level preprocessing strategies reduced class imbalance and led to improved supervised node behaviour classification, outperforming anomaly detection models. In particular, Neural Network (NN) outperformed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approaches for two attack families and was less affected by class imbalance, yet one GCN performed best overall. The presented study successfully applies a temporal graph-based approach for malicious actor detection in network traffic data.}
