Our approach combines fingerprinting based on attributes of the initial ClientHello message with the observed behavior of TLS clients when presented with permuted handshake messages in order to enhance the granularity of the derived fingerprints without increasing the required number of exchanged messages. We conduct a detailed evaluation against 21 browsers and TLS clients on two operating systems. The results show a significant increase in the entropy of the achieved splittings, allowing for a more precise identification of the TLS client than permitted by either of the underlying approaches in isolation.}

	abstract = {Twitter, prompted by the rapid spread of alternative narratives, started actively warning users about the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. This form of soft moderation comes in two forms: as an interstitial cover before the Tweet is displayed to the user or as a contextual tag displayed below the Tweet. We conducted a 319-participants study with both verified and misleading Tweets covered or tagged with the COVID-19 misinformation warnings to investigate how Twitter users perceive the accuracy of COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter. The results suggest that the interstitial covers work, but not the contextual tags, in reducing the perceived accuracy of COVID-19 misinformation. Soft moderation is known to create so-called ”belief echoes” where the warnings echo back, instead of dispelling, preexisting beliefs about morally-charged topics. We found that such “belief echoes” do exist among Twitter users in relationship to the perceived safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine as well as the vaccination hesitancy for themselves and their children. These “belief echoes” manifested as skepticism of adequate COVID-19 immunization particularly among Republicans and Independents as well as female Twitter users. Surprisingly, we found that the belief echoes are strong enough to preclude adult Twitter users to receive the COVID-19 vaccine regardless of their education level.}

The Value-based compliance (VBC) analysis method has been suggested to this end, however it has proven to be complex and time-consuming. Computerized software may aid this type of analysis and make it more efficient and executable. The purpose of this paper is to elicit a set of requirements for computerized software that support analysis of competing rationalities in relation to end users’ compliance and non-compliance with information security policies. We employed a design science research approach, drawing on design knowledge on VBC and elicited 17 user stories.

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical-Social Space (CPSS) is a promising paradigm to provide people with an intelligent environment by emphasizing the deep fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and social space. The interdependence of these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and even endanger the people’s life. Thus, the most challenging issue for CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It controls the access behaviors by considering the space information covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed by the performance evaluation.}

In the last decade, cloud services have inevitably entangled with businesses’ and individuals’ daily lives through products and services. On-demand, pay-per-use characteristics encourage corporations to outsource part of their businesses to accelerate their services and multiply value. The latest market tendency toward migration to cloud environments, started in 2019, indicates a flourishing trend in the next few years. Despite the numerous benefits of the cloud computing model for businesses or individuals, security issues still have been stated as the top cloud challenge in 2020. Although various factors affect security, technologies enabling cloud computing such as virtualization and multitenancy, in addition to on-demand characteristics, initiate new security entrances for malevolent activities. In this study, we surveyed service-based cloud computing security issues to establish the current state of the field. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the state of cloud security in the last decade and provide a unified taxonomy of security issues over the three-layer model, i.e., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.}

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the rogue access point (RAP) has been a persistent security threat in IEEE 802.11 networks. By exploiting the vulnerability in the 802.11 family, an RAP can be disguised as a legitimate access point to eavesdrop on victims’ communications. This attack has caused a mass of privacy leakage and property loss events, prompting in-deep researches on RAP detection in both academia and industry. Recently, the phase error extracted in channel state information has been studied in state-of-the-art researches to achieve hardware-based fingerprinting. However, demonstrated by our extensive empirical experiments, we reveal a significant fact that the phase error suffers from a drift phenomenon in widespread wireless devices. Such a phenomenon could cause phase error fingerprints to overlap across different devices and affects attack detection accuracy. Inspired by our significant observation that the phase error drift phenomenon, we innovatively propose a full-model RAP detection mechanism, named PEDR. PEDR introduces a novel fingerprinting concept of the subcarrier-level Phase Error Drift Range and uses it as a reliable hardware fingerprint for full-model RAP detection and source identification. Through evaluating the proposed mechanism with 27 wireless devices, we demonstrate that PEDR shows a better performance in stability and effectiveness than state-of-the-art approaches. PEDR’s detection rate against full-model RAP attacks remained above 90.5% in a real-world wireless dynamic environment with random interference factors.}

	abstract = {Phishing has become a prevailing method for attackers to steal users’ private data and commit fraud, posing a serious threat to Internet users. How to detect phishing websites has attracted great interests from both academia and industry. A popular approach is to use support vector machine (SVM) to detect phishing websites. However, this approach relies on extracting features designated by experts, and the prediction effectiveness of the model is greatly affected by the quality of feature extraction. In addition, it cannot handle features that are not identifiable. Deep learning methods therefore become popular as they do not require manual feature engineering. However, many deep learning methods can only learn feature information of uniform resource locators (URLs) at the character level, while ignoring the intrinsic connections of words. To address these limitations, we propose a novel highway deep pyramid convolution neural network (HDP-CNN), a deep convolutional network that combines character-level and word-level representation information. HDP-CNN first receives the URL string sequences as input, then performs character-level embedding and word-level embedding respectively. Afterward, it uses the Highway network to connect the character-level embedding representation and word-level embedding representation of the URL and extracts local features of different sizes from the region embedding layer. Finally, it passes them into the designed deep pyramid structure network to capture the global representation of the URL. Our experiments illustrate that the information expressed by embedding vectors of different granularities has subtle differences. By combining embedding feature information of different granularities, HDP-CNN exhibits better performance than methods based on single embedding feature information. In our experiments, we construct an imbalanced dataset that has the ratio of benign websites to phishing websites is close to 5:1. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods, with accuracy at 98.30%, true positive rate (TPR) at 99.18%, and true negative rate (TNR) at 94.34%.}

The negative effects of these attacks can not only disrupt or completely disable the system functioning, but also they can have serious safety related consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity in ICS becomes one of the most important issues. In this paper we propose a method for the design of algorithms for the detection of cyber-attacks on communication links between smart devices. The method belongs to the class of semi-supervised data driven approaches and it is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Starting from a predefined range of network hyperparameters and data obtained from system operation without attacks, the proposed method autonomously selects suitable CNN architecture and thresholds for online intrusion detection. Following the characteristics of ICS, the proposed intrusion detection is host based, and in our research we consider the structure of ICS and the feasibility of the attack detection algorithm implementation on control system devices. The method is experimentally verified using two case studies. In the first case study that refers to the publicly available dataset obtained from Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, we present a comparative analysis of the developed method with alternative approaches. The second case study considers a custom developed electro-pneumatic positioning system; in this system we carry out the real-world implementation and validation of the intrusion detection algorithm developed using the proposed method.}

Failure to detect large-scale attacks like DDoS not only makes the networks vulnerable, but a failure of critical lifesaving medical and industrial equipment can also put human lives at risk. Lack of availability of comprehensive and quality network datasets and the narrow scope to build an IDS based on a single machine learning classifier adds further limitations. Such issues can risk producing inaccurate or biased results in the solutions proposed by various researchers. Toward this end, this paper analyzed several datasets (old, recent, non-IoT, and IoT specific) using several individual and hybrid deep learning classifiers. Our goal is to establish a benchmark that can compare several classification models on several datasets to limit (1) dataset quality issues and (2) possible bias in produced results. We reported our empirical results by revealing exciting findings on some of the classifiers, which took hours to converge but could not successfully detect attacks. In contrast, others quickly converged and were able to produce the best results in terms of accuracy and other performance metrics. We believe that this paper's findings will help build a comprehensive IDS by recognizing that classification or prediction models should be trained beyond a limited scope of one dataset or application.}

Therefore, we proposed a cross-site scripting payload detection model based on graph convolutional networks, which could identify the cross-site scripting payload in the content submitted by the user (We termed our implementation of this approach, GraphXSS). We preprocessed the sample, and constructed the processed data into a graph structure, and finally used the graph convolutional network and the residual network to train the cross-site scripting detection model. In experiments, the model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) could achieve AUC value of 0.997 under small sample conditions. Compared with the detection model after adding the residual network structure, the model could converge and stabilize under the multi-layer, and could make the accuracy rate reached 0.996.}

	abstract = {The advent of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing has led to an increased convergence of traditional manufacturing and production technologies with IP communications. Legacy Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, now interconnected via public networks, are exposed to a wide range of previously unconsidered threats, which must be considered to ensure the continued safe operation of industrial processes. This paper surveys the ICS honeypot deployments in the literature to date, provides an overview of ICS focused threat vectors, and studies how honeypots can be integrated within an organisations defensive strategy. We discuss relevant legislation, such as the UK Cyber Assessment Framework, the US NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and associated industry-based standards and guidelines supporting operator compliance. This is used to frame a discussion on our survey of existing ICS honeypot implementations, and the role of honeypots in supporting regulatory objectives. We observe that many low-interaction honeypots are limited in their use. This is largely due to the increased knowledge attackers have on how real-world ICS devices are configured and operate vs the configurability of simulated honeypot systems. Furthermore, we find that environments with increased interaction provide more extensive capabilities and value, due to their inherent obfuscation delivered through the use of real-world systems. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework towards the classification and implementation of ICS honeypots.}

	abstract = {The Internet environment is exposed to diverse and increasingly numerous intrusion attacks due to its continuously expanding scale, threatening the information and assets of individuals and companies. The application of machine learning and deep learning methods has significantly improved the performance of network behavior anomaly detection (NBAD). However, existing NBAD methods based on machine learning classify network behaviors with hand-selected feature vectors, which are not flexible enough to adapt to various cyber environments and new categories of attacks, resulting in low accuracy. Moreover, high-dimensional and large-scale data have significantly increased the training, retraining, and detection time, resulting in low scalability. To solve these problems, an efficient NBAD algorithm based on deep belief networks (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks is proposed. First, a nonlinear feature extraction method using a DBN is applied to extract features automatically and reduce the dimension of the original data while guaranteeing accuracy. Then, a light-structure LSTM network is used to obtain the classification results. The results of multiple experiments show that the proposed approach performs well in feature learning and has high accuracy while obtaining results in a timely manner and easily updating the model.}

	abstract = {Since the emergence of the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm, data leakage has become a serious threat against edge computing users, thwarting the further applications of MEC. Previous studies concentrating on data storage security and deduplication for conventional cloud computing paradigm cannot be simply adapted to edge computing because a central coordinator (for example, a cloud server) with a global view is not always available in MEC. To tackle this problem, we take the particular properties of MEC into consideration and propose secure data deduplication schemes for three MEC settings (i.e., centralized, semi-distributed and distributed settings). All of our schemes can provide secure data storage, retrieval, sharing, and deduplication. Through theoretical analysis, we prove the security of our schemes against typical attacks in outsourced data storage. Experimental results with a real-world deployment environment have showed that our schemes can guarantee service quality of MEC effectively.}

	abstract = {In the booming development of China’s digital economy, the privacy and security issues of personal data in website applications are vital important. Websites need to implement basic personal information protection measures according to China’s existing statutory requirements for privacy protection, such as disclosing personal information protection policies. However, there still is possibility to leak personal information although the sites adopt the self-regulation way. In this study, we first propose the measurement study of popular websites in China combining strategy analysis and web verification, in hope of providing countermeasures for the development of the personal information protection legal system in China. The study is achieved by analysing a collection of 199,060 network behaviours from 663 websites spanning half a year, studying the consistency between behaviour and policy in websites and conducting a systematic analysis of the privacy policies disclosed on all websites. The findings are multi-fold, 67.6% of popular websites in China have publicly disclosed their privacy policies and all compliance requirements have reached more than 60%, while less than 5% of websites have clearly disclosed and strictly followed the policy statement on third-party sharing and cookie retention. Overall, we conclude that the website has a moderate level of transparency under the existing legal conditions, but there is still a lack of functional and usable mechanisms and regulations for users to consent to or deny processing of their personal data on the Internet. To this end, we analyse the measurement results and put forward appropriate recommendations for the website owners, legal institutions and regulatory authorities.}

	abstract = {Binary code traceability aims to use the relevant characteristics of anonymous binary codes to identify concealed authors or teams and replace error-prone and time-consuming manual reverse engineering tasks with automated systems. Although significant progress has been made in source code traceability technology, research on tracking binary files is still limited. Hence, we propose a feature extraction method and deep learning model that exploit the sequence and structure information of binary codes to identify the authors of anonymous and malicious binary codes and their relations with other known binary code families. We further propose a new multigranularity information fusion feature based on biological genes oriented to the traceability of binary codes. The evaluations conducted on the Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset indicate that our method can accurately trace the binary code from 1000 people to the target author with an accuracy rate of 71%. Further, experimental results verify the robustness of the proposed model. For malicious code datasets, in particular, the proposed method achieved a stable traceability accuracy rate for malicious samples using only a small number of training samples. For the problem of malicious code tracking, in 300 team organizations, the proposed method achieved a code-tracing accuracy rate of 82%.}
