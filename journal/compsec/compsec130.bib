	abstract = {With increased reliance on Internet based technologies, cyberattacks compromising users’ sensitive data are becoming more prevalent. The scale and frequency of these attacks are escalating rapidly, affecting systems and devices connected to the Internet. The traditional defense mechanisms may not be sufficiently equipped to handle the complex and ever-changing new threats. The significant breakthroughs in the machine learning methods including deep learning, had attracted interests from the cybersecurity research community for further enhancements in the existing anomaly detection methods. Unfortunately, collecting labelled anomaly data for all new evolving and sophisticated attacks is not practical. Training and tuning the machine learning model for anomaly detection using only a handful of labelled data samples is a pragmatic approach. Therefore, few-shot weakly supervised anomaly detection is an encouraging research direction. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to an existing few-shot weakly-supervised deep learning anomaly detection framework. This framework incorporates data augmentation, representation learning and ordinal regression. We then evaluated and showed the performance of our implemented framework on three benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2018, and TON_IoT.}

	abstract = {Code vulnerability detection has long been a critical issue due to its potential threat to computer systems. It is imperative to detect source code vulnerabilities in software and remediate them to avoid cyber attacks. To automate detection and reduce labor costs, many deep learning-based methods have been proposed. However, these approaches have been found to be either ineffective in detecting multiple classes of vulnerabilities or limited by treating original source code as a natural language sequence without exploiting the structural information of code. In this paper, we propose VDoTR, a model that leverages a new tensor representation of comprehensive code graphs, including AST, CFG, DFG, and NCS, to detect multiple types of vulnerabilities. Firstly, a tensor structure is introduced to represent the structured information of code, which deeply captures code features. Secondly, a new Circle Gated Graph Neural Network (CircleGGNN) is designed based on tensor for hidden state embedding of nodes. CircleGGNN can perform heterogeneous graph information fusion more directly and effectively. Lastly, a 1-D convolution-based output layer is applied to hidden embedding features for classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of VDoTR is superior to other approaches with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure on multiple datasets for vulnerability detection. Moreover, we illustrate which code graph contributes the most to the performance of VDoTR and which code graph is more sensitive to represent vulnerability features for different types of vulnerabilities through ablation experiments.}

	abstract = {Organizations today are greatly challenged by information security threats, which is often due to employee non-compliance with the information security policies (ISPs). By drawing on the organizational justice and citizenship behavior theories, this study develops a theoretical model that examines how each dimension of organizational justice such as perceived distributive justice, perceived procedural justice, perceived informational justice, and perceived interpersonal justice and citizenship behavior affect employees’ ISP compliance intention. We empirically tested the proposed theoretical model with 276 survey responses collected from IS users in governmental and private banks in Ethiopia. Employees’ perceived fairness of security policy compliance outcome, procedures used to design and implement security policies, adequacy of information regarding security policies and interpersonal treatment employees received during ISPs enforcement are found to directly influence employee ISP compliance intention. The study results also suggest that security related citizenship behavior partially mediates the effects of procedural justice, informational justice, and interpersonal justice on ISP compliance intention. This study contributes to the behavioral information security literature by showing the significance of perceived organizational justice and citizenship behavior on employee ISP compliance behaviors. Our results are also helpful for organizations seeking to improve their employees ISP compliance behavior.}

	abstract = {This work introduces a decision support framework, called Cyber Risk Optimiser for Smart homeS (CROSS), which advises both smart home users and smart home service providers on how to select an optimal portfolio of cyber security controls to counteract cyber attacks in a smart home including traditional cyber attacks and adversarial machine learning attacks. CROSS is based on a multi-objective bi-level two-stage optimisation. In stage-one optimisation, the problem is modelled as a multi-leader-follower game that considers both security and economic objectives, where the provider selects a security portfolio to protect both itself and its users, while rational attackers target the weakest path. Stage-two optimisation is a Stackelberg security game that focuses on additional user security controls under the remit of smart home users. While CROSS can potentially be applied to other similar use cases, in this paper, our aim is to address threats against artificial intelligence (AI) applications as the use of AI in smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new cyber threats to home environments. Specifically, we have implemented and assessed CROSS in a smart heating use case in a prototypical AI-enabled IoT environment that combines characteristics and vulnerabilities currently present on existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, demonstrating the selection of optimal decisions.}

	abstract = {As businesses have had to change how they operate due to the coronavirus pandemic, the need for remote work has risen. With the continuous advancements in technology and increases in typical job demands, employees need to increase their work productivity beyond regular work hours in the office. This type of work environment creates even more opportunities for security breaches due to employees intentionally violating information security policy violations. Although explicitly prohibited by information security policies (ISP), organizations have observed that employees bring critical data out of the office to complete their work responsibilities remotely. Consequently, developing a deeper understanding of how work pressure may influence employees to violate ISPs intentionally is crucial for organizations to protect their critical information better. Based upon the fraud triangle theory, this study proposes the opportunity to copy critical data, work pressure, and work completion justification as the primary motivational factors behind why employees copy critical company data to unsecured storage devices to work at home. A survey was conducted of 207 employees from a marketing research firm. The results suggest that opportunity, work pressure, and work completion justification are positively related to nonmalicious ISP violation intentions. Furthermore, the interaction effect between work completion justification and work pressure on the ISP violation intention is significant and positive. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the roles of work pressure and work completion justification on intentional nonmalicious ISP violation behaviors.}

Attack graphs are the most popular AMT amongst academics, while MITRE ATT&CK is becoming the most popular tool amongst practitioners. This research evaluates the effectiveness of attack graphs and MITRE ATT&CK in aiding cyber-attack perception after an attack has taken place. 157 participants were divided into expert and non-expert groups and further subdivided within respective groups. Participants underwent a test designed to demonstrate their comprehension of two cyber-attacks. Participants were also required to express personal preferences, in particular outlining which of the two AMTs was better at aiding their cyber-attack perception. Paired T-Tests reveal that both groups performed better with the attack graph compared to MITRE ATT&CK. Furthermore, both groups outlined a personal preference for the attack graph over MITRE ATT&CK.}

	abstract = {The domain name system is an essential part of the network, and target hosts are often attacked by malicious domain names to steal resources. Some traditional detection methods have low accuracy, poor generalization ability, and high resource overhead on model construction to deal with complex and variable malicious domain names. A three-level dynamic malicious domain detection method (DDOFM) is proposed in this paper. DDOFM only needs to combine a few high-order statistical features of benign domains with some DNS features, without flagging malicious samples and involving them in training. Firstly, the boundary recognition of passive DNS (PDNS) features extracted from DNS traffic is carried out to conduct an early- warning for some domains. Second, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) forward algorithm and normal distribution probability density function are used to calculate the formation probabilities of the warned domains and their probability density values. Then the probabilities of every character in the warned domain name and the standard deviation between these probabilities are counted. Further, the probability density values and the standard deviations of these warned domain names are compared with their respective thresholds to identify the attribution of the warned domain names. Finally, if the domain name is not warned, the Jensen–Shannon divergence (JS divergence) between it and the previous domain name will be calculated. Then the local iterative threshold finding algorithm (LLTFA) proposed in this paper will be combined to determine its attribution and identify whether the host is connected to the command and control (C&C) server. Experiments show that the detection indexes of this method exceed 99% for multiple types of malicious domain names. The C&C servers can also be identified by DDOFM faster than similar methods.}

In this work, we propose a novel method that maliciously exploits the BSS Transition Management frames IEEE 802.11v protocol and demonstrates how such an attack can be performed, by utilizing roaming 802.11 protocols. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of approach has not been examined in the past. Our testbed results suggest that the proposed method is successful, regardless of the legitimate and rogue access point signal strengths provided to the terminal under attack. This is not the case for other MiTM attack methods, where the signal strength provided by the rogue access point to the terminal under attack must be stronger than the legitimate access point signal strength. During the experimentation phase with our testbed, several mobile phone models were used to demonstrate the suggested technique. After demonstrating the validity of the method through the testbed, further analysis is performed with a realistic ray tracing simulator to determine practical attack distance limits in an urban environment under investigation and how an adversary can manipulate a device to connect to a rogue access point.}

In this paper, we propose a fully automated method for assessing the compliance of Android apps with the GDPR requirements for cross-border personal data transfers. We have applied the method to 4593 apps from the Google Play Store discovering that nearly half of the ones sending personal data are potentially non-compliant with GDPR requirements.

	abstract = {Social Media Platforms (SMPs) have changed how we communicate, share, and obtain information. However, this also comes at a cost, as users (willingly) share their Privately Sensitive Data (PSDs), such as pictures, real-time locations, and other personal connections, on SMPs. Recently, privacy concerns have gained much attention from both academia and industry. The current literature lacks the privacy risk assessment model that can lead the management sectors (e.g., industrial, social, and governmental) to cooperate to mitigate the privacy invasion risks of users’ PSDs in SMPs. Hence, we propose a novel assessment model (hereafter referred to as AFPr-AM), suggesting alternative strategies for reducing privacy invasion risks of users’ PSDs in SMPs based on determinant criteria. First, we explore multiple factors from the literature that affect the privacy invasion risks of users’ PSDs. Then, to prioritize the importance of determinant criteria, we seek sixty experts to participate in our survey and rank these factors. Finally, we apply the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process approach for weighting the criteria based on the experts’ opinions. Moreover, we employ a cooperative game theory-based multi criteria decision making framework to assess the possibilities of players’ interactions (e.g., management sectors), considering the weighted criteria as players’ payoffs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFPr-AM model provides effective strategic alternatives to mitigate the possible invasion risks of users’ PSDs in SMPs.}

	abstract = {Recommender systems have shown to popular in many Internet communities, as they could help users discover interesting items based on their history behaviors. However, with the explosive growth of data-intensive tasks and online information, cybersecurity risks become larger, conventional collaborative recommendation algorithms may not meet users’ security requirements. Besides, the sparsity issue and the cold-start issue also hinder the performance of conventional recommendation methods. Recently, deep learning has shown to outperform traditional modeling techniques, which can be employed in Recommender systems (RSs) to improve user behavior prediction. In light of these challenges and observations, an intelligent recommendation method based on multi-interest network and adversarial deep learning is proposed, where multi-source behavior information is applied for multi-view embedding extraction for better prediction performance. Specifically, multi-view preference embeddings, including self-embedding, interaction-aware embedding, and neighbor-based embedding, are combined to model users’ interests at a finer granularity. Besides, in neighbor-based embedding learning, an adversarial search scheme is adopted for fast similarity searching and privacy preservation. Finally, a DNN-based prediction mechanism is adopted for embedding aggregation and final prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposal achieves decent prediction performance with security concerns compared with state-of the-art baselines.}

	abstract = {All malware are harmful to computer systems; however, crypto-ransomware specifically leads to irreparable data loss and causes substantial economic prejudice. Ransomware attacks increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and because of its high profitability, this growth will likely persist. To respond to these attacks, we apply static analysis to detect ransomware by converting Portable Executable (PE) header files into color images in a sequential vector pattern and classifying these via Xception Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model without transfer learning, which we call Xception ColSeq. This approach simplifies feature extraction, reduces processing load, and is more resilient against evasion techniques and ransomware evolution. The proposed method was evaluated using two datasets. The first contains 1000 ransomware and 1000 benign applications, on which the model achieved an accuracy of 93.73%, precision of 92.95%, recall of 94.64%, and F-measure of 93.75%. The second dataset, which we created and have made available, contains 1023 ransomware, grouped in 25 still active and relevant families, and 1134 benign applications, on which the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 98.20%, precision of 97.50%, recall of 98.76%, and F-measure of 98.12%. Furthermore, we refined a testing methodology for a particular case of zero-day ransomware attacks detection—the detection of new ransomware families—by adding an adequate amount of randomly selected benign applications to the test set, providing representative evaluation performance metrics. These results represent an improvement over the performance of the current methods reported in the literature. Our advantageous approach can be applied as a technique for ransomware detection to protect computer systems from cyber threats.}

	abstract = {Lateral movement plays a vital role in a network attack campaign. After breaking into the intranet, perpetrators penetrate to their final target through this procedure. In order to protect the crucial resources of an enterprise, it is of significant importance to identify lateral movement traces. Previous studies related to this area have proposed several methods. However, most of them failed to raise high-quality alerts, and security operators cannot identify the real threat from raised massive alerts and make a response in time. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Behavior Deviation Measurement (BEDIM) to raise a few effective alerts for lateral movement detection. By modeling the behavior deviation level of each machine on the connection expanded graph sequences, BEDIM can locate unusual connections from massive logs as initial abnormal records. Apart from this, BEDIM also applies a strategy to filter benign records from initial abnormal connections to further reduce false alerts. Specifically, we propose two implementations of BEDIM, which are S-BEDIM (Simple) and C-BEDIM (Complex). Compared to related state-of-the-arts, both S-BEDIM and C-BEDIM are more precise, robust, and efficient. To demonstrate this, we conduct experiments on two datasets, which are collected from the intranet of two enterprises. The experiment results show that both S-BEDIM and C-BEDIM can raise a few effective alerts. Especially for C-BEDIM, with taking proper period, it can achieve 100% accuracy on both datasets.}

Among the techniques used for cyber defense, for cyber deception, a better understanding of human perception and behavior is crucial. To this point, the current study used a custom Deception Questionnaire to assess perceptions of cyber deception among experts. In this paper, we use a qualitative thematic analysis over the questionnaire responses, which provides a rich insight into the decision-making process of cyber attackers. Results reveal that experts were unlikely to expect deception, and upon encountering potential deception, a subset of attackers would increase and others decrease their attack activity in response. This work augments prior qualitative analyses indicating that cyber deception creates a psychological impact and behavioral change in cyber attackers. Results support the psychological impact and efficacy of deception to deter malicious actors and provide insights about how defenders might utilize deceptive strategies.}

	abstract = {Data poisoning attack is one of the common attacks that decreases the performance of a model in edge machine learning. The mechanism used in most of the existing data poisoning attacks diverges the gradients to a minimal extent which prevents models from achieving minima. In our approach, we have come with a new data poisoning attack that inverts the loss function of a benign model. The inverted loss function is then used to create malicious gradients at every SGD iteration, which is almost opposite to that of minima. Such gradients are then used to generate poisoned labels and inject those labels into the dataset. We have tested our attack in three different datasets, i.e. MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, along with some preexisting data poisoning attacks. We have measured the performance of a global model in terms of accuracy drop in federated machine learning settings. The observed result suggests that our attack can be 1.6 times stronger than the targeted attack and 3.2 times stronger than a random poisoning attack in certain cases.}

	abstract = {The enormous popularity of Android in the smartphone market has gained the attention of malicious actors as well. Also, considering its open system architecture, malicious attacks don’t seem to wane anytime soon. Cybercriminals use deceptive attack strategies like obfuscation or dynamic code loading to evade the system. A conventional static analysis approach fails to identify such attacks. Mitigating a wide range of evasive attacks requires excogitating savvy dynamic analysis framework. This paper proposes a precise dynamic analysis approach to identify a slew of malicious attacks. The proposed method focus on behavioral analysis of malware that requires reconstructing the behavior of Android malware. The dynamic behavior features used include system calls, binders, and complex Android objects (composite behavior). For efficient malware detection and classification, a feature selection method is used to remove extraneous features. For classification, we use homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble machine learning algorithms. The stacking approach has the best classification results with an accuracy rate of 98.08%. The rigorous experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of the model.}

	abstract = {At the confluence of two great paradigms such as Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Edge Intelligence arises. This new concept is about the smart exploitation of Edge Computing by bringing together reasoning and learning by Artificial Intelligence algorithms and the sensors/actuators computing capabilities. Security is the third paradigm that must join the team in order to have resilient and reliable systems to be used in real-world applications and use cases. Hence, smartness is, in this context, a puzzle of several independent pieces which, once fitted, can derived unprecedented benefits: a) security, b) low communication latency and network load, c) cost and energy saving and d) scalability by means of resource virtualization close to the IoT data generators (IoT devices). In fact, by paying exclusive attention to some of those main pillars and, therefore, disregarding others, edge computation once in operation often suffers from bad performance, unforeseen events or does not exploit the enormous potential that should be unlocked if a proper and complete specification had been laid down. With all this in mind, this work provides a technical review of the available and up-to-date frameworks to implement secure Edge Intelligence, pinpoints the most relevant unfilled gaps (strengths and weaknesses) and, last but nos least, includes challenges and future research lines as a result of our exploration.}

Although malware detection models based on deep learning are very effective in malware detection tasks, deep learning models are very vulnerable to adversarial attacks by adversarial examples. Adversarial malware can fool deep-learning malware detection models into classifying it as benign software. Due to the structural and discrete properties of Portable Executable (PE) files, it is very difficult and time-consuming to generate adversarial malware. Therefore, this paper proposes GAMBD, a gradient-based adversarial malware generative approach that can quickly generate powerful adversarial malware. Compared to existing methods, GAMBD has a higher success rate and takes less time to generate adversarial malware. Through experimental verification, GAMBD can achieve a success rate of 100% adversarial attack and the average time spent is only 2.8s, which is more than 30 times shorter than that of existing methods.}

	abstract = {With the improvement of face forgery techniques, people can easily generate various forgery face images, which brings serious challenges to public confidence. Numerous face forgery detection methods have been proposed, few of them can gain satisfying performance when training and testing forgery face images are generated by different forgery methods. To address this problem, we propose a domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) method, which include feature distribution discrepancy minimization (FDDM) and optimal classier distance minimization (OCDM). FDDM adopts the idea of joint disentanglement and generative adversarial training to separate the irrelevant information and constrains the generator to reduce the discrepancy in feature distribution between source and target domains to obtain domain-shared features. OCDM uses the meta-learning method obtain a domain-invariant representation by minimizing the optimal classier distance between the domain-shared features of source and target domains. With FDDM and OCDM, we can learn an effective domain-invariant representation space in which there exists an ideal classifier equivalent to the optimal source domain classifier and the optimal target domain classifier, and the minimum classifier error can be achieved in both the source and target domains. Ablation experiments on the FaceForensics++ dataset show that compared to the baseline, our method can bring a decrease of\n3.56\n%\nto\n8.56\n%\non Half Total Error Rate (HTER) when the test and training sets are generated by different face forgery methods. And the performance comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art methods also show that our method outperforms other methods.}

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a critical role in the detection of cyberattacks. The latest Graph Neural Network (GNN) technology, which learns over graph-structured data and thus can capture the impact of the network, has shown profuse results in network attack detection. However, most GNN approaches are limited to considering either node features or edge features. Our proposed approach overcomes this limitation by presenting a Node Edge-Graph Convolutional network (NE-GConv) framework which is equipped with both node and edge features. In particular, the network graph is formed by combining IP addresses and port numbers, and node and edge features are defined from packet contents and network flow data, respectively. Then, a two-layer model is designed, which implicitly performs edge classification by explicitly using node and edge features. Hence, the model is sensitive to intrusions in both packet contents and network flow. Furthermore, our framework addresses the constraints of lightweight devices by employing a feature selection unit before the NE-GConv and minimizing the number of hidden layers in the NE-GConv. The experimental results demonstrate our model outperforms other GNN models in terms of accuracy and false-positive rate and is computationally efficient.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is used in many fields that generate sensitive data, such as healthcare and surveillance. The increased reliance on IoT raised serious information security concerns. As IoT traffic is often compressed to optimize resource consumption, sending compressed data without encryption is a significant security risk for violating confidentiality, integrity, and privacy, as the data can be decompressed, read, and modified. The randomization generated by data compression can complicate classifying compressed data from encrypted data. Encrypted and compressed traffic classification is crucial for the security and forensic analysis of IoT implementations. Existing encrypted and compressed data classification approaches suffer from various limitations. This work proposes two Deep Learning (DL) systems to enhance traffic classification with an emphasis on reducing the possibility of falsely classifying compressed traffic as encrypted. The first approach is Engineered Features Classification (EFC), which uses a set of statistical tests. The second approach is Raw Data and Engineered Features Classification (RDEFC), which combines raw data and statistical tests to improve the classification of encrypted and compressed traffic. Our work also addresses the complexity of classifying encrypted samples of compressed files, such as encrypted JPG images. A large dataset is built in this work with different file types, which include TXT, HTML, WAV, PDF, and JPG. Our evaluation results show high performance for the EFC system with classification 80.94% accuracy. The RDEFC system has a significant improvement over the former with 90.55% classification accuracy. Our approaches outperform systems reported in the literature with similar configurations.}

	abstract = {Local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a privacy standard for collecting distributed data. In multi-dimensional data collection, separately perturbing each dimension is one canonical solution to protect privacy. Yet, it commonly falls short in statistical utility due to excessive noise injection caused by the privacy budget split linearly related to data dimensions. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional data collection scheme under LDP, called PPMC, achieving privacy-utility tradeoff through Haar transform-based dimension reduction. Specifically, we apply Haar transform to convert multi-dimensional data into two parts: the average value and eigenvector, so as to lay a foundation for reducing the dimension. We design a probability density-based perturbation mechanism for the average value, which can decrease the noise injection by optimizing the probability distribution. For the eigenvector, a dimension reduction model is presented that promises low utility loss by error-balanced strategy. Further, we develop a global perturbation mechanism for the reduced dimension eigenvector, which can better maintain statistical utility while ensuring privacy via a private sampling strategy. Finally, the noisy multi-dimensional data is generated by utilizing the inverse Haar transform in a locally differential private manner. Theoretical analysis and experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our solution.}
