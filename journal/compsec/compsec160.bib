	abstract = {The safety and reliability of ship navigation systems are critical for secure maritime operations. With growing reliance on digital tools, these systems face increasing vulnerability to cyber–physical threats such as GPS spoofing, sensor manipulation, and control logic interference. This research presents a comprehensive threat model across key navigation subsystems and proposes a multi-layer defense strategy based on cross-sensor validation. Rather than relying on hardware redundancy or statistical anomaly filters, our framework validates sensor data and control decisions through consistency checks across GPS, INS, sonar, and depth systems. Standard filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters, are used for state estimation. Experimental simulations across various attack scenarios show that the proposed defense restores navigational accuracy and operational safety, reducing error by over 99% in most subsystems. A public dataset and codebase are released to support future maritime cybersecurity research on GitHub 1 .}

	abstract = {As organisations embrace immersive environment to conduct their operations, the metaverse can be considered as a prominent technology that both enhance business efficiency and expose them to new security vulnerabilities that cannot be fully mitigated using traditional cybersecurity models. This study explores the adoption of the metaverse through the Trust, Identity, Privacy, and Security (TIPS) framework, emphasising the interdependencies between these security dimensions. Although prior research has examined these factors independently, little attention has been paid to their combined impact on organisational adoption of metaverse. Addressing this gap, we employ qualitative research based on thematic content analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), leveraging insights from in-depth interviews with business and IT professionals from micro & small, and medium enterprises (M/SMEs); entities that often lack extensive cybersecurity resources yet seek competitive advantages through digital innovation. Our findings reveal a structured hierarchical dependency between Trust, Identity, Privacy, and Security (TIPS) factors in metaverse adoption contexts, going beyond just identifying interrelationships between these elements. Specifically, trust in metaverse environments is influenced by user embodiment. The avatar as identity complicates identity verification and privacy protection as digital avatars merge physical and virtual identities. Finally, the metaverse raises privacy concerns, demanding frameworks that ensure transparency and user consent. Insights from our analysis suggest organisations should prioritise security-by-design principles while balancing implementation with user experience considerations to successfully navigate the socio-technical complexities of metaverse adoption.}

	abstract = {Identifying the most effective and scalable methods for notifying website owners about compromises or vulnerabilities remains an enduring challenge. Although some success factors have been identified, results regarding effective senders and notification framing are often inconsistent, and the understanding of how recipients perceive vulnerability notifications is still limited. Heading towards a better understanding, we conducted a 3 × 3 randomized controlled notification experiment, examining the impact of three distinct senders and three variations of notification framings for  n = 581 <math><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">n</mi><mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after" is="true">=</mo><mn is="true">581</mn></mrow></math>  compromised German websites. Our findings revealed a promising trend: receiving any notification significantly increased remediation compared to the absence of one. Remarkably, the choice of sender and framing played only a minor role in our notification experiment, which underscores the importance of notifying compromised websites and should motivate those who find vulnerabilities to take action. Yet, despite these encouraging results, a staggering 58% of the notified websites failed to remediate. To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we conducted follow-up interviews with 42 website owners who did not remediate their websites. The insights were revealing: while our notifications were delivered, many interviewees admitted they either overlooked or dismissed them as spam. This pattern persisted across different senders and framings, highlighting a critical challenge for future notification campaigns. Moving forward, future research should focus on finding ways to cut through the overwhelming amount of daily “spam” and explore strategies for how notifications can effectively convey their importance in recipients’ inboxes. Exploring strategies to raise the general awareness for cybersecurity, encouraging website owners to provide a security.txt, or providing additional assistance in the form of a self-service tool, are some proposals to increase remediation rates. We further recommend that future work should consider theories from communication science or psychology, e.g., Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) or the Elaboration-Likelihood Model, when designing notification campaigns.}

	abstract = {This study explores the impact of information security (infosec) conflicts on employees’ infosec extra-role behavior (voluntary, proactive actions not explicitly mandated by organizational policies), emphasizing how task-related and role-related conflicts shape security outcomes. Grounded in transactional stress theory, the research investigates how employees’ cognitive appraisals of infosec conflicts, perceived as challenges or hindrances, influence their behavioral responses. The findings reveal that task-related security conflicts can escalate into role-related conflicts, increasing psychological strain. Conflicts possess no intrinsic valence, but self-efficacy functions as a pivotal cognitive filter that determines whether infosec conflicts give rise to constructive or defensive behaviors. Job crafting emerges as a key mechanism through which employees transform security challenges into opportunities for enhancing security behaviors, while role-related conflicts drive neutralization behaviors that reduce infosec extra-role behavior. This paper contributes to the behavioral infosec literature by shifting the focus from infosec policy compliance (i.e., in-role behavior) to broader extra-role behaviors and highlights the importance of self-efficacy in managing security conflicts. Practical implications suggest that organizations should foster self-efficacy, reduce task-related conflict, and support role flexibility to encourage proactive security engagement and enhance overall organizational security culture.}

However, its exposed control plane interfaces introduce critical security risks. This paper conducts a systematic static analysis of these interfaces and uncovers insufficient access controls and missing rate-limiting mechanisms. We design four attack strategies and implement seven representative attacks in both local and cloud environments. The experiments demonstrate severe consequences, including sensitive data leakage, denial-of-service conditions, up to 90% CPU overhead, and 70% packet loss in co-located containers, which also lose the ability to resolve non-local DNS queries. Based on these findings, we propose mitigation strategies that have been acknowledged by cloud vendors and the Kubernetes community, with plans for deployment in future releases. This work provides the first systematic study of control plane interface vulnerabilities, and future research should explore automated analysis frameworks and isolated experimental environments to strengthen Kubernetes security in multi-tenant commercial platforms.}

	abstract = {Ransomware is a major cybersecurity threat facing organisations worldwide and has evolved into a highly lucrative criminal enterprise. Over the past five years, Conti, LockBit, and BlackCat/ALPHV have emerged as three of the most prominent ransomware groups, responsible for major cyberattacks across sectors including healthcare, banking, and critical national infrastructure. While these groups are well-known by name and have been discussed in industry articles, blogs, and government briefs, there remains a notable lack of  academic research  into the groups themselves, particularly regarding their origins, values, membership, and organisational structures. This paper addresses this research gap and aims to advance academic understanding of these and other ransomware threat actors, contributing to the evidence base through which they may be better understood and disrupted. Drawing on the PRISMA systematic review approach and a critical analysis of over 500 dispersed sources, including ransomware group communications, we examine the origins, structure, organisation, dynamics and nature of Conti, LockBit, and BlackCat/ALPHV. Our findings reveal that, while each group is unique, they share several noteworthy similarities: Russian origins, business-like operations, an emphasis on brand-building, strong leadership structures, a propensity for retaliation, use of ransomware-as-a-service models, and deployment of multi-level extortion tactics. These insights provide an evidence-based understanding of how such groups function and compare, while also offering important leads for wider mitigation strategies. Consequently, we make several actionable recommendations to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem including undermining ransomware group branding, targeting affiliate networks, and publicly exposing key members. To our knowledge, this is the first academic study to leverage an understanding of these groups, to synthesise such an extensive body of dispersed material, and to apply robust qualitative methods to derive comparative insights for the security research community. In addition, we leverage our findings to introduce a new conceptual framework through which other ransomware groups can be studied, profiled, and compared in the future.}

However, there is also criticism regarding their privacy guarantees, especially when used in regulated use cases that require high levels of assurance on the correctness and binding of a legal identity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive privacy model and analysis of one of the most prominent digital wallets – the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) – as specified by the Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) and the eIDAS 2.0 regulation. We employ a suite of qualitative privacy risk assessment methods to systematically map and evaluate information flows in three key use cases. Our analysis identifies multiple privacy risks – including linkability, identifiability, and excessive attribute data disclosure – and reveals that although the ARF is designed to comply with privacy-by-design principles, inherent design choices, such as the reliance on SD-JWT and mDOC data formats, as well as the concept of a Wallet Unit Attestation (WUA), retain risks to user privacy. Building on our findings, we then highlight how advanced Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), such as (general-purpose) Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), can reduce or mitigate some of these risks.}

	abstract = {Android malware detection achieves high effectiveness through Machine Learning (ML) techniques. While promising, ML-based models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which attempt to alter inputs slightly with functionality-preserving perturbations. Realistically, attackers can hardly take control of victim detectors, fostering attack methods in the black-box scenario. Whereas, researchers often restrict the number of model queries, commonly incurring a large degree of perturbations to evade detection. To mitigate the limitation, we design a  S ubgraph-based  M imicry  Attack , termed SMAttack, for generating Android adversarial malware examples. SMAttack designs snippet-wise manipulations that encapsulate sub-behaviors of Android apps, enabling the semantics-transplanting from benign apps to malicious ones. Furthermore, we leverage a two-stage search procedure to pinpoint the effective perturbations: a greedy algorithm efficiently generates initial adversarial examples and an evolutionary strategy refines the used perturbations by declining redundant manipulations. The experimental results demonstrate that SMAttack effectively evades 12 Android malware detectors. Specifically, it achieves attack success rates ranging from 80% to 97% across 12 state-of-the-art detectors, outperforming other attack methods. In addition, it maintains a mean perturbation ratio of less than 7%, which is approximately 10% lower than that of the compared attacks.}

	abstract = {Applications and OS kernels contain numerous vulnerabilities that are being discovered, reported, exploited, and patched on a regular basis. The discovery of vulnerabilities may be done by both security professionals and malicious actors. Sometimes, once a vulnerability is discovered by malicious actors, it may not be known to security professionals and remain unpatched for years. This leaves even systems that require a high level of security and adopt strong threat models, such as those based on confidential computing, vulnerable to attacks, including remote arbitrary code execution. Control flow enforcement solutions may fail to prevent such attacks due to the vulnerability being related to part of an unusual but valid program control flow. Once such attacks are successful, an attacker may inflict further damage by performing secondary actions such as privilege escalation or container escape. Existing solutions fail to defend against such attacks in many cases. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called  spatial specialization , to protect cloud VMs and containers from zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. Spatial specialization works by limiting the execution of system calls according to where, in the address space, they are required by the application. Our approach is applicable to server applications as well as software tools. We implement our solution in C, and through experimental evaluations, we show that it can prevent up to 96 % of attacks, while the state-of-the-art solution can only prevent 66 %. Through performance benchmarking, we show that our solution has a reasonably low overhead.}

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) has been identified as a key paradigm for enhancing data-centric communication, particularly in the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the scalability issues in existing solutions. Caching in NDN is a crucial mechanism for improving network performance by reducing latency and conserving bandwidth. However, it also introduces significant security challenges, making the system vulnerable to attacks like Cache Pollution Attacks and Side-Channel Timing Attacks, which can undermine data integrity and lead to denial-of-service scenarios. Traditional caching strategies, such as the Least Recently Used policy, predominantly rely on data usage frequency and often overlook critical factors including content popularity and data freshness. This oversight leaves the cache susceptible to exploitation, as it cannot effectively distinguish between valuable content and malicious requests. This paper proposes a cache management mechanism that integrates metrics such as content popularity and data freshness, facilitating early detection and mitigation of malicious activities while maximizing cache efficiency. Our results demonstrate a 96 % success rate in early detection and mitigation, significantly improving the security and reliability of the IoT-NDN ecosystem.}

Current Android malware classification approaches exhibit notable limitations: methods that ignore program semantic information often demonstrate suboptimal accuracy and robustness, while techniques leveraging control-flow or data-flow graph representations, though more effective, face computational challenges due to large graph sizes and high overhead. In response to these limitations, MCGDroid is introduced as a novel solution for classifying Android malware, utilizing a representation based on multi-feature class-call graphs. MCGDroid processes disassembled smali code to construct class-call graphs, where nodes are enriched with semantic features including opcodes and sensitive APIs. These class-call graphs, enriched with multiple features, are subsequently processed through a graph convolutional network to carry out malware detection and classification tasks. We confirmed the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method through comprehensive experimental evaluation. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that MCGDroid attains high detection and classification accuracies of 98.92% and 97.02%, respectively, with corresponding F1-scores of 98.54% and 96.65%. When evaluated on the obfuscated test set, the model maintains robust performance, achieving 93.12% detection accuracy and 86.26% classification accuracy.}

	abstract = {Detection of Suspicious Hidden Sensitive Operations (SHSO) is essential for identifying security vulnerabilities in Android applications. However, accurately identifying SHSO is complicated by anomalous control flow. Existing methods represent the main program, which includes exception handling code, as a control flow graph. The uncertainty of anomalous control flow results in missing edges between certain subgraphs and the main program entry, rendering certain subgraphs unreachable and preventing SHSO detection. Additionally, the distribution of normal sensitive operations is often imbalanced, resulting in prediction bias and misidentification of minority class samples. To address these issues, a method for detecting Android app SHSO that achieves high coverage of program execution paths is proposed. This method uses instruction labels to pinpoint exception handling code and extracts relevant sensitive function calls to complete execution paths. We implement similarity-based binary clustering of normal sensitive operations to filter minority classes and construct independent classification models for each class to reduce false positives. Experimental results show that the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple datasets, enhancing both recall and accuracy in SHSO detection.}

	abstract = {The growing popularity of Android requires malware detection systems that can keep up with the pace of new software being released. According to a recent study, a new piece of malware appears online every 12 seconds. To address this, we treat Android malware detection as a streaming data problem and explore the use of active online learning as a means of mitigating the problem of labelling applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Specifically, we develop a semi-supervised active learning framework that incrementally trains online learning models using only samples with low prediction confidence, while detecting concept drift and retraining the models when drift is observed. Our resulting framework achieves accuracies of up to 96 % on a balanced dataset, requires as little as 24 % of the training data to be labelled, and compensates for concept drift that occurs between the release and labelling of an application. We also consider the broader practicalities of online learning within Android malware detection, and systematically explore the trade-offs between using different static, dynamic and hybrid feature sets to classify malware. We find that features derived from static API calls lead to the best performing models, though models based around lower-dimensional permission and opcode feature sets provide a potentially more practical basis for deployment, with only a marginal deficit in accuracy. Dynamic and hybrid feature sets are found to significantly increase feature extraction costs with no net benefit to predictive performance.}

	abstract = {Personal identification number (PIN) authentication remains prevalent in mobile and IoT systems due to its simplicity, yet it is inherently vulnerable to various attacks such as shoulder surfing, smudge analysis, and brute force attempts. To reinforce its security without compromising usability, we propose KDPrint, a passive authentication framework that transforms keystroke dynamics into graph-based image representations. By applying a hash-based permutation and standardized feature processing, KDPrint captures the temporal and spatial structure of user behavior while mitigating raw data exposure. The resulting images are used with lightweight anomaly detection models, enabling accurate user verification under resource-constrained environments. Experiments involving 50 participants across both laboratory and real-world environments demonstrated that KDPrint maintained robustness under two adversarial scenarios: an EER of 3.3 % when only the PIN was leaked, and an EER of 4.4 % when both the PIN and behavioral characteristics were exposed. These results demonstrate that KDPrint offers a practical and interpretable solution for augmenting PIN authentication in mobile and IoT systems, balancing robustness, efficiency, and user transparency.}

The MITRE Corporation’s community-driven initiatives, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), play a vital role by offering standardized identifiers and descriptions for known issues. However, the intricate relationships between these vulnerabilities present major challenges for effective mitigation. To address this, there is increasing interest in using graph-based modeling techniques to integrate CVE and CWE data into a unified knowledge graph. Our research aims to connect this data to enhance vulnerability analysis and management. We propose a method to build and refine a cybersecurity knowledge graph that consolidates information from the CVE, CWE, and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) databases.

	abstract = {Online social network (OSN) usage is growing at an astonishing rate because it increases awareness, facilitates data sharing, fosters relationship building, and helps maintain social connections among users. The immense popularity of OSNs has exposed users’ profiles to various security threats, such as Sock puppet profiles, a subset of Sybil profiles, which are manually operated fake identities designed to mimic real user behavior. Their nuanced and human-like interactions pose substantial threats to OSN integrity and security by exploiting vulnerabilities to create counterfeit profiles, undermine trust, pollute user-generated content, and conduct other malicious actions in targeted OSNs. Currently, available detection approaches face challenges related to feature manipulation, unrealistic assumptions, evasion strategies from intelligent adversaries, data availability, efficiency, as well as high false positive and false negative rates. To overcome these issues, this research proposes the “Hybrid Harmony” concept, a socio-technical framework that synergizes both social and technical aspects to mitigate Sock puppets effectively. Moreover, this research explores cross-cultural variations based on behaviors to enhance adversarial resistance in the Sock puppet detection model. By leveraging socio-technical and cultural dimensions, this study offers a more adaptive adversarial resistance detection model. The proposed model extracts useful demographics using feature engineering from the diverse information shared by users on the OSN profile. Moreover, mathematical computations are performed on the extracted demographics, and various novel features are crafted through a feature selection process. Afterward, an anomaly detection mechanism is proposed to compute the final decision of the OSN profile as Sybil or benign. Formal verification of the proposed model is performed using Petri-nets, and its semantics are checked through ontologies. For proof of concept, an application is designed, and user feedback is considered through the Technology Acceptance Model ( TAM ) for the acceptance and usability analysis. The proposed approach offers a more comprehensive and adaptive security countermeasure in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.}

	abstract = {TikTok Mini Games represent a growing class of interactive, embedded experiences within social media platforms. Delivered through filters and effects, these games offer high engagement, but raise underexplored privacy concerns. Unlike standalone mobile games, TikTok Mini Games operate entirely within the app’s ecosystem-blurring the lines between entertainment, content creation, and data collection. Despite their popularity, little is known about how these features collect, process, and expose user data. This paper presents the first comprehensive privacy analysis of TikTok Mini Games using a mixed-method framework. We combine documentation review and experimental development, developmental toolkit analysis, interface and behavioral heuristic evaluation, network traffic and code analysis, data synthesis for privacy sensitivity, and comparative analysis to examine how privacy risks are architected, operationalized, and experienced. Our analysis reveals systemic privacy gaps: AR functionalities and motion sensors operate without granular consent mechanisms, UI designs lack transparency, and sensitive data streams (facial landmarks, geolocation, behavioral telemetry) are extensively collected, often without explicit interface-level disclosures. We also identify misalignments between TikTok’s runtime data practices and disclosed privacy policies, raising concerns about informed consent and accountability. A comparative analysis with Facebook Instant Games highlights structural differences in developer access, API use, and data governance. To address these concerns, we recommend platform-level reforms, including per-feature consent and embedded transparency mechanisms for interactive content. Our findings inform both the platform design and the regulatory discourse as gamified content embedded becomes a dominant mode of digital interaction.}

Current practice (e.g., ISO/SAE 21434 TARA) focuses on threat identification and qualitative impact ratings at the vehicle boundary, with limited systemic quantification. This study presents a systematic, simulation-based methodology for quantifying the systemic operational and safety impacts of cyber threats on connected vehicles, evaluating cascading effects across the transport network. Three representative scenarios are examined: (I) telematics-induced sudden braking causing a cascading collision, (II) remote disabling on a motorway (M25) segment, and (III) a compromised Roadside Unit (RSU) spoofing Variable Speed Limit (VSL) and phantom lane closure messages to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The results highlight the potential for cascading safety incidents and systemic operational degradation, as evidenced by the defined systemic operational and safety vectors, factors that are insufficiently addressed in the current scope of the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, which primarily focuses on individual vehicle-level threats. The findings underscore the need to incorporate systemic evaluation into existing frameworks to enhance cyber resilience across connected vehicle ecosystems. The framework complements ISO/SAE 21434 by supplying quantitative, reproducible evidence for the impact rating step at a systemic scale, reducing assessor subjectivity and supporting policy and operations, enabling more data-driven evaluations of systemic cyber risks.}

	abstract = {Research in behavioral biometrics, especially keystroke and mouse behavioral biometrics, has increased in recent years, gaining traction in industry and academia across various fields, including the detection of emotion, age, gender, fatigue, identity theft, and online assessment fraud. These methods are popular because they collect data non-invasively and continuously authenticate users by analyzing unique keystroke or mouse behavior. However, user behavior evolves over time due to several underlying factors. This can affect the performance of current keystroke and mouse behavioral biometric-based user authentication systems. We comprehensively survey current keystroke and mouse behavioral biometric approaches, exploring their use in user authentication and other real-world applications while outlining trends and research gaps. In particular, we investigate whether current approaches compensate for user behavior evolution. We find that current keystroke and mouse behavioral biometrics approaches cannot adapt to user behavior evolution and suffer from limited efficacy. Our survey highlights the need for new and improved keystroke and mouse behavioral biometrics approaches that can adapt to user behavior evolution. This study will assist researchers in improving current research efforts toward developing more secure, effective, sustainable, robust, adaptable, and privacy-preserving keystroke and mouse-behavioral biometric-based authentication systems.}

	abstract = {Digital computer systems and networks are essential to a wide range of engineering applications, including those related to buildings, transportation, machinery, business, and life support. Computer viruses have grown in prevalence despite this dependence on technology, compromising critical functions in the process. Many antivirus programs have been developed, but they are limited to detecting and removing infections based on knowledge of the virus code. Based on the network state, these programs are not enough to prevent the emergence of new viruses. The use of mathematical models can assist in understanding the dynamics of computer virus propagation and in developing preventive policies for managing a network. To address this issue, in this study, a deterministic and stochastic mathematical model has been developed to capture the unpredictability of virus spread in computer systems. We examine the positivity and uniqueness of the model and calculate its reproduction number. This paper investigates the extinction of viruses and their persistence in computer systems.

	abstract = {With the widespread deployment of IoT devices, firmware update process becomes the main target of malicious attack, which could cause large-scale devices bricking, critical information leakage, and vulnerability propagation through supply chain. Due to the complexity of firmware update process and implementation flaws, there are multiple types of firmware update vulnerabilities in each phase of firmware update process. Current studies cannot effectively detect these vulnerabilities through an automatic approach. Therefore, we propose FirmUpdate in this paper, an automated static firmware update vulnerability detection approach, which could recover the entire firmware update process and detect vulnerabilities in each phase of the firmware update process. FirmUpdate first constructs UG (Update Graph) to abstract the firmware update process into flow chat. Then, performs unsafe verification discovery and update-related taint analysis on UG. With these two methods, FirmUpdate could automatically detect firmware update vulnerabilities, including firmware verification, buffer overflow, and command injection vulnerabilities. FirmUpdate performs vulnerability detection in a firmware set that contains 131 firmware images from 7 vendors. The TPR (True Positive Rate) of vulnerability detection is 89.3 %. FirmUpdate detected 12 0-day vulnerabilities that had been assigned CVE ID, covering firmware verification, buffer overflow, and command injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, FirmUpdate provides an automated static approach to detect firmware update vulnerabilities, which could help IoT device vendors identify and fix vulnerabilities.}

This can lead to unpredictable outcomes such as data corruption, Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities, and deadlocks. While previous research has identified poor design practices that contribute to RC vulnerabilities, no existing studies have explored the factors that influence the severity or impact of race conditions. This paper introduces a comprehensive methodology for testing and quantifying how different variables affect the exploitability of race conditions in vulnerable web servers, providing a framework for future research to investigate this issue more thoroughly. In addition, we present an experimental evaluation of our methodology under various conditions. Specifically, we examine six RC exploitation tools using four different attack techniques across both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. To provide a complete overview of race conditions across all HTTP versions, we also introduce the first race condition attack tool for HTTP/3, named QUICker. Furthermore, we assess how the choice of database management systems and programming languages used in web application deployment can affect susceptibility to race condition attacks. This study offers key insights into how these factors influence the exploitability of RC vulnerabilities.}

	abstract = {With the intelligent transformation of the mining industry, mining cyber-physical systems (CPS) face multiple, interacting threats including cyberattacks, equipment failures, and natural disasters. Such interactions can severely undermine system stability and resilience. Existing assessment methods typically address single risk factors in isolation, neglecting both the interplay among multiple threats and the benefits of dynamic emergency response strategies. This paper proposes an integrated risk assessment framework tailored to mining CPS. We develop a multi-risk evaluation model that captures interactions among diverse hazard sources and embed it within a coordinated recovery network to optimize emergency response strategies. Through MATLAB-based simulations across various risk scenarios, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results demonstrate that the synergy among multiple threats markedly accelerates system performance degradation, whereas a coordinated recovery strategy prioritizing key nodes significantly enhances restoration efficiency and reduces resource consumption. Furthermore, our optimized resource allocation scheme substantially lowers total energy use, improves utilization rates, and bolsters overall system stability. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the introduction of a comprehensive multi-risk assessment framework providing theoretical foundations for intelligent mining; (2) the design of a coordinated recovery network model that refines the system restoration process; and (3) the implementation of a dynamic emergency response mechanism that elevates recovery efficiency and curtails resource expenditure.}

	abstract = {This study identifies main characteristics of cyber attacks on 63 central banks, based on the analysis of 84 case studies of attacks, which occurred from 2010 to 2025. Combining data on attacks from numerous publicly available databases and using the framework of rational choice and routine activity theories, reveals a rise in frequency of attacks over time, often part of broader offensives on financial institutions. In line with political risk theory, politically motivated hacktivists, by launching DDoS, were behind half the attacks (54,8 %), while financially motivated criminals, using diverse attack vectors, were responsible for one-fifth (19 %). Despite the attacks having no systemic consequences, detailed data remains scarce, which hinders research. Results point to actionable policy implications for enhancing central banks’ cyber resilience in form of both preventative and reactive strategies.}

	abstract = {Recently transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks have garnered increasing attention owing to their high practicality. However, targeted attacks suffer low transfer success rates, especially when overfitting to their source model. In this paper, we observe that perturbations with higher generalization across different styles of images tend to have higher targeted transferability. Therefore, we propose a Style-Agnostic Attack (SAA) to enhance the transferability of targeted adversarial examples. Specifically, SAA introduces a content consistency loss that stimulates the learned perturbations to be style-agnostic by aligning the content features of the adversarially perturbed original and stylized images. Accordingly, SAA enhances the generalization of adversarial perturbations across different stylized images, thereby enhancing the transferability of targeted attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that SAA significantly improves the targeted transferability of adversarial examples. Furthermore, SAA is a generalizable approach that can be readily integrated with existing adversarial attacks to further enhance targeted transferability.}

	abstract = {The integration of satellite and terrestrial networks effectively addresses geographical limitations, providing extensive and seamless connectivity. Despite robust security measures implemented in both terrestrial networks and satellite communication systems, certain inherent vulnerabilities in LTE/5G protocols can still be exploited, potentially compromising security. In this paper, we propose a security evaluation model, SigOverlay, which targets both terrestrial cellular networks and satellite communication networks. By exploiting the inherent openness of the Physical Broadcast Channel, SigOverlay can stealthily disrupt regular communication without incurring substantial additional power consumption. Experiments with commercial software-defined radios demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this strategy, revealing security risks in integrated satellite-terrestrial networks.}
