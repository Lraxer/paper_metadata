	abstract = {Amidst the critical international demand for cybersecurity talent, educational institutions and industry stakeholders have emphasized the need for broadening access to various forms of formal educational pathways and certificate programs. While these efforts have operated to significantly increase the number of students engaged in formal cybersecurity education, little has been done to develop accessible entry points into informal cybersecurity communities of practice. In this paper, we argue that cybersecurity expertise is largely predicated on entry into and participation in these cybersecurity communities of practice. Emphasizing the role of the cybersecurity community draws attention to the importance of ad-hoc and informal experiences in the development of both tacit knowledge and social capital within the workforce, and the ways in which opportunities in the field are differentially and unequally distributed. As such, this paper begins by describing the role and importance of the cybersecurity community and cybersecurity culture in developing the cybersecurity workforce, followed by a discussion of existing efforts at two major state universities to develop cybersecurity education programs that explicitly provide onramps to the cybersecurity community. We close this paper by exploring practical mechanisms by which to develop educational experiences which act as both gateways into cybersecurity communities of practice and as agents of change for the field itself - seeking to actively scale the workforce while simultaneously creating space for minoritized voices in the field.}

	abstract = {This survey paper compares existing IoT related datasets found in the literature with three main objectives. The first one is to highlight the characteristics of these datasets such as the ratio of normal to attack traffic, testbesd environment as real or simulated, and heterogeneity of IoT devices that generated the data traffic. The second objective is to classify these datasets according to some attributes such as number of features, availability of the dataset, their format, and type of attacks. The final objective is to compare between various machine learning techniques and models that have been used to address security issues based on these datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date comparison that help researchers to better decide on which IoT dataset they should use to evaluate the machine learning techniques they develop or used to design an IoT security system. In total, 44 datasets were presented and the general attributes of them were identified. The Datasets were collected from a variety of sources, including but not limited to search engines and digital libraries such as Google, IEEE EXplore, IEEE dataport, and ResearchGate. Documentation of dataset files, journal articles, and/or supporting websites was also considered as sources of information. Several observations were made about the limitations of existing datasets which include the lack of general documentation, lack of realistic representation of IoT protocols and current attack trends, and lack of representative structures and topologies that match current IoT/IIoT environments. To address these limitations, it is recommended to have a standard to discuss the required attributes and features in dataset documentation. Moreover, and in order to have better representative datasets, they need to be collected from realistic scenarios of IoT and IIoT applications or from real test-beds that highlight multiple layers of the IoT/IIoT systems.}

	abstract = {The increasing sophistication in computing capability and sensing technologies have continued to drive the design, development, and growth of the smart technologies commonly known as the IoTs. Nonetheless, the rise and spread of malware in this ecosystem is a pressing societal concern that requires immediate attention. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Sound Wave Memory Analysis Technique (SWMAT), for fingerprinting IoT devices by converting their dynamic memory traces into sound wave signals using a lossless transformation function from which a unique set of determinable features called Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted. The overarching objective of this research is to explore offline the effectiveness of using features from memory-encoded sound wave signals for fingerprinting and detecting abnormal changes in IoT devices, which potentially can provide an excellent technique for an on-device Host-Based Intrusion Detection System. Our SWMAT scores the similarity between two sequences of MFCCs using a Dynamic Time Warping distance measure. To evaluate our approach, we developed multiple IoT testbeds and generated 125 MFCC sequences from 20 benign and 5 infected IoT applications. Our results showed that the MFCC features, when leveraged as fingerprints for both Intra and Inter-app similarity, can uniquely distinguish an IoT process and can detect when an IoT process has been hijacked and/or is modified by another malicious code. Furthermore, this empirical result shows our technique’s similarity detection accuracy to be\n≈\n95%.}

	abstract = {Cyber security incidents are now prevalent in many organisations. Arguably, those who can learn from security incidents and address the underlying causes will reduce the prevalence of similar ones in the future. This research provides a new examination of how organisations learn from incidents by systematically reviewing academic research on organisational learning from cyber security incidents and identifying further research needed in this area. To do this, it considers three research questions: what research has been conducted on learning from cyber security incidents, what learning practices in organisations have been found by research and what improvements have been recommended, and what further research is needed as organisations learn from such incidents. Using the PRISMA method, a total of 3,986 articles were extracted and, from these, a relevant set of 30 were selected for analysis to map the body of research, and to identify future research avenues. Despite learning lessons being recommended by both researchers and industry standards, our findings suggest that this advice is not being fully adopted by organisations. Importantly, these studies have found inadequate participation in learning activities, with superficial causal investigations, scarce effort on ensuring lessons are implemented and no evaluation of whether the actions taken actually reduce future security incidents. More research is needed to understand the right level and which learning practices to invest in for the greatest impact. For practitioners, this review discusses the essential elements of an effective process to learn from incidents. This review provides academics with a novel synthesis of the research undertaken on this topic, enabling them to incorporate the significant findings into their work and potentially explore the research agenda suggested.}

	abstract = {Industrial control systems (ICSs) are facing serious and evolving security threats because of a variety of malicious attacks. Deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely considered as one of promising security solutions for ICSs, but these deep neural networks for IDSs in ICSs have been designed manually, which are extremely dependent on expert experience with numerous model parameters. This paper makes the first attempt to develop an automatic architecture design method of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on differential evolution (abbreviated as DE-CNN) for the intrusion detection issue in ICSs. The first phase of the proposed DE-CNN is the off-line architecture optimization of the CNNs constructed by three basic units such as ResNetBlockUnit, DenseNetBlockUnit, and PoolingUnit, including encoding the architecture parameters of a CNN as a population, evaluating the fitness of the population by the validation accuracy and the number of CNN model parameters, implementing the evolutionary process including mutation and crossover operations, and selecting the best individual from the population. Then, the optimal CNN model obtained by the off-line optimization of DE-CNN is deployed for the online IDSs. The experimental results on two intrusion detection datasets in ICSs including SWaT and WADI have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed DE-CNN to the state-of-the-art manually-designed and neuroevolution-based methods under both unsupervised and supervised learning in terms of Precision, Recall,\nF\n1\n-Score and the number of the CNN model parameters.}

BINO recognizes inline calls of methods of C++ template classes (even with unknown data types). We do this through a binary fingerprinting and matching approach. Our fingerprint model captures syntactic and semantic features of an assembly function, along with its Control-Flow Graph structure. Using these fingerprints and subgraph isomorphism, it recognizes inline method calls in a target binary. BINO automates the fingerprints generation phase by parsing the source code of the template classes and automatically building appropriate binaries with representative inline calls of said methods. We evaluate BINO by performing experiments on a dataset of 555 GitHub C++ projects containing 10,600 inline functions, exploring several optimization levels that allow the compiler to inline function calls. We show that our approach can recognize inline function calls to the most used methods of well-known template classes with an F1-Score up to 63% with the -O2, -O3, and -Ofast optimizations levels.}

To provide a theoretical rationale, we investigate barriers to a cybersecurity career based on career stages defined by Super (1957) and gender. Concerns about a cybersecurity career differ between girls, young adult women, and mid-career women. Girls feel an unawareness of opportunity and requisite training, whereas adult women are concerned that they will be undervalued in a male-dominated field, and mid-career women are concerned about being harassed in a male-dominated field. This paper outlines several suggestions for improving these concerns.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) enables many clients to train a joint model without sharing the raw data. While many byzantine-robust FL methods have been proposed, FL remains vulnerable to security attacks such as poisoning attacks and evasion attacks due to its distributed adversarial environment. Additionally, real-world training data used in FL are usually Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID), which further weakens the robustness of the existing FL methods (such as Krum, Median, Trimmed-Mean, etc.), thereby making it possible for a global model in FL to be broken in extreme Non-IID scenarios. In this work, we mitigate the aforementioned weaknesses of existing FL methods in Non-IID and adversarial scenarios by proposing a new FL framework called Mini-Federated Learning (Mini-FL). Mini-FL follows the general FL approach but considers the Non-IID sources of FL and aggregates the gradients by groups. Specifically, Mini-FL first performs unsupervised learning for the gradients received to define the grouping policy. Then, the server divides the gradients received into different groups according to the grouping policy defined and performs byzantine-robust aggregation. Finally, the server calculates the weighted mean of gradients from each group to update the global model. Owning the strong generality, Mini-FL can utilize the most existing byzantine-robust method. We demonstrate that Mini-FL effectively enhances FL robustness and achieves greater global accuracy than existing FL methods when against security attacks and in Non-IID settings.}

The proposed IDS framework utilizes the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Feedforward (FF) ANN, to detect volume-based and protocol-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on the data plane of SDN. The proposed model considers the attack detection a multi-class classification problem and classifies the network traffic into six attack classes with an accuracy of 98.81% and a minimal False Alarm Rate (FAR) of 0.002. The proposed classification model addresses the binary classification problem to compare and analyze the classification performance metrics. The Deep-Discovery that deals with the binary classification problem categorizes the network traffic into anomalous and normal traffic with 99.79% accuracy and a nominal FAR of 0.0001. The novelty of this work is its emphasis on obtaining the optimal performance metrics with a simple neural network with minimal computational overhead rather than an intricate and complex model.}

This paper presents a rationale for adopting and standardizing the protection of software as a risk management process according to the NIST SP800-39 approach. We examine the relevant constructs, models, and methods needed for formalizing and automating the activities in this process in the context of MATE software protection. We highlight the open issues that the research community still has to address. We discuss the benefits that such an approach can bring to all stakeholders. In addition, we present a Proof of Concept (PoC) decision support system that instantiates many of the discussed construct, models, and methods and automates many activities in the risk analysis methodology for the protection of software. Despite being a prototype, the PoC’s validation with industry experts indicated that several aspects of the proposed risk management process can already be formalized and automated with our existing toolbox and that it can actually assist decision making in industrially relevant settings.}

	abstract = {Source code analysis has many application scenarios, such as code plagiarism detection and software vulnerability search. Source code analysis can benefit from machine learning, but it typically requires a standard vector representation and cannot be directly applied to the source code. Thus, we are required to embed source code into vector representation while maintaining the semantics of the code as much as possible. Code2vec proposes a code embedding method that converts source code into code vector through Abstract Syntax Tree(AST). However, we found that code2vec uses a hashing algorithm to generate the identifier for the path in the path context, which leads to the loss of node information in the path and also causes the model training parameters to be very large. Therefore, we present a new path representation which utilizes RNN to generate vectors for paths. We also proposed alternative model designs and evaluated their impact on the model in the experiments. The results we obtained in a challenging source code classification task suggest that, compared to code2vec, the RNN-based paths representation can produce a better embedding model with fewer training parameters.}

While deep learning methods have been applied to IoT malware analysis using sequences or graphs to represent system calls, these approaches have limitations in their semantic representation of system call names. This paper presents Enimanal, a novel cross-architecture IoT malware analysis method based on graph neural networks. Enimanal leverages information from the Linux Programmer Manual to improve the semantic representation of dynamic system call information. By fusing semantic and structural information, Enimanal constructs a unique feature representation called an attributed system call graph (ASCG). We evaluated Enimanal on a dataset of 63k IoT malware samples with 9 CPU architectures and find that it outperforms comparison methods by up to 46% in macro precision and 38% in macro recall, achieving macro precision, macro recall and macro f1-score of over 98%. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of Enimanal against “zero-day” IoT malware.}

Previous container attack surface reduction efforts have relied on dynamic analysis and training using representative workloads to limit the set of system calls exposed to containers.

	abstract = {In recent years, we have seen significant growth in the use of IoT devices as part of conventional enterprise networks to increase the operations, services, and functionality of business processes. The use of IoT technologies in businesses is expected to grow more in the coming years due to smart sensors, more computing power, and reliable mobile connectivity with 5 G capabilities. Since enterprise networks are liable to customers’ data and they generally have to follow certain compliances and regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.), they are always concerned about the overall security of their IT and security infrastructures. To address this concern, they have IT auditors that periodically analyse and assess different parts of IT infrastructure to ensure processes and systems run accurately and efficiently while remaining secure and meeting compliance regulations. Unfortunately, as of this writing, there is no customized or standalone standard that IT auditors can follow when they evaluate an IT infrastructure that has IoT devices installed. Since IoT devices have their own unique characteristics, it does not practical to use traditional IT auditing standards to audit IoT devices nor such practices can provide any meaningful audit results that can prevent corporations from violating their required compliances or regulations. This implies that if organizations want to take full advantage of IoT technologies for increasing profitability, they cannot rely on conventional IT auditing practices unless the auditors are equipped with a proper auditing framework tailored to audit IoT devices. Motivated by this, we present a modular IoT auditing framework to audit an enterprise network that consists of IoT devices. To support the implementation of the proposed framework, we provide a set of auditing questions covering all security-related features of IoT devices such as firmware, hardware, physical/logical security, communication, and data privacy.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel game-theoretic framework for defending against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). It applies the original Cut-The-Rope model into an experimental study extending the previously studied attacker movements beyond the Poisson distribution to a realistic set of attack actions. More importantly, it demonstrates the value of this framework on an experimental study of an APT defense game on attack graphs, which lets a security officer establish an optimized defense policy against stealthy intrusions. The security model and algorithm under study is designed for practical use with attack graphs as threat models, possibly including vulnerability information if available. The game-theoretic optimization delivers a proactive defense policy under the following assumptions or requirements: first, we do not need to assume that the system is, or has been, clean from adversaries at any time. At the moment when the defender computes the defense policy, the attacker is assumed to already be in the system (also having penetrated it until an unknown depth). Second, the defender does not rely on any signaling or other indicators of adversarial activity, nor is there a reliable feedback mechanism to tell the defender if its actions were successful or not. Third, the model can use information on exploits, such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers, to refine the defense game, but can also operate without such information. We corroborate our findings on publicly documented attack graphs from the robotics domain; without and with CVE information. We run experiments against two different types of defense regimes, and compare the results against an intuitive baseline defense heuristic. The results show that the optimized defense strongly outperforms simple heuristics, like taking the shortest or easiest attack paths.}

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI) plays an indispensable role in providing evidence-based knowledge to plan defensive strategies against advanced cyber attacks. Most threat intelligence data originate from security researchers, vendor blogs, list of threat indicators, and commercial cyber security firms. However, as attack surfaces become more dynamic and threat actors shift towards organization/sector-specific attacks, generic threat information is no longer adequate to safeguard against these targeted attacks. In such scenarios, darknet data can be an invaluable source of threat information at the enterprise level as in darknet, the traffic is destined for a range of unused IP addresses. As these IP addresses are unused, the traffic destined for them is considered suspicious and can serve as a valuable source for threat intelligence. Darknet monitoring is done in either active or passive mode. Passive darknet monitoring gives generic information without active engagement with the attacker devices. So, we developed a novel method for gathering threat intelligence via active darknet monitoring by designing a kernel-level darknet sensor that engages incoming traffic by establishing a 3-way handshake. We called it DARK-KERNEL in our previous work. This work aims to implement DARK-KERNEL as a Service (DKaaS) for organization-level threat intelligence. To achieve this, we deploy the DARK-KERNEL by assigning four unused public IP addresses. We gather 37 days of traffic and provide a comprehensive analysis of captured data using Security Onion and several automated scripts. In addition, we highlight a few attacks to define the effectiveness of DKaaS. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates DKaaS with a customizable Security Orchestration and Response (SOAR) engine to deploy behavioral honeypots to lure sophisticated attackers.}

Since FL will be universally applied in the real world, the fairness issue involved is worthy of attention, while there are few relevant studies. Unlike previous work on group fairness in FL or fairness in centralized machine learning, this paper firstly considers both privacy and individual fairness and proposes promoting individual fairness in FL through distributionally adversarial training without violating data privacy. Specifically, we assume a model satisfying individual fairness as one robust to certain sensitive perturbations, which aligns with the goal of adversarial training. Then we transform the task of training an individually fair FL model into an adversarial training task. To obey the FL requirement of keeping data on clients privately, we execute the adversarial training task on the client side distributionally. Extensive experimental results on two real datasets collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which not only improves individual fairness significantly but improves group fairness at the same time.}

The limited computing capacity of IoT devices makes them highly vulnerable, and large-scale malware attacks have been conducted using them, as evidenced by the Mirai 2016 botnet, which infected 15 million IoT devices. This stresses the need for enhancements in IoT security, especially in the domain of IoT malware detection. The majority of the research on IoT malware detection is focused on static analysis methods which do not take packers and obfuscation techniques into account. A moderate amount of research is done on the dynamic analysis methods, but such methods fail when the sample’s architecture is not supported. Hybrid analysis methods are also not widely explored even though they are capable of learning more meaningful features than just static or dynamic analysis methods alone. To this end, we have proposed a new sandbox and a novel hybrid detection model that is cross-architectural and capable of dealing with obfuscated and packed samples. Our proposed hybrid model works well even when one of the analysis methods, static or dynamic analysis, fails. We have trained our hybrid model on a dataset of 3145 samples with 2210 malware samples and 935 benign samples. Our model achieves an accuracy of 99.18% with an MCC score of 0.98.}

The growing use and functionality of UAVs increases the chances that a digital forensics investigation of a UAV could be required to investigate an accident, incident or just the appearance of a UAV in a specific geographical location. As a result, both industry and academia have published a number of guidelines and publications concerning the forensic investigation of UAV systems. The focus of this paper is the academic perspective of UAV forensics. Specifically, we present a systematic survey of the UAV forensics literature, with the purpose of identifying and documenting research trends describing the digital forensic investigation of UAV incidents, accidents and crimes. The findings from the survey identify the need for an enhanced digital forensics framework to help guide future UAV investigations, as well as a number of research themes that are currently unaddressed in the literature. The research contributions are three-fold. First, the paper categorizes, through a taxonomy, previous UAV forensics literature concerning UAV forensics artifacts, frameworks and models for undertaking UAV forensic investigations, forensic readiness for UAVs, and tools that have been used to conduct UAV forensic investigations. Second, using the findings from the literature, we propose and describe the Conceptual Drone Forensic Framework (CDFF), which attempts to address shortcomings in previous UAV forensics models and frameworks. Third, the paper sets the foundation for future research in UAV forensics by proposing three unaddressed research themes that could help enhance future UAV forensic investigations.}

	abstract = {Software vulnerability detection is critical to computer security. Most existing vulnerability detection methods use single modal-based vulnerability detection models, which cannot effectively extract cross-modal features. To solve this problem, we propose a new multimodal deep learning based vulnerability detection method through a cross-modal feature enhancement and fusion. Firstly, we utilize a special compilation and debugging method to obtain the alignment relationship between source code statements and assembly instructions, as well as between source code variables and assembly code registers. Based on this alignment relationship and program slicing technology, we propose a cross-slicing method to generate bimodal program slices. Then, we propose a cross-modal feature enhanced code representation learning model to capture the fine-grained semantic correlation between source code and assembly code by using the co-attention mechanisms. Finally, vulnerability detection is achieved by feature level fusion of semantic features captured in fine-grained aligned source code and assembly code. Extensive experiments show that our method improves the performance of vulnerability detection compared with state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our method achieves an accuracy of 97.4% and an F1-measure of 93.4% on the SARD dataset. An average accuracy of 95.4% and an F1-measure of 89.1% on two real-world software projects (i.e., FFmpeg and OpenSSL) is also achieved by our method, improving over SOTA method 4.5% and 2.9%.}

	abstract = {Computer communication is at the foundation of how the modern world works, connecting people and machines over public infrastructure. For this reason, communication is exposed to attacks, either by passive listening, or by active interference in the communication. Security protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) play a crucial role in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the communication. However, like in all technologies, there may be flaws in the design, implementation, or cryptography of TLS that compromise the security of the communication channel. Remediation of such vulnerabilities takes time, leaving valuable services exposed to potential attacks. In this article, we present MultiTLS, a middleware based on cipher diversity and network tunneling that enables secure communication even when new vulnerabilities are discovered. MultiTLS creates a secure communication tunnel through the encapsulation of\nk\nTLS channels, where each one uses a different cipher suite. This approach allows the communication channel to remain protected, even when\nk\n−\n1\ncipher suites become vulnerable, because of the remaining cipher suite. The diversity of cipher suites tolerates cryptography faults. We evaluated the implementation of MultiTLS and concluded that it is easy to use and to maintain up-to-date, since it does not require code changes to any of its dependencies. We also evaluated its performance in practical use cases and proved that it is viable an useful for various personal and corporate contexts using Internet communications.}

	abstract = {As global anti-money laundering (AML) protocols and technologies strengthen, traditional laundering methods increasingly face stringent scrutiny. Concurrently, the allure of virtual currencies for laundering illegal funds is magnified, owing to their immunity from seizure, elusive traceability, and seamless cross-border transactions. This necessitates the design of specialized AML strategies for virtual currencies to counter this burgeoning avenue of illicit money circulation. Our study introduces a groundbreaking two-tier algorithm, marrying heuristic rules and integrated learning modalities, designed to enable risk-based detection of virtual currency money laundering. By employing data science methodologies, we scrutinize the distribution of statistical risk attributes within existing transaction samples to institute heuristic rules. By training an amalgamated model of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), we can effectively discern conspicuous anomalous money laundering patterns across diverse transaction datasets. The integrated learning segment deploys a hard voting mechanism, bolstering the recognition of laundering techniques by synergizing multiple anomaly detection classifiers such as Histogram-Based Outlier Scoring (HBOS) and Isolation Forest. This methodology facilitates the detection of laundering activities in unlabeled data, generating explicit anomalous transaction data and concurrently capturing implicit abnormal transactions undetected by heuristic rules. Our approach alleviates the difficulty of procuring labeled money laundering data for AML identification, simultaneously improving the generalization and accuracy of unsupervised learning methods for money laundering detection.}

	abstract = {With the development of machine learning models throughout industries, there has been a corresponding increase in research demonstrating its vulnerability to adversarial examples (AE). Realizing physically robust AE that survive real-world environmental conditions faces the challenges such as varied viewing distances or angles. Laser beam-based methods claim to overcome the obviousness, semi-permanence, and unchangeable drawbacks of adversarial patches. However, laser beam-based AE could not be captured by the camera under daylight, which makes the application scenarios limited. In this research, we introduce Adversarial Spot Light (AdvSL), a novel approach that enables adversaries to build physically robust real-world AE by utilizing spotlight flashlights. Since the spotlight flashlights may be switched on and off as required, AdvSL allows adversaries to perform more flexible attacks than adversarial patches. Especially, AdvSL is feasible in a variety of ambient light conditions. As a first step, we modeled a spot light with a set of parameters that can be physically controlled by the adversary. To determine the optimal parameters for the light, a heuristic optimization approach is adopted. Further, we use the k-random-restart technique to prevent the approach from being stuck in a local optimum. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments under different physical conditions, including indoor and outdoor tests. In the digital test, AdvSL causes misclassifications on state-of-the-art neural networks with up to 93.7% attack success rate. In the outdoor test, AdvSL causes misclassifications on the traffic sign classification model with up to 84% attack success rate. In the physical setting, experiments show that the AdvSL is robust in non-bright settings and is feasible in bright settings. Finally, we discuss the defense of AdvSL and evaluate an adaptive defender using adversarial learning, which is able to reduce the attack success rate from 92.2% to 54.8% in the digital.}

	abstract = {IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is one of the most prominent networking technologies currently fueling the drastic growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) market. As 6LoWPAN runs on resource-constrained devices like ultra-low powered micro-controllers and radio transceivers, therefore use of traditional routing protocols is not recommended. To solve the problem of achieving energy-efficient routing in 6LoWPAN, Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is specified by IETF. Although RPL gives many benefits to 6LoWPAN, but the research fraternity has raised many concerns regarding its security. One such security issue is the Dropped Destination Advertisement Object (DDAO) attack. In a DDAO attack, an attacker exploits the standard DAO forwarding technique of RPL to perform the attack without getting noticed. Using multiple experiments, we have observed that the key network performance parameters are severely affected by the DDAO attack. In this view, this paper proposes a novel lightweight Challenge-Response Authentication-based technique for securing RPL against DDAO attacks. The key idea of CRA-RPL is to use a modified version of control messages by incorporating challenge-response pair for authenticating DAO-ACK messages. CRA-RPL is implemented on a widely used Contiki-NG embedded operating system and validated on Cooja Simulator. Performance of CRA-RPL is compared with ContikiRPL (i.e., standard RPL implementation). The experimental findings indicate that CRA-RPL effectively identifies and counteracts DDAO attacks in static and mobile environments without devastatingly affecting the resource-constrained nodes.

The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is the most significant security threat addressed in the research. The research proposes edge-heterogeneous IoT (HetIoT) centric defense IDS that aids the HetIoT infrastructure in detecting and blocking victim traffic near the network edge. The Edge-HetIoT defense IDS helps to address significant issues such as performance and security due to proximity to the local network. The research focuses on six learning techniques, including five machine learning (ML) classifiers, namely, ID3, NB, RF, LR, and AdaBoost, and the proposed deep learning (DL)-based hybrid model (i.e., CNN+LSTM). These learning techniques are trained and tested using the real-time benchmark-dataset CICDDoS2019 and consider binary and multiclass (14 classes) classification. The performance is analyzed and evaluated against six classifiers to determine which classification model performs best in detecting and classifying various DDoS attacks. The proposed DL-based hybrid model outperforms when compared against ID3, NB, RF, LR, and AdaBoost. The proposed DL-based hybrid model successfully detects and classifies MSSQL, NetBIOS, TFTP, NTP, Syn, and Portmap attacks with 100% precision, recall, and f1-score. The overall weighted average precision, recall, and f1-score for the proposed DL-based hybrid model are 92%, 89%, and 90%, respectively.}

	abstract = {Attack graphs are a fundamental security tool focused on depicting how multi-stage attacks can be carried out through a network to compromise specific assets and systems. While attack graphs have been widely utilised in the IT cyber domain, their use in Operational Technology (OT) environments requires new approaches able to properly model and analyse Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In this paper, we introduce Cyber-Physical Attack Graphs (CPAGs) as a class of attack graphs able to cover both cyber and physical aspects. CPAGs aim at extending the reach of standard attack graphs to cyber-physical networks typically observed in industrial environments and critical infrastructure systems, analyse how an attacker can move within the network, and understand the impact that these actions may have on the system. We propose a constructive methodology to design CPAGs backed up by a formal rule-based approach that specifies how integral parts of the model can be generated and later composed to build more complex CPAGs. We then explore the semantics of CPAGs associated to cyber and physical attack actions as well as their impact on CPS environments. We also discuss potential CPAG-based analysis techniques and focus on risk analysis using Bayesian CPAGs. Finally, we show the application of the proposed model over a realistic scenario on smart farming using our open source tool T-CITY.}

	abstract = {The ransomware threat has loomed over our digital life since 1989. Criminals use this type of cyber attack to lock or encrypt victims' data, often coercing them to pay exorbitant amounts in ransom. The damage ransomware causes ranges from monetary losses paid for ransom at best to endangering human lives. Cryptographic ransomware, where attackers encrypt the victim's data, stands as the predominant ransomware variant. The primary characteristics of these attacks have remained the same since the first ransomware attack. For this reason, we consider this a key factor differentiating ransomware from other cyber attacks, making it vital in tackling the threat of cryptographic ransomware. This paper proposes a cyber kill chain that describes the modern crypto-ransomware attack. The survey focuses on the Encryption phase as described in our proposed cyber kill chain and its detection techniques. We identify three main methods used in detecting encryption-related activities by ransomware, namely API and System calls, I/O monitoring, and file system activities monitoring. Machine learning (ML) is a tool used in all three identified methodologies, and some of the issues within the ML domain related to this survey are also covered as part of their respective methodologies. The survey of selected proposals is conducted through the prism of those three methodologies, showcasing the importance of detecting ransomware during pre-encryption and encryption activities and the windows of opportunity to do so. We also examine commercial crypto-ransomware protection and detection offerings and show the gap between academic research and commercial applications.}

This can be leveraged to derive corresponding persona profiles that can be subsequently used to detect anomalies and security events. Also, upon the occurrence and detection of a security event, it is important to get full details on the underlying entities and to gain relevant insights to mitigate and prevent such occurrences in the future. In this context, this paper proposes an innovative approach leveraging machine learning techniques along with deep learning for persona-specific traffic profile generation. This capability can be deployed as part of online traffic monitoring solutions for persona identification and anomalous network behaviour detection, where no software needs to be installed on deployed workstations. Performed experiments indicate that the proposed approach is efficient, scalable, and suitable for near real-time deployment scenarios.}

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel paradigm where the data plane and the control plane are decoupled on network devices. This approach places the control plane in an external entity, rather than in each individual device as in the traditional networking architecture to conquer the latter weaknesses such as the lack of global visibility of the network state. SDN simplifies network management, offers flexibility, and makes communication networks easier. However, SDN faces several security challenges, since the controller is considered as a single point of failure that may return the whole network down in case of a security compromise. Indeed, the single point of failure is partially tackled by the use of multi-controller mechanisms. However, simply using these mechanisms cannot avoid compromising vulnerable controllers due to their visible nature. In fact, the attacker needs just much more time to compromise the whole system. In this paper, we propose to approach the issue of intrusion tolerance in the SDN control plane by first applying a Recovery Based model which assumes that as soon as a system comes online it is compromised; therefore, periodic restoration to a good state is necessary. Secondly, we aim to establish Moving Target Defense (MTD) that provides a proactive defense against adaptive adversaries. The goal of the MTD in the Dispatcher is to constantly shift between multiple controllers with diverse configurations in order to increase the uncertainty for the attacker, in effect, diminishing the information gathered from the control plan during the reconnaissance phase of a potential attack. Finally, We put in place probabilistic models that can contribute to the perception of the performance of self-cleansing intrusion tolerance in the SDN control plane.}

In the present work, we extend the UDS framework with a privacy category to allow a more comprehensive evaluation, becoming the UDSP framework.

	abstract = {Multiple base fuzzers collaborate as a fuzzer combination. Fuzzer combinations have been proven to perform more robustly and efficiently when fuzzing complicated real-world programs. The efficiency of finding bugs with limited computational resources would greatly benefit from the fuzzer combinations chosen by an effective and quantitative performance evaluation. However, evaluating fuzzer combinations remains challenging due to the lack of infrastructure for collaborative fuzzing, high enough collaboration efficiency of base fuzzers, unified benchmarks, comprehensive metrics, and unified analysis methods of coverage and bugs. This prevents us from selecting efficient fuzzer combinations and thus impairs vulnerability mining on real-world targets. In this paper, we design and implement FCEVAL, the first open-source platform for evaluating fuzzer combinations. In detail, we propose a new test case-sharing policy for increasing fuzzing potential so that we can provide a more efficient running environment for fuzzer combinations and thus improve evaluation effectiveness. Also, we select a unified set of diverse benchmarks and comprehensive metrics while adopting unified independent methods of real-time coverage statistics and multiple-sanitizers-based bug analysis for evaluation fairness and quantification. In addition, we design tools and guidelines covering the whole evaluation process for usability. With the above methodologies, we first construct an infrastructure special for collaborative fuzzing as the base of FCEVAL. After comparing two test case-sharing policies on the infrastructure and choosing the promising one as a substantial part of FCEVAL, we leverage FCEVAL to evaluate fuzzer combinations for more than 40,000 CPU hours and come up with five important conclusions, including (a) an efficient test case-sharing policy improving fuzzing potential and thus evaluation effectiveness, (b) comprehensive metrics being essential, (c) 24-hour duration and 20 repetitions for evaluation being substantial, (d) independent analysis methods of code coverage and bugs deserving of extensive adoption, and (e) FCEVAL being able to evaluate fuzzer combinations effectively, fairly, comprehensively, and easily. Meanwhile, we suggest how to improve collaborative fuzzing. In addition, source codes and test data are publicly available.}

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology able to identify security threats in activity logs. The contribution of the paper is twofold: we propose an encoding technique, based on prime numbers, that can be used to represent in a compact way a set of activities, we then describe an outlier detection algorithm which, based on the encoded activities, is able to detect malicious behavior.

	abstract = {Ear biometrics is a fast-developing field of computer vision that offers several advantages over existing biometric authentication methods. The performance of the ear is superior to or comparable to that of other biometric traits. However, the recognition performance of 2D ear images degrades due to the impacts of posture, illumination, and scaling. To overcome these challenges, we propose combining 3D and 2D ear images and constructing a keypoint detector and descriptor using a covariance matrix derived from texture and geometry information. The feature vector of the descriptor is then used to describe keypoints and utilized to identify keypoints with the smallest distance between a probe and gallery for the subsequent registration process. The registration error that results serves as the matching score. The proposed method is evaluated on a large database of ear images and compared to state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating superior performance in occlusion, noise, and pose variations.}

	abstract = {For a long time, DNS tunnels have played a pivotal role in advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, posing a threat to the real-world network environment. Existing approaches either use single packets or grouped packets as the basic unit for detecting DNS tunnelling traffic. Currently, single-packet-based methods usually focus on the encoding features of the DNS packet payload, which results in a high false alarm rate in real-world environments. Approaches using grouped-packets as the basis detection unit are difficult to apply to real-time inspection environments and cannot perform a finer-grained inspection of packets. To address these issues, we propose a DNS tunnelling detection method that uses a combination of encoding and behavioral features on DNS query & response pairs (Q&R). Q&R pairs achieve good balance between the information conveyed and the detection time required. We then train a powerful XGBoost classifier to fuse the features and conduct the classification of benign DNS traffic and DNS tunnelling traffic. We evaluate our approach with an authoritative DNS dataset (the base dataset) and a generalized test dataset that we curated with real-world attack simulations and collections of secure enterprise traffic. Our method achieves 99.68% accuracy on the base dataset and 98.82% accuracy on the generalized test dataset, which is better than the compared state-of-art methods. The efficiency is 66.77% higher than the baseline grouped-packets-based method. We also test our method in a real-world network environment and detect 7 malicious DNS tunnelling events.}

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based Android malware detection is still suffering from adversarial attacks, although it has better performance than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a query-efficient black-box attack method called GenDroid, which can generate high-quality Android adversarial examples with a low number of queries. We take GenDroid as an attack framework and extend it with the attention mechanism and JSMA algorithm to improve the efficiency of adversarial example production. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, Drebin and MaMaDroid. Compared with four state-of-the-art adversarial attacks on real-world datasets, GenDroid achieves higher misclassification rates with significantly the fewest number of queries on the two datasets. In addition, we have validated the effectiveness of our attack on real-world commercial anti-virus engines. Finally, to enhance the security of Android malware detector and defend against the GenDroid attack, we use combined features consisting of the associated Android features, the spatial properties of Android adversarial examples and the uncertainty to detect adversarial examples, which can achieve a high detection rate of 95.71%.}

	abstract = {Utility-driven mining is a powerful data mining technique that aims to extract significant and valuable knowledge from different kinds of datasets. Nevertheless, analyzing datasets with sensitive or private information may raise security and privacy concerns. To balance utility maximization and privacy preservation, Privacy Preserving Utility Mining (PPUM) has been presented. The primary objective of PPUM algorithms is to conceal the sensitive knowledge that can be found via the application of utility mining algorithms to sensitive data. However, the current PPUM literature shows a paucity of privacy preserving algorithms scalable and efficient enough to handle large and dense datasets. Based on this perspective, this paper proposes three heuristic-based algorithms, namely Selecting the Most Real item sensitive utility First (SMRF), Selecting the Least Real item sensitive utility First (SLRF), and Selecting the most Desirable Item First (SDIF), to efficiently conceal all Sensitive High utility Itemsets (SHIs) while mitigating the projected detrimental impact on the non-sensitive information. The proposed algorithms rely on a novel concept, called Real Item Sensitive Utility (RISU), to effectively select a definite victim item for each SHI during the whole sanitization process. Furthermore, a new sensitive dataset sorting technique is proposed to reduce the time needed to find suitable transactions for sanitization. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations with state-of-the-arts, the viability of the proposed three algorithms was testified. The acquired findings clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in terms of reducing the sanitization time and side effects.}

	abstract = {Although 5G security has been further improved with the evolution of the standard, it remains to be checked whether 5G cellular devices (i.e., User Equipment or UE) have correctly implemented the designed security features following the specification. In this work, we present SecChecker, a security inspection system, to examine the security implementation of 5G devices. Firstly, to determine which security items to check, we extract 11 general Security Requirements (SRs) for 5G UEs after a comprehensive study of the 3GPP standard. Then we design corresponding Inspection Cases (ICs) for testing the UE implementation of these SRs. We implemented a prototype of SecChecker based on open-source 5G projects and utilized it to inspect 7 Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices using 5G baseband chips from the top five vendors. The results indicate that most of the required key security features in the specification are securely implemented by the tested 5G devices. However, we also found several UE security implementations that do not meet the extracted SRs or that are vulnerable to exploits, as well as some protocol mismatches. To show the implications on mobile users using the affected 5G devices, we implement two proof-of-concept attacks including the 5G redirection attack and the 5G user plane Man-in-the-Middle attack, to exploit the identified security flaws. Finally, the mitigations are discussed.}

	abstract = {The rapid development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) has brought great convenience to people's life, and also makes various intelligent vehicle services emerge in an endless stream. However, with more than 1.35 million people killed in traffic accidents every year, the detection of abnormal driving behavior has attracted more and more attention. Although some progress has been made in the research of abnormal driving behavior detection, numerous challenges remain. Firstly, it is difficult to manually analyze whether driving behavior is abnormal, which makes it costly to accurately label them for machine learning. Secondly, few studies have considered the problem of class imbalance in the abnormal driving behavior detection, which is common in driving behavior and has a significant negative impact on the detection model, especially in weakly supervised scenarios. Thirdly, assessing a driver's behavior solely based on real-time performance is insufficient, the historical behavior is equally important. To address these challenges, an abnormal driving behavior detection system based on weakly supervised learning under edge computing architecture is proposed in this paper. This system considers the class imbalance problem and utilizes the historical information of the vehicles to provide a low cost and effective detection service. Firstly, the abnormal driving behavior detection is modeled as a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem, which only needs coarse-grained labels for anomaly detection, so that the labeling work becomes low cost. Secondly, the class imbalance problem under weakly supervised learning is solved by incorporating parameter transfer and pre-estimating abnormal scores. This approach enhances the model's sensitivity to rare classes and significantly improves the performance of weakly supervised detection models. Thirdly, in order to learn the historical information of the vehicle, a summary mechanism is used for the road side units (RSUs), which can provide different historical summary of the vehicles for other detection nodes, so as to make the model more effective for different abnormal events. Several experiments are carried out on both simulation dataset and real-world dataset to verify the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that compared with the traditional supervised learning methods, the proposed method can still achieve near-optimal performance when only using coarse-grained labels, and all the strategies proposed have improved the detection performance obviously.}

Most studies use single behavioral modality systems to authenticate users. However, the behaviors of genuine users may change, and systems fail when significant changes occur. This results in either usability or security issues. In the literature, the fusion of biometrics is used to solve this problem and achieves improved results. This paper presents our research on the design and evaluation of new approaches to CA using fusion of touch gestures and keystroke dynamics. To collect the biometric data from mobile device users we have developed the BioGames App which follows an innovative approach based on the gamification paradigm. We examine each modality separately and investigate if we can improve the performance results with a feature-level fusion. For this reason, a new appropriate feature set is developed that combines touch gestures and keystroke dynamics. We used the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and compared their performance. We have shown that feature-level fusion of touch gestures and keystroke dynamics improves the performance of systems and solves security and usability issues. We found that the MLP is superior to LSTM in this context. The MLP achieved Accuracy 98.3% (increased 21.1%), EER 1% (error reduction by 23.7%), TAR 99.4% (increased 46%), TRR 97.4% (increased 10%), FAR 2.6% (reduced by 10.5%), and FRR 0.6% (reduced by 46%).}

In response, organizations are dedicating resources, time, and employee effort to train staff to identify simulated phishing attacks. However, the real-world effectiveness of these training efforts in large enterprises remains largely unexplored. To address this, we carried out a controlled experiment in an Israeli financial institution with approximately 5,000 employees. The experiment included three simulated phishing emails, and we examined how different factors influence the phishing Click-Through Rate (CTR). Our findings suggest that employees are more likely to engage with phishing simulation emails that use personalized phrasing. We also found that phishing CTR varies between business units, and that the timing of training before the simulated email did not significantly affect phishing CTR. Furthermore, it became clear that training prior to phishing simulations and adopting a data-driven approach that includes process, variable and measure analysis, can enhance organizational awareness of phishing. Although advanced technologies can mitigate some phishing attacks, our research indicates that employee awareness and proactive behavior will continue to play a critical role in the foreseeable future. The paper concludes by providing guidelines to information security officers on establishing effective organizational awareness to prevent phishing attacks.}

However, it is compromised to a severe threat, namely a backdoor attack, which maliciously manipulates a model by poisoning a small portion of training data. Previous works mainly focused on backdoor attacks in image classification, however, it is scarcely studied in semantic segmentation widely used in computer vision. In this paper, we proposed a novel backdoor attack on semantic segmentation named object-free backdoor attack (OFBA). This method allows the free selection of object classes to be attacked during the inference, breaking the limitation of previous work only attacking object classes determined before training. In addition, to identify the security of unknown models and mitigate the threat of OFBA, we proposed a defense method called Segment Cleanse, alleviating the dilemma of insufficient computing resources and high detection error rates in Neural Cleanse. The experimental results show that our proposed methods are always effective on state-of-the-art models.}

	abstract = {Federated learning enables multi-participant joint modeling with distributed and localized training, thus effectively overcoming the problems of data island and privacy protection. However, existing federated learning frameworks have proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers embed backdoor triggers into local models during the training phase. These triggers will be activated by crafted inputs during the prediction phase, leading to misclassification targeted by attackers. To address these issues, existing defense methods focus on both backdoor detection and backdoor erasing. However, passive backdoor detection methods cannot eliminate the effect of embedded backdoor patterns, while backdoor erasing may degenerate the model performance and cause extra computation overhead. This paper proposes ADFL, a novel adversarial distillation-based backdoor defense scheme for federated learning. ADFL generates fake samples containing backdoor features by deploying a generative adversarial network (GAN) on the server side and relabeling the fake samples to obtain the distillation dataset. Then, taking the labeled samples as inputs, knowledge distillation which employs the clean model as a teacher and the global model as a student is implemented to revise the global model and eliminate the influence of backdoored Neurons in it, thereby effectively defending against backdoor attacks while maintaining the model performance. Experimental results show that ADFL can lower the attack success rates by 95% while maintaining the main task accuracy above 90%.}

	abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have shown wonders in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as language-to-language translation, spam filtering, fake-news detection, and comprehension understanding. However, research has shown that the adversarial vulnerabilities of deep learning networks manifest themselves when DL is used for NLP tasks. Most mitigation techniques proposed to date are supervised—relying on adversarial retraining to improve the robustness—which is impractical. This work introduces a novel, unsupervised detection methodology for detecting adversarial inputs to NLP classifiers. In summary, we note that minimally perturbing an input to change a model’s output—a major strength of adversarial attacks—is a weakness that leaves unique statistical marks reflected in the cumulative contribution scores of the input. Particularly, we show that the cumulative contribution score, called\nC\nF\n-score, of adversarial inputs is generally greater than that of the clean inputs. We thus propose Con-Detect—a Contribution based Detection method—for detecting adversarial attacks against NLP classifiers. Con-Detect can be deployed with any classifier without having to retrain it. We experiment with multiple attackers—Text-bugger, Text-fooler, PWWS—on several architectures—MLP, CNN, LSTM, Hybrid CNN-RNN, BERT—trained for different classification tasks—IMDB sentiment classification, fake-news classification, AG news topic classification—under different threat models—Con-Detect-blind attacks, Con-Detect-aware attacks, and Con-Detect-adaptive attacks—and show that Con-Detect can reduce the attack success rate (ASR) of different attacks from 100% to as low as 0% for the best cases and\n≈\n70% for the worst case. Even in the worst case, we note a 100% increase in the required number of queries and a 50% increase in the number of words perturbed, suggesting that Con-Detect is hard to evade.}

	abstract = {Security operations centers (SOCs) are the 911 centers of many organizational networks, except they not only respond, but also monitor. SOC operators are charged with detection, response, and mitigation. This is a tall task when one considers the volume, velocity, and variety of both internal and external organizational network and system data. SOC operations are truly a big data problem. Security orchestration, incident event management, data fusion, and anomaly detection systems help, but more is needed. This study examines the impact virtual reality (VR) can have on SOC operator performance and perceived task load. We developed a VR based network monitoring tool and assigned human subjects to one of three conditions – VR only, traditional tool only, or both. Our results, though small in scale, provide very promising indication that VR based technology may be beneficial for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), particularly with overall data perception involving novice SOC operators. The results are promising, but the sample size is small, so future research should validate this pilot study. Given the workforce challenges in the cybersecurity space, and the need to perceive large quantities of data, VR may be a very good addition to SOCs.}

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides ample evidence and information regarding the detection of cyber attack activities. Existing methods employ CTI reports to extract Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for attack detection. Nevertheless, these methods are challenged in providing necessary and sufficient evidentiary support for recognition decisions, making it difficult for human operators to comprehend and accept the decision-making process. This paper proposes a topic prototype-based explainable TTPs classification approach, which provides accurate boundaries for key evidences to justify the results of TTPs classification. The proposed method introduces a self-adversarial framework for obtaining necessary and sufficient evidence for TTPs classification. The framework consists of an evidence generator and a TTPs classifier discriminator. The evidence generator utilizes a topic prototype-based keyword importance filtering method to extract evidence from CTI text while removing noise, resulting in an evidence set and a perturbation set. Subsequently, the impact of the evidence set and the perturbation set on TTPs classification is assessed using our siamese discriminator. The discriminator is specifically trained to ensure that only the elements belonging to the evidence set are accurately classified as TTPs information. The experiments primarily test the necessity and sufficiency of TTPs and evidence. In the sufficiency evaluations, classical deep learning methods are used for TTPs classification to verify the accuracy of the results, where the proposed method improves the Micro F1 scores by 0.16% to 6.63% and Macro F1s by 0.26% to 6.85%. To prove necessity, various case-based explainable methods are used to measure the completeness of CTI evidence. The results shows that the proposed method is able to obtain more stable prediction, more reasonable evidence sets, and more significant boundaries.}

	abstract = {Cyber-attacks, with various emerging attack techniques, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to deal with, posing great threats to companies and every individual. Therefore, analyzing attack incidents and tracing the attack groups behind them becomes extremely important. Threat intelligence provides a new technical solution for attack traceability by constructing Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG). In this paper, we propose a framework for threat intelligence extraction and fusion, which is able to extract, correlate and unify cybersecurity entity-relation triples from structured and unstructured data. However, the existing entity and relation extraction for cybersecurity concepts uses the traditional pipeline model that suffers from error propagation and ignores the connection between the two subtasks. To solve the above problem, we propose a joint entity and relation extraction model for cybersecurity concepts. We model the joint extraction problem as a multiple sequence labeling problem, generating separate label sequences for different relations, which contain information about the involved entities and the subject and object of that relation. Experimental results on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) data show that the F1 value of the joint model is 81.37%, which is better than the previous pipeline model. For the knowledge fusion, we propose an improved Levenshtein distance to correlate the same entities extracted from different data sources to construct a preliminary CKG, which is demonstrated in the Experiments section.}

We define cyber-resilience as the capacity to withstand, recover from and adapt to the external shocks caused by cyber-risks. This article seeks to provide a broader organizational understanding of cyber-resilience and the tensions associated with its implementation. We apply Weick's (1995) sensemaking framework to examine four foundational tensions of cyber-resilience: a definitional tension, an environmental tension, an internal tension, and a regulatory tension. We then document how these tensions are embedded in cyber-resilience practices at the preparatory, response and adaptive stages. We rely on qualitative data from a sample of 58 cybersecurity professionals to uncover these tensions and how they reverberate across cyber-resilience practices.}

	abstract = {The integration of the Internet into industrial plants has connected Industrial Control Systems (ICS) worldwide, resulting in an increase in the number of attack surfaces and the exposure of software and devices not originally intended for networking. In addition, the heterogeneity and technical obsolescence of ICS architectures, legacy hardware, and outdated software pose significant challenges. Since these systems control essential infrastructure such as power grids, water treatment plants, and transportation networks, security is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, current methods for evaluating the security of ICS are often ad-hoc and difficult to formalize into a systematic evaluation methodology with predictable results. In this paper, we propose a practical method supported by a concrete toolkit for performing penetration testing in an industrial setting. The primary focus is on the Modbus/TCP protocol as the field control protocol. Our approach relies on a toolkit, named MOSTO, which is licensed under GNU GPL and enables auditors to assess the security of existing industrial control settings without interfering with ICS workflows. Furthermore, we present a model-driven framework that combines formal methods, testing techniques, and simulation to (formally) test security properties in ICS networks.}

In response, recent works suggest alternative Tor path selection methods preferring Tor nodes with higher resilience to active BGP attacks.}

This paper utilizes an integrated IUIPC and Privacy Calculus model to explore the impact of privacy concerns, incident response efficacy, trust, and risk involved in digital conferencing adoption. To test the proposed model, we administer a survey to 212 participants and find that perceived benefits, trusting beliefs, and personal Internet interest increase intention to use digital conferencing software while risk beliefs decrease behavioral intentions. In addition, we find incident response efficacy to be a salient construct in explaining users’ trusting beliefs. The study provides recommendations for digital conferencing service providers on how to improve consumer adoption through strengthened security practices and incident response strategies.}

In this paper, we analyze the security of the new solution from the user experience perspective concerning Denial of Service (DoS), Social Engineering (SocEng), and other possible attacks that can be mounted without special privileges or obtaining unauthorized access. Our analysis shows that, even though the solution is of paramount importance to the Danish online infrastructure, the analyzed version did not adequately defend against simple attacks targeting specific users. With simple automated scripts, we were able to prevent a targeted user from authenticating for a period of 9 days; and show how an attacker can collect information to mount convincing SocEng attacks aiming at identity theft. Our findings were disclosed to the affected parties in December 2021, and since then, the solution has been updated two times. The first update in January 2022 rendered the SocEng attacks ineffective. However, due to the inherent design trade-offs, targeted DoS attacks were still unmitigated. The second update was in June 2023 and appears to address all of our findings.}

In theory, setting the code to be unreadable can prevent code reading. However, the pages are loaded dynamically, and the existing methods cannot set all code as unreadable at one time. They can only control code permissions page-by-page via time-consuming page tracking. Moreover, since some special users need to read code, turning off the read permission will affect their execution. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a method AntiRead. It rebuilds the buddy system for memory allocation. The new buddy system places code pages in a specific memory pool to manage their read permissions. In the presence of AntiRead, what is obtained by adversaries through code reading is either randomized code or non-executable code. Experiments and analysis show that AntiRead can prevent the code that has been read from being used as gadgets without affecting the normal code reading. In addition, the CPU overhead introduced by AntiRead is 1.8%.}

Gradient-based adversarial attacks usually craft perturbation on the whole pixels of input image, making them easier to be perceived or detected by the detection-based defenses, in the case of using large perturbation budget. In this paper, we present a new sparse approach to perturb image, which we call Robust Gradient-based Low Frequency search (RGLF). We show that RGLF provides a convenient way to modify any adversarial attack so that its imperceptibility can be improved significantly, not only to human eyes, but also to some popular detection-based defenses. Technically, RGLF first uses a robust gradient mask (RGM) to localize the semantic regions of input image, and then, applies a technique, called adaptive frequency search (AFS), to generate the low-frequency perturbations we expect, and finally, embeds the perturbations in the semantic regions. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that, i) the proposed RGLF technique can remarkably reduce the detection rates of the gradient-based adversarial attacks by 25%, 36%, and 30%, respectively for three SOTA detection-based defenses, namely, SBD, LiBRe, and SimCat; ii) The imperceptibility of the adversarial attacks modified by RGLF is improved significantly, even in the case of using large perturbation budget.}

	abstract = {Network intrusion detection methods based on federated learning (FL) and edge computing have great potential for protecting the cybersecurity of the Internet of Things. It overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional centralized method, such as high latency, overloaded network, and privacy leakage. At the same time, it can combine private data from multiple participants to train models, and the rich data can train more effective models. However, the inherent security vulnerabilities of the FL framework do not ensure the robustness of the global models trained collaboratively. Towards FL, each participant has access to model parameters and training data, and malicious participants can affect the global model by tampering with data or weights. This paper studies label-flipping attacks in FL-based IoT intrusion detection. We propose a lightweight detection mechanism to mitigate the impact of poisoning attacks on FL-based intrusion detection methods in IoT networks. The detection mechanism on a central server filters anomalous participants and excludes their uploaded models from the global model aggregation. Specifically, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating participants based on the loss of the local model and the training dataset size. Afterwards, the Manhattan similarity between each participant will be calculated according to the scores. Finally, the anomalous participants will be found by clustering algorithm for similarity cluster analysis. The experimental results show that our proposed detection method can defend against label-flipping attacks in FL. On the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, our method can improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection model trained based on FL from 84.3% to 97.1%, while enhancing the protection of IoT network security.}

	abstract = {Vulnerability analysis has long been used to evaluate the security posture of a system. Different approaches, including vulnerability graphs and various vulnerability metrics, have been used to study the vulnerability landscape and provide security analysts with cyber situational awareness. However, most current solutions still lack a principled approach to quantifying various dimensions of known vulnerabilities in a way that can easily adapt to different applicative domains and operating conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce a vulnerability metrics framework that extends and generalizes our previous metrics for evaluating the exploitation likelihood of a vulnerability and the exposure factor of system components to vulnerability exploits. We argue that the factors influencing these metrics and their relative weights depend on the specific applicative domain, defender’s priorities, and attacker’s knowledge. Thus, instead of providing a static set of equations, we establish a framework for instantiating the equations that best model the scenario being considered. We combine likelihood and exposure factor metrics into a severity score that allows us to rank vulnerabilities. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that ranking vulnerabilities solely based on their CVSS scores is not sufficient for effective prioritization, due to the limited number of possible distinct severity values compared to the sheer number of existing vulnerabilities. We define a ranking quality score and show that considering additional information about vulnerabilities helps refine their ranking, providing more actionable intelligence to security analysts.}

	abstract = {Extra-role security behaviors (ERSBs) – spontaneous security behaviors that are not prescribed in organizational security policies – are seen as a useful addition to securing informational assets in organizations. However, this exploratory study, based on findings obtained through 29 in-depth-interviews, challenges this positive perspective and shows that extra-role security behaviors cut both ways: They are either helpful or harmful. In addition, our results suggest that (1) ERSB contributes to varying degrees to the effectiveness of information security compliance, (2) the self-determination theory contributes to understanding the motivators for ERSB, and (3) the construal level theory of psychological distance explains the differential risk evaluation of ERSB. We discuss implications for researchers and practitioners – particularly in terms of promoting the beneficial nature of extra-role security behaviors – and suggest compelling avenues for future research.}

	abstract = {Phishing attacks are among the most prevalent attack mechanisms employed by attackers. The consequences of successful phishing include (and are not limited to) financial losses, impact on reputation, and identity theft. The paper presents a systematic literature review featuring 248 articles (from the beginning of 2018 until March 2023) across the main digital libraries to identify, (1) the existing mitigation strategies against phishing attacks, and the underlying technologies considered in the development of these strategies; (2) the most considered phishing vectors in the development of the mitigation strategies; (3) anti-phishing guidelines and recommendations for organizations and end-users respectively; and (4) gaps and open issues that exist in the state of the art. The paper advocates for the need to consider the abilities of human users during the design and development of the mitigation strategies as only technology-centric solutions will not suffice to cater to the challenges posed by phishing attacks.}
