	abstract = {Despite dramatic changes in the constellation of cybersecurity risks, the basic approach to risk calculation has been anchored to probability theory. The probability approach is widely known and conceptually simple. But it is disadvantageous in its grounding on expert estimates of frequency data which is often publicly unavailable. This study proposes the use of possibility theory as a complementary grounding for cybersecurity risk calculations. Using a design science research approach, we use possibility theory as the kernel theory in developing and evaluating a practical possibility-based risk estimation prototype. The results offer an expanded grounding to improve cybersecurity risk analysis.}

	abstract = {The large body of Android malware research has demonstrated that machine learning methods can provide high performance for detecting Android malware. However, the vast majority of studies underestimate the evolving nature of the threat landscape, which requires the creation of a model life-cycle to ensure effective continuous detection in real-world settings over time. In this study, we modeled the concept drift issue of Android malware detection, encompassing the years between 2011 and 2018, using dynamic feature sets (i.e., system calls) derived from Android apps. The relevant studies in the literature have not focused on the timestamp selection approach and its critical impact on effective drift modeling. We evaluated and compared distinct timestamp alternatives. Our experimental results show that a widely used timestamp in the literature yields poor results over time and that enhanced concept drift handling is achieved when an app internal timestamp was used. Additionally, this study sheds light on the usage of distinct data sources and their impact on concept drift modeling. We identified that dynamic features obtained for individual apps from different data sources (i.e., emulator and real device) show significant differences that can distort the modeling results. Therefore, the data sources should be considered and their fusion preferably avoided while creating the training and testing data sets. Our analysis is supported using a global interpretation method to comprehend and characterize the evolution of Android apps throughout the years from a data source-related perspective.}

Specifically, indicators of compromise (IOC), such as file hash and IP address, receives the most attention among security researchers. However, the ability of IOC-centric CTI systems to understand and detect threats remains questionable for two reasons. First, IOCs are forensic artifacts that indicate that an endpoint or network has been compromised. They cannot depict the technical details of threats. Second, attackers frequently change infrastructure and static indicators, which makes IOCs have a very short lifespan. Therefore, when designing a CTI system, we should turn our attention to other types of CTI data that are helpful in threat understanding and detection (e.g., attack vector, tool).}

From a perspective of manifold theory, most adversarial examples generated by current adversarial attack methods are off-manifold and can be detected by adversarial defense methods based on manifold theory. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial attack method for crafting on-manifold adversarial examples. Specifically, we utilize the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to obtain the low-dimensional manifold of data, and design a latent substitute model based on the data manifold to ensure that the generated adversarial examples are still on-manifold. Additionally, to overcome the difficulty in limiting the perturbation of adversarial examples when searching in the latent space, we propose a gradient decoding strategy (GDS) and confidence re-ranking strategy (CRS). The results demonstrate the competitive performance of our method compared with that of some of the current attack methods applied to state-of-the-art defense models, especially those based on the manifold theory. Additionally, when using the proposed method for adversarial training, the robustness of the model is improved without reducing the accuracy of classifying the original dataset. We hope that our proposed attack method can serve as a benchmark for evaluating and improving the robustness of networks.}

The age of remote working (i.e., telecommuting) has further increased information security related incidents that need to be adequately addressed. This paper extends the protection motivation theory by drawing insights from organizational and institutional theory literature to examine how organizational culture and subcultures such as team culture impact information security compliance. The primary objective of this study is to understand the impact of the dimensions of organizational culture and team culture on employees' perceived threats and coping motivation associated with information security compliance. The study applied structural equation modeling to analyze survey responses of 341 IT employees in the United States. The result of the study indicates that both organization and team culture impacts employees' perception to appraise threat and coping, which in turn impacts behavioral intention to comply with information security policies. The findings of this study contribute to the information security compliance research by demonstrating the importance of developing an information security culture within an organization and its subgroups.}

	abstract = {Low-cost networked IoT devices are fast becoming commonplace. From implanted medical devices to motion-activated surveillance cameras and from driverless smart cars to voice-operated home management systems, IoT devices continue to permeate further and deeper into our lives. However, this widespread adoption of IoT devices has also given rise to a wide range of security, privacy and trust issues that are unique to the IoT ecosystem. Conventional solutions are ill-suited for the IoT domain due to limited resources, network dynamics, and evolving trust boundaries. Hence, novel mechanisms are needed to address the specific challenges of the IoT landscape. To this end, we propose a user-centric cloud-based service that allows device owners to have fine-grained control over what kind and how much data is shared through their IoT devices. Our scheme builds on top of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to instantiate secure virtual clones (shadows) of actual devices in the cloud, substantially reducing the attack surface for IoT networks. Furthermore, a scalable infrastructure in the cloud allows us to deploy sophisticated policy enforcement and data scrubbing mechanisms on a per application basis giving users explicit control over data sharing. The presented approach requires little effort on part of device vendors and users as the service provider handles the bulk of the work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically by implementing the service on SGX hardware and deploying advanced data cleansing policies on device-generated data.}

The devices accessed with default credentials are getting compromised with brute force attempts or the vulnerable devices are compromised with exploits to install the malware and perform malicious activity like initiating denial of service (DoS) attacks. The malware detection and classification in IoT paradigm is still considered a problem, as the adversary consistently create new variants of IoT malware and actively look for compromising the victim devices. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning (DL) based Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit-Convolutional Neural Network (Bi-GRU-CNN) model to detect the IoT malware and classify the IoT malware families using Executable and Linkable Format (ELF, formerly named Extensible Linking Format) binary file byte sequences as an input feature. In addition, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based DL model combinations are considered to evaluate the performances of the IoT malware detection and family classification and also those models performance is compared with the proposed method. Our performance evaluation shows that our proposed approach obtained 100% accuracy for IoT malware detection case and 98% for IoT malware family classification. Further evaluation of our proposed model with only byte sequence as an input feature exhibit similar performance as the byte sequence and CPU types as an input features and showed that our model is robust and platform independent to detect and classify the IoT malware.}

The use of behavioural biometrics can be used to supplement these credentials to provide a greater level of assurance in the identity of an authenticated user. However, user behaviours can also be used to ascertain other identifiable information about an individual. In this paper we build upon the notion of keystroke dynamics (the analysis of typing behaviours) to infer an anonymous user’s name and predict their native language. This work found that there is a discernible difference in the ranking of bigrams (based on their timing) contained within the name of a user and those that are not. As a result we propose that individuals will reliably type information they are familiar with in a discernibly different way. In our study we found that it should be possible to identify approximately a third of the bigrams forming an anonymous users name purely from how (not what) they type.}

	abstract = {Affected by vulnerabilities, the control data on the stack is easily destroyed, which provides the most convenient conditions for code reuse attacks (CRAs). The operating system (OS) does not impose strict restrictions on the control flow paths. It allows instructions to jump to any location in the same address space. The OS will prevent code execution if and only if an execution error occurs. However, attackers can use stack overflow to accurately tamper with the control data on the stack and avoid execution errors. Although canary technology has been widely adopted, it turns out that this method can be bypassed. The traditional shadow stack technology can only protect the backward control flow and is invalid for the forward control flow. In contrast, the defense effect of the control flow integrity methods is better. Unfortunately, they either cannot get rid of the source code dependence on the protected objects, or cannot provide high-precision instruction boundaries. All these problems make it difficult to eliminate the CRAs based on stack overflow. Faced with these problems, this paper proposes a new security method KPointer. It filters the vulnerable data by tracking the overwriting operation to the stack data. Next, these data will be tracked to locate the jump instructions related to them. Finally, we use new security strategies to determine whether the current instruction is illegal. Experiments and analysis show that KPointer has a good protection effect on the CRAs based on stack overflow. It does not depend on the source code of the protected objects and only introduces 2.7% performance overhead to the CPU.}

However, However, there is still much room for improvement in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we design a toolkit called LEGO that efficiently combines garbled circuits, secret sharing, oblivious transfer, and homomorphic encryption to reduce time and improve accuracy. Our work focuses on the two-server model where the two servers train the models on the different owners’ private data. For fully connected layers and convolutional layers, we utilize the associated multiplication triplets to reduce the communication. For the offline phase, we design a novel protocol based on oblivious transfer and improved the previous protocol based on homomorphic encryption. We use the MPC-friendly activation function to improve the performance. Besides, we accelerate the local computation by adding GPU support. Our work is implemented in C++, and it can securely train machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. The experimental results show that our work is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art works.}

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) based on deep learning models can identify and mitigate cyberattacks in IoT applications in a resilient and systematic manner. These models, which support the IDS’s decision, could be vulnerable to a cyberattack known as adversarial attack. In this type of attack, attackers create adversarial samples by introducing small perturbations to attack samples to trick a trained model into misclassifying them as benign applications. These attacks can cause substantial damage to IoT-based smart city models in terms of device malfunction, data leakage, operational outage and financial loss. To our knowledge, the impact of and defence against adversarial attacks on IDS models in relation to smart city applications have not been investigated yet. To address this research gap, in this work, we explore the effect of adversarial attacks on the deep learning and shallow machine learning models by using a recent IoT dataset and propose a method using adversarial retraining that can significantly improve IDS performance when confronting adversarial attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that the presence of adversarial samples deteriorates the detection accuracy significantly by above 70% while our proposed model can deliver detection accuracy above 99% against all types of attacks including adversarial attacks. This makes an IDS robust in protecting IoT-based smart city services.}

Moreover, in the case of proprietary applications such as online social networks, users are at the mercy of the vendor’s security measures. Therefore, users are vulnerable to various security and privacy threats. Contrary to this, covert communication techniques hide the existence of communication and thus achieve security through obscurity and hidden communication channels.

Nevertheless, new techniques to identify unknown malware are necessary to protect systems even at the day zero of a malware release. Few-shot learning is an approach that consists of using a few examples from each class while training a model. A compelling case of this approach is classifying objects classes that have not yet been used in the training set, namely Zero-shot Learning. In the present work, we propose Malware-SMELL, a new Zero-shot learning method to classify malware using visual representation. In Malware-SMELL, we propose a new representation space to calculate the similarity between pairs of objects, called S-Space. This new representation enhances the class separability and, thus, makes such a challenging classification process more efficient. Malware-SMELL reached 80% of recall and outperforms other methods by a ratio of 9.58% in a classification model trained only with goodware code on real-world datasets in Generalized Zero-shot Learning paradigm.}

To deal with this problem, we introduce a rules generation framework for a fraud-detection system – an automatic rules generation using distributed tree-based ML (machine learning) algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, where the components of expert rules are used as the features for the model. This approach is a combination of statistical and expert-based approaches. We apply it to the bank's card transaction data. Our dataset covers February 2021 and consists of more than 20 mil. records including information on clients, transactions, and merchants. The autogenerated rules were aimed at improving FPR (false positive rate) business-metric. The framework was tested in a real fraud-monitoring system of large bank throughout half of the year. The rules obtained using this framework proved to be satisfactory efficient while having tangible business effect.}

	abstract = {As various types of network threats have increased recently, manual threat response by security analysts has become a limitation. To compensate for this, the importance of security information event management (SIEM), a response system that collects and analyzes threat events from security devices, has been emphasized. In general, SIEM has adopted a signature-based threat classification model that generates large volumes of false threat events and burdens the work of security analysts. To address this limitation of SIEM, research has attempted to develop an AI-based threat classification model. In particular, deep learning-based threat classification models are known to have high accuracy in classifying threats. In this study, we focused on the excessive overhead incurred in learning and classifying large sets of threat events using deep learning models, which becomes an overhead in actual SIEM operations. In this study, we selected representative deep-learning-based models for threat classification, such as CNN, LSTM, and GRU, based on the models used in previous studies. We then extend these models considering the characteristics of actual threat events collected from a security operation center (SOC) environment. Specifically, CNN-static(2D) and LSTM were extended to use our own encoding method. CNN-static(1D) was developed to reduce the time for model learning and threat classification while minimizing the loss of accuracy compared to CNN-static(2D). GRU was first used for threat classification in this study. In this study, we aimed to identify the most effective deep learning model for SIEM in terms of both threat classification accuracy and learning and classification efficiency. To consider real workloads, we use 2.6 million threat events collected from a representative security vendor in South Korea, and manually annotated by security experts. First, in terms of threat classification accuracy, the LSTM model has the highest F1-score, but all the models show high accuracy between 94.07% and 95.11% in terms of recall, which is the most important metric at SOC. Second, in terms of model learning and classification times, CNN-static(1D) significantly outperformed the other models. To validate the models in the actual SOC environment, we also present two cost-based scenarios to estimate the cost of the models for specific scenarios: the cost of rebuilding the model to respond to zero-day attacks, and the cost of classifying threats in the actual SOC environment. We show that CNN-static(1D) is the most cost-effective model for both scenarios.}

	abstract = {Passwords continue to occupy an interesting position in cyber security, being both widely used and widely criticised at the same time. In many cases the criticism is levelled at users, who are routinely judged to be at fault for making weak choices. However, such judgements frequently tend to overlook that fact that users were ultimately permitted to make such choices, and often guided to do no better. This paper presents the fifth in a series of studies that have been conducted every 3-4 years since 2007 and examines the extent to which leading websites guide and support users in making appropriate password choices. Following the same core approach as the prior investigations, it examines the password practices of ten leading websites, with the aim of examining the level of guidance provided to users before and during the password selection process, as well as examining the nature of the passwords that users are then permitted to choose. The findings reveal that while there have been some marginal improvements in some areas (e.g. for the first time all of the sites under test were found to enforce a minimum password length), there are still numerous shortcomings and omissions in areas that would arguably support users in improving both their password practices and their resultant protection. Most sites present no upfront information on what good passwords should look like, and many offer ambiguous feedback in response to choices that are not permitted. Moreover, when it comes to filtering and preventing the use of weak passwords, there are a range of surprising omissions, with some sites readily permitting common passwords that others block for being too obvious. The findings demonstrate that users can remain unguided on good practice and unchallenged on bad decisions, which continues to be a disappointing outcome in an area of cyber security that is used so often.}

	abstract = {While the technique of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art results for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, recent works have shown that the decisions made by DNNs cannot always be trusted. Recently Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have been proposed as a method for increasing DNN’s reliability and trustworthiness. These XAI methods are however open to attack and can be manipulated in both white-box (gradient-based) and black-box (perturbation-based) scenarios. Exploring novel techniques to attack and robustify these XAI methods is crucial to fully understand these vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose Tamp-X—a novel attack which tampers the activations of robust NLP classifiers forcing the state-of-the-art white-box and black-box XAI methods to generate misrepresented explanations. To the best of our knowledge, in current NLP literature, we are the first to attack both the white-box and the black-box XAI methods simultaneously. We quantify the reliability of explanations based on three different metrics—the descriptive accuracy, the cosine similarity, and the\nL\np\nnorms of the explanation vectors. Through extensive experimentation, we show that the explanations generated for the tampered classifiers are not reliable, and significantly disagree with those generated for the untampered classifiers despite that the output decisions of tampered and untampered classifiers are almost always the same. Additionally, we study the adversarial robustness of the tampered NLP classifiers, and find out that the tampered classifiers which are harder to explain for the XAI methods, are also harder to attack by the adversarial attackers.}

	abstract = {Wireless body area network (WBAN) plays a vital role in patient health monitoring due to its ability to measure private physiological data of patients via low-power sensor devices and send them to medical experts through wireless channels. However, the open nature of wireless channels makes the collected patients’ data vulnerable to unauthorized access. Thus, effective authentication and data privacy protection in WBAN are important. The devices in WBAN lack adequate resources to handle existing complex cryptographic authentication solutions. Consequently, non-cryptographic based authentication approaches are proposed, which are more desirable because of their less complexity. However, the existing methods limit themselves to securing intra-WBAN communications, leaving the data of the patients unprotected against security attacks in the inter-WBAN layer. Moreover, they either require additional sensors, specified user movements, or restricted proximity, which undermines their widespread adoption. To address these shortcomings, we propose a hybrid device authentication scheme based on a user-specific signal propagation signature to secure inter-WBAN communications using channel characteristics and lightweight symmetric encryption. The key ideas in the proposed scheme are constructing signal propagation signatures related to each user from received signal strength (RSS) data and leveraging a feedforward neural network to correctly recognize the signal propagation signatures of the users and use them to verify inter-WBAN devices positioned on the bodies of the users. We conduct security and performance analyses of our scheme to show its resistance to security attacks and its computational effectiveness. Moreover, we implement our scheme on hardware devices and conduct extensive experiments on human subjects in indoor and outdoor places to validate the robustness of the proposed method. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively detect 92.7\n%\nof attack attempts with false alarms on just 7.5\n%\nof legitimate traffic.}

However, they are increasingly becoming targets of sophisticated data-driven adversarial attacks resulting in misprediction, eroding their ability to detect threats on network devices. In this paper, we present AdIoTack,\n1\na system that highlights vulnerabilities of decision trees against adversarial attacks, helping cybersecurity teams quantify and refine the resilience of their trained models for monitoring and protecting Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In order to assess the model for the worst-case scenario, AdIoTack performs white-box adversarial learning to launch successful volumetric attacks that decision tree ensemble network behavioral models cannot flag. Our first contribution is to develop a white-box algorithm that takes a trained decision tree ensemble model and the profile of an intended network-based attack (e.g., TCP/UDP reflection) on a victim class as inputs. It then automatically generates recipes that specify certain packets on top of the indented attack packets (less than 15% overhead) that together can bypass the inference model unnoticed. We ensure that the generated attack instances are feasible for launching on Internet Protocol (IP) networks and effective in their volumetric impact. Our second contribution develops a method to monitor the network behavior of connected devices actively, inject adversarial traffic (when feasible) on behalf of a victim IoT device, and successfully launch the intended attack. Our third contribution prototypes AdIoTack and validates its efficacy on a testbed consisting of a handful of real IoT devices monitored by a trained inference model. We demonstrate how the model detects all non-adversarial volumetric attacks on IoT devices while missing many adversarial ones. The fourth contribution develops systematic methods for applying patches to trained decision tree ensemble models, improving their resilience against adversarial volumetric attacks. We demonstrate how our refined model detects 92% of adversarial volumetric attacks.}

	abstract = {The botnet relies on the Command and Control (C&C) channels to conduct its malicious activities remotely. The Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) is often used by botnets to hide their Command and Control (C&C) server and evade take-down attempts, which allows the bot to generate a large number of domain names until it finds its C&C server. The lengths of domain names generated by DGAs are different. Our research finds that the length of the domain name has an impact on the performance of the DGA domain name detection model. In other words, the model is sensitive to the length of the domain name. In this case, attackers can evade detection simply by designing domain names of specific lengths. Moreover, the detection accuracy of DGA domain names still needs to be further improved. To solve these problems, three feature extraction methods adapted to the length of the domain name are proposed in this paper. For extra-short domain names, we use the attention-based method to extract features, which can make use of the character-level semantic feature. For moderate-length domain names, a two-dimensional structure, namely Right Shifted Tensor (RST), is constructed to make the domain name present apparent features similar to images. For the extra-long domain name, the effective classification of domain names can be achieved by manually crafted easy-to-calculate features. Then, different detection structures are designed based on these tree feature extraction methods to form a heterogeneous DGA detection model, namely HAGDetector. In addition, the public suffix is an important part of the domain name. We further analyze the public suffix to evaluate its impact on the detection of DGA domain names. Finally, the experiments are conducted to assess the validity of HAGDetector, as well as compare our approach with the current state-of-the-art and highlight the impact of the domain name length. The experimental results show that our method greatly improves the detection performance.}

	abstract = {Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA\n1\n) is meaningful in various software security applications, including vulnerability discovery, clone detection, and malware detection. Although many BCSA studies have been based on neural networks in recent years, some significant problems are challenging to solve. First, most existing methods focus more on the function pair similarity detection task (FPSDT\n2\n) while ignoring the function search task (FST\n3\n), which is more major in vulnerability discovery. Moreover, they care more about the final result, which is to improve the success rate of FPSDT by using unexplainable neural networks. Finally, in practice, most methods are difficult to resist cross-optimization and cross-obfuscation in BCSA. We first proposed an adaptive BCSA architecture combining interpretable feature engineering and learnable attention mechanism to solve these problems. We design an adaptive model with rich interpretable features, and the experimental results on FPSDT and FST are better than the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also found that the attention mechanism has outstanding advantages in functional semantic expression. Finally, the evaluation shows that our approach can significantly improve FST performance between cross-architecture, cross-optimization, cross-obfuscation and cross-compiler binaries.}

	abstract = {Cybersecurity is a broadly defined concept comprising security for many different types of elements. Dealing with cybersecurity is a multidimensional problem, and the damage generated by cyberattacks can be very diverse. Reports about cybersecurity show recurrent problems, or increasing on their frequency of appearance, with no clear approach for solving them. Existing models deal with cybersecurity in several different but general ways, and results are not better. Consequently, managing cybersecurity deserves consideration of a new approach. Our approach is based on the nature of security. Security services are modeled around three basic security concepts, namely isolation, interaction, and representation. With these three concepts, a cybersecurity development starts with security objectives for overcoming the cybersecurity challenges, and also has a security representation to achieve integral and comprehensive security results. We propose an architecture-based security conceptual framework having three components, namely a system representation model kind, a security representation model kind, and a security process model kind, to accomplish the security process for a system. The security process is fully guided and supported with security objectives from the beginning to the end. The framework proposes several models, based on data structures for representing the system, the security, and the process itself. The models are scalable to represent systems of any size, from tiny to huge technology infrastructures, and with support for automation of the security process. The scope of the framework is the security of IT systems and cybersecurity, including information, software, virtual resources, hardware, IT devices, money, people, and other related physical objects being represented digitally. The framework was developed while creating a university cloud infrastructure, and consolidated while supporting the security of several national wide software and infrastructure applications for digital signature in Costa Rica. We aim to provide a new and innovative way for doing cybersecurity, by directly targeting the actual security requirements; with a simple, systemic, structured and potentially automated security process, and for achieving integral and comprehensive security solutions.}

However, with the rapid growth in the number of connected devices, registration and authentication of the devices in 5G cellular network are set to become challenging tasks. Currently, the basis for registration and authentication of the devices in 5G mobile network is the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) that is provided to every device. But, with large scale deployments in IoT, providing a USIM and authenticating every device individually is going to be arduous. Recently, several group based authentication protocols have been proposed by researchers. Even so, none of these proposals can be easily adopted, since they are not based on the challenge response mechanism used in the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol (5G-AKA). In this paper, an efficient scheme for remote registration and group authentication of the IoT devices in 5G cellular network is proposed. The scheme is designed to work along with 5G-AKA protocol as its extension. It uses elliptic curve cryptography that is lightweight in nature and is suitable for resource constrained IoT environment. Security analysis and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secured and efficient in comparison to similar recent proposals in the literature.}

	abstract = {Security issues have gradually emerged with the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI). Earlier work verified the possibility of converting neural network models into stegomalware, embedding malware into a model with limited impact on the model’s performance. However, existing methods are not applicable in real-world attack scenarios and do not attract enough attention from the security community due to performance degradation and additional workload. Therefore, we propose an improved stegomalware EvilModel. By analyzing the composition of the neural network model, three new methods for embedding malware into the model are proposed: MSB reservation, fast substitution, and half substitution, which can embed malware that accounts for half of the model’s volume without affecting the model’s performance. We built 550 EvilModels using ten mainstream neural network models and 19 malware samples. The experiment shows that EvilModel achieved an embedding rate of 48.52%. A quantitative algorithm is proposed to evaluate the existing embedding methods. We also design a trigger and propose a threat scenario for the targeted attack. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods were demonstrated by experiments and analyses of the embedding capacity, performance impact, and detection evasion.}

	abstract = {Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) empowers users to govern their digital identity and personal data. This approach has changed the identity paradigm where users become the central governor of their identity; hence the rapid growth of the SSI model. Utilizing the security and privacy properties of blockchain, together with other security technologies, SSI purports to provide a robust security and privacy service. However, this governing power for users comes with a greater accountability and security risk, as not all users are capable or trained in its use and therefore in its efficient application. This trade-off requires a systematic evaluation of potential attacks on the SSI system and their security risks. Hitherto, there have been no noteworthy research studies performed to evaluate potential attacks on the SSI system and their security risks. This paper proposes an easy, efficient and economical approach to perform an evaluation of potential attacks on the SSI system and their security risks. This approach utilises a combination of an attack tree model and risk matrix model to perform this evaluation of potential attacks and their security risks, in addition to outlining a systematic approach including describing the system architecture and determining its assets in order to perform this evaluation of potential attacks and their security risks. This evaluation work has identified three potential attacks on the SSI system: faking identity, identity theft and distributed denial of service attacks, and performed their security risk evaluation utilising the proposed approach. Finally, this paper has proposed several mitigation strategies for the three evaluated attacks on the SSI system. This proposed evaluation approach is a systematic and generalised approach for evaluating attacks and their security risks, and can be applied to any other IT system.}

	abstract = {Traditional malware detection methods based on static traffic characteristics and machine learning are hard to cope with the increasing number of APT malware variants. In order to alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based malware classification approach that combines time sequence features and association rules features. This method uses the improved LSTM neural network structure named RESNET_LSTM and PARALLEL_LSTM to extract time sequence features of different protocol traffic. It also utilizes association analysis to generate quantitative rule features. Finally, we connect the time sequence feature vector and the quantization rule vector as input to deep learning models to detect malware traffic. We evaluated our proposed approach on a dataset consisting of malicious traffic generated by 57 types of malware and normal traffic. The experimental results demonstrate that the loss decline rate of PARALLEL_LSTM structure during the training phase is faster than that of the LSTM and RESNET_LSTM structures. When the RESNET_LSTM structure is used, the prediction accuracy is close to 100%, which is slightly higher than the other two structures. The accuracy of the detection methods proposed in this paper are all above 96%, while the accuracy of malware detection methods combined with static traffic characteristics and machine learning is about 85%.}

	abstract = {In contrast to previous surveys, the present work is not focused on reviewing the datasets used in the network security field. The fact is that many of the available public labeled datasets represent the network behavior just for a particular time period. Given the rate of change in malicious behavior and the serious challenge to label, and maintain these datasets, they become quickly obsolete. Therefore, this work is focused on the analysis of current labeling methodologies applied to network-based data. In the field of network security, the process of labeling a representative network traffic dataset is particularly challenging and costly since very specialized knowledge is required to classify network traces. Consequently, most of the current traffic labeling methods are based on the automatic generation of synthetic network traces, which hides many of the essential aspects necessary for a correct differentiation between normal and malicious behavior. Alternatively, a few other methods incorporate non-experts users in the labeling process of real traffic with the help of visual and statistical tools. However, after conducting an in-depth analysis, it seems that all current methods for labeling suffer from fundamental drawbacks regarding the quality, volume, and speed of the resulting dataset. This lack of consistent methods for continuously generating a representative dataset with an accurate and validated methodology must be addressed by the network security research community. Moreover, a consistent label methodology is a fundamental condition for helping in the acceptance of novel detection approaches based on statistical and machine learning techniques.}

	abstract = {Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have advanced performance in many application scenarios, they are vulnerable to the attacks of adversarial examples that are crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations. Most of the existing adversarial attacks rely on the structure and parameters information of the attacked network. Thus, the generated adversarial examples are poor in transferability to attack black-box defense models, which makes them difficult to be used in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an approach based on saliency distribution and data augmentation to generate transferable adversarial examples against the defense models. By optimizing perturbations over non-saliency regions, the generated adversarial examples are less sensitive to the attacked source models and have better transferability. Further, by utilizing data augmentation in generating adversarial examples, the overfitting problem on source models is alleviated in targeted attacks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can generate adversarial examples with higher transferability. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/dongysxd/SDM-FGSM-Attack\n.}

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks mislead machine-learning models to output an attacker-specified class when presented a specific trigger at test time. These attacks require poisoning the training data to compromise the learning algorithm, e.g., by injecting poisoning samples containing the trigger into the training set, along with the desired class label. Despite the increasing number of studies on backdoor attacks and defenses, the underlying factors affecting the success of backdoor attacks, along with their impact on the learning algorithm, are not yet well understood. In this work, we aim to shed light on this issue by unveiling that backdoor attacks induce a smoother decision function around the triggered samples – a phenomenon which we refer to as backdoor smoothing. To quantify backdoor smoothing, we define a measure that evaluates the uncertainty associated to the predictions of a classifier around the input samples. Our experiments show that smoothness increases when the trigger is added to the input samples, and that this phenomenon is more pronounced for more successful attacks. We also provide preliminary evidence that backdoor triggers are not the only smoothing-inducing patterns, but that also other artificial patterns can be detected by our approach, paving the way towards understanding the limitations of current defenses and designing novel ones.}

However, the quantified ability to indicate how effective (i.e., How Effective) a method is still unknown. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to understand the effectiveness of these methods better. More specifically, we prepare a dataset of 124 papers focusing on vulnerability discovery from S&P, SECURITY, CCS, and NDSS over the past ten years. These papers cover four techniques, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, concolic analysis, and fuzzing, yielding 3970 vulnerabilities, of which 954 get CVE records. Then, we extract several attributes from the paper and categorize them into five dimensions, i.e., popularity, scalability, capability, severity, and diversity, which facilitate us to compare various techniques along these dimensions statistically. Moreover, taking these attributes into account, we propose a scoring method to quantify the effectiveness of a method, thereby indicating how effective a method is. The empirical study on dimensions and effectiveness scores reveals several findings that help better understand the effectiveness of vulnerability discovery techniques.}

Individual users and corporations are not the only ones who are affected by cyber-attacks; national security is also a serious concern. Different nations' cybersecurity rules make it simpler for cybercriminals to carry out damaging actions while making it tougher for governments to track them down. Hence, a comprehensive cybersecurity policy is needed to enable governments to take a proactive approach to all types of cyber threats. This study investigates cybersecurity regulations and attributes used in seven nations in an attempt to fill this research gap. This paper identified fourteen common cybersecurity attributes such as telecommunication, network, Cloud computing, online banking, E-commerce, identity theft, privacy, and smart grid. Some nations seemed to focus, based on the study of key available policies, on certain cybersecurity attributes more than others. For example, the USA has scored the highest in terms of online banking policy, but Canada has scored the highest in terms of E-commerce and spam policies. Identifying the common policies across several nations may assist academics and policymakers in developing cybersecurity policies. A survey of other nations' cybersecurity policies might be included in the future research.}

IoT scenarios imply the presence of multiple data producers (e.g., sensors, actuators, RFID, NFC) and consumers (e.g., end-user devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs). A variety of standards and protocols must cooperate to efficiently gather, process, and share the information. The fog computing paradigm, due to its distributed nature, represents a viable solution to cope with interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy issues, which naturally emerge, since it operates as an intermediate layer between data consumers/producers and traditional cloud systems. This paper analyzes the evolution in the modeling of new methodologies, related to fog computing and IoT, showing how moving security and privacy tasks toward the edge of the network provide both advantages and new challenges to be faced in this research field.

	abstract = {IoT devices are vulnerable to security threats. The connectivity among such devices presents opportunities for cybercriminals to perform different types of attacks. In IoT, application layer protocols play an important role. They form the basis of communications between applications and services. Security is an optional design aspect in application layer protocols, leading developers to neglect these security settings, or others may lack security mechanisms in their standard configuration. This paper introduces Beholder, an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) to prevent attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities in the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) protocols. Most IoT systems adopt MQTT or CoAP. Beholder exploits the Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology to analyze data streams and detect attacks on IoT applications that use the MQTT and CoAP protocols. Beholder is the first IDS that relies on CEP technology to detect attacks on MQTT and CoAP protocols in IoT environments to the best of our knowledge. This work introduces a real scenario for the evaluation process, performing attacks on a smart home. Initially, we validated the quality of our IDS, comparing it against the well-known Snort IDS. Since Snort can only handle attacks on TCP, we restricted the experiment to attacks on this protocol. Results demonstrated that Snort achieved three 9s of precision, while Beholder reached a precision of four 9s. The experiment to evaluate Beholder’s precision for the MQTT and CoAP protocols revealed that Beholder obtained 100% precision for High QoS Flood (MQTT) and the Error Flood(CoAP).}

	abstract = {Recent emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic have shown how timely information sharing is essential to promptly and effectively react to emergencies. Internet of Things has magnified the possibility of acquiring information from different sensors and using it for emergency management and response. However, it has also amplified the potential of information misuse and unauthorized access to information by untrusted users. Therefore, this paper proposes an access control framework tailored to MQTT-based IoT ecosystems. By leveraging Complex Event Processing, we can enforce controlled and timely data sharing in emergency and ordinary situations. The system has been tested with a case study that targets patient monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic, showing promising results.}

	abstract = {Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is one of the most serious security problems in web applications. Although deep neural network (DNN) has been used in XSS attack detection and achieved unprecedented success, it is vulnerable to adversarial example attacks because its input-output mapping is quite discontinuous to a large extent. The existence of adversarial examples have raised concerns in applying deep learning to key security fields. Therefore, to evaluate the effectiveness of these detection methods, a XSS adversarial example attack technique using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm is presented in the paper. A key aspect of our idea is to train an agent using SAC algorithm to build adversarial examples for several popular XSS detection models which have been proved can achieve very high accuracy rate by simulation experiments. We first design mutation strategies for different modules of XSS attack vectors to ensure the validity of the generated adversarial examples. Then, the agent selects an appropriate escape strategy according to the feedback of the detection model until it bypasses the detection model. The final experiment results show that our model can achieve an escape rate of more than 92% and outperforms the latest method by up to 6%. In other words, the effectiveness of these detection models needs to be improved, at least in terms of defense adversarial example attacks.}
