	abstract = {Cyber attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) have seen a significant increase in recent years. This is primarily due to the widespread adoption and prevalence of IoT within domestic and critical national infrastructures, as well as inherent security vulnerabilities within IoT endpoints. Therein, botnets have emerged as a major threat to IoT-based infrastructures targeting firmware vulnerabilities such as weak or default passwords to assemble an army of compromised devices which can serve as a lethal cyber-weapon against target systems, networks, and services. In this paper, we present our efforts to mitigate this challenge through the development of an intrusion detection system that resides within an IoT device to provide enhanced visibility thereby achieving security hardening of such devices. The device-level intrusion detection presented here is part of our research framework BTC\n_\nSIGBDS (Blockchain-powered, Trustworthy, Collaborative, Signature-based Botnet Detection System). We identify the research challenge through a systematic critical review of existing literature and present detailed design of the device-level component of the BTC\n_\nSIGBDS framework. We use a signature-based detection scheme with trusted signature updates to strengthen protection against emerging attacks. We have evaluated the suitability and enhanced the capability through the generation of custom signatures of two of the most famous signature-based IDS with ISOT, IoT23, and BoTIoT datasets to assess the effectiveness with respect to detection of anomalous traffic within a typical resource-constrained IoT network in terms of number of alerts, detection rates, detection time as well as in terms of peak CPU and memory usage.}

	abstract = {Cloud-native systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular platforms for application development, providing lightweight virtualization, simplified DevOps procedures, scaling, resource efficiency, monitoring, and more. The typical cloud-native system may include containers, container orchestrators, and service meshes. However, a number of attacks exploit vulnerabilities in different components, leading the attacker to gain control over the cloud-native system. In this paper, we collect, classify, exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities of different components. Firstly, we choose Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio as the most popular cloud technologies and give each an overview. Secondly, we give an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities. We collect cloud-native vulnerabilities over the past five years and propose two classifications of those vulnerabilities. One is based on the architecture of the component, and the other is based on the attack enabled. We exploit vulnerabilities that enable us to discover some insightful findings and provide mitigation solutions. Third, we analyze 15 open-source security tools provided for the cloud-native environment. We argue that among all these security tools, none of them covers all features which we will discuss in this paper. We believe that our analysis of cloud security vulnerabilities and open-source security tools can benefit the security of the cloud-native ecosystem.}

	abstract = {Due to the numerous advantages of machine learning (ML) algorithms, many applications now incorporate them. However, many studies in the field of image classification have shown that MLs can be fooled by a variety of adversarial attacks. These attacks take advantage of ML algorithmsâ€™ inherent vulnerability. This raises many questions in the cybersecurity field, where a growing number of researchers are recently investigating the feasibility of such attacks against machine learning-based security systems, such as intrusion detection systems. The majority of this research demonstrates that it is possible to fool a model using features extracted from a raw data source, but it does not take into account the real implementation of such attacks, i.e., the reverse transformation from theory to practice. The real implementation of these adversarial attacks would be influenced by various constraints that would make their execution more difficult. As a result, the purpose of this study was to investigate the actual feasibility of adversarial attacks, specifically evasion attacks, against network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS), demonstrating that it is entirely possible to fool these ML-based IDSs using our proposed adversarial algorithm while assuming as many constraints as possible in a black-box setting. In addition, since it is critical to design defense mechanisms to protect ML-based IDSs against such attacks, a defensive scheme is presented. Realistic botnet traffic traces are used to assess this work. Our goal is to create adversarial botnet traffic that can avoid detection while still performing all of its intended malicious functionality.}

As a matter of fact, more and more manufactures are relying on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to shield their devices. In particular, ARM TrustZone (TZ) is being widely used in numerous embedded devices, especially smartphones, and this technology is the basis for secure solutions both in industry and academia. However, as shown in this paper, TEE is not bullet-proof and it has been successfully attacked numerous times and in very different ways. To raise awareness among potential stakeholders interested in this technology, this paper provides an extensive analysis and categorization of existing vulnerabilities in TEEs and highlights the design flaws that led to them. The presented vulnerabilities, which are not only extracted from existing literature but also from publicly available exploits and databases, are accompanied by some effective countermeasures to reduce the likelihood of new attacks. The paper ends with some appealing challenges and open issues.}

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to train collaborative machine learning (ML) models, preserving the privacy of the participantsâ€™ datasets. However, standard FL approaches present some limitations that can hinder their applicability in some applications. Thus, the need of a server or aggregator to orchestrate the learning process may not be possible in scenarios with limited connectivity, as in some IoT applications, and offer less flexibility to personalize the ML models for the different participants. To sidestep these limitations, peer-to-peer FL (P2PFL) provides more flexibility, allowing participants to train their own models in collaboration with their neighbors. However, given the huge number of parameters of typical Deep Neural Network architectures, the communication burden can also be very high. On the other side, it has been shown that standard aggregation schemes for FL are very brittle against data and model poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose SparSFA, an algorithm for P2PFL capable of reducing the communication costs. We show that our method outperforms competing sparsification methods in P2P scenarios, speeding the convergence and enhancing the stability during training. SparSFA also includes a mechanism to mitigate poisoning attacks for each participant in any random network topology. Our empirical evaluation on real datasets for intrusion detection in IoT, considering both balanced and imbalanced-dataset scenarios, shows that SparSFA is robust to different indiscriminate poisoning attacks launched by one or multiple adversaries, outperforming other robust aggregation methods whilst reducing the communication costs through sparsification.}

	abstract = {Taint analysis is a method used to detect system security problems by tracking the flow of user input or information leakage through the system. In the taint analysis for Android applications, the complete taint propagation path is generally obtained by tracking the taint data. There is often a compromise between efficiency and analysis accuracy in the method of obtaining the taint propagation path, or false positives and false negatives due to the neglect of Android features. Given the problems, a novel multi-branch taint search association algorithm is proposed, which optimized the processing of Android component features in taint analysis. It directly finds taint related codes and associates them according to predefined rules. It has effective Android taint analysis ability including alias analysis and reduced the negative impact of taint unrelated codes on the performance of taint analysis. At the same time, the Android static taint analysis prototype tool TaintSA is implemented based on the multi-branch taint search association algorithm. The experimental results show that TaintSA can not only ensure the analysis results' accuracy but also reduce the time and space required for taint analysis. The accuracy rate of 91.5% and the recall rate of 75.6% on the DroidBench2.0 test set are better than the taint analysis tool FlowDroid. The time consumption and memory consumption of about 30% and 20% are reduced at the same time. In terms of the representation of taint propagation edges, compared with FlowDroid, the taint propagation path output by TaintSA does not contain intermediate variables, and the form is more concise. In addition, TaintSA can output the taint propagation path without taint leakage, which is helpful for further taint analysis.}

	abstract = {Most defense strategies in complex networks are developed from the defense perspective, overlooking the key attack-defense characteristics in cybersecurity. A defense decision algorithm is ineffective when dealing with dynamic attacking behaviors, and when based on attack-defense analysis, stochastic uniform network models are generally used to model the target network, while most networks are large and complex. Thus, the algorithms and their results do not well suit small-world, scale-free, and high-aggregation networks. In this study, considering the structural characteristics of complex networks and the attack-defense characteristics of cybersecurity, potential differential game theory is integrated with complex networks, and a global optimal defense decision algorithm is proposed according to the overall network defense objective. Based on the evolutionary analysis of network security states, a network attack-defense potential differential game model is constructed. Adversarial analysis is carried out on the overall attack-defense strategy, and a defense decision algorithm is designed based on a saddle point equilibrium strategy. Simulation tests are carried out on small-world and scale-free networks to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with that of random defense strategies and classic decision algorithms.}

However, the existing detection methods have bottleneck in the face of insufficient training datasets. This work proposed and a novel anomaly detection approach based on ensemble semi-supervised active learning, which can effectively detect anomalous traffic when there is few labeled samples and the dataset is unbalanced. Specifically, this work proposed balanced sampling strategy, which combines the margin sampling and the democratic co-learning techniques, to construct a balanced training set that consists of manually labeled high-information samples and automatically labeled high-confidence samples, to effectively train the detection model on a limited budget. We also found adding correctly labeled high-confidence samples into training set improves the performance of detection model when the training samples are few and the label budget is limited. This work achieves a good balance between the effectiveness of model training and the cost of sample querying when the traffic data in CPS is rare labeled and imbalanced. In addition, we designed five pairs of experiments with NSL-KDD and SWaT dataset, and the results demonstrate the capability and advancement of proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Model stealing attacks have been successfully used in many machine learning domains, but there is little understanding of how these attacks work against models that perform malware detection. Malware detection and, in general, security domains have unique conditions. In particular, there are very strong requirements for low false positive rates (FPR). Antivirus products (AVs) that use machine learning are very complex systems to steal, malware binaries continually change, and the whole environment is adversarial by nature. This study evaluates active learning model stealing attacks against publicly available stand-alone machine learning malware classifiers and also against antivirus products. The study proposes a new neural network architecture for surrogate models (dualFFNN) and a new model stealing attack that combines transfer and active learning for surrogate creation (FFNN-TL). We achieved good surrogates of the stand-alone classifiers with up to 99% agreement with the target models, using less than 4% of the original training dataset. Good surrogates of AV systems were also trained with up to 99% agreement and less than 4000 queries. The study uses the best surrogates to generate adversarial malware to evade the target models, both stand-alone and AVs (with and without an internet connection). Results show that surrogate models can generate adversarial malware that evades the targets but with a lower success rate than directly using the target models to generate adversarial malware. Using surrogates, however, is still a good option since using the AVs for malware generation is highly time-consuming and easily detected when the AVs are connected to the internet.}

The cooperation provides opportunities for a malicious participant to conduct a backdoor attack. However, the attack is challenging when the adversary does not own labels with the mitigation of other participants. In this paper, we discover that an adversary can exploit local latent representations output in the inference stage to inject a backdoor in VFL, even without access to labels. With little auxiliary labeled data, the adversary fine-tunes its bottom model to make it output specific latent representation for backdoor input instances, which induces the federated model to predict the attacker-specified label regardless of benign participants. Our experiments show that the proposed attack can achieve a high attack success rate with little loss of main task accuracy and outperform existing backdoor attacks. We also explore possible defenses against the attack. Our research demonstrates the potential security threat to VFL.}

In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight and generic NIDS with a two-stage framework to detect botnet activities on the IoT network, only using accessible packet-length features. Our NIDS can be deployed at a resource-limited device and work in an efficient online manner. We first propose 21 statistical features which are discriminative for malicious and normal traffic flows. Based on these features, we design a module based on an autoencoder to filter out a large number of normal traffic flows in the first stage. Then we propose a novel mechanism to transform the packet length sequence into a three-channel RGB image for malicious traffic classification based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). In order to demonstrate the performance, we build a real IoT environment and deploy our NIDS on a Raspberry PI. The experiment results show that our NIDS has excellent accuracy for detecting botnet activities and higher processing rate for traffic compared with the state-of-the-art ANN-based methods.}

	abstract = {A substantial part of the Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain that involves semiconductor fabrication, packaging, and testing has shifted globally to minimize IC costs and satisfy market needs. This globalized supply chain and the presence of non-trusted entities have raised concerns about security issues. The fabless business model has resulted in numerous vulnerabilities. Logic Locking (LL) has emerged as a potential/versatile technique utilized by industries/academia. LL protects IPs integrated with System-on-Chip (SoC) designs from hardware threats throughout the IC supply chain. The applicability, feasibility, and effectiveness of LL have been investigated for more than a decade. The research interests involve metrics that evaluate the consequences of locking at multiple levels of abstraction, tampering, threat model description, machine learning implementation, and resiliency against physical attacks. However, complex logical and physical vulnerabilities that increase in effectiveness simultaneously as LL prevention/mitigation solutions have challenged the trustworthiness and resilience of modern LL solutions. We have classified known defenses and vulnerabilities by explaining measurements and fundamentals of LL, assumptions, limitations, and emerging technologies that highlight needs and guide future research. This survey paper aims to enable IP owners, SoC engineers, and researchers to explore and determine state-of-the-art logic locking techniques for further evaluation and research.}

	abstract = {Industrial control protocols have a large number of vulnerabilities due to lacking authentication and misuse of function codes, which seriously threaten the production safety. Fuzzing, as a common method for vulnerability mining, has the disadvantages of low reception rate of generated test cases and blind mutation, which leads to poor vulnerability mining. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive fuzzing method based on Transformer and protocol similarity mutation. Firstly, the Transformer network is trained to learn the semantics information of the commonly used industrial control protocol Modbus TCP, which can generate test cases with a high reception rate in a short time. Secondly, during the test case generation stage, compare the semantic similarity and the size of random values between the newly generated bytes and the model input fields to determine whether to perform bit-flip mutation for the newly generated bytes, so as to reduce the overall similarity of the test cases and improve the test system abnormal rate. Finally, the byte importance self-adaptive algorithm is used to improve the mutation probability of bytes that are prone to trigger vulnerabilities. Experimental results indicate that compared with the traditional method, our method not only effectively improves the testing efficiency, but also increases the test systemâ€™s abnormal rate. In addition, the ability of vulnerability mining capability has been effectively improved.}

We used data collected from 50 volunteers and leveraged the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classification algorithm for the case study. User recognition patterns are taken from a combination of blinking, attention concentration, and picture recognition emotion sequences. These actions impact alpha, beta, gamma, and theta brain waves, which are measured using several electrodes. Ten different electrode placement patterns are explored, with varied positioning on the head. For each placement position, four features are examined, for a total of 40 extracts in the learning model. Features are: 1) spectral information, 2) coherence, 3) mutual correlation coefficient, and 4) mutual information. Each feature type is trained by the SVM algorithm, and the 40 weak classifier candidates. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), a type of machine learning, is then used to generate a robust classifier, which is subsequently used to create a model, and select features, used to accurately identify individuals for authentication purposes. Upon verifying the proposed method using 32 legitimate users and 18 intruders, we obtained an authentication error rate (ERR) of 0.52%, and a classification rate of 99.06%.}

	abstract = {Investigations within Security Operation Centers (SOCs) are tedious as they rely on manual efforts to query diverse data sources, overlay related logs, correlate the data into information, and then document results in a ticketing system. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools are a relatively new technology that promise, with appropriate configuration, to collect, filter, and display needed diverse information; automate many of the common tasks that unnecessarily require SOC analystsâ€™ time; facilitate SOC collaboration; and, in doing so, improve both efficiency and consistency of SOCs. There has been no prior research to test SOAR tools in practice; hence, understanding and evaluation of their effect is nascent and needed. In this paper, we design and administer the first hands-on user study of SOAR tools, involving 24 participants and six commercial SOAR tools. Our contributions include the experimental design, itemizing six defining characteristics of SOAR tools, and a methodology for testing them. We describe configuration of a cyber range test environment, including network, user, and threat emulation; a full SOC tool suite; and creation of artifacts allowing multiple representative investigation scenarios to permit testing. We present the first research results on SOAR tools. Concisely, our findings are that: per-SOC SOAR configuration is extremely important; SOAR tools increase efficiency and reduce context switching, although with potentially decreased ticketing accuracy/completeness; user preference is slightly negatively correlated with their performance with the tool; internet dependence varies widely among SOAR tools; and balance of automation with assisting decision making is preferred by senior participants. We deliver a public user- and tool-anonymized and -obfuscated version of the data.}

But how to sufficiently extract the spatio-temporal features of traffic and generate superior background network traffic are still problems for the Cyber Range. In this paper, we propose a background network traffic generative model, DBWE-Corbat. Our solution relies on intelligent feature extraction based on the DB-WE dynamic word embedding method. Which consists of Doc2Vec and two Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers. Specifically, first we convert the traffic feature tuple data into a static word vector. Then, we capture the spatio-temporal features of the traffic for characterization. Finally, we generate high-quality and numerous background network traffic by learning the feature distribution of small samples based on the contrastive learning model SimCSE. Extensive experiments show that our approach can generate high-quality traffic data. It meets the requirements of cyber range construction compared to other traffic generation methods.}

	abstract = {Modern vehicles have dozens of electronic modules, connected through sophisticated intra-vehicle networks, which essentially control all the vehicle functions. Recent studies have shown the vulnerability of vehicular computer systems, but the existing security models are not enough robust yet because the busload and level of cryptographic strategy are not considered enough to be implemented in the frame. This work proposes a new security model for the Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-Rate (CAN FD), based on encryption and authentication. The model divides the frame data field into two blocks. The AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) symmetric key encryption is applied to the first block of the data frame, whose content is the data corresponding to the payload of the frame. The authentication of the data in the first block is executed through the implementation of the HMAC/SHA-256 function and inserted in the second block. Performance analysis has shown that the combination of 32 bytes for the first block and 32 bytes for the second one provides the shortest processing time and 33.33% fewer data compared to frame 48. Results indicated that the proposed security model has a higher encryption performance than existing methods.}

	abstract = {Due to the advanced features, smartphones have become an essential and widely adopted electronic device around the world, which can provide various benefits, such as online shopping, e-commerce payment, making friends via social media, email checking and more. Such devices make peopleâ€™s work and life more convenient and flexible, but how to secure the locally stored phone data is a big problem. With more sensitive or private data stored on these portable devices, there is a significant demand to safeguard smartphones from unauthorized access. Currently, one of the most straightforward and intuitive approaches is to implement an unlock mechanism that asks users to input a correct unlock pattern for authentication, e.g., Android unlock patterns. However, such unlock mechanism can be easily compromised when the unlock pattern is leaked. In this work, we advocate that combining behavioral features with unlock mechanisms is a promising solution, and propose a double-cross-based unlock scheme, called Double-X, which requires users to unlock the device by inputting two cross shapes on the selected dots. For authentication, users have to re-input the selected dots and draw the cross shapes. In the evaluation, we conduct two user studies with 100 participants in total to explore and validate the scheme performance, as compared with two similar unlock schemes. The experimental results indicate that under our scheme, users can reach good success rates with better feedback.}

	abstract = {The Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (ML-IDS) becomes more popular because it doesn't need to manually update the rules and can recognize variants better, However, due to the data privacy issue in ML-IDS, the Federated Learning-based IDS (FL-IDS) was proposed. In each round of federated learning, each participant first trains its local model and sends the model's weights to the global server, which then aggregates the received weights and distributes the aggregated global model to participants. An attacker will use poisoning attacks, including label-flipping attacks and backdoor attacks, to directly generate a malicious local model and indirectly pollute the global model. Currently, a few studies defend against poisoning attacks, but they only discuss label-flipping attacks in the image field. Therefore, we propose a two-phase defense mechanism, called Defending Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning (DPA-FL), applied to intrusion detection. The first phase employs relative differences to quickly compare weights between participants because the local models of attackers and benign participants are quite different. The second phase tests the aggregated model with the dataset and tries to find the attackers when its accuracy is low. Experiment results show that DPA-FL can reach 96.5% accuracy in defending against poisoning attacks. Compared with other defense mechanisms, DPA-FL can improve F1-score by 20âˆ¼64% under backdoor attacks. Also, DPA-FL can exclude the attackers within twelve rounds when the attackers are few.}

We build on Utility theory and previous social engineering, adversarial thinking, and conversational agent research. We designed a conversational agent to allow humans to learn and practice social engineering techniques in a fun and engaging setting. Users learn how an attacker might use these techniques by performing them.

The study was assessed in two phases. The model's validity and measurement reliability were evaluated in the first phase, while in the second phase, all preliminary model relationships were appraised. This was achieved utilizing structural equation modelling to establish whether the proposed constructs, i.e. neutralization, response efficacy, fear, threat, habit and role values were good predictors for intention or reactance towards compliance with information systems security policy. Participants included 348 employees from 7 nations, i.e. the USA, the UK, Oman, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. SmartPLS v. 3.3.9 was used for data analysis. The models' measurement reliability and validity were affirmed. Fear and role values have a significant influence on intention toward ISPC. RE significantly predicted threat which in turn significantly predicted fear, and the latter demonstrated a significant effect on reactance as well as Neutralization predicted reactance. In contrast, habit failed to reach a significant influence on intention towards ISPC. The implications are presented, together with proposals for further studies. Our findings are helpful for ISS literature and application by supporting the crucial functions of role values in encouraging employees to behave in a compliant manner. Additionally, it is regarded as the first empirical attempt to estimate intended compliance concerning ISPs in higher education from a worldwide viewpoint.}

	abstract = {The number of connected devices in our world is continuously increasing at a rapid rate. The Internet of Things(IoT) civilization has resulted in the generation of enormous amounts of data. Analytics on this data pays off in various sectors like health care, manufacturing, and transportation. However, the data generated in the IoT environment is often sensitive, and hence, the need to address the privacy concerns of the data owners. Existing approaches incur a huge computation cost and there is also a gap between privacy preservation and data utility. In this work, a genetic algorithm is coupled with a deep learning network based on adversarial training to build a utility-privacy balanced, low computation solution. The proposal aims to prevent inference of implicit privacy labels present in the data while maintaining data utility. The first part of the proposed work leverages an optimized encoder architecture to learn latent space representation of the input and the second part is the incorporation of adversary for training the framework to prevent unintended sensitive inference. Both parts are governed by a genetic algorithm to output a fitting encoder. Numerical results carried on a benchmark dataset exhibit the capability to protect sensitive data by keeping the accuracy level of the adversary within 23%, and producing a maximum inference accuracy of 95% for the intended task.}

Intrusion detection in CPSs and other domains, such as the Internet of Things, is often addressed through machine and deep learning. However, many existing proposals tend to favor the application of complex detection models over the usability in real-world operations.

	abstract = {Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to malicious attacks, such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks. A model injected by a backdoor attack can work adequately under normal conditions but the malicious behaviour is evident on samples with specific triggers. In most existing backdoor attacks, the trigger is manually defined, which results in a less-than-optimal attack success rate, a degree of stealthiness and a high poison ratio. To address these limitations, first, we reformulate the goal as a problem of determining the boundaries of a neural network. Then, we propose a dynamic invisible trigger algorithm (DIT) for determining the neural networkâ€™s decision boundaries. Then, based on DIT, we propose DIHBA, Dynamic Invisible and High attack success rate with low poison ratio Boundaries Backdoor Attack, in which we use the decision boundary images generated by DIT as trigger images. Finally, we analyse the stealthiness, attack success rate and poison ratio of DIHBA with the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB and Cat-face datasets. Compared to BadNets Gu et al.(2019), HB Saha et al.(2020), ROBNET Gong et al.(2021) and Poison Ink Zhang et al.(2022), DIHBA is not only stealthy but also has a high attack success rate, with low poison ratios of 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 20% and 25% for attacking different precision networks. In addition, DIHBA has strong resistance to the state-of-the-art backdoor defence systems Strip Gao et al.(2019) and Neural Cleanse Wang et al.(2019).}

	abstract = {CPU registers are small discrete storage units that are used to store temporary data and instructions within the CPU. Registers are not addressable in the same way memory is, which makes them immune to memory attacks and manipulation by other means. In this paper, we take advantage of this to protect critical program data with integrity guarantees that cover register spills. This protection effectively addresses control- and data-oriented attacks targeting the stack, even by adversaries with the full knowledge of program memory. Our solution RegGuard is a software-based mitigation technique that uses existing CPU registers and cryptographic primitives to protect critical variables with hardware-level assurance. Unlike conventional register allocation methods, RegGuard prioritises the security significance of a register candidate over its expected performance gain. Our scheme also deals effectively with saved registers to the stack, i.e., when the compiler frees registers to make room for the variables of a new call. With RegGuard, register values saved to the stack are protected, including strong adversaries with arbitrary read and write access capabilities. While our primary design focus is on security, performance is important for a scheme to be adopted in practice. RegGuard is still benefiting from the performance gain normally associated with register allocations and provides practical protection. Despite being adaptable to different CPU architectures, we showcase the performance of RegGuard using different benchmark programs and the C library on the ARM64 architecture as a proof-of-concept.}

	abstract = {Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN) is deployed for various underwater applications, such as underwater creature tracking and underwater tactical surveillance. Particularly, UASN in military applications could be invaded by some underwater spy-robots termed eavesdroppers. The eavesdroppers navigate around some anchored nodes of UASN and eavesdrop on their communication channels silently. The anchored nodes are difficult to perceive the adjacent eavesdroppers, because the eavesdroppers never actively communicate with others. Thus, the anchored nodes could disseminate the data messages while they are blithely unaware of the adjacent eavesdroppers capturing the data messages. To reduce the theft ratio of data messages and guarantee the topology connectivity of UASN, an analysis framework regarding the theft ratio of data messages is first formulated, and then a geometric distribution is constructed for the in-degrees of anchored nodes. Furthermore, a binomial distribution for the communication ranges of anchored nodes is derived from this analysis framework. In our proposed Anti-Theft Topology Control Mechanism (ATTCM), the anchored nodes set the initial communication ranges according to the obtained binomial distribution, and then the communication ranges of anchored nodes are checked and adjusted to guarantee the topology connectivity. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of ATTCM, i.e., ATTCM can reduce the theft ratio of data messages effectively, and it can guarantee that there is at least one available communication path from each anchored node to the surface sink.}

	abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a network architecture within the control is centralized through a software-based controller. Being a single point of attack makes the controller the preferred target in the SDN architecture. Multi-controller architecture has been introduced to reinforce the control plane. However it requires a communication interface between the controllers which is a security threat. In this objective, a dual controller architecture is introduced and it consists of one nominal controller in charge of the data plane computation plus a second one in charge of the detection of anomalies in the decisions taken by the main controller. In the case of non-determinist algorithm, the detection logic aims at determining a likelihood score of the decisions taken by the controller. A multi-criterion detection approach is proposed by considering both the performance of the decisions and the structure of the decisions taken by the controller. Such computations are probabilistic and attention has been paid to machine learning algorithms to determine this likelihood. More precisely, three formalisms are compared: Probabilistic Finite Automaton, Hidden Markov Model and Recurrent Neural Network. The impact of the control variance in the detection accuracy depending on the formalism used is discussed on a case study.}

	abstract = {Phishing has emerged as a critical security threat to individuals and organizations. Academics and practitioners have developed various methods to convince individuals to take preventive measures against phishing attacks. However, people are not rational decision makers. One important factor influencing one's risk decision making is optimism bias, which refers to people's tendency to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events and more likely to experience positive events than others. It is well indicated in the literature that optimism bias may hinder one's efforts to develop and implement risk-reducing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, the important role played by optimism bias in people's decision-making process with respect to phishing has not been fully explored in previous studies. Drawing on the theory of reasoned action, our research explored how optimism bias moderates the relationship between phishing risk and attitude toward the adoption of preventive measures against phishing attacks. The results indicate that phishing risk determines the attitude toward preventive measures against phishing attacks, and that optimism bias weakens this relationship.}

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack has become one of the fatal threats to the Internet, where attackers send massive amounts of packets to the target system to make online systems unavailable to legitimate users. Proper attack detection measurement is crucial to defend against these attacks. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model using a contractive autoencoder to detect anomalies. We train our model to learn the normal traffic pattern from the compacted representation of the input data, and then apply a stochastic threshold method to detect the attack. Three renowned Intrusion Detection System datasets have been used for evaluationCIC-IDS2017, NSL-KDD, and CIC-DDoS2019. We have assessed the results against a basic autoencoder and other deep learning approaches to show our model efficacy. Our results indicate a successful intrusion detection of the proposed method with an accuracy ranging between 93.41% and 97.58% on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. Moreover, it achieved an accuracy of 96.08% and 92.45% on NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017 datasets, respectively.}

Yet, its effectiveness is often limited by traineesâ€™ perception that it is boring and unengaging, which weakens their attention and thus diminishes learning outcomes. We examine whether antiphishing training that uses narrativesâ€”storiesâ€”can make training more engaging and improve training outcomes. To that end, we conduct an experiment to compare the effects of a narrative antiphishing training against an existing non-narrative training as well as a no-training control group. Comparing against the control group, we found both training models to be effective. However, comparing the two training models, the experiment showed that the narrative training engenders higher levels of curiosity among trainees and higher levels of phishing-detection self-efficacy and phishing-detection ability. Taken together, these findings show that antiphishing training in specific, and perhaps security training in general, can be improved using narratives.}

	abstract = {Cryptographic devices are vulnerable to side-channel attacks, which have attracted broad attention in the hardware security field. The side-channel analysis framework proposed at Eurocrypt 2009 has been widely adopted in academia, containing key elements such as points of interest, leakage models, distinguishers, and security metrics. This classical framework, however, is not intuitively compatible with recent micro-architectural attacks such as cache attacks, therefore, few attempts have been made to link them. In this paper, we extend the classical side-channel analysis framework and migrate its ideas to access-driven cache attacks. We find that cache attacks can be effectively incorporated into this framework. Specifically, we propose a leakage model called cache access pattern vector according to the cache timing leakage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose data preprocessing schemes such as noise reduction, dimensionality reduction, and vector expansion to implement efficient attacks. Subsequently, we proposed seven distinguishers in three categories: difference of means-based analysis, vector distance-based analysis, and mutual information-based analysis. Moreover, we attacked the last round of the AES fast software implementation algorithm based on the Chipyard platform. According to the experimental results, all proposed methods can successfully extract the key, and five of them are comparable to mainstream cache analysis in attack efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the five efficient distinguishers under three different cache micro-architectures using guessing entropy. Based on the experimental environment of this paper, vector distance-based distinguishers have the best attack efficiency, and the difference of mean-based analysis has the worst. Surprisingly, the most general mutual information-based attacks can achieve excellent medium results in a few attack rounds without the help of static analysis tools. Meanwhile, the experimental results demonstrate that cache micro-architecture directly impacts the attack effect, in which the smaller cache line size benefits the attacks, while the random replacement policy increases the noise and difficulty of the attacks.}

	abstract = {While security experts, firms, security providers, threat analysts all around the globe are working hard to provide ironclad security for information system softwares, vulnerabilities in softwares are still being detected on a daily basis. Although it is very important to neutralize all these vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, prioritization of vulnerabilities to determine the order for resolving these vulnerabilities is an equally important step for optimization of the remediation process. Among different available techniques for prioritization of vulnerabilities, scoring the vulnerabilities is the most common practice. In this paper, we have proposed a novel hybrid technique, VIEWSS: Variable Impact-Exploitability Weightage Scoring System, which scores vulnerabilities by varying the Impact-Exploitability score ratio towards calculation of base scores. We have also discussed three popular quantitative vulnerability scoring techniques; CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), VRSS (Vulnerability Rating and Scoring System) and WIVSS (Weighted Impact Vulnerability Scoring System) by explaining the underlying metrics, scoring systems, formulas and some limitations of these techniques. The proposed technique, VIEWSS is also compared with the discussed techniques by generating scores for around 83,500 vulnerabilities reported on NVD (National Vulnerability Database) in the last five years. It is observed that our proposed technique generates the greatest number of distinct scores and also the score distribution of our technique performs well on different parameters including skewness and kurtosis. Further when these techniques were applied on a dataset containing around 12,200 â€˜high-riskâ€™ vulnerabilities extracted by cross-referencing NVD and Exploit-DB, our proposed technique outperformed all the discussed techniques in terms of identifying the threat accurately.}

However, if an adversary attacks when the agent making critical decisions, it is bound to bring disastrous consequences because humans cannot detect it. Therefore, it is necessary to study adversarial attacks against deep reinforcement learning to help researchers design highly robust and secure algorithms and systems. In this paper, we proposed an attack method based on Attack Time Selection (ATS) function and Optimal Attack Action (O2A) strategy, named ATS-O2A. We select the critical attack moment through the ATS function, and then combine the state-based strategy with the O2A strategy to select the optimal attack action which has profound influence as targeted action, finally we launch an attack by making targeted adversarial examples. In order to measure the stealthiness and effectiveness of the attack, we designed a new measurement index. Experiments show that our method can effectively reduce unnecessary attacks and improve the efficiency of attacks.}
