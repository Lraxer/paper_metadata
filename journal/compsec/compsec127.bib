	abstract = {The allure of the metaverse along with Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and speed at which they are deployed may shift focus away from security and privacy fundamentals. In this work we employ classic exploitation techniques against cutting edge devices to obtain equally novel results. The unique features of the Virtual Reality landscape set the stage for our primary account of a new attack, the Man-in-the-Room (MitR). This attack, realized from a vulnerable social networking application led to both worming and botnet capabilities being adapted for VR with potential critical impacts affecting millions of users. Our work improves the state-of-the-art in Virtual Reality (VR) security and socio-technical research in VR. It shares several analytical and attacking tools, example exploits, evaluation dataset, and vulnerability signatures with the scientific and professional communities to ensure secure VR software development. The presented results demonstrate the detection and prevention of VR vulnerabilities, and raise questions in the law and policy domains pertaining to VR security and privacy.}

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of things that are interconnected to provide a variety of services. These things can include smartphones, actuators, sensors, computers, and wearables. The IoT enables the collection and exchange of data between these objects. The expansion of smart networks is what has given the Internet of Things its global influence. Routing is an important strategy that involves the creation of routes and the transmission of data packets from the source to the intended recipient in the network. Energy and trust are considered to be the two most important parts that provide secure data transmission in a network. However, secure routing in the highly distributed and dynamic environment of IoT still results in a great challenge due to the heterogeneity of devices. Hence, an efficient secure data routing mechanism is designed with the proposed Competitive Verse Flower Pollination (CVFP) algorithm that considers trust, energy, delay, distance, and link lifetime (LLT) parameters to find an optimal routing path. Moreover, the selection of optimal path is made by involving CH nodes such that nodes have higher energy are chosen in the routing strategy. The quality of the link is measured using the LLT constraint in order to decide whether data can be routed or to perform a route maintenance mechanism to ensure reliability in data routing. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed using the simulated data. The proposed algorithm attains a lower delay of 0.204 s, higher residual energy of 0.093 J, a maximum throughput of 94.59%, and a higher trust of 0.713.}

	abstract = {The availability of a multitude of data sources has naturally increased the need for subjects to collaborate for supporting distributed computations that combine different data collections for their elaboration and analysis. Due to the quick pace at which datasets grow, often the authorities collecting and owning such datasets resort to external third parties (e.g., cloud providers) for their storage and management. Data under the control of different authorities are autonomously encrypted (using different encryption schemes and keys) for their external storage. This makes distributed computations combining these sources difficult to support. In this paper, we propose an approach enabling collaborative computations over data encrypted in storage, selectively involving also subjects that might not be authorized for accessing the data in plaintext when their collaboration is considered economically convenient. We also consider the possible adoption of trusted hardware components, to enable the evaluation of operations over plaintext data at non-fully trusted computational providers. The experimental results confirm the economic benefits that can be enabled by our proposal.}

We measure these needs by analysing six cybersecurity-related job profiles—each with its own specific skill requirements—that have been assessed by academic and industrial organisations from the cybersecurity community in 14 European countries. We find that it is possible to identify a series of “transversal” skills relevant to all job profiles, and thus of utmost importance in the cybersecurity curricula. However, we also observe that academic and industrial priorities differ substantially, and that skills related to the area of Human security do not rank particularly high, possibly exposing the difficulty of integrating such concepts in traditional education.}

Thus, empirical studies on cybercrime prevention policies and tools are needed to understand their effectiveness and to improve implementation and evaluation. This article analyzes whether two UK government schemes aimed at encouraging and helping businesses to adopt cybersecurity controls and policies ('Cyber Essentials’ and ‘10 Steps to Cyber Security’) are associated with safer organizational behavior and whether adopting the recommended measures is related to lower levels of cybercrime victimization and its impacts. Bayesian model averaging is employed on a representative sample of 5,872 businesses from four rounds (2018–2021) of the UK Government's Cyber Security Breaches Survey. The results show that awareness of the Government schemes is associated with more cyber secure practices, but we do not find evidence of lower likelihood of victimization or negative consequences for companies that implement the recommended measures. Findings are discussed in relation to policy, practice and future research.}

	abstract = {Reachability query is one of the most popular and fundamental operations, which answers whether two given nodes are reachable in a graph. With the continuous increase of graph scale, data owners would like to upload graphs to the cloud server to enjoy the nice computing and storage service. How to realize privacy-preserving reachability query over graphs has become an important problem. Although there have already been some existed schemes for this problem, all of them only support the honest-but-curious model. If the cloud server returns the invalid query result, existing schemes will not work any longer. In this paper, we initiate the first study on realizing the verifiable privacy-preserving reachability query over graphs, and propose three step-by-step schemes based on the 2-hop labeling index and the MAC technology. The first proposed scheme can generate the verification tag for each pair of nodes in the index. But it leads to high communication and computation overhead. In order to address this problem, we propose the second scheme by constructing a special matrix to store the verification tag for each two nodes and their common nodes in the graph. It only returns one verification tag to the user, which requires less communication and computation overhead. Finally, we optimize the second scheme and propose the third scheme to further reduce the computation complexity. We make use of the symmetric-key primitives to secure the index, ensuring the necessary privacy with the ability of querying. The security analysis and extensive experiments show that our proposed schemes are secure and efficient.}

This work demonstrates that detecting SQL injection attacks on flow data from lightweight protocols is possible. For this purpose, we gathered two datasets collecting flow data from several SQL injection attacks on the most popular database engines. After evaluating several machine learning-based algorithms, we get a detection rate of over 97% with a false alarm rate of less than 0.07% with a Logistic Regression-based model.}

A key limitation lies in the lack of a model to achieve better detection performance and more reliable interpretability, and keep a balance between performance efficiency and training optimization. In this paper, we propose GRN, an Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection method based on neural graph networks and gated recurrent units (GRU). GRN can automatically learn potential correlations between sensors from multidimensional industrial control time series data, quickly mine long-term and short-term dependencies, to improve detection performance and help users to infer the root cause of detected anomalies. Based on GRU, GRN preserves the original advantages of processing the sequences and capturing the time series dependencies, moreover solves the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion. We compare the performance of nine state-of-the-art algorithms on two real water treatment datasets (SWaT, WADI). GRN achieves better detection precision and recall. Meanwhile, the comparison of Area Under the Curve (AUC) demonstrates that GRN has the effect of maintaining balance between detection performance and training optimization. Compared with a Graph Deviation Network(GDN), GRN has achieved greater interpretability.}

The TPM chip exposed on the motherboard is easily monitored or bypassed. As a slave device on the bus, it is under the control of the master device and has no higher privileges to access system resources than the CPU used only to compute in traditional computers. The current trusted computing architecture cannot ensure that the TPM chip starts to work prior to the CPU. To solve these problems, this paper propose a new trusted computing dual-architecture, which is made up of a trusted computing subsystem and a traditional computing subsystem. A new hardware root-of-trust and a kind of boot process in the trusted computing dual-architecture are implemented to provide a higher-level trust for the whole system. In a word, the new trusted computing dual-architecture ensures that the hardware root-of-trust is a trusted source due to its dual-architecture design and trusted boot process. It can effectively introduce and set up a trusted chain for the whole computer system. Active-defense capabilities obtained can ensure system security to avoid those defects in previous trusted computing.}

DDoS is an assault that targets the availability of resources and servers of a network by flooding the communication medium from distinct locations by utilizing various IoT devices, which makes it harder to detect. Thus, analyzing and defending DDoS is a protruding field of research these days. The paper gives a thorough knowledge of DDoS over IoT. In this, we have critically analysed the existing DDoS variants, IoT Security issues, the execution of DDoS attempts, along with the exploitation of IoT devices and creation of them in Botnets or zombies.

However, the interconnectivity and open nature of such systems in smart industrial facilities can also be targeted and abused by malicious actors, which reinforces the importance of cyber security. In this paper, we present a secure, decentralized, and Differentially Private (DP) Federated Learning (FL)-based IDS (2DF-IDS), for securing smart industrial facilities. The proposed 2DF-IDS comprises three building blocks, namely: a key exchange protocol (for securing the communicated weights among all peers in the system), a differentially private gradient exchange scheme (achieve improved privacy of the FL approach), and a decentralized FL approach (that mitigates the single point of failure/attack risk associated with the aggregation server in the conventional FL approach). We evaluate our proposed system through detailed experiments using a real-world IoT/IIoT dataset, and the results show that the proposed 2DF-IDS system can identify different types of cyber attacks in an Industrial IoT system with high performance. For instance, the proposed system achieves comparable performance (94.37%) with the centralized learning approach (94.37%) and outperforms the FL-based approach (93.91%) in terms of accuracy. The proposed system is also shown to improve the overall performance by 12%, 13%, and 9% in terms of F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively, under strict privacy settings when compared to other competing FL-based IDS solutions.}

	abstract = {Entrepreneurs are likely to be victims of ransomware. Previous studies have found that entrepreneurs tend to adopt few preventive measures, thereby increasing their chances of victimization. Due to a lack of research, however, not much is known about why entrepreneurs lack self-protective behaviors and how they can be encouraged to change said behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explain, by means of an extended model of the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the motivation for entrepreneurs using protective measures against ransomware in the future. The data for our study were collected thanks to a questionnaire that was answered by 1,020 Dutch entrepreneurs with up to 250 employees. Our Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that entrepreneurs are more likely to take preventive measures against ransomware if they perceive the risk of ransomware as severe (perceived severity), if they perceive their company as being vulnerable (perceived vulnerability), if they are concerned about the risks (affective response), and if they think that the people and companies around them expect them to apply preventive measures (subjective norms). However, if entrepreneurs think that they are capable of handling the risk (self-efficacy) and are convinced that their adopted preventive measures are effective (response efficacy), they are less likely to take preventive measures. Furthermore, for entrepreneurs that outsource IT security, the significant effect of perceived vulnerability and subjective norms disappears. The likelihood of entrepreneurs protecting their business against ransomware is thus influenced by a complex interplay of various motivational factors and is partly dependent on the business’ characteristics. Based on these findings, we will discuss security professionals’ prospects for increasing the cyber resilience of entrepreneurs, thus preventing cybercrime victimization.}

However, current research ignores the interference caused by data noise, thus limiting broader application and deployment in real scenarios. In this paper, the interpretable role mining problem is extended considering data noise, referencing the minimal noise role mining problem. Accordingly, an improved minimal noise role mining algorithm is proposed to optimize the reconstruction error and role interpretability. The experimental results on real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better efficiency, lower reconstruction error while ensuring the interpretability regardless of the data scale.}

	abstract = {The introduction of robust optimisation has pushed the state-of-the-art in defending against adversarial attacks. Notably, the state-of-the-art projected gradient descent (PGD) -based training method has been shown to be universally and reliably effective in defending against adversarial inputs. This robustness approach uses PGD as a reliable and universal “first-order adversary”. However, the behaviour of such optimisation has not been studied in the light of a fundamentally different class of attacks called backdoors. In this paper, we study how to inject and defend against backdoor attacks for robust models trained using PGD-based robust optimisation. We demonstrate that these models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Subsequently, we observe that backdoors are reflected in the feature representation of such models. Then, this observation is leveraged to detect such backdoor-infected models via a detection technique called AEGIS. Specifically, given a robust Deep Neural Network (DNN) that is trained using PGD-based first-order adversarial training approach, AEGIS uses feature clustering to effectively detect whether such DNNs are backdoor-infected or clean.}

	abstract = {With the advance of deep learning, it definitely has achieved the unprecedented success in the community of artificial intelligence. However, the issue of the intellectual property (IP) protection towards deep learning model is usually ignored, which largely threats the interests of the model owner. Currently, although a few schemes of model watermarking have been continuously proposed, in order to protect the specific neural network designed for detection or classification task, most of them are hardly directly applicable to generative adversarial networks (GAN). To our knowledge, the GAN model has plays more and more important role in the computer vision, such as image-to-image translation, text-to-image translation, image inpainting and etc., which remarkably improves the capability of image generation. Similarly, the malicious attackers possibly steal a trained GAN model to infringe the IP of the true model owner. To address that challenging issue, it is proposed to establish the framework of model watermarking towards GAN model. In particular, we first establish the trigger set by combining the watermark label with the verification image. Next, the watermarked generator is efficiently trained on the premise of preserving the original model performance. Finally, only relying on the correct watermark label, the synthetic watermark can be successfully triggered by the model owner for IP protection. The extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness and generalization of our designed method, which can easily be applicable to the benchmark GAN models such as WGAN-GP, ProGAN and StyleGAN2. Moreover, our proposed model watermark is robust enough to resist against the mainstream attacks, such as parameter fine-tuning and model pruning.}

	abstract = {Modern cyber security systems increasingly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to tackle the surge in security threats. However, it is well-known that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples. The state-of-the-art adversarial malware attacks focus on fooling the detector without losing functionality, but ignore the magnitude of perturbation, which can lead to attack failure in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel technique of generating adversarial malware examples, AMGmal, i.e., Adaptive Mask-Guided adversarial attack against malware detection with minimal perturbation. By prioritizing the modification of critical bytes at slack areas by saliency detection and mask guidance technique, we find an optimal balance between the evasion rate, perturbation magnitude and running time through three strategies, namely\nD\ni\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\nE\nr\no\ns\ni\no\nn\nand\nH\ne\nu\nr\ni\ns\nt\ni\nc\n. The proposed strategies can be extended to other attack methods as a generic post-processing step to minimize the perturbation. We evaluate the performance of AMGmal on the Malimg and SOREL-20M datasets and five DNN-based malware detectors. Experimental results show that the perturbation magnitude is reduced to one-third of base attack, from 3.34% to 0.90% and 2.32% to 0.73%. Compared to existing methods, AMGmal has the highest success rate of 68.09% and 64.75% when the amount of perturbation is similar, and vice versa. Furthermore, AMGmal is still effective even with defenses in place.}

We conducted laboratory experiments to study an effective way to shape end-users’ experiences to improve their detection of phishing emails. Despite technical and training-based solutions to phishing detection, malicious emails continue to reach people broadly. The end-user’s susceptibility towards phishing emails could be due to lack of experience in phishing, lack of motivation or inappropriate knowledge of phishing cues. In this paper, we study the effects of two experimental variables during a training phase: The frequency of phishing emails (low frequency-25%, medium frequency-50%, and high frequency-75%), and the type of feedback provided on the decisions made (outcome or detail feedback). The individual’s base susceptibility to phishing emails was measured in a pre-training phase in which 20% of the emails were phishing and compared to a similar post-training phase. The results show that the type of feedback provided during training affected participants’ sensitivity to detecting subsequent phishing emails. In addition, the frequency of phishing emails during training impacted their likelihood of classifying subsequent emails as phishing or legitimate. The results of these experiments show that anti-phishing training must be carefully designed taking into consideration the impact that these design choices have on human learning and decision making.}

	abstract = {The constantly evolving digital transformation imposes new requirements on our society. Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the difficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result, data-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for securing large networks. Although, in the network security domain, ML-based solutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between different contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data usually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes the stacked-unsupervised federated learning (FL) approach to generalize on a cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data). Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case of non-IID data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed FL-based NIDS results in a feasible approach for generalization between heterogeneous networks.}

	abstract = {There is an astounding growth in the adoption of machine learners (MLs) to craft intrusion detection systems (IDSs). These IDSs model the behavior of a target system during a training phase, making them able to detect attacks at runtime. Particularly, they can detect known attacks, whose information is available during training, at the cost of a very small number of false alarms, i.e., the detector suspects attacks but no attack is actually threatening the system. However, the attacks experienced at runtime will likely differ from those learned during training and thus will be unknown to the IDS. Consequently, the ability to detect unknown attacks becomes a relevant distinguishing factor for an IDS. This study aims to evaluate and quantify such ability by exercising multiple ML algorithms for IDSs. We apply 47 supervised, unsupervised, deep learning, and meta-learning algorithms in an experimental campaign embracing 11 attack datasets, and with a methodology that simulates the occurrence of unknown attacks. Detecting unknown attacks is not trivial: however, we show how unsupervised meta-learning algorithms have better detection capabilities of unknowns and may even outperform classification performance of other ML algorithms when dealing with unknown attacks.}

	abstract = {Cyber security risk assessments provide a crucial starting point towards the understanding of existing risk exposure, via which suitable mitigation strategies can be formed. Risk is viewed as a product of threat, vulnerability and impact, and equal understanding of each of these elements is vitally important. This can be a challenge in Industrial Control System (ICS) environments, where adopted technologies are typically not only bespoke, but interact directly with the physical world. To date, existing vulnerability identification has focused on traditional vulnerability categories. While this approach provides risk assessors with a baseline understanding and the ability to hypothesize about potential resulting impacts, it is rather high level, operating at a level of abstraction that would be viewed as incomplete within a traditional information system context. The work presented in this paper takes the understanding of ICS device vulnerabilities a step deeper. It offers a tool, PLC-VBS, that helps identify Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) vulnerabilities, specifically within logic used to monitor, control, and automate operational processes. PLC-VBS gives risk assessors a more coherent picture about the potential impact should the identified vulnerabilities be exploited; this applies specifically to operational process elements.}

The detection of these attacks is a challenging issue in cybersecurity, which has been addressed using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Although ML/DL can improve the detection accuracy, but they can still be evaded - ironically - through the use of ML/DL techniques in the generation of the attack traffic. In particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have proven their efficiency in mimicking legitimate data. We address the above aspects of ML/DL-based DDoS detection and anti-detection techniques. First, we propose a DDoS detection method based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capable of learning long-term dependencies. The detection scheme yields a high accuracy level in detecting DDoS attacks. Second, we tested the same technique against different types of adversarial DDoS attacks generated using GAN. The results show the inefficiency of the LSTM-based detection scheme. Finally, we demonstrate how to enhance this scheme to detect adversarial DDoS attacks. Our experimental results show that our detection model is efficient and accurate in identifying GAN-generated adversarial DDoS traffic with a detection ratio ranging between 91.75% and 100%.}

Their ability to scale and reconstitute complex functionalities into small, cohesive, and interconnected components (the microservices), and their limited use of isolation contribute to this success. Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, these very factors enlarge the attack surface and increase the security risks of today’s deployments. In this study, we performed a systematization of knowledge about the run-time security of microservices. Starting from a keyword search, we initially reviewed 807 papers available in digital libraries (e.g., Google Scholar and Scopus), which we filtered down to 48 by applying a number of selection criteria (e.g., the presence of a proof-of-concept implementation). We also considered over 30 industry tools that offer various security services for microservices. We categorized both papers and tools and highlighted areas where research is abundant, where it is lacking, and where it is misleading. We conclude that the run-time security of microservices is still in its infancy and we supplement our analyses with insights into addressing the key challenges.}

Recent studies on continuous authentication have achieved encouraging progress. However, they suffer two limitations: 1) weak capability of capturing smartphone user’s behavioral patterns from biometric data sequences with time correlation because these methods don’t consider the long-range dependencies between the behavioral biometric data sequences; 2) poor performance under a high authentication frequency. To solve these issues, we present AuthConFormer, a novel continuous authentication system based on a proposed convolutional transformer, which is suitable for running on the mobile phone CPUs.}

	abstract = {The transferability of adversarial examples under the black-box attack setting has attracted extensive attention from the community. Advanced optimization algorithms are one of the most successful ways to improve the transferability among all methods proposed recently. However, existing advanced optimization algorithms either can only slightly enhance the transferability of adversarial examples or take a large amount of computation time. We propose the future momentum and future transformation (FMFT) method to balance the transferability and computation overhead. The FMFT method incorporates two parts, future momentum (FM) and future transformation (FT). FM is inspired by the looking ahead property and updates adversarial examples with the future -th step momentum during each iteration. FT, on the other hand, makes use of the input transformations during the progress of future momentum calculation to obtain a more robust gradient and reduce computation overhead. Additionally, we propose a new input transformation called random block scaling, which divides the image into various blocks and then scales the blocks differently. Empirical evaluations on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate the superiority of our FMFT.}

	abstract = {In covert channel attacks, an adversary seeks various means to influence a tangible characteristic of a system, and then makes the systems leak information by measuring this characteristic. Covert channels are, by nature, very elusive. This makes it very difficult to identify them and defend against attacks that use these channels to leak sensitive information. Thus, they are a serious threat to the security of many systems.}
