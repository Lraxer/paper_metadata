	abstract = {Malware family classification is a significant issue with public safety and research implications that has been hindered by the high cost of expert labels. The vast majority of corpora use noisy labeling approaches that obstruct definitive quantification of results and study of deeper interactions. In order to provide the data needed to advance further, we have created the Malware Open-source Threat Intelligence Family (MOTIF) dataset. MOTIF contains 3,095 malware samples from 454 families, making it the largest and most diverse public malware dataset with ground truth family labels to date, nearly\n3\n×\nlarger than any prior expert-labeled corpus and\n36\n×\nlarger than the prior Windows malware corpus. MOTIF also comes with a mapping from malware samples to threat reports published by reputable industry sources, which both validates the labels and opens new research opportunities in connecting opaque malware samples to human-readable descriptions. This enables important evaluations that are normally infeasible due to non-standardized reporting in industry. For example, we provide aliases of the different names used to describe the same malware family, allowing us to benchmark for the first time accuracy of existing tools when names are obtained from differing sources. Evaluation results obtained using the MOTIF dataset indicate that existing tasks have significant room for improvement, with accuracy of antivirus majority voting measured at only 62.10% and the well-known AVClass tool having just 46.78% accuracy. Our findings indicate that malware family classification suffers a type of labeling noise unlike that studied in most ML literature, due to the large open set of classes that may not be known from the sample under consideration.}

	abstract = {Text-based permission requests do little to engage and inform smartphone users. Comics have recently been used with permission requests, though only in a survey of participants' perceived reactions. In this paper we study more realistic reactions to comic-based and text-based permission requests. For our study, we invited participants to engage with a prototype version of a fictitious WebApp (PetConnect); participants were only informed of our intent to study permission requests at the end of the study. While using the app, participants were exposed to four permission request types (contact, storage, location and calendar) related to different functions of our app, using one of two styles of request (comic-based or text-based). Our results showed that participants were significantly more likely to deny the comic-based requests vs the text-based requests (47% vs 33%) and that comic-based requests were perceived to be more influential in participant decision making. Both styles of request were perceived to be equally relevant to the app, as well as equally annoying. We discuss several observations for future permission request design based on our participants' explanations of their choices.}

	abstract = {Fuzzing is nowadays one of the most widely used bug hunting techniques. By automatically generating malformed inputs, fuzzing aims to trigger unwanted behavior on its target. While fuzzing research has matured considerably in the last years, the evaluation and comparison of different fuzzing proposals remain challenging, as no standard set of metrics, data, or experimental conditions exist to allow such observation. This paper aims to fill that gap by proposing a standard set of features to allow such comparison. For that end, it first reviews the existing evaluation methods in the literature and discusses all existing metrics by evaluating seven fuzzers under identical experimental conditions. After examining the obtained results, it recommends a set of practices –particularly on the metrics to be used–, to allow proper comparison between different fuzzing proposals.}

TensorFlow is one of the most popular Machine Learning (ML) platforms. Every software product is a subject to security failures which often result from software vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on threats related to 6 common types of threats in TensorFlow implementation. We identify them using Common Weakness Enumeration. We analyze more than 100 vulnerability instances. We focus on vulnerabilities’ severity, impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, as well as possible results of exploitation. We also use Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). The results show that a majority of vulnerabilities are caused by missing/incorrect checking statements, however some fixes require more advanced algorithmic changes. Static Analysis Tools tested in our study show low effectiveness in detecting known vulnerabilities in TensorFlow, but we provide some recommendations based on the obtained alerts to improve overall code quality. Further analysis of vulnerabilities helped us to understand and characterize different vulnerability types and provide a set of observations. We believe that these observations can be useful for the creators of new static analysis tools as a source of inspiration and to build the test cases. We also aim to draw the programmers’ attention to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in deep learning applications and a low effectiveness of automatic tools to find software vulnerabilities in such products.}

	abstract = {Cyber threat modeling is an analytical process that is used for identifying the potential threats against a system and supporting the selection of security requirements in the early stages of the system development life cycle. Thus, threat modeling is a vital instrument for the realization of the secure-by-design principle. Despite being a well-known practice in software development projects, its adaptation to cyber-physical systems still requires systematic elaboration. The complex interactions between cyber and physical spaces and their reflection on the cyber threat landscape constitute a significant challenge for the system development teams. This study proposes a detailed methodology to apply STRIDE to cyber-physical systems and demonstrates its applicability in a case study of a microgrid system. Our methodology provides a systematic threat elicitation procedure based on an attack taxonomy that was created for this research. This paper also shows how assets could be identified, data flow diagrams formed, trust boundaries determined, and threats prioritized, in the case of a cyber-physical system.}

The variety of system components presents an extensive attack surface that can be exploited.

This paper presents the first taxonomic representation of VR security challenges. By systemically classifying existing VR cyber threats against existing defences in a single comparative matrix, we aim to help researchers from different backgrounds to identify key focus areas where further research would be most beneficial.}

We propose an unsupervised attack detector for DNN classifiers based on class-conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We model the distribution of clean data conditioned on the predicted class label by an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN). Given a test sample and its predicted class, three detection statistics are calculated based on the AC-GAN generator and discriminator. Experiments on image classification datasets under various TTE attacks show that our method outperforms previous detection methods. We also investigate the effectiveness of anomaly detection using different DNN layers (input features or internal-layer features) and demonstrate, as one might expect, that anomalies are harder to detect using features closer to the DNN’s output layer. Finally, our approach is also investigated for more general out-of-distribution detection.}

	abstract = {The surge in cyber-attacks has driven demand for robust Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to protect underlying data and sustain availability of network services. Detecting and classifying multiple type of attacks requires robust machine learning approaches that can analyze network traffic and take appropriate measures. Traffic data usually consists of redundant, irrelevant, and noisy information, which could have a negative influence on the model performance. In this paper, we propose an improved bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm for efficient detection and classification of multi-stage attacks. The proposed model uses a one-versus-all sub-model based technique to deal with the multi-class classification problem. Each sub-model employs an enhanced Harris Hawk optimization with extreme learning machine (ELM) as the base classifier. This hierarchy produces the best subset of features per attack, along with optimized ELMs weights, which can improve the detection rate significantly. The proposed technique was tested against various meta-heuristic algorithms and multi-class classifiers using the UNSWNB-15 dataset. In seven different types of attacks, experimental results outperformed other existing methods in terms of decreasing the crossover-error rate and obtaining the best values for the G-mean measure.}

Starting from an externally reachable host, these attacks compromise a chain of network hosts until they reach their targets. Each compromised host could provide attackers access to new systems and network zones, thus enabling them to intrude deeper into the network.

	abstract = {Analysts who work in a Security Operations Centre (SOC) play an essential role in supporting businesses to protect their computer networks against cyber attacks. To manage analysts efficiently and effectively, SOC managers and stakeholders use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate their performance. However, existing literature suggests a lack of a systematic approach for assessing analysts’ performance. Even though cyber security researchers advocate for research into this area, little effort has been made by researchers to address this gap. Drawing on the results of a Delphi panel with industry experts and the principles of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), this paper interrogates the problem and proposes a systematic weighted approach for measuring the performance of an analyst in a SOC. The proposed method, referred to as a SOC Analyst Assessment Method (SOC-AAM), was evaluated in two SOCs as a part of an experimental case study. The results of the empirical evaluation show that the SOC-AAM enables SOC managers and stakeholders to quantify and assess analysts’ performance in a systematic manner. The SOC-AAM also provides a novel guideline for assessing the quality of incident analysis and the quality of incident reports. This study will be of interest to practitioners and cyber security researchers seeking to understand the operations of a SOC analyst.}

	abstract = {Organizations need to consider different managerial approaches to motivate security compliance behavior as more employees work outside of the office. This study examines two approaches for motivating security compliance behaviors in a changing work environment. We examine protection motivation and stewardship-based strategic approaches to determine their effectiveness towards influencing information security behaviors. Independently, each approach has received demonstrable evidence of contributing to organizational behaviors. However, as the nature of work changes (e.g., hoteling, traveling, working from home), it also changes the security risk landscape for organizations, rendering the effectiveness of previous security controls debatable. This study contends there is value to management in integrating both protection motivation and stewardship approaches in this context. A research model is developed that integrates both approaches; protection motivation and stewardship concepts. We find that constructs consistent with protection motivation theory are more likely to explain decreases in security policy violations than stewardship theory. Further, by combining protection motivation and stewardship perspectives, this study's results supplement our understanding of security policy violations in a changing work environment. We show that the two together account for 51 percent of the variance, and thus both have value. Our findings suggest that a PMT-based strategy is a stronger approach for influencing compliance behavior. Therefore, it is important for organizations to continue focusing their efforts on threat communications as well as enhancing employees’ abilities to respond. However, we also show that organizations should build a sense of belonging with their employees such that their employees become stewards of the organization's resources.}

	abstract = {Previous studies on applying the framing effects to cybersecurity nudges have shown that slight wording adjustments can predictably alter users’ security and privacy preferences. However, the applications mostly focus on the Reference-dependent preference, whereas limited information is available about another important embodiment, the Pseudo-certainty effect. In addition, it is also suggested that the framing effects are sensitive to the context, whereas known contributing contextual factors are limited. To solve the problems, we examine framing effects in cybersecurity in depth by designing two framing nudges based on the Pseudo-certainty effect and exploring their interactions with a contextual factor, timing. A between-subjects field experiment with 182 participants was conducted on a self-developed game to investigate the effectiveness of the framing nudges and timing in improving online game security. The participants were prompted to decide whether to set a game password. The results indicate that the framing of security warnings significantly affects users’ security decisions and behaviors, although their effects are moderated by the timing at which the warnings are presented. Finally, we conclude with practical security warning design implications.}

We provide a modelling framework that assesses the risk of private health data breaches focusing on the data sets compiled by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We show that the counting process of the data-breach incidents is adequately modelled by the Markov-modulated non-homogeneous Poisson process (MMNPP) whilst the logarithm of the breach sizes is well-captured by the generalised Pareto distribution. The cyber insurance premium per institution and two risk measures Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Average VaR are obtained. The computed results indicate that cyber insurance policies with longer maturity are more cost effective. A comprehensive analysis, parameter estimation and implementation of the MMNPP to model cyber risks are underscored as the principal contributions of this research.

	abstract = {There has been ever-growing use of Internet and progress within many communication channels such as social media and this escalates the need for rapid and low source demanding phishing detection mechanisms. In this very study, we propose a new deep neural model for phishing URL identification so-called GramBeddings introducing some distinguishing novelties by (1) proposing the use of n-gram embeddings, computed on the fly, requiring no pre-training stage, (2) removing the necessity of word and sub-word level information, (3) providing a smart and efficient n-gram selection pipeline, and benefiting from attention mechanism. Other than that, we share a publicly available, large-scale and novel dataset\n2\nincluding 800K real-world phishing and legitimate URLs. Our scheme suggests an adjustable and automated n-gram selection and filtering mechanism along with a new neural network architecture concatenating four-channel information flow through cascading CNN, LSTM, and attention layers. With that, discriminative multi-level character patterns can be discovered without any hand-crafted operation and are enabled to contribute to prediction. As a result, the proposed system provides the following features in the problem domain: (i) real-time, end-to-end and high performance inference, (ii) language-agnostic prediction, and (iii) removal of the necessity of any third-party service or hand-crafted feature. These experiments show that our approach outperforms the other models in the literature with an accuracy of 98.27%. Moreover, the comparative study conducted with several datasets clearly verifies the superiority of our model in all tests. We also examine the robustness of our model against a real-world adversarial attack and discuss the methods of overcoming such an attack. Our codebase\n3\nis shared with the community to be used for benchmarking purposes in the future.}

	abstract = {Ultra-Dense Network (UDN) as one of the key technologies of 5G aims to increase the capacity per area of the current 4G network by 1,000-fold through the deployment of dense Small Base Stations (SBSs). To reduce the traffic on backhaul links, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) as a promising network architecture has been applied to UDN recently. However, its in-network caching mechanism is subject to Cache Pollution Attack (CPA), where attackers aim to occupy limited caching space with unpopular contents. Existing studies focusing on the static networks cannot be directly used in dynamic UDN scenarios. In this paper, we propose a detection and defense scheme of CPA based on federated learning, where CPA is determined by the cooperation of multiple SBSs. First, each SBS can build or join a cluster based on the metrics of distance similarity and load similarity. Then, each cluster head as the working node trains the local classifier to detect CPA based on the statistics within the cluster. The macro base station aggregates all the local models to generate an improved global classifier for all the SBSs. In our scheme, federated learning as a special case of distributed machine learning allows each cluster head to independently train the local data even when it is non-i.i.d. or unbalanced. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms in terms of detection ratio, cache hit ratio, access delay, and false alarm ratio compared with other state-of-the-art schemes.}

	abstract = {The concept of Federated Learning (FL), which is vital to the development of machine learning, has emerged as a convergence of machine learning, information, and communication technology. However, general FL settings cannot meet requirements in decentralized environments, especially in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, where a fully connected central server is unavailable due to limited communication ranges. In this paper, to satisfy the requirements of security, privacy preservation, and robustness in the context of FL in P2P networks, we propose a decentralized global model training protocol, named PPT. Particularly, PPT aggregates local model update parameters in a single-hop manner and uses the symmetric cryptosystem to ensure secure communications between network nodes where an enhanced Eschenauer-Gligor (E-G) scheme is proposed for secure key distribution. Further, PPT generates random noise for privacy preservation without reducing the model accuracy since the noise is eliminated ultimately. PPT also adopts game theory to resist collusion attacks. In addition, PPT has elaborate designs in terms of communication efficiency and dropout-robustness. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that PPT can resist various security threats and preserve user privacy. Ingenious experiments on Trec05, Trec06p, Trec07, and SMS Spam Collection v.1 confirm the 20\n×\nand 12\n×\nimprovement of computation efficiency that PPT achieves compared to Google’s Secure Aggregation and Local Differential Privacy (LDP)-based FL methods. More importantly, the global model trained by PPT is better than that trained by LDP-based FL methods in terms of prediction performance (about 14% and 1% improvement in convergence rate and accuracy).}

	abstract = {Clustering distributed star social graphs, which can offer useful insights into the structure of the data, has attracted considerable attention. Each star social graph often contains sensitive personal information. Unrestricted collection and analysis of such information by curators may reveal privacy. Local differential privacy (LDP), as a privacy model un-requiring any trusted third party, has been widely utilized in distributed privacy-preserving clustering. Most existing solutions adopt the edge-LDP model, compromising privacy strength for high utility. To enhance privacy, we turn to node-LDP and design a two-stage privacy-preserving graph clustering framework, achieving more robust privacy strength while keeping a higher clustering quality. Concretely, in the first stage, we design a node aggregation approach based on the silhouette coefficient measurement model and combine some connection information to form initial clusters. Besides, a novel cluster-based perturbation mechanism is developed to improve data statistics accuracy by leveraging an adaptive noise injecting method. The second stage develops a feedback loop strategy between clients and the curator. The curator iteratively optimizes the perturbation mechanism and node aggregation method based on the feedback information to improve the clustering quality further. Theoretical analysis and experimentation on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain desirable clustering results while satisfying node-LDP.}

	abstract = {Information Systems (IS) research on managerial response to cybersecurity breaches has largely focused on externally oriented actions such as customer redressal and crisis response. Within the firm itself, a breach may be a symptom of systematic problems, and a narrow, siloed focus on only fixing immediate issues through technical fixes and controls might preclude other managerial actions to ensure future cybersecurity. Towards this end, Information Security Risk Assessments (ISRA) can help surface other vulnerabilities following a breach. While the role of governance in such exercises is emphasized in standards, it is undertheorized in IS research and lacks empirical evidence. We draw on the attention-based view to theorize that the principles of focus of attention, structural distribution of attention, and situated attention can lead to the top management team (TMT) according greater attention to cybersecurity following relatively high breach costs. Using firm level data, we find that high breach costs result in greater TMT attention to cybersecurity, while also making it more likely that firms will carry out an ISRA. Moreover, TMT attention to cybersecurity partially mediates the relation between breach costs and the decision to carry out an ISRA. We theorize that this is because the TMT is best positioned to oversee resource allocation, consider business implications, and centrally orchestrate an ISRA. Our findings stress the need for the cybersecurity function to work with the TMT in managing breach response.}

In modern networks, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) acts as a significant function for network security. The IDS can be either anomaly or signature-based behavior detection. Recently, several detection approaches have been proposed by researchers to find network intrusions. In this paper, a deep learning approach to intrusion detection using the Exponential Shuffled Shepherded Optimization Algorithm (ExpSSOA) is proposed. The proposed ExpSSOA combines the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) and the shuffled shepherded optimization algorithm (SSOA). The proposed ExpSSOA-based Deep Maxout network for intrusion detection is examined using the MQTT-IOT-IDS2020 dataset and the Apache Web Server dataset. According to the experimental results using the Apache webserver dataset, the suggested ExpSSOA-Deep maxout network offers a better result with an accuracy of 0.883, an F-measure of 0.8768, a precision of 0.8746, and a recall of 0.8564.}

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies improve the dependability and resilience of networks by enabling administrators to spawn and scale-up traffic management and security services in response to dynamic network conditions. However, in practice, they often suffer from poor performance and require complex configurations because network packets must be ‘detoured’ to each virtualized security service, which expends bandwidth and increases network propagation delay. To address these challenges, we propose a new SDN-based data plane architecture, called DPX (Data Plane eXtension), that natively supports in-network security services. The DPX action model reduces redundant processing caused by frequent packet parsing and provides administrators with a simplified (and less error-prone) method for configuring security services into the network. DPX also increases the efficiency of enforcing complex security policies by introducing a novel technique called action clustering, which aggregates security actions from multiple flows into a small number of synthetic rules. Also, the application of action clustering (i.e., advanced and global) provides more diverse policies and network-wide detection. We present an implementation of DPX in hardware using NetFPGA-SUME and in software using Open vSwitch. We evaluate the performance of the DPX prototype and the efficacy of its flow-table simplifications against a range of complex network policies exposed to line rates of 10 Gbps.}

Our analysis explains in what ways the ETSI Provisions are a positive evolution of the UK DCMS Guidelines. We also suggest aspects of security advice warranting special attention by those offering security advice. Such parties may find the systematic analysis method, which categorizes advice into predefined categories, to be of general interest beyond IoT itself.}

In recent years, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to obtain users’ privacy data have been one of the main web attack methods of network hackers. Traditional antivirus software cannot identify such cross-site scripting attacks. To identify cross-site scripting attacks quickly and accurately, we proposed a cross-site scripting detection model (C-BLA) with two-channel multi-scale feature fusion embedded in a self-attention mechanism. The model first maps cross-site scripting payloads into spatial vectors by data preprocessing using Word2Vec. Then the two-channel network performs feature extraction on the data. Channel I: extract local features of cross-site scripting payloads at different scales by designing parallel one-dimensional convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes; Channel II: extract semantic information of cross-site scripting payloads from two directions of positive and negative order using a bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory network, and then embed the self-attention mechanism to strengthen the semantic information features. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves a precision rate of 99.8\n%\nand a recall rate of 99.1\n%\nfor cross-site scripting detection, which is a certain improvement in detection rate compared with a single deep learning model and traditional machine learning methods. The two-channel feature fusion of this model better solves the cross-site scripting detection problem.}

	abstract = {Stress plays a critical role in information security policy (ISP) compliance behavior. Since there are multiple sources of stress, the current literature does not provide a consistent view of the association between stress and ISP compliance behavior. Understanding the significance of the association between stress and ISP compliance behavior is valuable for managers, especially in managing the tradeoff between stress and ISP compliance behavior among individuals. It is also important to understand why there has been so much inconsistency in past studies. Thus, we attempted a meta-analysis to provide a generalized interpretation of the association between stress and ISP non-compliance behavior. A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis are conducted to examine the underlying contradiction and aggregate the findings of relevant studies. The results of this meta-analysis confirmed a weak positive correlation between stress and ISP non-compliance behavior. Demographic characteristics like age, country, and the category of the respondents (employee vs non-employee) are significant predictors of the association between stress and ISP non-compliance behavior. The meta-analysis presented here is also pertinent to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which forced organizations to engage with their employees in new working conditions, putting employees under more stress and strain.}

	abstract = {Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is one of the most important approaches for intelligent vehicles to communicate under complex road conditions. However, as a VANET is working under wireless and complex conditions, it is under the threat of various malicious attacks. One efficient solution to counter those attacks is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which can detect intrusions to the VANET based on the statistical machine learning method. However, most IDS solutions have a problem that they can only detect the attacks which have already known when the IDS is designed/trained. For unknown attacks, most IDSs become inefficient. A blockchain-based Lifetime Learning IDS (LL-IDS) framework has been designed to address this problem. It applies a blockchain to store uncertain data that an IDS cannot decide and is highly likely to be a new type of attacks. With the help of traditional security agencies such as universities, these uncertain data can be labelled to train the IDS model. The incremental learning models are shown to have a great potential in this scenario. In this paper, we introduces a novel IDS named as incremental IDS based on LL-IDS. Numerical experiments show that the computational time consumption and web payload could be decreased by applying the ILL-IDS to a public VANET dataset.}

	abstract = {The proposal of federated learning solves problems of data silos and privacy protection in the field of artificial intelligence. However, privacy attacks can infer or reconstruct sensitive information from the submitted gradient, which causes users’ privacy leakage in federated learning. Secure aggregation (SecAgg) protocol can protect users’ privacy while completing federated learning tasks, but it incurs significant communication overhead and wall clock training time on large-scale model training task. Thus, it is difficult to apply SecAgg in bandwidth-limited federated applications. Recently, Rand-k sparsification with secure aggregation (Rand-k SparseSecAgg) was proposed to optimize SecAgg protocol, while its optimization of communication overhead and training time is limited. In this paper, we replace Rand-k sparsification with Top-k sparsification, and design a Top-k sparsification with secure aggregation (Top-k SparseSecAgg) protocol for privacy-preserving federated learning to further reduce communication overhead and wall clock training time. In addition, we optimize the proposed protocol by assigning clients to different groups in the logical layer, which reduces the upper limit of compression ratio and practical communication overhead in Top-k SparseSecAgg. Experiments demonstrate that Top-k SparseSecAgg can reduce communication overhead by\n6.25\n×\nas compared to SecAgg,\n3.78\n×\nas compared to Rand-k SparseSecAgg, and reduce wall clock training time\n1.43\n×\nas compared to SecAgg and\n1.13\n×\nas compared to Rand-k SparseSecAgg. Thus, our protocol is more suitable in bandwidth-limited federated applications to protect privacy and complete learning task.}

Tracking activities and fitness levels has become an intrinsic part of many people’s lives. While the deep insight it provides into an individual’s health has multiple benefits, this lifestyle choice comes with the risk of endangering the user’s privacy. Data from these devices has previously been proven capable to identify a person, much like a fingerprint. Most existing privacy attacks rely on fine-grained multi-sensor data. Through our observations we can demonstrate that pedometer data, collected per default by iPhones, even when aggregated to a 15-minute resolution, can be used to identify a user with good precision if sufficient training data is used to create the fingerprints. We also demonstrate that the participant’s data has such a strong individual signal that they can be clustered with high accuracy if they are divided into days.}

	abstract = {Assessing the exploitability of vulnerabilities is critical for defenders. But the vulnerability-triggering samples available for analysts often do not trigger exploitable states, making it hard to accurately assess whether the underlying vulnerabilities are exploitable. Several customized fuzzing solutions have been proposed to address this problem, by searching for new vulnerability-triggering test cases that can enter exploitable program states. However, such solutions are inefficient and in general take an overwhelmingly long time to find exploitable states, due to the large number of program paths to explore and complicated path constraints to satisfy. In this paper, we present a new automated solution Tunter to assess the exploitability of vulnerabilities. It could explore exploitable program states and generate working exploits, even if only non-exploitable vulnerability-triggering samples are given. It adopts two novel techniques: (1) a taint-guided exploration procedure to explore candidate exploitable states; and (2) a pruning mechanism to prune unwanted states for exploitation to alleviate the state explosion issue faced by symbolic execution. We have implemented a prototype of Tunter and evaluated it on 14 capture-the-flag (CTF) programs and two real-world applications. The experimental results demonstrate that it has significant performance than state-of-the-art solution Revery (Wang et al., 2018). Specifically, it finds exploitable states for these 16 programs with a 75% recall and an 88.9% precision, and eventually generates working exploits for 11 out of these 16 programs. Moreover, Tunter is 41.02 times faster than Revery.}

	abstract = {As in other cybersecurity areas, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a promising solution to detect Android malware. In this sense, many proposals employing a variety of algorithms and feature sets have been presented to date, often reporting impresive detection performances. However, the lack of reproducibility and the absence of a standard evaluation framework make these proposals difficult to compare. In this paper, we perform an analysis of 10 influential research works on Android malware detection using a common evaluation framework. We have identified five factors that, if not taken into account when creating datasets and designing detectors, significantly affect the trained ML models and their performances. In particular, we analyze the effect of (1) the presence of duplicated samples, (2) label (goodware/greyware/malware) attribution, (3) class imbalance, (4) the presence of apps that use evasion techniques and, (5) the evolution of apps. Based on this extensive experimentation, we conclude that the studied ML-based detectors have been evaluated optimistically, which justifies the good published results. Our findings also highlight that it is imperative to generate realistic experimental scenarios, taking into account the aforementioned factors, to foster the rise of better ML-based Android malware detection solutions.}

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) offer a crucial layer of defense that allows organizations to detect cyberattacks on their web servers. Academic research overwhelmingly suggests using anomaly detection techniques to improve the performance of these defensive systems. However, analyzing and comparing the wide range of solutions in the scientific literature is challenging since they are typically presented as isolated (unrelated) contributions, and their results cannot be generalized. We believe that this impairs the industry’s adoption of academic results and the advancement of research in this field. This paper aims to shed light on the literature on anomaly-based detection of attacks that use HTTP request messages. We define a novel framework for anomaly detection based on six data processing steps grouped into two sequential phases: preprocessing and classification. Based on this framework, we provide a taxonomy and critical review of the techniques surveyed, emphasizing their limitations and applicability. Future approaches should take advantage of the syntax and semantics of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), be scalable, and address their obsolescence. These aspects are frequently overlooked in the literature and pose a significant challenge in the current era of web services. For better comparability, authors should use adequate public datasets, follow a thorough methodology, and use appropriate metrics that fully show the pros and cons of the approach.}

While there is no theoretical guarantee that deep learning (DL)-based solutions perform better than classic machine learning (ML)-based ones, DL-based models have become the common default. This paper compares well-known DL-based and ML-based models and shows that in the case of malicious traffic classification, state-of-the-art DL-based solutions do not necessarily outperform the classical ML-based ones. We exemplify this finding using two well-known datasets for a varied set of tasks, such as: malware detection, malware family classification, detection of zero-day attacks, and classification of an iteratively growing dataset. Note that, it is not feasible to evaluate all possible models to make a concrete statement, thus the above finding is not a recommendation to avoid DL-based models, but rather an empirical finding that in some cases, there are more simplistic solutions, that may perform even better.}

To achieve this goal, in DoH protocol, DNS traffic between a DNS client and its local DNS resolver is channeled through an encrypted HTTPS tunnel. However, as shown in previous studies, adversaries can still infer users’ web browsing activities from encrypted DoH traffic through machine-learning-based traffic analysis (TA) attacks. These attacks rely on unencryptable features in the DNS footprint of a website, including query/response lengths and counts and delays between subsequent queries (timing), to identify which website is being visited. To defend against such TA attacks, existing DoH clients and resolvers pad DNS queries and responses with null bytes to specific block sizes before encrypting them, as recommended in RFC 8467. However, as shown by prior research and our current work, this padding alone is not effective in defeating TA attacks, and even with this padding, attackers can still achieve over 95% accuracy.}

Although this way can reduce storage and maintenance costs, data owners lose the control and possession of the data, which will result in some additional security issues, such as data corruption. It means that cloud server providers may delete or tamper with the infrequently used data to economize on storage space. Therefore, it is essential to provide an audit service to verify integrity of data stored on the cloud. Most of the existing audit schemes are based on the difficult problems of large integer decomposition and discrete logarithms. With the development of quantum computers, these schemes will face the security threat, because quantum computers can easily solve these difficult problems. In short, it is essential to design a data audit scheme that is resistant to quantum attacks. Therefore, we design a novel data audit scheme to achieve post-quantum security, in which the ring signature based on the problem of learning with errors is employed. In addition, two data possession games are designed to prove the security of the DIVRS. Experiment results show that the communication and computing costs are acceptable, and the time spent in each phase of the DIVRS is shorter than that of the comparison schemes.}

	abstract = {Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) are highly dependent on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) for process monitoring and control. Such SCADA systems are known to communicate using various insecure protocols such as Modbus, DNP3, and Open Platform Communication (OPC) Data Access standards (providing access to real-time automation data), which are vulnerable to a range of attacks. This leads to increased cyber risks faced in critical infrastructures, especially in the Oil and Gas sector. One of the most popular and critical attacks deployed against such infrastructure is Denial of Service (DoS), as it can have severe consequences that range from financial loss to loss of life. Such attacks can disrupt the ability of an operator to control hazardous operations leading to potentially unsafe scenarios. A novel Field Flooding attack is described which takes advantage of the packet memory structure of the Modbus protocol to perform a DoS attack. This attack can cause overflowing of the memory bank allocated in the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) for Modbus operations. The attack is deployed and evaluated on a real industrial testbed and its impact against the Mitre ATT&CK framework is assessed, in order to identify which tactics an adversary could use to compromise the system. A novel mechanism that utilises supervised machine learning to detect this attack in industrial control system networks is also described. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism, using the XGBoost algorithm, can identify this attack with 99% accuracy.}

The ensuing privacy issues make privacy protection the focus of our attention. In this paper, we propose a secure Naive Bayes classification scheme with better efficiency and accuracy than existing methods. The operations involved in Naive Bayes classification have multiplication, division, comparison, etc., and are accurately implemented by our secret-sharing protocols. Besides, we propose a secure count protocol to support count operation in Naive Bayes classification. The data between cloud servers are properly packaged to reduce communication rounds. We carefully analyze the accuracy and efficiency of our scheme. The experimental results show that our scheme has no accuracy loss and our scheme is more efficient than existing schemes without accuracy loss.}

	abstract = {Fake engagement services allow users of online social media and other web platforms to illegitimately increase their online reach and boost their perceived popularity. Driven by socio-economic and even political motivations, the demand for fake engagement services has increased in the last years, which has incentivized the rise of a vast underground market and support infrastructure. Prior research in this area has been limited to the study of the infrastructure used to provide these services (e.g., botnets) and to the development of algorithms to detect and remove fake activity in online targeted platforms. Yet, the platforms in which these services are sold (known as panels) and the underground markets offering these services have not received much research attention. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper studies Social Media Management (SMM) panels, i.e., reselling platforms—often found in underground forums—in which a large variety of fake engagement services are offered. By daily crawling 86 representative SMM panels for 4 months, we harvest a dataset with 2.8 M forum entries grouped into 61k different services. This dataset allows us to build a detailed catalog of the services for sale, the platforms they target, and to derive new insights on fake social engagement services and its market. We then perform an economic analysis of fake engagement services and their trading activities by automatically analyzing 7k threads in underground forums. Our analysis reveals a broad range of offered services and levels of customization, where buyers can acquire fake engagement services by selecting features such as the quality of the service, the speed of delivery, the country of origin, and even personal attributes of the fake account (e.g., gender). The price analysis also yields interesting empirical results, showing significant disparities between prices of the same product across different markets. These observations suggest that the market is still undeveloped and sellers do not know the real market value of the services that they offer, leading them to underprice or overprice their services.}

	abstract = {The widespread use of web applications has also made them more vulnerable to hackers, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of application and personal privacy data. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are one of the most significant threats to web applications. Attackers can inject scripts to control the victim’s browser to send data or execute commands, leading to the theft of privacy or the hijacking of login tokens. Therefore, we proposed a multi-feature fusion-based neural network vulnerability detection model for detecting XSS vulnerabilities in the JavaScript source code of websites (We termed our implementation of this approach MFXSS). We combine abstract syntax tree (AST) and code control flow graph (CFG) to convert the generalized sample data into graph structure and code string structure. Then, through the graph convolutional neural network, weighted aggregation, and the bidirectional recurrent neural network, the logical call features and the context execution relationship features of the source code are extracted and fused respectively. Finally, the fused feature vectors are used to detect and predict XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript. In the experiment, we designed multiple control experiments to verify that the model construction is optimal, and the accuracy rates in the standard and variant datasets are 0.997 and 0.986. Moreover, in comparing similar detection schemes, MFXSS also performs better. Applying the model to an actual web environment, we successfully detected the presence of XSS vulnerabilities in websites.}

	abstract = {False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) detection can prevent the tampering of important data in the smart grid. This is of great significance to the operation and control of modern power systems. Since the existing FDIA detection methods are limited by the sequential input of data in Euclidean space, they cannot accurately describe the compelling correlation between data components. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel FDIA localization detection method based on graph data modeling and graph deep learning. The proposed approach tries to disaggregate the primary data into graph structured data with graph topological relationships based on graph theory, then designs specialized networks for data with different graph topologies. Moreover, the designed multi-graph mechanism and temporal correlation layer can better fully mine the correlation features between data components, with its attribute characteristics, to construct deep learning on the specific graph topology for FDIA detection. Extensive simulation experiments and visualization show that the proposed scheme is more effective than the conventional detection model, and its overall accuracy in 14-bus, 118-bus and 300-bus systems is 98.3%, 96.4% and 95.8%. It also proves that this scheme has high robustness and generalization ability in different scenarios.}
