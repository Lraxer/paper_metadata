	abstract = {Personal big data can greatly promote social management, business applications, and personal services, and bring certain economic benefits to users. The difficulty with personal big data security and privacy protection lies in realizing the maximization of the value of personal big data and in striking a balance between data privacy protection and sharing on the premise of satisfying personal big data security and privacy protection. Thus, in this paper, we propose a personal big data pricing method based on differential privacy (PMDP). We design two different mechanisms of positive and reverse pricing to reasonbly price personal big data. We perform aggregate statistics on an open dataset and extensively evaluated its performance. The experimental results show that PMDP can provide reasonable pricing for personal big data and fair compensation to data owners, ensuring an arbitrage-free condition and finding a balance between privacy protection and data utility.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the question of how to perform an efficient side-channel analysis (SCA) of real-world crypto products with proprietary side-channel countermeasures. Concretely, answering this question requires a suitable selection of side-channel analysis methods and various steps to instantiate it to break various side-channel countermeasures. We take the analysis of a protected prototype system as an example, to discuss how to efficiently use traditional SCA methods and Deep-Learning based SCA methods in the context of analyzing current side-channel countermeasures. Then, we extend the analysis research on a real-world commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 4G Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) card, showing how to reverse-engineer the embedded side-channel countermeasures by using side-channel information only. The experiment results show that the secret key and other operator-related parameters can be fully recovered without prior knowledge of side-channel countermeasures. This research allows us to provide a living case study of the physical security analysis of real-world crypto products, which might be worthy of more in-depth investigations.}

Such detectors are considered as physics unaware. In this paper, we present the outcome of a series of experiments designed to explore the significance of design knowledge in improving the detection effectiveness of ML-based anomaly detectors. The experiments were conducted on an operational Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) plant by launching several coordinated attacks. Based on the observations we argue that detectors that use physics-informed ML algorithms can detect, and explain to plant operators, a wider range of anomalies when compared against their physics-unaware counterparts.}

	abstract = {Cybersecurity threat and incident managers in large organizations, especially in the financial sector, are confronted more and more with an increase in volume and complexity of threats and incidents. At the same time, these managers have to deal with many internal processes and criteria, in addition to requirements from external parties, such as regulators that pose an additional challenge to handling threats and incidents. Little research has been carried out to understand to what extent decision support can aid these professionals in managing threats and incidents. The purpose of this research was to develop decision support for cybersecurity threat and incident managers in the financial sector. To this end, we carried out a cognitive task analysis and the first two phases of a cognitive work analysis, based on two rounds of in-depth interviews with ten professionals from three financial institutions. Our results show that decision support should address the problem of balancing the bigger picture with details. That is, being able to simultaneously keep the broader operational context in mind as well as adequately investigating, containing and remediating a cyberattack. In close consultation with the three financial institutions involved, we developed a critical-thinking memory aid that follows typical incident response process steps, but adds big picture elements and critical thinking steps. This should make cybersecurity threat and incident managers more aware of the broader operational implications of threats and incidents while keeping a critical mindset. Although a summative evaluation was beyond the scope of the present research, we conducted iterative formative evaluations of the memory aid that show its potential.}

MANET nodes provide the transmission capability to receive, transmit and route traffic from a sender node to the destination node. In this paper, we design an artificial immune system-based security method for MANET by simulating the mechanism of the human immune system. This paper presents a new bio inspired algorithm namely Artificial Immune System Based Algorithm (AISBA) to select selfish nodes in MANET, which utilizes principles of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) that in turn mimics the strategy of the Human Immune System. Unlike Combined Immune Theories Algorithm, AISBA does not utilize a learning stage. In AISBA two different Trust models are developed as well to distinguish between a genuine node as well as a selfish node. An average detection rate of\n93.41\n%\nwas achieved with this bio inspired approach. The Simulation results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to the well known secured AODV (SAODV) protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio (about\n87\n%\nof packet delivery ratio is achieved compared to about\n37\n%\nin the case of SAODV) and about\n94\n%\nof detection rate for the proposed scheme compared to\n86\n%\nfor SAODV in the presence of misbehaved nodes. The statistical analysis of the false positive probability is also conducted to assess the efficiency of the obtained results, showing promising results with respect to the effect of weight and trust on threshold.}

It is usually deployed in unattended areas where sensor nodes can easily be infiltrated by attackers who can affect the detection results by injecting false data. This paper proposes a malicious-node identification method based on correlation theory that prevents fault data injection attacks. First, anomalies among similar types of sensor data are detected based on time correlation. Second, malicious nodes are identified based on spatial correlation. Third, the identified malicious nodes are verified based on event correlation. The experimental results and their comparison with those of existing methods show that the proposed scheme has better recall with lower false-positive and false-negative rates than those of the traditional fuzzy reputation model and weighted-trust-based methods.}

	abstract = {Routing protocols play an important role in the communication and information distribution within an Internet of Things (IoT) system. RPL is one such popular routing protocol for IoT devices and systems. However, security in RPL is an afterthought, and it does not meet the demands of today’s complex cyberthreat landscape. Focusing on sybil attack detection in RPL-based IoT, we first propose a lightweight Bloom filter and physical unclonable function (PUF) based sybil attack detection mechanism (hereafter referred to as liteSAD). Our approach is designed to minimize memory cost as well as detection latency, without affecting the detection accuracy. Specifically, in liteSAD, Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root generates a Bloom filter array through hashing each legitimate node’s identifier and PUF response, and distributes it through a new packet named BF-DAO. Upon receiving the BF-DAO packet, each legitimate node retrieves the Bloom filter array, updates its local copy, and employs it to detect sybil attack. We also propose a probabilistic DIO reply mechanism (i.e., proDIO) to reduce the number of broadcasted DIO packets in response to attack DIS packets. We investigate the setting of Bloom filter parameters that minimize the probability of false positive and time complexity while meeting the requirement of memory constraints in IoT devices. We also evaluate the performance of our mechanism liteSAD+proDIO through extensive simulation experiments, where the results demonstrate that liteSAD+proDIO can provide better performance in terms of detection rate, detection latency, miss detection rate, DIO Trickle timer, number of broadcasted DIO packets, and energy consumption. In summary, our major contributions are twofold: (i) the comprehensive analysis of RPL routing protocol, Trickle algorithm, and the impact of sybil attack; and (ii) the proposal of lightweight Bloom filter and PUF based sybil attack detection mechanism.}

	abstract = {As people’s demand for personal privacy and data security becomes a priority, encrypted traffic has become mainstream in the cyber world. However, traffic encryption is also shielding malicious and illegal traffic introduced by adversaries, from being detected. This is especially so in the post-COVID-19 environment where malicious traffic encryption is growing rapidly. Common security solutions that rely on plain payload content analysis such as deep packet inspection are rendered useless. Thus, machine learning based approaches have become an important direction for encrypted malicious traffic detection. In this paper, we formulate a universal framework of machine learning based encrypted malicious traffic detection techniques and provided a systematic review. Furthermore, current research adopts different datasets to train their models due to the lack of well-recognized datasets and feature sets. As a result, their model performance cannot be compared and analyzed reliably. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse, process and combine datasets from 5 different sources to generate a comprehensive and fair dataset to aid future research in this field. On this basis, we also implement and compare 10 encrypted malicious traffic detection algorithms. We then discuss challenges and propose future directions of research.}

However, it has been shown that machine learning models, in partidular deep neural networks, lack robustness against crafted inputs (adversarial examples). In this work, we have investigated the vulnerability of a state-of-the-art shallow convolutional neural network malware classifier against the deat code insertion technique. We propose a general framework powered by a Double Q-network to induce misclassification over malware families. The framework trains an agent through a convolutional neural network to select the optimal positions in a code sequence to insert dead code instructions so that the machine learning classifier mislabels the resulting executable. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly drops the classification accuracy of the classifier to 56.53% while having an evasion rate of 100% for the samples belonging to Kelihos_ver3, Simda, and Kelihos_ver1 families. In addition, the average number of instructions needed to mislabel malware in comparison to a random agent decreased by 33%.}

	abstract = {Assessment is an integral part of online education, much like traditional classroom education. During the online assessment, evaluation of the learning outcomes presents challenges mainly due to academic dishonesty among students that may lead to unfair evaluations. This systematic review examines the research on online assessment security involving studies completed between 2016 and 2021. The review investigates the literature, around four critical themes - reasons for student engagement in dishonest behavior, mechanisms used for dishonesty, integrity strategies to handle dishonesty and the role of machine learning in integrity strategies. The results indicate that readily available opportunities provided by environmental factors like Internet availability, shadow individual characteristics of the student; the students with high moral values also often succumb to dishonesty. We found that among the five types of dishonest behaviors identified in online students, researchers have shown more interest in studying collusion and plagiarism. It is interesting to note that technology, a pre-requisite for the conduct of online assessments, is exploited by the students for dishonest behaviors vis-a-vis technology also plays a key role in mitigation. The integrity strategies fall under two approaches- prevention and detection. We propose an Academic Dishonesty Mitigation Plan (ADMP) that encompasses strategies from both prevention and detection approaches for effective security and integrity of online assessments. ADMP also necessitates the involvement of major stakeholders - platform owners, institutions, teachers and students, to establish a secure online assessment system. We find an increasing use of machine learning techniques to automate the detection of dishonest behavior. The findings provide a holistic understanding of academic dishonesty that could help preserve integrity in current online assessments.}

	abstract = {In the face of increasing numbers of cyber-attacks, it is critical for organisations to understand the risk they are exposed to even after deploying security controls. This residual risk forms part of the ongoing operational environment, and must be understood and planned for if resilience is to be achieved. However, there is a lack of rigorous frameworks to help organisations reason about how their use of risk controls can change the nature of the potential losses they face, given an often changing threat landscape. To address this gap, we present a system that calculates Cyber Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of an organisation. CVaR is a probabilistic density function for losses from cyber-incidents, for any given threats of interest and risk control practice. It can take account of varying effectiveness of controls, the consequences for risk propagation through infrastructures, and the cyber-harms that result. We demonstrate the utility of the system in a real case study by calculating the CVaR of an organisation that experienced a significant cyber-incident. We show that the system is able to produce predictions representative of the actual financial loss. The presented system can be used by insurers offering cyber products to better inform the calculation of insurance premiums, and by organisations to reason about the effects of using particular risk control setups on reducing their exposure to cyber-risk.}

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) networks offer ultra-low latencies, higher reliability, scalability, data rates and capacities to support applications such as vehicular communications, internet of everything (IoE) and device to device (D2D) communication. In spite of these excellent features, user privacy, resource management and handover authentications present some challenges. To facilitate seamless connectivity in 5G and B5G networks, numerous machine learning schemes have been developed to facilitate target cell selection based on parameters such as signal strength and signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, most of these approaches concentrate on performance enhancements, ignoring security and privacy issues. On their part, majority of the conventional handover authentication schemes exhibit long latencies which contravenes 5G and B5G requirements. Moreover, the base stations in these networks have very small footprints and hence require the deployment of numerous base stations within the coverage area. This serves to compound performance, security and privacy issues due to the resulting frequent handovers. In this paper, a multilayer neural network (MLNN) privacy and security preservation protocol is presented. To facilitate target cell selection, parameters that took user satisfaction, network, user equipment (UE) and service requirements into consideration were deployed so as to enhance both quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) during and after handover. For handover security, timestamps, ephemerals and random nonces were deployed during handover authentication to offer both security and privacy. Formal security analysis using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) showed that the proposed protocol offered strong mutual authentication among the communicating entities. On the other hand, informal security analysis showed that the proposed protocol offers perfect forward key secrecy and is robust against attacks such as impersonation and packet replays. In addition, performance evaluation showed that it has the lowest communication costs and average computation overheads. Moreover, it exhibited a 27.1% increase in handover success rate, and a 24.1% reduction in ping pong rate.}

	abstract = {Java malware exploiting language vulnerabilities has become increasingly prevalent in the recent past. Since Java is a platform-independent language, these security threats open up the opportunity for multi-platform exploitation. Although security researchers continuously develop different approaches for protecting against Java malware programs, the presence of complicated Java malware properties, such as code obfuscation, makes these malware programs fly under the radar. These challenges present the need to develop new approaches that are resilient to such properties. This article presents Jadeite, a novel approach for detecting Java bytecode malware programs using static analysis and recent advancements in the image-based, deep-learning classification space. In particular, Jadeite extracts the Interprocedural Control Flow Graph (ICFG) from a given Java bytecode file and then prunes the ICFG and converts it into an adjacency matrix. Finally, Jadeite constructs a grayscale image from this matrix. We leverage an object detection algorithm in a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to determine maliciousness. Also, Jadeite extracts an additional set of features from the Java malware program to improve the accuracy of malware classification. These features are consolidated with the extracted images and used as inputs to the CNN classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that Jadeite achieves high accuracy (98.4%) compared to other Java malware detection approaches and is capable of detecting both known and previously-unseen real-world malicious Java programs.}

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies are emerging as virtual financial systems based on their innovative decentralized and distributed strategy in order to provide astonishing capabilities across a range of applications. In contrast to the conventional currencies that exacerbate security threats, these threats have been implicitly addressed by the notion of cryptocurrencies, which have a distinguished impact on their adoption rate among stakeholders. However, this potential adoption bubble may get diminished by the uncontrolled fragility in market conditions and persuasive increase in potential contemporary security concerns. In this survey, we systematically examine the state-of-the-art associated with security concerns in cryptocurrencies from various perspectives. Firstly, we investigate state-of-the-art consensus mechanisms, as they are one of the primary underlying concepts of cryptocurrencies. Thereafter, we thoroughly investigate various applications of cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, we present a detailed examination of various contributions from the literature addressing security aspects in cryptocurrencies. We also shed light on some of the well-known ongoing cryptocurrency-related projects across the globe. Furthermore, we outline open challenges and draw insights for perspective directions of research in the domain.}

Detecting and preventing botnets is very important in cybersecurity. Previous studies have suggested anomaly-based, signature-based, or HoneyNet-based botnet detection solutions. This paper presents new solutions for detecting and classifying families of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) botnets. Our solution can be applied in practice to disable botnets even if they have infected the computer. Our works help solve two problems, including binary classification and multiclass classification, specifically: (1) Determining whether a domain name is malicious or benign; (2) For malicious domains, identify their DGA botnet family. We proposed two deep learning models called LA_Bin07 and LA_Mul07 by combining the LSTM network and Attention layer. Our evaluation used the UMUDGA dataset recently published in 2020, with 50 DGA botnet families. The experimental results show that the LA_Bin07 and LA_Mul07 models solve the DGA botnets problem for binary and multiclass classification problems with very high accuracy.}

	abstract = {Today, cybersecurity training is commonplace in both large companies and Small & Medium Enterprise (SME). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of many of the current training offerings is put into question by reports of increasing successful cyber-attacks. While a number of models for developing Cybersecurity (CS) training frameworks for industrial personnel or general audience have been proposed, these models often lack consideration for humans aspects of learning (cognitive abilities, learning styles, meta-cognition among others) during development. Additionally, the success of a CS training program highly depends on its ability to engage participants. To develop a CS training framework that is able to motivate participants, we must consider individual-specific factors that can affect the result of training, besides establishing optimal training delivery methods and assessment. For this, in this work we propose a CS training framework based on a revised version of the ADDIE model and more recent research personalised learning theory. The Delphi method was used to both develop and validate our decisions during the development of the training framework model. The results of the decision of the Delphi method have later been compared to recommendations in the literature to create the finalised framework. This work presents two major distinctions from other CS training frameworks models described in the literature. First, the developed model is strongly based in learning theory foundations and takes into consideration differences in learning styles, cognitive abilities and metacognition of individuals, to offer tailored solutions optimized for each group of employees and single individual. Second, the use of the Delphi method and the involvement of experts stakeholders from various sides of academia and industry gave a wide insight into current needs and recommendations for CS training, as well as formal validation for the final development.}

	abstract = {Differential Privacy (DP) is well-known for its strong privacy guarantee. Briefly speaking, DP algorithms guarantee that the statistical information of the data is roughly preserved, and at the same time, individual privacy is protected with guarantees. However, when there are correlations among the attribute in the dataset, only relying on DP is not sufficient to defend against the attribute linkage attack, which is a well-known privacy attack aiming at deducing individuals’ private information. In the attribute linkage attack, the adversary can leverage prior knowledge about the victim, combined with accessing the published dataset, to infer sensitive information about a victim. In this paper, we study the attribute linkage attack in DP settings, and argue that enhancing DP can give users a higher level of privacy guarantees. Our contributions are ➀ we show that the attribute linkage attack can be initiated with high probability under the protection of DP, ➁ we propose a variant of DP called APL-Free\nϵ\n-DP to provide a higher level of privacy guarantees, ➂ we design an algorithm APLKiller which satisfies the APL-Free\nϵ\n-DP. Finally, experiments show that our algorithm not only eliminates the attribute linkage attack, and at the same time, it has a better ability to extract useful information from the data.}

	abstract = {The development of cloud computing techniques has promoted the continuous sharing of a tremendous amount of media data. However, the involved parties in such processes usually share different or even conflicting benefits, causing non-orthogonal security concerns. The data owners worry about their private data being abused through illegal access or unauthorized redistribution by the requesters, while the latter ones are vulnerable to being profiled (e.g., interests, age) through their data access histories. Since most existing approaches address these problems individually, the security requirements of different roles cannot be properly satisfied. In this paper, we attempt to provide a joint effort that flexibly addresses the above security concerns. We first design a new cryptographic primitive (i.e., TFPRE-OT) by exploiting type-based proxy re-encryption for fine-grained sharing and oblivious transfer for hiding the access histories of data requesters. Using TFPRE-OT as the building block, a novel data sharing scheme is proposed to achieve differential access control and protect privacy disclosure in general cloud computing settings. We provide a thorough security analysis, showing that the proposed method can fulfill all desired security requirements. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our design with both case studies and extensive experiments.}

In our study, focusing on machine / deep learning-based XSS attack detection approaches, we propose a fuzzing-based approach to realize “Black&White attack”, in order to effectively improve the confidence coefficient of malicious samples. We also present an adversarial attack model based on Soft Q-learning, designed to generate adversarial attack examples for different XSS attack detection models using multiple strategies. Experimental results reveal that the proposed adversarial attack model generates adversarial attack examples against various XSS attack detection models, with an escape rate of over 85%. In other words, our research has implications on existing XSS attack detection models, for example in terms of effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Deep learning models have shown their advantages in computer vision, e.g., image classification, whereas they are well-known to be susceptible to imperceptible perturbations of input images which are called adversarial attacks. Recently proposed data-free substitute training (DaST), an adversarial framework based on a multi-branch generator where each branch generated images of the corresponding class to balance synthetic images, trained surrogate models without the requirement of any real image for transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. However, this multi-branch framework was too redundant to converge quickly and was limited to datasets of a few categories. In this paper, we propose a simpler adversarial framework based on a single-branch generator to train substitute models fast and effectively, named FE-DaST. More specifically, we adopt a single-branch deep convolutional generator with an information entropy loss to stimulate the generation of balanced images, promote the similarity between substitute models and target models, and further enhance the strength of the transfer-based attack. Despite its simplicity, experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FE-DaST over DaST in terms of computational loads, similarities between surrogate models and target models, and attack success rates of transferable adversarial examples on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. For CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets where DaST is not available, our FE-DaST also achieves competitive attack success rates compared with pre-trained models which are trained with realistic training images. Furthermore, the attack performance of FE-DaST outperforms other state-of-the-art substitute training methods on the four datasets.}

	abstract = {As the smartphone and the services it provides are becoming targets of cybercrime, it is critical to secure smartphones. However, it is important security controls are designed to provide continuous and user-friendly security. Amongst the most important of these is user authentication, where users have experienced a significant rise in the need to authenticate to the device and individually to the numerous apps that it contains. Gait authentication has gained attention as a mean of non-intrusive or transparent authentication on mobile devices, capturing the information required to verify the authenticity of the user whilst the person is walking. Whilst prior research in this field has shown promise with good levels of recognition performance, the results are constrained by the gait datasets utilised being based upon highly controlled laboratory-based experiments which lack the variability of real-life environments. This paper introduces an advanced real-world smartphone-based gait recognition system that recognises the subject within real-world unconstrained environments. The proposed model is applied to the uncontrolled gait dataset, which consists of 44 users over a 7–10 day capture – where users were merely asked to go about their daily activities. No conditions, controls or expectations of particular activities were placed upon the participants. The experiment has modelled four types of motion normal walking, fast walking and down and upstairs for each of the users. The evaluation of the proposed model has achieved an equal error rate of 11.38%, 11.32%, 24.52%, 27.33% and 15.08% for the normal, fast, down and upstairs and all activities respectively. The results illustrate, within an appropriate framework, that gait recognition is a viable technique for real-world use.}

These platforms introduce new challenges in tracing the money flows and getting evidence of illicit behaviors. Yousaf, Kappos, and Meiklejohn (USENIX Security’19) are the first to link the cross-ledger money flows. However, their scheme is only applicable to one platform and requires real-time monitoring to obtain transaction lists. To extend the cross-ledger tracing techniques, we design CLTracer, a general and non-real-time framework based on address relationships. In our implementation, we discover more than 1.7 million cross-ledger transactions on ShapeShift. We further design a combined heuristic of cross-ledger clustering and obtain 24,925 cross-ledger clusters. Two methods are then proposed to analyze the false positives, and the biggest clusters are inspected to understand their behaviors. Finally, we study the deposit and withdrawal mechanisms of 19 other trading platforms and adapt our techniques to nine of them. Our work could provide insights to the supervising authority in collecting evidence of illicit cross-ledger trading behaviors.}

	abstract = {Wireless system in industrial scene plays an important role in the process of automation. This kind of system urgently needs low complexity, lightweight, high security authentication mechanism. The emergence of physical layer authentication meets these requirements. However, the existing authentication mechanism based on binary hypothesis testing can only perform ideally under fixed conditions, and cannot distinguish multiple users; The authentication mechanism based on deep neural network (DNN) algorithm has limitations in small sample learning and parameter setting. In order to further improve the accuracy of authentication in dynamic industrial scenarios, a new multiuser physical layer authentication scheme is proposed. The mechanism uses machine learning algorithm based on autonomous parameter optimization to replace the traditional decision making method based on user-defined threshold, and is suitable for small sample learning. This paper takes the channel matrix estimated by the mobile node as the authentication input, obtains different channel matrix dimensions through down sampling, and finds out the optimal channel matrix dimension through experiments, so as to reduce the running time and improve the authentication accuracy. A large number of simulations are carried out using the public dynamic industrial scene data set. Compared with the existing authentication schemes, the proposed authentication scheme further improves the accuracy of multiuser authentication in dynamic industrial scenarios.}

Additionally, when passwords are leaked, attackers have the opportunity to study - and possibly identify - the structure or pattern of the user password selection set. This way, attackers could predict the next password or reduce the search space considerably in their attacks. Therefore, this study proposes a novel behavior-based password policy to increase the present security level and avoid further exploitations if a breach occurs. This study uses statistical methods and visualization techniques to examine the password selection behaviors of over ten million UserID-password pairs collected from anonymously shared data breaches. The data set is anonymized while keeping the uniqueness of userID-password pairs and shared with other researchers along with extracted features. Results show that user password selection patterns can be generalized and used to increase the success rate of attacks.}

	abstract = {Access to the many benefits available from digital technology can often vary depending upon the capabilities and facilities of the individual who is attempting to engage with it. Many digital devices and services require us to be identified and so require some form of user authentication as part of the process. However, the authentication methods that are currently dominant can prove difficult to use and do not meet the needs of users with disabilities. As such, they can constitute an additional barrier that is not faced by other users. This paper presents an assessment of different forms of user authentication (including various forms of secret, token and biometric approaches) against a range of potential disability categories that may affect their suitability for related user communities. The study draws upon disability classification identified by the World Health Organization and analyzes how the usability and/or security of current authentication methods fail users with disabilities due to their non-inclusive design. The discussion is based upon a combination of literature review and examination of real-life examples, and identifies aspects of current implementations that can cause problems in different scenarios. The findings suggest that biometric approaches are likely to be more directly applicable without incurring additional overheads, although even here the potential usability impacts are more prominent for some forms of disability. It is further recognised that while some methods can be made more accessible via assistive technologies, the primary aim should be for authentication choices to be as inclusive as possible by default, rather than expecting or requiring that some user groups should face an additional challenge to accessibility.}

	abstract = {Understanding employees’ motivations and behaviors toward compliance with information security policies (ISPs) remains a theoretical and practical challenge. Although previous information security researchers have investigated different motivational factors related to ISP compliance, most have not recognized different forms of ISP compliance behaviors characterized by their levels of willingness and persistence, nor have they noted the importance of adopting an other-oriented lens to examine such behaviors. In this paper, we propose and test an integrated model that investigates how various motivational factors affect different ISP compliance behaviors. Specifically, the model anchors on the prosocial motivational perspective in addition to the instrumental and self-regulatory motivational perspectives and investigates two types of compliance behaviors (voluntary ISP compliance and instrumental ISP compliance). We tested our model using survey data collected from 407 employee respondents. Our results show that the three sets of motivational factors have different effects on the two types of ISP compliance behaviors. Prosocial motivation and self-regulatory motivation positively affect voluntary ISP compliance behavior. Deterrence as an instrumental control leads to instrumental ISP compliance behavior but undermines voluntary ISP compliance behavior. Our study highlights that, to foster employees’ voluntary ISP compliance, organizations need to take a more holistic approach by integrating the prosocial approach with the instrumental and self-regulatory approaches in managing voluntary compliance behaviors, while being mindful of the negative effects of instrumental controls (e.g., deterrence) on such behaviors.}

	abstract = {Software emulation is at the core of efficient automated software analysis. It allows efficient use of computing resources by running multiple instances on a single machine. Also, software emulation naturally provides a strong sandboxing that contains the analyzed target software. Software emulation techniques and principles have been implemented in dynamic binary translators (DBI) and emulators used extensively in practice. Transparency of emulation is one of the essential aspects of emulation engines. That is, hiding the presence of emulation from the software that is being emulated is vital in many use cases of software emulation (e.g., malware analysis). Detecting the presence of emulation through various methods and preventing such exploits have been an important topic in the field. Emulation detection is commonly used in protecting commercial software against reverse engineering or abused by malware developers who intend to sabotage their malware analysis. Many works have proposed methods for emulation detection, while others introduced mitigations. In this paper, we present EmuID that exploits a peculiar microarchitectural caveat of the ARM architecture to detect emulation. Our method is accurate, implementation-agnostic, and robust. Our evaluations show that our method detects ARM execution in well-known emulation engines on ARM (i.e., ARM-on-ARM) as well as cross-architecture ARM emulation on the x86 architecture (i.e., ARM-on-x86. Also, mitigation of our approach would require non-trivial modifications to emulation engines, unlike the heuristics-based detection methods that can be readily mitigated once the mechanisms are known.}

	abstract = {By using tomography-based topology inference method, attackers can infer the topology of a network without the collaboration of the internal nodes in that network, which can greatly improve the efficiency of their subsequent link flood attack (LFA) behaviors. In order to defend against adversarial tomography-based topology inference, we propose a network topology obfuscation mechanism named AntiTomo, which is a proactive deception based network anti-reconnaissance method. By providing the attackers with well-designed obfuscated path measurement metrics, AntiTomo can lead the attackers to form a fake network topology view, which hides the key elements (i.e., the key links and the key nodes) of the physical network. To generate an obfuscated network topology with high deceptive features efficiently, AntiTomo uses the multi-objective optimization model to construct the obfuscated topology with security and low-cost features. Our experimental analysis based on several typical real network topologies shows that AntiTomo can generate an effective obfuscated network topology with high deceptive, low cost, and high efficiency, which can defend against tomography-based network topology reconnaissance effectively.}

	abstract = {The task of source camera identification is devoted to linking an image to the source camera model and plays a significant role in forensics. Nevertheless, with the ongoing development of new camera models, it is difficult to keep a model database up to date, giving rise to the open-set problem. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel approach based on the envelope of data clustering optimization (EDCO). The new EDCO scheme can identify the camera model regardless of whether or not it is included in the database. The experimental results prove that EDCO efficiently separates unknown source images from known source images and links the query image identified as known with the source camera model. When the dataset is expanded with the new camera model, EDCO only needs to train the new model instead of retraining with all models together, which greatly improves the scalability. Compared with the state of the art, our method can effectively distinguish between images from known and unknown camera models, even in extreme cases.}

However, it is nontrivial to preserve user and/or data privacy when we are analyzing data from multiple sources, with different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a method to preserve privacy when dealing with data obtained from multiple/disparate sources. Taking images and corresponding text descriptions as examples, we set up different methods and protection scenarios to protect the private information in the data. Our proposed method is also designed to maintain the availability of existing information and links between the two forms to some extent. We then quantitatively analyze the performance of the proposed approach.}

	abstract = {Global malware campaigns and large-scale data breaches show how everyday life can be impacted when the defensive measures fail to protect computer systems from cyber threats. Understanding the threat landscape and the adversaries’ attack tactics to perform it represent key factors for enabling an efficient defense against threats over the time. Of particular importance is the acquisition of timely and accurate information from threats intelligence sources available on the web which can provide additional intelligence on emerging threats even before they can be observed as actual attacks. Currently, specific indicators of compromise (e.g. IP addresses, domains, hashsums of malicious files) are shared in a semi-automated and structured way via so-called threat feeds. Unfortunately, current systems have to deal with the trade-off between the timeliness of such an alert (i.e. warning at the first mention of a threat) and the need to wait for verification by other sources (i.e. warning after multiple sources have verified the threat). In addition, due to the increasing number of open sources, it is challenging to find the right balance between feasibility and costs in order to identify a relatively small subset of valuable sources. In this paper, a method to automate the assessment of cyber threat intelligence sources and predict a relevance score for each source is proposed. Specifically, a model based on meta-data and word embedding is defined and experimented by training regression models to predict the relevance score of sources on Twitter. The results evaluation show that the assigned score allows to reduce the waiting time for intelligence verification, on the basis of its relevance, thus improving the time advantage of early threat detection.}
