	abstract = {Penetration testing  (PT) is an active method to evaluate the security of  computer systems . With the continuous expansion of the scale of the network, the difficulty of penetration testing increases sharply, and at the same time, it relies heavily on expert experience. Therefore, AI-based techniques such as  Deep Reinforcement Learning  (DRL) will be an effective solution to automate penetration testing and reduce labor costs. However, in the existing DRL-based PT work, the attacker has a large number of low feedback behaviors, and it is difficult to collect enough successful experiences and positive learning rewards, that is, the sparse reward problem. In addition, existing works on automatic penetration based on  MSF  in real environments mainly focus on single-host scenarios and have not been extended to multi-host networks. In this paper, we propose a new intelligent  PT framework  “ HER-PT ” that integrates Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) techniques into DRL-based PT models in the hope of solving sparse reward problems in  reinforcement learning  and applying penetration testing to real multi-host scenarios. We constructed several network scenarios, trained  HER-PT  model agents in the  cyber attack  simulator Nasim for autonomous penetration testing experiments, and tried different  reinforcement learning  optimization schemes. Experimental results show that  HER-PT  can converge within 500 episodes in a medium scenario of 16 hosts, which is about 50% faster than other models. It can still maintain a success rate of 85.76% in the medium frequency dynamic change scene. The results show that  HER-PT  can effectively accelerate the training of the model and shorten the training period.}

Given the importance of the position, this study seeks to expand on the sparse literature on the role of the CISO and provide insights on current position requirements and responsibilities to guide and inform higher education cybersecurity  management programs  as well as aspiring cybersecurity leaders. To better understand this critical role, this study uses a combination of  natural language processing  methods and manual information extraction to provide an in-depth dive into the responsibilities and requirements of the role through a comprehensive analysis of 250 CISO job postings listed across 27 nations. The results of the analysis showed that nearly 99 % of positions required prior professional experience, with 10 years being the most common experience requirement. Employers highly valued bachelor's or master's degrees in STEM or business fields, vendor-neutral certifications like the Certified  Information Systems  Security Manager (CISSP) or Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), strong communication skills, and knowledge of regulatory frameworks and cybersecurity standards. In contrast, technical expertise in cybersecurity platforms, programming skills, and  security clearance  were less frequently required, as were travel commitments. Current CISO responsibilities and requirements also emphasize the strategic and business-facing nature of the role, with an emphasis on strategic & management-level tasks, rather than tactical, technical tasks. Higher  education programs  seeking to train the next generation of cybersecurity leaders, as well as information technology, cybersecurity, or management professionals aspiring to obtain a CISO position should note the role requirements currently in demand by industry, as well as the strategic and management-focused tasks commonly assigned to the role and prepare accordingly.}

	abstract = {Human-machine interaction is becoming smarter because of an emerging technology called the  Internet of Things .  Internet of Things devices  are made by different manufacturers, which may lead to a lack of security standards. The attackers use this lack, such as unpatched vulnerabilities, to form  botnets  by simply hacking the  Internet of Things  devices. Of the several  security breaches ,  distributed denial of service attacks  are quite tricky, dismember the network, and offer end consumers a variety of services. For instance, sapping bandwidth, depleting server resources, and ruining the end-user experience. As a result, in many Internet of Things use cases,  distributed denial of service  might create the possibility of catastrophe. This paper explores encountering the  distributed denial of service  attack mooting by malicious Internet of Things systems. To detect and prevent  distributed denial of service attacks , our security strategy modifies the software-defined network paradigm. To identify and counteract distributed denial of service attacks, we have suggested a unique semi-supervised deep-extreme learning machine-learning technique for detection with unique dataset features and a unique optimal link mitigation algorithm. These detection and mitigation methods are incorporated into the software-defined  network controller , which is located in the internet of things and application layers. Compared with other solutions results, our detection and  mitigation strategy  increases the throughput and bandwidth level and decreases the network load. We tested the semi-supervised deep  extreme learning machine  algorithm using an emulated topology and  testbed , and then we compared the outcomes to cutting-edge solutions. We improved the accuracy rate for distributed denial of service attack detection to 99.97 %.}

	abstract = {The network flow  watermarking technique  associates the two communicating parties by actively modifying certain characteristics of the flow generated by the sender so that it covertly carries some special marking information. Some third-party attackers communicating with the hidden server as a Tor client may attempt de-anonymization attacks to uncover the real identity of the hidden server by using this technique. This compromises the privacy of the anonymized  communication system . Therefore, we propose a watermark  defense scheme  based on  deep neural networks . Firstly, we design a training architecture based on  generative adversarial networks  and  adversarial attacks . This architecture can train a converter to convert the original Inter-Packet Delays (IPD) into newly generated “clean” IPDs by the model, causing the adversary’s detector to extract incorrect information and thus unable to perform traffic correlation. Using the trained converter model, we design a watermark  defense scheme  that can effectively resist time-based watermarking techniques.}

	abstract = {In recent years,  advanced persistent threats  (APTs) have frequently occurred with increasing severity on a global scale. Provenance graph-based APT detection systems have demonstrated significant effectiveness. However, current  data compression  methods face challenges in processing massive data volumes, including compression imbalance, limited generality, and semantic loss. To address these challenges, we propose PDCleaner, a multi-perspective collaborative  data compression  method designed to preserve the semantics of provenance graphs. This method comprises three core strategies: a global semantics-driven event deletion strategy, a behavior-preserving entity aggregation strategy, and a similarity-based event chain merging strategy. These strategies collaboratively compress data across three perspectives: events, entities, and event chains, resulting in concise and generalizable datasets suitable for model training and prediction. Experimental results indicate that the multi-perspective collaborative compression method achieves a compression rate of 14.43X while maintaining an average semantic loss of only 4.98%, significantly reducing data size and preserving provenance graph semantics. Furthermore, in a deep learning-based threat detection model, this method reduces training time by up to 20.22% and improves the F1 score by 0.051, offering an optimal data foundation for efficient and accurate threat detection.}

	abstract = {With the popularization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices,  IoT  security issues are becoming increasingly prominent. A significant number of devices remain highly vulnerable to  malware  attacks due to inadequate security management. As a solution, machine learning-based network traffic behavior analysis has proven to be effective and is widely deployed across various scenarios. However, the efficiency of  network feature extraction  and online detection is significantly constrained by the insufficient computing resources available on the  IoT  devices. To address the challenge, we propose HoleMal, a novel host-level framework to detect malicious network behavior in resource-constrained environment. HoleMal provides a comprehensive suite of host-level  traffic monitoring , processing, and detection solutions, aiming to achieve optimal network protection with minimal resource cost. During the detection process, HoleMal constructs host-level traffic features from the device’s perspective. It describes a device’s behavior in 3 dimensions, including connection behavior, network activity and accessed service, corresponding to a total of 36 host-level features. As these features are unrelated to payloads, they are not affected by traffic encryption. Furthermore, HoleMal provides a cost-sensitive feature selector which is able to quantify the feature computational cost and involve the cost into the feature selection process. It identifies the host-level feature subset with superior detection capability and minimal computational cost, thereby providing  theoretical basis  for detection model construction, further enhancing the efficiency advantages of HoleMal. We evaluate HolaMal by multiple datasets on Raspberry Pi. The experimental results demonstrate that HoleMal exhibits robust detection performance across all datasets, and it achieves significant efficiency improvements compared to fine-grained approaches.}

The dynamic nature of the mobile ecosystem, characterized by  data distribution  changes, poses significant challenges to the development of effective malware detection systems. Additionally, collecting up-to-date information for training  machine learning  models in a centralized fashion is costly, time-consuming, and privacy-invasive. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a novel  federated learning  system for collaborative  mobile malware  detection. M2FD leverages the  collective intelligence  of the user community to collect valuable contributions to the detection system while preserving user privacy. Additionally, M2FD incorporates robust  concept drift detection  mechanisms and model retraining strategies to ensure the adaptability of the system to changing data distributions. By effectively handling concept drift, M2FD guarantees a high ability to  detect malware , with 85% accuracy and 84% F1-score, even in presence of evolving attack strategies, thus avoiding the need for frequent model retraining, reducing the retraining frequency by up to 84%, so reducing the computational burden on clients. An extensive experimental evaluation performed on KronoDroid, an open-source real-world dataset, proves the effectiveness of M2FD in detecting concept drift, minimizing model updates, and achieving high accuracy in mobile malware detection.}

This study devises a novel method for building the graph of references among the Common Criteria certified products, determining the different contexts of references with a supervised machine-learning algorithm, and measuring how often the references constitute actual dependencies between the certified products. With the help of the resulting reference graph, this work identifies just a dozen of certified components that are relied on by at least 10% of the whole ecosystem – making them a prime target for  malicious actors . The impact of their compromise is assessed, and potentially problematic references to archived products are discussed. Processing of all public certificate artifacts additionally provides insights into the dynamics of the whole certification ecosystem in time, including the popularity of categories, average assurance levels, length of validity periods, the adoption rate of selected  cryptographic algorithms , and cross-referencing among national schemes.}

The system demonstrated superior robustness across various scenarios: maintaining high performance with reduced  training data  and imbalanced datasets, achieving a 99.57% F1-score with a reduced feature set despite evasion attempts, and operating effectively across  Android  versions 8.1 to 12 with minimal modifications.

Based on a  systematic literature review  covering 36 ISP non-/compliance articles using  Protection Motivation Theory  (PMT) and/or  Theory of Planned Behavior  (TPB), we found four major types of conceptual inconsistencies and unclarities within and across studies; (i) inconsistencies in variable definitions; (ii) inconsistencies between variable measurement items; (iii) inconsistencies between variable definitions and measurement items; and (iv) unclearly/vaguely worded measurement items. The review contributes to the field by demonstrating that the inconsistent results in the field may not only be due to unknown contextual moderators, but also to conceptual incongruences within and across studies.}

Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of IoT networks and the challenges in low-label data volume present significant difficulties for traditional  network security  technologies. This paper introduces HC-NIDS, a Historical Contextual Traffic Based Network Intrusion Detection System, which addresses these challenges by leveraging contextual information from historical traffic. In HC-NIDS, we propose a novel feature representation technique based on the structure of  Graph Neural Networks  (GNNs), called Signal Channel Correlation Fusion Representation. This technique is designed to extract compelling features from complex historical traffic in a dynamic manner. Subsequently, the incorporation of extracted historical and current traffic features facilitates the enhancement of the efficacy and resilience of HC-NIDS against evolving network threats. A series of comprehensive experiments on four public datasets have validated the effectiveness of HC-NIDS, demonstrating its superior performance even when utilizing disparate volumes of labeled data. Notably, in multi-classification tasks, the detection outcomes remain markedly enhanced even when employing a mere 2% of original labeled  training data , in comparison to the baselines. The study also investigates the impact of varying lengths of historical data and the functionality of different modules within HC-NIDS, confirming its adaptability and potential for practical application in securing IoT networks. The findings highlight the critical role of historical traffic information in enhancing the accuracy of  network intrusion detection , indicating a promising direction for future research in  network security .}

	abstract = {Memory corruption attacks continue to be a critical issue in system security, as defenders and adversaries constantly compete to develop new means to protect or exploit vulnerabilities. To safeguard against these  malicious attacks , researchers have developed various methods, such as  Address Space Layout Randomization  (ASLR) and Stack Canary, to  protect sensitive data  in the memory. One method in this category is stack isolation, which relocates sensitive objects in the stack to a dedicated “safe region” to enhance security. However, attackers have devised sophisticated methods, like Allocation Oracle, to locate these safe regions, thereby undermining the protection this technique can provide. In response to these threats, we propose Satellite, a novel method that securely defends against memory corruption and  information disclosure  attacks by effectively protecting the safe region. Satellite ensures that return addresses stored in the safe region are safeguarded from typical vulnerabilities like  buffer overflows . Moreover, our method counters  information disclosure  attacks, as it continuously modifies the memory layout at runtime, thus making it difficult for attackers to pinpoint the safe region. Satellite also works within the LLVM compiler framework and can, therefore, seamlessly support general C/C++ programs. To address potential compatibility issues, we develop supplementary libraries that enhance the flexibility of compiler instrumentation and evaluate the performance and effectiveness of Satellite with  benchmark programs  such as SPEC CPU2006 and SPEC CPU2017. We also test the impact of our proposed method on real-world applications, including the Nginx web server and the ProFTPD FTP server. Our results demonstrate that Satellite imposes a performance overhead of less than 1%, making it an efficient and effective solution for enhancing stack memory safety.}

	abstract = {Detecting  malicious domains  is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, with recent advancements leveraging  Artificial Intelligence  (AI) to enhance accuracy and speed. However, existing browser-based solutions often struggle to achieve both high accuracy and efficient throughput. In this paper, we present MADONNA, a novel browser-based malicious domain detector that exceeds the current state-of-the-art in both accuracy and throughput. MADONNA utilizes feature selection through correlation analysis and model optimization techniques, including pruning and quantization, to significantly enhance detection speed without compromising accuracy. Our approach employs a Shallow Neural Network (SNN) architecture, outperforming  Large Language Models  (LLMs) and state-of-the-art methods by improving accuracy by 6% (reaching 0.94) and F1-score by 4% (reaching 0.92). We further integrated MADONNA into a Google Chrome extension, demonstrating its practical application with a real-time domain detection accuracy of 94% and an average inference time of 0.87 s. These results highlight MADONNA’s effectiveness in balancing speed and accuracy, providing a scalable, real-world solution for malicious domain detection.}

	abstract = {The  Internet of Things  (IoT) devices are connected to the Internet and are prone to various IoT-based attacks.  IoT  attack problems cannot be adequately resolved by the existing methods. Additionally, a  Software Defined Networking  (SDN) based  intrusion detection  mechanism is proposed in this work because the existing  intrusion detection  mechanisms are difficult to use. This paper presents a hybrid  deep learning  method called Extended Hunger Games Search Optimization based on long short-term memory for intrusion detection. Initially, the input data is pre-processed with min-max normalization and  one hot encoding . After that, the most significant features are identified using the Extended Wrapper Approach (EWA). Next, Fuzzy logic calculates the probabilities of intrusions such as benign user, attacker, and mixed. The request has been classified using the Dense Bidirectional long short-term memory. In order to fine-tune the parameters of the  classification model , Extended Hunger Games search optimization (ExHgO) is utilized. The proposed technique's performance is compared to that of existing techniques in order to demonstrate its efficiency. The proposed technique has an accuracy of 99.5 % for the CIDDS-001 dataset, 98.76 % for the NSL-KDD dataset, 99 % for the KDD cup ’99 dataset, and 99.64 % for the UNSW NB15 dataset.}

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of  Android  devices has made them a prime target for  malware developers , necessitating sophisticated detection techniques. Obfuscation poses a significant challenge in  Android malware detection  due to the platform’s unique characteristics and widespread usage of  obfuscation techniques  by  malware developers . This work proposes a static  Android malware  detection approach that is resilient to obfuscation. The method involves extracting method-level opcode sequences and segmenting them into strings, representing methods as Multiset of Encoded Opcode Sequences (MOS). The next step is to encode the  Android Application  Package (APK) as a set of multisets based on the principle of multiset equality. This encoding provides detailed method representation and efficient APK comparison that optimizes the proposed approach, enhancing detection accuracy and efficiency. The proposed approach employs a strategy for generating a reduced feature subset through filtering and feature selection processes. It further improves efficiency, enhances model performance, prevents overfitting, simplifies interpretation, and optimizes  computational resources . The dataset used to evaluate MOSDroid’s performance included Data-MD, a collection of 15,356 Android apps sourced from AndroZoo, and Data-MOS, comprising 10,500 Android apps collected from AndroZoo and Drebin benchmarks. Additionally, 25,990 obfuscated samples derived from these datasets were analysed to assess the impact of obfuscation and resilience. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is potent and resilient to obfuscation in  malware detection , achieving an accuracy of 98.41%, and an AUC of 99.45%.}

	abstract = {With the widespread adoption of iris  authentication  technology and its use in different applications, the potential risks associated with iris template leakage have become a major concern. Hence, a secure template protection scheme becomes an important requirement for biometric systems. However, most of the current template protection schemes based on cancelable templates fail to meet the balance between security and performance. To address this challenge, we propose a method called cancelable iris template based on slicing (Iris-Slice). The scheme generates segments by segmenting the original iris data to a specific length, and subsequently compares these segments with their opposite sequences and retains the smaller segments. Next, the retained segments are randomly expanded, where the expanded sequences are half the inverse of the original iris data. Ultimately, the expanded sequences are saved in a collection for iris data protection. Experimental results on well-known iris datasets (CASIA-IrisV3-Interval, CASIA-IrisV4-Lamp, MMU-V1, IITD) show that the accuracy of the Iris-Slice method decreases only slightly by 0.63%. We also analyze the  irreversibility , revocability, and unlinkability of our proposed scheme, both theoretically and experimentally. The results show that our scheme satisfies all these requirements with high performance.}

	abstract = {The protection of Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs) from cybersecurity threats is essential to ensure the resilience and safety of critical infrastructures.  Anomaly detection  approaches for CPSs proposed in the literature use either network data or data from sensors/actuators as inputs, often failing to detect attacks that affect only specific components. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework for threat detection in CPSs. This framework integrates anomaly detection models that operate on both network and physical data, by leveraging a  decision fusion technique  to combine the outputs into a coherent decision. To assess the effectiveness of the framework, we employ an unlabeled release of a real-world dataset, integrating network traffic with sensors/actuators data. Additionally, we offer explicit labeling rules to ensure reproducibility. The results demonstrate that our approach substantially improves CPSs security, efficiently identifying subtle attacks that can evade traditional methods relying on a single data source. In particular, we show that integrating both physical and network data improves the F1 score by approximately 10% compared to using just network data, and by nearly 30% compared to using just physical data.}

	abstract = {Exploitation of vulnerabilities in digital products is among the key components of cyberattacks. Suppliers of digital products use different security-by-design practices, such as a product security  incident response team  (PSIRT), to respond to discovered vulnerabilities and minimise the cybersecurity risk. However, the efficiency of such practices, including PSIRT, remains underexplored. This paper evaluates the efficiency of PSIRT in reducing risks of exploitation of vulnerabilities 'in the wild' (i.e. their active use in real-world cyberattacks) using a customised model based on randomised matched case-control design with data from authoritative public sources. Results show that PSIRT reduces the likelihood of exploitation by 17 % (absolute risk reduction). Additionally, factors like the availability of proof of concept for vulnerability exploitation, type of supplier's industry, and the open-source nature of its products influence the risk altering the absolute risk reduction by 10 %, 3.6 % and 2.2 % respectively. The study confirms PSIRT as a good practice that cybersecurity practitioners – particularly large suppliers and suppliers to critical infrastructure – should consider in order to reduce risk of vulnerability exploitation in the wild. It recommends coupling PSIRT with other security-by-design practices to maximise risk reduction. The proposed model allows researchers and practitioners to assess the efficiency of similar practices in reducing the risk of vulnerability exploitation.}
