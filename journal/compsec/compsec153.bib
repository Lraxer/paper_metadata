	abstract = {The persistent threat of malicious domains in cybersecurity necessitates robust detection systems. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle to accurately assess domain name risks due to their static analysis methods and lack of consideration for temporal changes in domain attributes. To address these limitations, we developed DomainDynamics, a novel system that evaluates domain name risks by analyzing their lifecycle phases. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation and refinement of the DomainDynamics framework. The system creates temporal profiles for domains and assesses their attributes at various stages, enabling informed, time-sensitive risk assessments. Our initial evaluation, involving over 85,000 malicious domains, achieved an 82.58% detection rate with a low 0.41% false positive rate. We expanded our research to include benchmarking against commercial services, feature significance analysis using interpretable AI techniques, and detailed case studies. This investigation not only validates the effectiveness of DomainDynamics but also reveals temporal indicators of malicious intent. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of lifecycle-based analysis over static methodologies, providing valuable insights for practical cybersecurity applications.}

	abstract = {Deep learning models  are vulnerable to  adversarial attacks . Although various defense methods have been proposed, such as incorporating perturbations during training, removing them in  preprocessing steps  or using image-to-image mapping to counter these attacks, these methods often struggle to robustly defend against diverse  adversarial attacks  and may affect the model’s predictions on normal samples. To address this issue, we propose an  adversarial example  defense method based on image transformation. First, we designed an image transformation combiner that integrates multiple image transformations for defending against adversarial examples, thereby enhancing the robustness of the method. Second, we divide the image into patches and apply different combinations of image transformations to each patch to ensure the retention of useful information and increase the flexibility of the transformations. We combined 12 geometric or color transformations using the image transformation combiner and tested it on adversarial examples generated from the MNIST, CIFAR - 10, and ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other advanced detection methods in terms of accuracy and effectively mitigates the impact of adversarial perturbations on the model.}

	abstract = {Cyber threat actors are increasingly targeting networked assets and critical infrastructure, with the potential for major socioeconomic impacts.  Moving target defence  (MTD) is a  cyber defence  paradigm that creates constantly shifting attack surfaces (i.e., vulnerabilities). It intends to make it more difficult for  cyber adversaries  to exploit systems, thereby increasing costs and chances of detection. There is a lack of research into the efficiency of combined MTD techniques, especially regarding several types of security considerations like time, cost, and effort. This gap is particularly significant in the  Internet of Things  (IoT) context, where security problems arise from its  heterogeneous architecture . Moreover, MTD may result in the overutilization of network and system resources to enhance cybersecurity. We present a Vulnerability Defence method to address this issue using the three-layer Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (3-layer-THARM). This approach overcomes this difficulty by evaluating the safety of aggregated network states, considering security metrics in each state and the accessibility of network nodes and edges. Using this model, we can recognize probable attack scenarios in the context of  Internet of Things  (IoT) systems, conduct a thorough security analysis of the IoT system using well-defined security metrics, and assess the effectiveness of various defence tactics. This feature inherently introduces an additional level of security for the system. Furthermore, this model showcases the ability to identify potential attack pathways and effectively mitigate the consequences of such attacks. Our analysis reveals a noteworthy trend: combining MTD techniques from different categories, such as shuffle and diversity, generally produces more favorable outcomes, including a lower probability of attack success, lower attack risk and higher attack cost.}

	abstract = {Wireless body area networks  collect  electronic health records  (EHRs) in real-time through sensors and use mobile  IoT  devices for data transmission and processing, promoting  telemedicine  monitoring and personalized health management. With the large-scale deployment of mobile medical devices, attribute-based proxy re-encryption (ABPRE) has been widely adopted to achieve fine-grained access control over encrypted EHRs. However, existing  ABPRE schemes  face high communication delay when processing large amounts of edge data under traditional cloud sharing architecture. There are also security, flexibility, and efficiency challenges in multi-user collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we propose a secure and controllable cloud–edge collaborative data sharing (SCCE-DS) scheme, which ensures that data users can join dynamically by supporting fine-grained access control and flexible  ciphertext  sharing. Meanwhile, we introduce  edge computing  to accelerate user request responses and reduce the computing burden of cloud servers. To further improve efficiency, we design an online/offline mechanism and outsource some decryption operations to the cloud server, which significantly improved the encryption and decryption efficiency of online shared data. Formal security analysis proves that SCCE-DS has chosen  plaintext attack  security and can resist collusion attacks and  denial of service attacks . Performance evaluation demonstrates that SCCE-DS has significant advantages in encryption and decryption efficiency and communication delay compared with traditional schemes, indicating that it has strong practical application potential in mobile healthcare systems.}

	abstract = {JavaScript is a key component of websites and greatly enhances web page functionality. At the same time, it has become one of the most common attack vectors in malicious web pages. Early approaches to detecting  malicious scripts  relied heavily on manual feature engineering by security experts, with limited feature representation capabilities. With the advancements in  deep learning  technologies,  deep learning  networks have shown the ability to automatically learn strong feature representations from malicious JavaScript. Presently, mainstream detection methods usually extract the  Abstract Syntax Tree  (AST) from  JavaScript code , which captures the code’s semantic information. The information about AST nodes is then processed into a sequence using depth-first traversal and fed into  deep learning models . However, for large  JavaScript library  files and obfuscated  JavaScript code , the computational power and hardware constraints pose challenges in feeding complete information into the model. Only a part of the sequence is sampled for training and detection, significantly diminishing the model’s detection capability. To address this, this paper proposes an innovative method for malicious JavaScript detection based on sequence compression. The approach extracts input sequences comprised solely of AST node type information and employs a  compression algorithm  to reduce their length further. Technically, we first extract the information of the type field in each node in the AST in the order of depth-first traversal to generate the sequence, and then effectively compress the sequence using Byte Pair Encoding. Finally, the compressed sequence is fed into the deep learning model for detection. On publicly available datasets, when employing the same deep learning model for classification, our proposed method outperforms existing other approaches, achieving a precision of 98.96% and a recall of 96.37%.}

	abstract = {The rise of web application attacks, increasingly frequent and complex, presents a significant cybersecurity challenge. This rise is driven by the vast data available on the internet, attracting  cybercriminals . Among these attacks,  Structured Query Language  Injection (SQLI) remains particularly pervasive and dangerous, threatening the security and integrity of critical databases. This enduring threat has encouraged extensive research to develop strategies for detecting SQLI attacks with high accuracy and low latency. This paper introduces two advanced models for SQLI detection using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network as a  deep learning model  and other traditional  Machine Learning  classifiers. A key challenge addressed in this study is data imbalance—a common issue in cybersecurity datasets where malicious instances are vastly outnumbered by benign ones. This imbalance can bias  Machine Learning  models toward the  majority class . To counter this, the research employs a variety of  data preprocessing techniques  that significantly enhance model performance. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in performance metrics due to preprocessing. However, the standout finding is the superior performance of the proposed  deep learning model , specifically the  LSTM  neural network. Without relying on resampling techniques, the  LSTM  model demonstrates exceptional accuracy in detecting SQLI attacks, beating the enhanced Machine Learning model. It is worth noting that the proposed LSTM model performance is tested on three different datasets to ensure its robustness and ability to adapt with varying environments. It achieves a perfect 100 % precision, recall, and F1-score. Its accuracy consistently ranged from 99.7 % to 99.8 % across all three datasets, with a remarkably low  classification error  of 0.002 that was nearly zero. These results highlight the LSTM model's robustness and effectiveness in addressing SQLI detection challenges, making it a powerful tool for enhancing cybersecurity defenses.}

	abstract = {Feature selection in  network intrusion detection  is an important research hotspot in  network security . The performance of meta-heuristic algorithms, as one of the most effective methods for feature selection, will directly affect the solution to the problem. The RIME  optimization algorithm , a novel meta-heuristic algorithm proposed in 2023 based on the  physical phenomenon  of rime, is suitable for  intrusion detection  feature selection due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, the standard RIME algorithm suffers from low convergence accuracy and a tendency to converge early, which severely limits its problem-solving ability. For this reason, this paper proposes an improved feature  selection algorithm , the Multi-strategy RIME  optimization algorithm  (MRIME), which combines the chaotic local search strategy, an interaction mechanism, and an improved hard-rime puncture mechanism to enhance the performance of the standard RIME algorithm. The proposed MRIME algorithm has been validated through experiments on three publicly available  intrusion detection  datasets: UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, and CICIoV2024. The experimental results demonstrate that MRIME outperforms existing feature selection algorithms, excelling in accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and runtime. Furthermore, MRIME has proven its adaptability to high-dimensional, low-dimensional, and large-scale datasets through scalability experiments on nine UCI datasets. These findings highlight the potential of MRIME for feature selection in intrusion detection systems.}

So, in this paper, a digital, innovative, and sustainable business economy model is introduced with cyber security and risk indicators to evaluate the performances of digital economies when developing a novel fuzzy hybrid framework. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed fuzzy hybrid framework is not explored in the literature. The main contributions of this paper are presented as follows. First of all, the eight main criteria and forty-three sub-criteria are specified based on the experts’ notions and published reports. Then, a Fermatean fuzzy sets-based  analytical hierarchy process  (FFSAHP) is proposed to obtain weights of the main criteria and sub-criteria. Based on FFSAHP results, economics, risks, and innovation & digitization are the top three crucial criteria. Next, a fuzzy slacks-based  data envelopment analysis  (FSDEA) is introduced to measure the efficiencies of digital economies. Twenty-two out of thirty economies are efficient based on FSDEA results. Further, the FSDEA-embedded TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) technique is developed to rank the efficient digital economies. Denmark, Switzerland, and Luxembourg have the three highest scores from FSDEA-embedded TOPSIS results as efficient digital economies. Finally, comparison studies and managerial and theoretical recommendations are presented for policymakers, including  sustainable development goals  and cyber security risk management.}

Theorizing it as a type of deviant behavior, this study leverages  neutralization theory  to understand users’ uninformed consent decisions. Through a review of neutralization theory, we identified and contextualized four relevant neutralization techniques: denial of responsibility, denial of injury, claim of normality, and claim of necessity. We focused on how these neutralization techniques could individually and collectively lead to uninformed consent to privacy policies. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 985 Internet users. A multi-method approach combining  structural equation modelling  (CB-SEM) with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (Fs/QCA) confirmed the proposed individual and configurational effects, thereby answering how these neutralization techniques could individually and collectively influence uninformed consent decisions. These insights provide an important theoretical angle to understand why users accept privacy policies without reading the content. Practitioners can leverage these insights to design user-friendly privacy policies.}

This growing complexity requires sophisticated and automated  malware detection  tools because traditional methods cannot keep up with the sheer volume of threats and their evolution. Detection mechanisms that are resilient against evolved malware behaviors, which are typically described by  application programming interface  (API) functions, are essential for real-time  system protection . This paper presents APIARY, an innovative API-based Automatic Rule generator for the YARA tool, designed to enhance malware identification through customized signatures based on peculiar API-based patterns. It discovers distinctive APIs that distinguish malware from goodware, regardless of input data coming from dynamic and  static analyses  of Windows-like  executable files . The algorithm assigns relevance scores to each variable and discards less significant features to identify critical malware indicators. In addition, the generation process optimizes the identified malware model categories to increase the detection rate while minimizing the number of rules produced. The experimental results obtained on nine datasets sourced from the literature demonstrate the potential of APIARY to automatically produce highly effective YARA rules in a short time. Moreover, the rules generated outperform those obtained using alternative state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of detection performance. Lastly, unlike competitors, the proposed procedure does not rely on additional malware  analysis data , such as network connection attempts or  API parameters , achieving a more streamlined and efficient detection process.}

Current vehicle cyber-security efforts primarily concentrate on vulnerabilities within the  Controller Area Network  (CAN) of existing automobiles. However, the anticipated proliferation of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) capabilities in the near future brings forth a new set of cyber-security challenges. Traditional IoV security analysis methods often focus on either data or dynamic models to assess malicious vehicle behavior, lacking a comprehensive, multidimensional security evaluation approach. In this paper, a novel IoV security analysis framework is proposed, integrating vehicle dynamics models with driving behavior and communication traffic data. The framework employs set-membership  filtering algorithms  and  deep learning  techniques to comprehensively assess vehicle status and detect a wide range of security threats, including ARP spoofing, flooding attacks, and speeding, while ensuring adaptability to diverse threat scenarios. Security scores are dynamically generated based on varying threat levels using an enhanced Dempster-Shafer theory, enabling robust threat evaluation. Although the proposed framework is designed for future IoV implementations, its effectiveness is validated through  joint  simulations conducted in CARLA and OMNeT++, demonstrating its potential to enhance both current and next-generation vehicle networks. Additionally, the proposed framework is designed to be modular, enabling seamless integration with existing connected vehicle security systems and ensuring its relevance for both current and future IoV networks.}

To this end, the  SDN  P4-based Neighbour Discovery Protocol security protection technology is proposed for the protection of NS and NA message processes by taking advantage of the open and programmable nature of P4 technology that can flexibly customize the threat detection and protection mechanisms. This technology collects the IPv6 addresses and corresponding switching ports of IPv6 hosts joining the network, and discards the  spoofed packets  that do not belong to the corresponding ports according to the spoofed  packet filtering  algorithm. Experimental results show that this technology can properly collect information about hosts joining IPv6 networks and filter and discard NS/NA spoofed messages sent by spoofing tools such as THC-IPv6 and IPv6 Toolkit. Compared with security protection technologies such as Match-Prevention and NDPsec, this technology does not add additional neighbour discovery protocol parameter options or use hash cryptography, so it is less complex, consumes fewer resources, and is more feasible in deployment and application.}

	abstract = {Launching effective black-box  adversarial attack  against a  deep neural network  (DNN) without knowledge of the model's details is challenging. Previous studies involved performing numerous queries on the target model to generate  adversarial examples , which is unacceptable due to the high query volume. Additionally, many of these queries are unnecessary as the dataset may contain redundant or duplicate data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage black-box  adversarial attack  approach that combines side-channel attacks and a  data reduction  technique. In the first stage, we employ  Long Short Term Memory  (LSTM) to gather partial information about the target DNN through side-channel attacks, enabling us to obtain the class probability of the dataset. In the second stage, we utilize a new data  reduction algorithm  based on the class probability to enhance the efficiency of generating  adversarial examples . Our approach is capable of precisely identifying the target model and the  data reduction  performs better than other reduction methods. Furthermore, when utilizing the reduced datasets to train the shadow model, the adversarial examples generated on this shadow model demonstrate a higher transferability success rate than SOTA data reduction methods.}
